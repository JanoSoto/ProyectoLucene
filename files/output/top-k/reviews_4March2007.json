[{"date":"4 March 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I finally took the time to see writer\/director Brad Bird's first foray into feature length film with The Iron Giant. Hearing how great of a film it was and the success of his Pixar debut The Incredibles, I've been seeing the movie on my shelf for a while now, just waiting to finally be viewed. If you thought his last movie had heart, you need to see this one. While being based on a book, I'm not sure if it is the original source material or Bird's vision on screen, but the parallels to King Kong are unmistakable. This creature from another world instills fear into all but one person&#151;one person who can see beneath the harsh exterior into the wealth of feelings and compassion bottled up within. Sure the beauty in a story like King Kong is the sacrifice he makes in order to keep his love safe at the unfortunate price of being a monster in the eyes of everyone else, but here we have a kid's story where happy endings aren't just a commonality but a necessity. Bird handles the subject matter nicely at the end in order to give the audience the same emotional attachment to the creature despite the fact that the general population does end up seeing him for what he truly is. Ala Superman\/Spider-Man\/ etc, the monster mystic soon dissolves as they begin saving human lives.A big part of The Iron Giant's success is the gorgeous animation. This may be one of the last great 2D animated films before CGI took over the field. The cinematic touches are great, including a depth of field composed of blurred images to give the audience a focal point. You forgive that the blurring effect renders the object even flatter than the medium does originally because the effect works as it would in a live-action film. Also, the lighting effects are wonderful, especially the flashlight sequences. When our young protagonist looks out his window into the woods, and the light flare goes from bright blind spot to illuminating band of vision, it looks very realistic. The power of the light even dissipates as the flash goes farther out into the distance. As with The Incredibles, though, the true heart of the film is in the fully fleshed out characters. There is not an overabundance of cluttered supporting roles, but instead a few main roles, which are allowed to evolve and grow an attachment from the viewers. The emotion etched into the movement and facial ticks of the Giant are spectacular at getting language across, much as would have been done in a silent film. Eli Marienthal does a great job as young Hogarth Hughes, the only one who believes that his new friend is more than a weapon. Christopher McDonald adds some nice comic relief as our only villainous role, albeit not a bad guy in the common use of the term, and Jennifer Aniston allows Mrs. Hughes to be both motherly and understanding of her son's adventures. The vocal star ends up being Harry Connick Jr., who is fantastic as Hogarth's friend and confidant when it comes to the new discovery of the Giant. I think the best compliment that a film like this can have is the fact that the vocal talent was so good I didn't recognize any as the people they are in real life. No one tried to infuse their own shtick into the part, but instead played the roles to enhance the story being told.Along with all that, we are treated to subtle commentary on the state of the government, both with the duck and cover absurdity of atomic warfare and the references to gun control and war. These jabs are just that though, small moments that go along with the story, rather than take it over and hijack the film like what happened with Happy Feet this year. Weighty issues can be addressed in children films successfully, making the audience understand the problem yet not shoving it down their throats when the real issue at hand is the relationship between a child and his new otherworldly friend, giving him the confidence to stand up for himself and be a hero.So far Bird has really impressed me as an animation director. While the teaser for Pixar's new Ratatouille left me a bit indifferent, just the attachment of this autuer's name makes me that much more excited for the movie. Hopefully Bird can keep the track record intact and also, maybe prove that in order for these films to be successful, a good story is necessary. In an age where we get around ten animated films a year, there are many that are horrible cashcows to rip off unsuspecting parents into taking the children to a cartoon. Thankfully Brad Bird shows us that animated films can still hold up against live action ones for the pieces of art they should aspire to be.

I knew it would be trashy, cheap, unassuming, and interesting. But unfortunately, this film is none of these things. I went in expecting these things and i had them all shoved back into my face. I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as KALIFORNIA, but i was taken agog when i discovered what it really was.The film is basically just about a couple who hook u with a young outlaw and basically go on a trip to nowhere. While on this trip, they have some encounters with several people who they end up murdering. They don't show any kind of guilt by doing this. Just regret.This film was too easy. It's concluding statement is that the youth of today have made their world there own personal hell. This is established from the beginning and then the film decides to show as many different ways of showing this as it can. For me it didn't work, but in a strange way, it did. I liked the way the film doesn't take or give any sort of apologies for the weird images it shows. I liked the way the film showed us a continuing spiral around repetition. I usually hate it when a film does these sorts of things, but here it fit perfect. Rose Mcgowen does a fine job in her role of what appears to be a girl with terrets syndrome.The major problem is that the film just doesn't show enough of... well... everything. The scenes are half heartedly done, the characters are half heartedly developed, and the set design just seems to keep repeating more and more strange set tone and color, but not enough variety. Take, for instance, a surreal scene in which the teenagers accidentally hit a dog on the road and put it out of its misery. What makes this scene funny is the fact that they have already murdered several people throughout the course of the film, and yet when they hit the dog, they show more genuine emotion for hitting this animal than for murdering another human being. And yet the viewer will still get the feeling that they didn't show enough emotion for the dog either. There must be something wrong with a film when the only scene in the film where the viewer can feel anything relative to the characters in a regular human being is in a particular scene right at the very end which involves hedge trimmers and Nazis. Obviously, it is scenes like the one with the dog that drive the message of the film home.Now, the main problem with the film is how director Greg Araki(Mysterious Skin, Totally F*ckd Up) has to add a little zing to the carnage scenes. He adds style, which should definitely not be used in a film like this. There is a scene where a store owner's head is blown off with a shotgun, right off the stump. Now this scene is pretty straight forwardly done. Two people struggle with the gun, it goes off, someone is killed in the process. The thing is, once the the head lands in the guacamole, it screams and lurches, as if still alive. Now there's nothing wrong with having something like this in a film of this texture. The problem arises when it is talked about on local news programs that begin the discussion of how the head was sworn to be talking at the scene of the crime, and how a necklace was found at the scene of the crime along wit several other dead bodies. This is the kind of stuff that isn't necessary and certainly doesn't make the film any more interesting. It makes the film slow paced. And for a film that is less than 90 minutes, that is something that a director, especially one like Greg Araki, who has made some amazing films, should definitely avoid doing. Just look at films like KIDS or BULLY. They don't fall into the trap of being stylized for the sake of being stylized.Homosexuality also is a frequent concept that is brought up several times in the film. Now i have absolutely nothing against homosexuality in films. I don't even care if it's just a casual occurrence in a film.But in this film, the concept of the boyfriend being gay, or the drifter being gay is simply something that isn't explored to any real extent. In fact, the aspect of Rose Mcgowen or her boyfriend being a straight couple is barely explored either. For a film that has so much gay sex, straight sex, and three ways, there really should be more of an attempt for sexual exploration of the characters and less of a chore. I know that it is just a thing that these characters do, and i know that they don't care who loves who or what they want to do with each other, but they could have at least had an orgy and not just a series of weird encounters.Having said that, i do find the film interesting in its own trashy way. And i do kind of think the film is worth seeing, but the whole awkwardness of what the film attempts and repeatedly succeeds to prove is dumbed down by its finishing touches.(the film is not rated but is intended to be viewed by adults only. it contains overdone violence and gory images, a substantial use of strong language, lots of graphic sex and nudity, and a fair share of drug use.)

Why not marry the two things? That's what he did in some of his early short films, and that's what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.Jackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin's genius? Coogan doesn't steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like My Boy and Oliver Twist.Chaplin's storytelling&#x97;even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill&#x97;deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene&#x97;they're perfect. Chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.Want me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus? But you know, I can't even complain about that. It's too sweetly naïve. And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.One important note children love this movie.

Mysterious, personal, elliptical, beautiful, philosophical, disturbing, inspiring &#150; all at the same time. But there are two factors above all others that make this film truly a work of genius. Firstly, if Tarkovsky ever intended the audience to glean one specific interpretation of his film he never shows his cards, thereby inviting every individual viewer to undergo an experience vastly different than the person sitting next to them. Secondly, Stalker is one of those rare films that replays and resonates in your mind long after it has finished. You may be driving along months after you last saw it, and an image or idea from the film might suddenly pop into your mind. You may be running a bath one morning and for no obvious reason find your musing about one of the many mysteries generated in the film.In a small, unspecified country, there exists a Zone where the laws of science and logic cease to hold true. The Zone was formed following a meteorite strike (or possibly a celestial visitation). Now, the border of the Zone is continually patrolled by armed guards with instructions to prevent anyone from entering. And there are plenty of people who WOULD like to enter, for rumours abound that at the centre of the Zone lies a Room where innermost wishes can be granted. Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky) makes a living by smuggling people into the Zone and guiding them through its hazardous landscape to the Room. His wife (Alisa Frejndlikh) has grown to detest his frequent absences on such dangerous jobs, more so because while he is away she must tend to their daughter Monkey (Natasha Abramova), physically disabled yet in possession of telekinetic powers due to her father's exposure to the Zone. Stalker finds himself taking two new customers into the Zone &#150; Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who wishes to find fresh inspiration, and Professor (Nikolai Grinko), who claims to be fascinated by the scientific mysteries within the Zone, but is in fact on a secret mission to blow it up in order to prevent the potential for an evil person to have their darkest wishes granted at the Room.Tarkovsky presents the outer world as an impoverished, litter-strewn dump, shot in endlessly dull sepia colours, while the scenes based in the Zone are filmed in striking colour to emphasis the lush greenery. But he also makes the Zone seem permanently dangerous, with Kajdanovsky uttering cryptic warnings about its ever-changing pathways and wearing furtive, fearful expressions upon his face all the time they are there. By having his camera more often than not positioned at some distance from the characters, Tarkovsky makes the audience feel like spies and this in turn creates paranoid suspense, as if the three main characters are continually being watched by some unknown force. In the film's stunning climax, Stalker assumes messianic characteristics - he breaks down in tears and laments the fact that nobody he has taken to the Room has fulfilled their dreams. Nobody believes. Nobody! Who am I going to take there? Oh, God&#133; And what's most awful is that no-one needs it. No-one needs that room, and all my efforts are just in vain. Like Jesus, Stalker is trying to convince people that they MUST have faith&#133;. Tarkovsky's shattering conclusion is that he cannot win in the face of a cynical society, but the one redeeming fact is that his daughter's amazing powers may give her strength to succeed where her father has not. This is challenging, essential cinema.

A Short Circuit made in 2007 would be mind-numbingly PC with bullet-time effects and a CGI Johnny voiced by a hip-hop 'artist'. It's a grim time for this genre indeed. But back in 1986 I had nothing to complain about as most of the family movies from that decade are fondly remembered as classics.I loved this movie as a kid and it's been a long, long time since I watched it from start to finish. Plus the VHS I rented back then was in horrid pan and scan with half the picture chopped-off. Which is a real shame since John Badham shot it brilliantly-framed Panavision. So I've never really seen the FULL movie until now. How does it hold-up 21 years later? Well, I guess you could say Johnny Five is kinda dated but not so much as all the rest of the 'ground-breaking' technology at the Nova factory. Number Five is a robot made for Military Stealth purposes and armed with a laser beam. But designer Newton Crosby (Steve Guttenberg) and his partner Ben Jabituya (a non-Indian and very funny Fisher Stevens) originally designed him as a marital aid, apparently. They are unhappy with the way Nova has marketed the robot but after a demonstration to the Military, Five is struck by lightning and assumes consciousness. Needing input and desperate to learn more about his surroundings, he escapes the factory and journey's across Oregon, soaking up knowledge and the idiosyncrasies of modern human culture. As a reflection of today's 'zany' society, Five is full of spirit, personality and random pop-culture references.The Military are kinda annoyed at a potential lethal weapon (not the Mel Gibson kind) running loose about America, so it's their new mission to find him and destroy him. Five, who has been taken in by animal-lover (not in THAT way) Stephanie Speck (a gorgeous Ally Sheedy) does everything he can to stay out of harm's way. But they are persistent and won't let him live because they don't believe he is truly alive.It's not totally original since some of it feels inspired by the works of Issac Asamov and I doubt a film like this would have been green-lighted had E.T. not been so successful. But it is very enjoyable and funny and Johnny Five is a great character despite being nothing more than a puppet. Short Circuit is definitely a film for any kid born in the 80s.

Is that believable? Hardly. It's the kind of thing that a ten year old brother might do, not a parent, especially a parent who is gay-positive and hoping that his son will meet someone and have a serious affair.It's almost as embarrassing to watch the father meet a woman through a dating agency. The two of them act like they are 15 years old... and totally unnatural at that. When he decides to propose to her he actually gets down on one knee. If it were done tongue in cheek, maybe I could accept it, but it's done straight (pardon the pun).This film also has the bad habit of having the actors turn towards the camera and talk to the audience directly. Once or twice, maybe, but over and over again it totally breaks up the film and destroys any possibility of allowing the audience to get emotionally into what is happening. The worst moment in the film is when the father has had a stroke and is lying almost paralyzed in his bed. The son goes to get something, leaving the father alone, and all of a sudden he stops lying there like a vegetable, smiles, and starts chatting to the audience.

I thought it might be better to watch them chronologically rather than in the initial order as I had heard of all the hatred towards this episode so I thought I'd dislike it equally if I'd seen the original trilogy first; hence, I gave it the chance it deserved. On the whole, I'm glad I did.I found the opening half an hour or so rather confusing. I don't know if this was due to the fact this was my first ever taste of Star Wars or if it was just shoddy writing but I'll admit that it was lucky to have a bit of a Star Wars fan watching it with me otherwise I would have been completely lost. What I didn't like was the virtually vacant introduction to Jedi's and what they were (although it's assumed you've seen the other films before this one so I can't hold that against it too much) and the inaudibility of the character of Jar-Jar Binks. What also didn't help was the fact that whenever someone said something, there seemed to be an annoying little 'bleep' noise or an animal\/alien moan in the background, rendering what it was they were saying equally inaudible. I thought this was rather laughable so early on as what I found to be a complicated plot set up involving a trade dispute between two planets was made even harder to follow given the fact I couldn't hear what it was that was being said.When these things were ironed out after about twenty five minutes, the film got going and although rather ashamed saying it, I was impressed. I liked how each of the characters interacted with one another, I liked the whole 'double team of Jedi's travelling around helping out' scenario and although the subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and his space racer\/eventual fish out of water story was primitive; it was light hearted and enjoyable at the same time. The way the film flicked between the two situations going on and eventually culminating in a feel good finale where they all integrate was good; the trade situation was as compelling as the Anakin storyline and we're never forced to 'side' with the 'better' story as each is given enough screen time.The character of Darth Maul was another interesting thing I noticed during the film. Although he's one of those enemies that hardly ever speaks and is one of those bad guys that 'remains in the background, looming and threatening at all times' (similar to the Terminator in the first Terminator film); I couldn't quite feel the build up nor could I the menacing persona he was meant to carry. The cloaked bad guy who appeared via holograms was more of a menace and this is where the film lacked a little in the end because you knew he was never a threat and all good films\/stories like this one have a decent bad guy who is always there trying to thwart the hero(s); in Episode one, there wasn't stone wall evidence of one of these.Even if the way the editing jumps between each story toward the climax is a little predictable in the way it shows the tank battle, the palace surge and the light-saber duel at the same moments in their progression (initial fighting, bad guy(s) get the upper hand, twist of fate, hero(s) winning) it was satisfying and never took itself too seriously. This way of telling the finale, I believe, was Lucas' way of saying 'don't expect an epic; just a satisfying journey coming to an end'.

Tony Serra. James Woods plays the fictionalized version of Serra, under the name Eddie Dodd. Robert Downey, Jr. plays Roger Baron, a young idealistic lawyer that comes to clerk for the once famous Dodd- with dreams of defending civil liberties and making a difference. He arrives only to find the once rebellious and justice minded Dodd defending drug addicts and drug dealers. One evening a young Korean woman & lady come to his offices looking for help. Her son was sent to jail 8 years ago & is now accused of murder because of a prison fight that resulted in the death of a member of the Aryan army. Despite the fact it's not his area of expertise, Roger convinces Dodd to take the case. For Dodd, this case, this young man, Shu Kai Kim played very well by Yuji Okumoto, represents so much more than just another case. Dodd himself is looking to reclaim his own enthusiasm, freedom and hope. The District Attorney is played very reliably by Kurtwood Smith (poor guy- pre 70's show he always seemed to play a bad guy.)The main reason I like this movie are the actors. Yes, the story is somewhat predictable- but there are some turns that make you doubt who is innocent & who is guilty on first viewing. James Woods' performance in this movie is one of his most versatile and enjoyable. He transitions with ease from humorous sarcasm to an almost raw vulnerability. One of the best scenes is one in which he tells his client, I know you're innocent- even if you've forgotten. After 8 years in prison, Shu isn't the same man he was when he went in. Just as Dodd tells Roger at the beginning of the movie that 10 years is a lot of time- in other words, despite his shinning past as a defender of civil liberties- he has also changed. Cynicism is something that creeps stealthily into everyone as age and time increase. In the movie And Justice for All they delve into the difficulty of being a defense lawyer & having to defend people you may know full well did a heinous crime of some sort. This has to change a person and that is part of what this movie is about. All the other actors, including Margaret Colin as the PI Kitty Greer, are believable and supply good support for the main character of Dodd. This is basically Woods' show, and that's okay with me since I'm a big fan of his. He was also fabulous in Salvador but then I think he is fabulous. If you like Woods, you'll like this movie I think - if you like a good story, I think you'll like this movie.

Realism in his relationships with the rest of the characters protrudes greatly, especially in the most famous scene in the film, sitting in the car with his brother, delivering that passionate monologue to his brother, whose resistance to compassion is chiseled away. Actually, he meets his match with Lee J. Cobb, who delivers on an incredible level as the horrible union boss, creating a very raw villain that draws pure hate from the audience, additionally because of the context the story is in, as he bullies salt-of-the- earth working class people.Yes, On the Waterfront is a good film with strong lead performances, but by today's standards, as much as the masses of its generation look back upon it as one of the all-time greatest films of all time, the film is dated in the least fascinating sense. Eva Marie Saint's role is, like most of the female roles in most of the rest of the films of the 1950s, unfortunately subjugated as the love interest, objectified rather than fleshed out to make a very good film like this even more dramatic. Instead, it condescends the ability of its own sympathetic female character like the general remainder of mainstream films. In On the Waterfront, the two-dimensional drawing of the characters does not stop at women, however. It extends to the transparently token role of Karl Malden's priest, whose purpose is terribly obvious, and that is to communicate directly the film's profound moral message. He only arrives on screen to present us with monologues that rivet the sympathetic workers and frustrate the bad guys. Another role that is, at least by now, very cliché is the role of the dense, squinting sidekick to the union mob whose only line is a reply to someone asking for the posse's approval, and it is always, Definitely.These elements that I criticize are not necessarily flaws, because the film clearly works. It's powerful, but by today's standards, the film is unfortunately weakened. The standards I speak of are not even necessarily cinematic. They are social in general. The film needs no crutch; it simply bears all the standard weak points of formula films that are designed to work for the specific point in time, which in this case is the mid-1950s. Now, the kid massacring the pigeon coup in response to a character who talks to the police would not have as much of a sympathetic portrayal as it does in this film. It certainly does not arouse sympathy in me, as I am a devout animal lover.The director, Elia Kazan, fashions a tight movie that has its great flashes of realism in terms of chemistry between people and the conditions of environment, and reveals his squealer perspective, being one of the maniacs who participated in ratting out Hollywood writers and directors on the Black List, and propagandizes his standpoint on ratting out by glorifying and commending it here, showing those who don't approve to be naive and apart of an unfortunate, insulated community that simply doesn't know any better.

The plot is interesting and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is pretty much solid all the way, I was never bored. The effects hold up remarkably well, and are seldom anything less than completely convincing. The writing is quite good, with credible characters and events(considering the genre, obviously); it did, however, stand out how one character seems to disappear for the final act with no explanation. The acting is fine; it doesn't soar to Oscar-winning heights(nor does it drop to the point where it's embarrassing), but it worked well for the film. I thought that the event which the title refers to held a great point, and worked well as satire and social commentary. The music has the disadvantage of being produced at a time where music for sci-fi alien\/UFO stuff was what by any standard today is considered corny; this piece deserves a much more fitting score, but if you can overlook that(which I had little trouble doing), it's still a highly enjoyable movie. The film plays much more seriously than many sci-fi films(particularly of the period, and for dealing with UFOs), and works really well as such. The one thing that brings down the overall quality is the way the moral of the story is presented... I realize that movies did occasionally spoon-feed their points around this time(Scarface of '32 being a prime example thereof, although this film certainly isn't as bad as that), but it's difficult to listen to the point being presented, valid as it arguably may be, when it's being preached to us.

Well, it wasn't a baseball film, which was disappointing. No, it was just a sportswriter's account of being with Cobb in the ballplayer's later years while the two collaborated on a book. Even at that, this could have been a more appealing movie than they made it.Granted Cobb was anything but a nice guy, an extremely talented player but brutal in that he would do anything to beat you....and he was viscous, intimidating and had a lot of demons to fight.

Everyone who knows that one, immediately recognizes how much Crimson Tide borrows. Still it succeeds in adding a few new elements. So some of the criticism I have read is unfair. The movie is not realistic? Sure, but that is not what it is about. If an artist wants to make a point, (s)he often has to sacrifice realism. Read Homerus or Shakespeare for some examples. The point is of course the conflict between Hunter and Ramsey. That is an important one, even if it is impossible in the real world. I am not a fan of either Washington or Hackman. In Crimson Tide they do a decent job - not more - by making the conflict trustworthy, as long as the movie lasts. The Russians are stereotypical crooks? We hardly meet one in the movie. The world is saved not by heroism of the American Navy, but because the Russian government does her job. The possibility of a nationalist coup d'état was not that unlikely. Remember Boris Jeltsin locked up in the Russian White house? There were some generals involved. The final handshake is not credible? The whole point is, that the two main characters never really dislike each other. They are willing to cross some lines just to do what they think is right. It is not a good guy versus bad guy scheme. Both Hunter and Ramsey are right; in the movie it is impossible for both and for the spectator to decide. So far the strong points, which are enough for a 7\/10 for me. Being a chauvinist I must make clear, that a skillful European director would have made much more of the drama. The solution of the conflict is very predictable. And when things become hard, Tony Scott grabs what Hollywood directors know best violence and action. To summarize Crimson Tide is a decent, not brilliant but neither awful action thriller. There is certainly not as much shouting as for instance in The Rock, which can be compared in several ways. The characters of Crimson TIde are not uninteresting, like those of The Rock. Crimson Tide dares to leave the usual good-bad scheme. The message is simple, but still important enough the importance of correct procedures cannot be underestimated. See Crimson Tide that way and you will be able to forget its flaws.

Whether it REALLY was originally intended as a re-pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films. Instead of the usual sidekicks for Fred (such as Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton), Burns and Allen are used--probably since despite being known as a comedy team, they COULD sing and dance quite well. This actually shocked me, but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional Fred and Ginger numbers were done with either Fred and Gracie or these two along with George.

Not a huge surprise given that both stories involve Truman Capote's childhood (Harper Lee based the Dill Harris character on Capote). Both films also use small Alabama towns for their locations. Capote loosely based his 1951 The Grass Harp novella on the eccentric maiden cousins of his childhood. For the film Piper Laurie plays good Aunt Dolly and Sissy Spacek bad Aunt Verena (who is even less likable than Pollyanna's Aunt Polly). Spacek gets to do something out of character and nicely underplays this one. Laurie gets to have even more fun and turns in a joyful performance. She is a little too good to be true but Laurie manages to sell the character with a remarkable performance. In the 1950's Laurie was an extremely pretty (and hot) young starlet but it is obvious from this and her performance in Carrie (playing Spacek's mother) that there was a lot of substance in that pretty package. Edward Furlong (best know as John Conner in Terminator 2) avoids the Pollyanna trap and is pretty easy to take. The coming-of-age side of the story works quite well. The Grass Harp is a bit underrated, probably because the screenplay fails to capture the lyrical quality of Capote's storytelling, giving the viewer a surfeit of sentimentality compounded by a too sweet score. The title is a reference to the musical sound of blowing grass, a metaphor about intergenerational connections and the primary theme of the story. The film would have benefited from a little more restraint. This is not a fatal flaw but the film would have been more powerful with Mockingbird's toned down production design and less colorful characters; maybe even going so far as to release it in black and white. Those looking for action adventure and hot romance should look elsewhere. But there are a lot of Mockingbird fans out there who should really enjoy The Grass Harp. Then again, what do I know?

Those looking for action adventure and hot romance should look elsewhere. But there are a lot of Mockingbird fans out there who should really enjoy The Grass Harp. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

However in the interest of maintaining a well rounded view of cinematic achievement, I caught this today on Turner Classic Movies. Boy, was it dumb.The host on TCM stated that each of the Frankie and Annette beach party movies were shot completely in a few hours, and then took about forty minutes to edit. It didn't sound like he was kidding about that, and judging by Beach Blanket Bingo, that formula is probably pretty close. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the film makers were working without a script too, because the situations and dialog at times appear to be completely at random, with no help from editing. For example, there's a scene where Bonehead (Jody McCrae) begins to pine after Lorelei (Marta Kristen) as she swims away in the moonlight, but instead of allowing the situation to build with emotion, the scene abruptly cuts to one of the skydiving sequences in bright daylight.It also would have helped if Dee Dee (Annette Funicello) and Frankie (Frankie Avalon) managed to stay in character from scene to scene. With Frankie scanning every babe to pass into view throughout the film, one minute Dee Dee is jealous, and the next the pair are lovey dovey. It doesn't help that Frankie epitomizes male chauvinism with his 'boys are different' philosophy, as much as stating that Dee Dee should concentrate on staying in the kitchen instead of learning to sky dive.It would be hard to come up with the movie's low point, but the leading contenders have to include Rickels' monologue when he tells Annette he never did like her anyway, and Zipper's (Harvey Lembeck) song lyric 'We'll give them the finger now. For me personally, it would be South Dakota Slim's (Timothy Carey) trip to the 'booby shack', by that time I felt like Jack Nicholson after the lobotomy in 'Cuckoo's Nest'. For my money, Slim is in the running for the most pathetic movie character ever.But hey, at least Linda Evans has that Lesley Gore thing going for her in a couple of singing numbers, which I would have bet were dubbed but weren't. And I did like the description of Von Zipper's 'Rats' as Carbon Monoxide Commandos; that was about the most thought put into this flick. But come on, you know you saw that 'fish out of water' line coming from a mile away.I know I'm in the minority here based on some of the other posters for this film, but nostalgia only goes so far. When the final scene came down blessed by that 'Fin-ee', I could only scratch my head and repeat one of Frankie Avalon's lines from the picture - You know, I just don't know.Oh yeah, Buster Keaton is in the movie too, but I just don't believe it.

Brando's performance is ludicrous, and to be fair to Brando, it is his very worst performance ever. Mitch is too underplayed by Karl Malden. Stella, the play's weakest and least likable character, comes across better in the movie only because the other characters are such clowns, even considering the time period.

It is, in my humble opinion, his best film. It's the only time in his career, I believe, where he played a totally villainous character with no redeeming qualities (forget about The Iceman in that Batman film).Written and directed by James Cameron, the action and suspense are non-stop from start to finish. And the best part is that Arnold has minimal dialog, which I believe adds to the sinister nature of his character.The Terminator (Arnold) is sent back to the present (i.e. 1984) from 2029 to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who will give birth to a futuristic leader, John Connor. Also traveling back in time is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) who is sent by Connor to stop the terminator.We learn from Reese that the terminator is a cyborg, part machine, part human who is programmed only to seek out and kill Sarah Connor. He has no feeling and cannot be reasoned with. Two other women with the same name are murdered by the terminator before Sarah realizes the Reese is trying to help her. We also learn that neither Reese nor the terminator can return to the future.The police, led by Lt. Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) and Detective Hal Vukoviich (Lance Henriksen) try to give Sarah police protection. When the terminator tracks her down to the police station. Arnold utters his now famous line Ah'll be back! And back he is.The rest of the film has Reese and Sarah encountering and escaping from the terminator until....................................Arnold makes a terrifying villain. Its a wonder, he didn't seek out more such roles. Hamilton makes a fetching heroine. she was or was about to be marries to James Cameron around this time. Watch for Bill Paxton as the leader of the punks who confront Arnold at the beginning of the story.Followed by two sequels where Arnold reprises his role, but as a good terminator.
