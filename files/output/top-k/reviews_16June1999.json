Although there are some impressive feats of animated derring-do on display here, the overwhelming question that may run through the filmgoer's mind is, where have I seen this before? The answer to that question is, Everywhere! The story of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Ape Man has been filmed to death from silent film days to the Johnny Weismuller series in the '30s, to at least two television series, to Greystoke in the '80s to the cartoon parody George of the Jungle and the live action film version of George of the Jungle (also by Disney). If there's a fresh angle or new depth to be plumbed from this simple tale of a baby boy raised by gorillas who grows up to be a major swinger with animal magnetism (and meets up with a civilized babe called Jane), the folks at Disney didn't come up with it on this go-around. The major accomplishments of this animated version are the fluid animation techniques that provide moments of graceful, often thrilling action. This Tarzan is all animal instinct and feral grace, not only swinging from vines but leaping, somersaulting, even surfing down the serpentine jungle trees. Tarzan is nearly all-action sequences with relatively little dialogue (or time dedicated to character development). While kids should get a big kick out of it (especially boys), there's not much of an interesting plot or conflict to hold the attention of anyone over 15. This is a surprising gaffe since Disney seemed to have perfected the strong (if cookie-cutter) story-telling technique for animated films. The non-stop action seems to serve two specific purposes a) the film can play in foreign markets with very minimal dubbing, and b) it's a movie designed to sell video games.The film is in fact reminiscent of a silent movie - with the lean, pointy-chinned Tarzan bearing an uncanny resemblance to silent film star William S. Hart. The freshest character is Jane, voiced with playful, flustered spontaneity by Minnie Driver. This Jane is no knockout, but has an endearingly British overbite and receding chin. Her blend of spinsterly British reserve and amorous appreciation of the hunky ape man provides some of the film's brightest moments. Glenn Close is all honeyed warmth as the voice of Tarzan's deep-hearted gorilla foster mom (one of the most visually expressive characters in the film) and Brian Blessed and Nigel Hawthorne voice the poaching British meanie and his sympathetic flunkie, respectively.  The film's most ill-advised character is Tarzan's wisecracking gorilla friend, with Rosie O'Donnell providing a grating Brooklyn street-kid accent which is neither funny nor sensible in the jungles of Africa. This character is the Jar-Jar Binks of the film - trying way too hard and it just ain't funny. The role does however contribute a great deal to O'Donnell's increasing stature as America's most annoying celebrity. Another misfire is Disney's attempt to repeat the Elton John\/Lion King triumph by hiring The King of Bland, Phil Collins to write and sing the unmemorable songs. Not exactly famous for his driving jungle rhythms, Collins is no Elton John - and  Tarzan is no Lion King. But school's out and since the kids have gotta do something, Tarzan should provide an entertaining diversion for at least 90 minutes. The rest of the summer you're on your own.

But nope, he is some sort of blackballed ex-CIA spook for hire who teams up with some thugs and malcontents and other spook types who are recruited by some Irish babe to get this piece of luggage cleverly disguised as an ice-skates holder.  So they go after this case, but the folks who have it don't want to give it up.  Then some Russians or East Germans or someone from that old Cold War bozo brigade decide they want the case, also. Which means we got all sorts of opportunities for gun battles with small guns, big guns, machine guns, and one grenade launcher.  And since all these guys are into fast cars, we got just as many cars as guns.  But all this takes place in France, so we aren't talking about good old American violence, we are talking about good old French violence.  Then again, good old French violence would be folks getting their heads chopped off, so maybe we just got good old American violence in France.  And since everyone speaks American, some with an Irish accent, some with a French accent, some with a German accent, and some with a New York accent, I guess we can say American is the language of choice for violence.We got gun battles galore, and even with automatic weapons we still got guys who can't hit a dead-ass slow target 10 feet in front of them much less a moving target like a car, we got cars speeding through all the narrow streets of France meanwhile there ain't no other cars on these streets so maybe the French were on strike again, we got a piece of luggage everyone wants but we never find out what's in it and finally, we got Bobby De Niro talking like he just finished reading some sort of seventh grade story about Stupid Things to say so you can sound Stupid.One and a half 9mm stars.

But nope, he is some sort of blackballed ex-CIA spook for hire who teams up with some thugs and malcontents and other spook types who are recruited by some Irish babe to get this piece of luggage cleverly disguised as an ice-skates holder.  So they go after this case, but the folks who have it don't want to give it up.  Then some Russians or East Germans or someone from that old Cold War bozo brigade decide they want the case, also.

With the comedy genre coming back strong with the brilliant ANALYZE THIS, now the horror genre is back in it's most chilling form with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  It seemed like that the horror genre was going downhill with such recent horror films as I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, URBAN LEGEND, BRIDE OF CHUCKY, WISHMASTER, and the idiotic and trendy SCREAM movies.  The only recent films that were considered good horror films were EVENT HORIZON and JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.  Now,  just like 1978 with John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN the terror in films is brought back to a new figure.  And sad to say, years from now, everybody is going to be copying this film. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young student film-makers who go to the small town in Maryland formerly called Blair.  In this town they wish to uncover the mystery about the Blair Witch legend.  With interviews with the town locals, they tell stories that range from typical bedtime stories to urban legends.  Then the students wish to go out a seek this mysterous graveyard where some of these burials occur.  As they go out into the woods looking for this graveyard, they begin to get deeper and deeper into a horrible and scary world that they never knew that they would be getting into. This is what I call a SCARY movie.  It makes SCREAM and SCREAM 2 look like a Disney movie.  What makes it scary?  We can all relate to what these filmmakers are going through.  1.) Being lost  we all get lost, and when we get lost, we get paranoid, confused, and scared.  These people getting lost in the woods can only cause them to not concentrate as much as they should. 2.) The scary noises in the dark  when we go outside at night, and you hear scary noises that make you wonder what that was. This film has plenty of those, enough to have your heart racing. 3.) Being the outsiders  these people don't know their way around, they don't know the people or the forrest that well. With this, they are like fish out of water which can also cause confusion.  4.) The terror that lurks  these people know that there is terror that lurks in the dark with them, and from time to time there will be some very terrifying and scary surprises. This is a horror film with no music soundtrack!  There's no suspense music, no gory make-up, no silly looking person wearing a hockey mask.  This is the kind of terror that is among us.  The kind we think about when we are alone. This is without a doubt one of the best movies of 1999! This is going to be placed among Independent Film Hall of Fame along with PULP FICTION, CITIZEN RUTH, BOUND,  TRAINSPOTTING, and LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  This is a excellent movie, and like the last movie that did this (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) it makes you feel like that you are lost among these unfortunate souls.  Writer\/Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have a successful hit on their hands.  They will more than likely be writing and directing some more movies for big studios in the future.  And don't be surprised that the stars will be making television appearances just to alert the pubilc that this is a fictional movie.  Or is it?

Indeed, I found the love affair a tad repulsive, and the immorality of the characters does play some role in this.  The majority of my dissatisfaction, however, resides with my lack of interest in their lives if the characters have emotion, the audience is not brought to share in that emotion.  I felt quite numb watching this movie, and that is a terrible mistake for a tragic work... tragedy relies on emotion and sympathy, both of which are absent here. The main symbolic thread of the story, the Count's memory and his book, suffers from the same malaise if it were easier to care about his character, his memories would be very touching.  Unfortunately, the film does not do its job in executing this idea. In short, there are great possibilities in this film for an excellent overall work, but it seems that the story was neglected in favour of adding effort to the visual aesthetics.

Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein never scared me, but there is something about zombies that always sends me cringing in fear. Maybe it's the fact that they're everywhere...where ever you turn, there they are, ready to devour you, and after they eat you alive, you get up and become one of them. And maybe it's the fact that they're so slow...vampires you never see coming. Frankenstein (in the original book) was fast and cunning. But zombies are slow, and you watch them gather around you and there's nothing you can do about it. Or maybe it's the fact that they're still decaying, even though they're after you and they look at least a little alive.Regardless, zombies always make me shudder with fear. And this is the film that started it all. This was the film that showed zombies as what they are considered now flesh-eating and unable to be killed unless shot in the head. In the history of horror films, there were four famous and classic zombie movies this one, it's two sequels, Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead, and 1980's Zombie. However, of the other two, none of them were as influential as this one. Telling the story of seven diverse people trapped in a farmhouse as the dead gather around them outside, it soon presents what the viewer already knows they're worst enemies are each other! One is African American, and there's a racist man against him. One has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly transforming. One is a vegetable....having seen her brother attacked by a zombie and freaked out. Then there's the strong-willed mother and the two, star-crossed lovers. All in all, they're a motely group, and each of them stand for something different in this film, whether it be ignorance, innocence, heroism, or immense evil.This film was ahead of its time, both socially and gore-wise. It lauched the popularity of B-movies...never has a low-budget film so successful. A strange, cult-gathering has arisen from this film, but that's hardly surprising. It is a classic, and maybe the greatest horror film of all time. With its nasty zombie makeup, the who-will-survive plot, and an especially twisted ending, it is not to be missed. Without a doubt, it is one of George Romero's finest!There was a remake in 1990 with a little more ideas introduced and a stronger cast (though the cast here is still good), though it wasn't nearly as good, which is odd because of its large budget and gross-out effects. Low budget and cheap just sometimes works better for certain films...giving it an especially creepy atmosphere (just another thing this film proved that later films tried to mimic).

Telling the story of seven diverse people trapped in a farmhouse as the dead gather around them outside, it soon presents what the viewer already knows they're worst enemies are each other! One is African American, and there's a racist man against him. One has been bitten by a zombie and is slowly transforming. One is a vegetable....having seen her brother attacked by a zombie and freaked out. Then there's the strong-willed mother and the two, star-crossed lovers. All in all, they're a motely group, and each of them stand for something different in this film, whether it be ignorance, innocence, heroism, or immense evil.This film was ahead of its time, both socially and gore-wise. It lauched the popularity of B-movies...never has a low-budget film so successful. A strange, cult-gathering has arisen from this film, but that's hardly surprising. It is a classic, and maybe the greatest horror film of all time. With its nasty zombie makeup, the who-will-survive plot, and an especially twisted ending, it is not to be missed. Without a doubt, it is one of George Romero's finest!There was a remake in 1990 with a little more ideas introduced and a stronger cast (though the cast here is still good), though it wasn't nearly as good, which is odd because of its large budget and gross-out effects.

Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein never scared me, but there is something about zombies that always sends me cringing in fear. Maybe it's the fact that they're everywhere...where ever you turn, there they are, ready to devour you, and after they eat you alive, you get up and become one of them. And maybe it's the fact that they're so slow...vampires you never see coming. Frankenstein (in the original book) was fast and cunning. But zombies are slow, and you watch them gather around you and there's nothing you can do about it. Or maybe it's the fact that they're still decaying, even though they're after you and they look at least a little alive.Regardless, zombies always make me shudder with fear. And this is the film that started it all. This was the film that showed zombies as what they are considered now flesh-eating and unable to be killed unless shot in the head.

Jimmy Stewart does not belong in Washington, but the incredulous Jefferson Smith will not accept the limits put on freedom, hence Stewart's greatest performance. This is Capra's most idealistic work, a film he seemed to prepare for the upcoming test the United States would be put to in just two years in World War II.  Modern day viewers will no doubt see the dated elements in Capra's presentation of our country's mores.  I felt awe and a new sense of patriotism in the montage of images from D.C. that I wish I could still completely believe in.  Time has told us we can't.  Jeff Smith would be crushed in today's political climate, but it is a beautiful thing to see this David and Goliath fight take place in the form of a Senatorial filibuster.Capra's direction is so forward and compelling in showing the once bright-eyed Mr. Smith's realization of what he is up against.  Even in the 1930's, there were political machines led by mobsters or businessmen. Stewart is the best at showing emotion through his facial gestures.  His weepy breakdown in he and Capra's equally brilliant ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is similar to Mr. Smith's 23 hour filibuster.

The happenings we see in a film like MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON can only happen in Hollywood films, which is why the system and its classics have endured for so long.

Director Spike Lee's new film chronicles this event and the ways it touched a community through it's violence and intolerance.  It's Lee's most vibrant work yet, and it carefully explores each and every downfall Lee holds as a director. Working on his most detached film, Lee recreates the hot summer of 1977 flawlessly.  Watching the film you can smell the stench of the street, the hot cheese burning on a reheated pizza, the musty aroma of a gay porno shop, and most importantly, the delirium of the citizens as a killer walks among them. Lee's Crooklyn and Do The Right Thing were more intimately created worlds, but Sam is the most believable. We weave around the Brooklyn neighborhoods and watch the Guidos read the papers everyday, monitoring the moves of the killer.  They pose and threaten, try to go on as life intended, but everybody is frightened to death of Sam.  Their lives are drastically changed during this one summer. John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino star in one story about a young married couple who cannot seem to be sexually compatible.  It is during the hysteria of Berkowitz that the couple finds themselves experimenting in role playing and sex clubs. Lee's biggest failure is trying to make the two actors more than one-dimensional characters.  They don't give the best performances of their respective careers.  Academy Award winner Sorvino especially seems to be slumming in a seriously thin role that requires nothing from her.  Leguizamo is a good comedic actor, and the dramatic roles he takes have been equally as sharp, but the script by Michael Imperioli and Victor Colicchio lacks depth. They leave him hanging in a sea of F-words and impossible improv. You can only take so much of that before you cry uncle. Lee fares better in the other story of a young punker (Adrien Brody) who the neighborhood suspects is the killer.  Refreshingly working outside of rap and jazz, Lee is remarkably accurate with his depiction of the punk movement.  He scores major points with a montage set to a Who song that sold the movie to me.  It's the best 5 minutes of the film.  As Brody runs around in spikey hair and a counterfeit British accent, he's the most eye-catching of the picture.  I would say it's the most layered performance in the film.  Leading a double life as an ambitious musician during the day, and a nightlife of nude dancing and porno films, Brody is compelling to watch.  Lee doesn't give any of his actors a chance to shine - the neighborhood is really the star of the film - so when Brody makes an impression, that's something to say. The biggest failure of the film is it's length.  At 140 minutes, it's just way too long.  The story runs out of steam long before the slick end credits hit. The movie would be better served as a faster, sleeker vehicle.  Spike Lee cannot seem to cut a film perfectly.  The extra fat that he loves weigh each movie down impossibly. Summer Of Sam would be a perfect picture about 30 minutes shorter.This film is fun to watch.  It's interestingly shot, breathtakingly sexually explicit, and contains a Spike Lee cameo that steals the movie.  As risky and challenging summer entertainment, Sam faces a battle with Eyes Wide Shut for the title of the Most Refunds For A Summer Film award.  Spike seems to be back on track after the unsatisfactory He Got Game and I hope he decides to revisit a New York summer in the future.

Lee doesn't give any of his actors a chance to shine - the neighborhood is really the star of the film - so when Brody makes an impression, that's something to say. The biggest failure of the film is it's length.  At 140 minutes, it's just way too long.  The story runs out of steam long before the slick end credits hit. The movie would be better served as a faster, sleeker vehicle.  Spike Lee cannot seem to cut a film perfectly.  The extra fat that he loves weigh each movie down impossibly. Summer Of Sam would be a perfect picture about 30 minutes shorter.This film is fun to watch.  It's interestingly shot, breathtakingly sexually explicit, and contains a Spike Lee cameo that steals the movie.  As risky and challenging summer entertainment, Sam faces a battle with Eyes Wide Shut for the title of the Most Refunds For A Summer Film award.  Spike seems to be back on track after the unsatisfactory He Got Game and I hope he decides to revisit a New York summer in the future.  It seems to be his forte.----------- 7 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"16 June 1999","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Just as Saving Private Ryan is the war movie to end all war movies, Unforgiven is the western to end all westerns.  In the history of film, the western film genre has been one of the most violent.  Senseless violence to say it more truthfully.  Usually, there are bands renegades, a solo gunslinger, and a countless number of innocent fatalities.  Some would say a western is filmed for violence for violence sake.  The typical western usually represents the moral conflict of good vs. evil.  Pushing further, the brother-genre of the western is the epic war film, which in moral terms is validated by the soldiers fighting for a certain philosophy, i.e. freedom, tyranny, religion.  What has usually lacked in the western, is a script that goes beyond the anarchic confines of the great plains, where a man or family is tested to fight for survival.  That is until Unforgiven was filmed.  I can only praise this films intention on a philosophical level.  Clint Eastwood, who stared in and directed this film, has taken a moral standpoint against the type of films that brought him into fame. The beauty of this film and the reason it is potent is that there are no good guys or heroes present.  It's intent is to show, through realism, the absurdity of glorifying the life of a gunfighter in the wild west.  All the main characters are bad guys the hit men, the rapists, the law enforcement. As a viewer, it is only by habit that one would side with Clint Eastwood, for in the characters actions they are all morally bankrupt.  This film topples the pedestal that Clint Eastwood has stood on throughout his career. Conceptually, this film is a treatise on the consequences of pulling a trigger with the intent to kill for killings' sake.  Of course, in the situations that surrounds these men, it is either kill or be killed, backed by the idea of self-defense.  But this film has Clint in the role he has played so many times before, which is the roving hitman. Only this time we see the thoughts and reactions of a man who has killed more men on film than is imaginable.  This time we also see his friends, his children, we know his history. All these things, which are usually left out of the plot, when considered helps us to dramatically understand the motives and react to the consequences that face a premeditated killer.  What a  courageous statement filmed by Eastwood!This film was decorated by the Academy Awards for it's wonderful performances by Hackman, Freeman, Eastwood,..the cinematography, screenplay, sets, and of course direction.  This film has a vision.  In my eyes it is Clint Eastwood's reflection on the genre he took to the heights and solidified his career.  The western gunslinger seeks no forgiveness by giving death to another man because they all know that they have it coming,...kid.
