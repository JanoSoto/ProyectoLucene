Well, Murphy isn't really a con-man in this movie, but Steve Martin is and he does a very good job at it. In one review they compared it to Get Shorty, which in a way it is similar, but Bowfinger is a much more straight forward that Get Shorty.Bowfinger is a director that wants to make his big break. He works out of a decrepit house inspiring the title Bowfinger International Films. One night he finishes reading a script by his screenwriter, entitle Chubby Rain, and decides to make it, but all he needs is interest from elsewhere. So, after staging a meeting with some executive, he is told that is he gets this major star (played by Eddie Murphy) he will have himself a picture. So he attempts to get his interest, but unfortunately he is not interested. But instead of admitting defeat, he instead decides to make the film using him, but without him knowing.What makes the film truly hilarious is that Murphy not only doesn't realise that he has been cast in a film, but he is incredibly paranoid, so when strange people rock up, throw water in his face and accuse him of being an alien, he freaks out. Bowfinger does a really good job of inciting his paranoia and Murphy does a very good job at the role.A few other things that I might mention about this film, as it really is a farce directed at Hollywood. First we have Daisy (Heather Graham), who plays a naive country girl who comes to Hollywood to be an actor, and finds herself involved in Bowfinger's film. Daisy literally takes the typical Hollywood actress overboard with her sleeping with everybody in the film, yet retaining a professional edge, and using her charm to get what she wants. She thinks that she is using everybody, yet what she doesn't realise is that Bowfinger ends up using her as well. But then she is not stupid as she learns that Murphy really isn't in the film, but plays along with it anyway.Then there is Mindhead, which is a payout of scientology. It is a cult of the stars, a religion that literally controls the stars. Murphy is a member and they are constantly trying to work out his paranoia. Yet even with all their influence, they cannot stop Bowfinger from blackmailing Murphy into allowing them to use him in the film.What is interesting is the opening to the film. It goes over a trophy case, which is mostly empty. This is another mockery of some films which like to show off a full trophy case with a out of it owner. This is a empty case with a couple of things from his childhood, but in the end he is a nothing director want-to-be. And the Mexicans that he takes from the borders are also cool, especially since in the end they all have mobile phones.

Such is the case with Gentleman's Agreement. No, it was not a favorite of its renowned director's own work. No, the execs didn't want to green light the thing. But the very discomfort expressed by its makers is the very reason for the picture's importance. It's just the anxiety endured by this film's protagonist, which is one of the reasons why the film is so emotionally powerful We, the audience, undergo the very same shocking indignation that he does, and begin to see how the attitudes of those around us that we take for granted so much of the time are the carrying out of the poison.Gregory Peck brings his signature righteous ire and passion to the role of the film's hero, a journalist assigned to write an expose on anti-Semitism in the affluent communities of New York and Connecticut. The movie begins moving in a very minor direction. So far I've been digging in facts and data&#x85;I've sort of been ignoring feelings. Yadda, yadda, yadda. All of us white gentile Americans are familiar enough already with such armchair outlooks. But! Soon he's the recipient of great inspiration. What if he poses as a Jew? His name is convenient enough for the task Philip Green. Would you pass this fascinating first-hand sociological role-play up? Many variations have been made on this plot over the decades since Gentleman's Agreement. I'm sure you saw Soul Man, either with your high school friends in the '80s or on Comedy Central in the '90s. There was also the Texas native who posed as a black man to write his famous expose, which was parodied cunningly by Eddie Murphy on SNL. Actually, my creative writing teacher in the 6th grade told us about an incredible tan she had one summer that managed to prohibit her from admission into a swimming pool when she was a kid, leaving an indelible impact on her social and political sensibilities. It's a brilliant concept that Laura Hobson came up with. But very few offspring and variation on her premise bore the real-life outrage of this ultimately captivating story.Kazan found the romantic elements of the plot contrived. To me, Green's building rapport with Dorothy McGuire's Kathy goes hand-in-hand with his arc from complacence to active progressivism. She's his editor's divorced niece, who initially proposed the expose. Her uncle pampers her with a lavish apartment and wealth. Later, Green attempts to describe anti-Jewish intolerance to his bright young son, right after parading some male chauvinism. Green expresses to his ma his bafflement that the idea for the assignment came from a girl. Ma retorts, Next thing ya know, women will be thinking. The film remains a keepsake that bigotry has countless features, all of which are threatening but not all obvious. It doesn't take long for the symptoms of discrimination to shock Green. A doctor warns against seeing a Jewish consultant. Tommy is harassed at school when his supposed heritage becomes known. And Kathy wants Phil to abandon his charade when they attend a high-class get-together.This movie's handling of racism starts off braying, to ensure we all recognize the characteristics and implications of anti-Semitism. But as the movie clears from the preliminary stages, it surveys deeper, more insinuating manner of intolerance. Kathy supports Jewish equality, but she doesn't want Phil or his son to be mistaken for Jews. She understands life is harder for Jews and wants her loved ones to take the simpler road. Is that mindset prejudiced? When someone tells a vulgar Jew joke, she claims she quietly took offense, but made no bones. Does her silence embody an unstated tolerance of prejudice? In this Zanuck production, there's cost to narrow-mindedness, and Kathy represents many of us. She talks the talk, but does she walk the significantly more scarce ideal reasoning liberal walk? Her adoration for Green grows so speedily as to distend gullibility, but it's essential for events that occur later. It compares Green's viewpoint of prejudice with Kathy's. We find hers lacking. She's not bad, and he loves her, but when the situation arises for him to decide between her or his ethics, he's compelled to forfeit. This, sequentially, builds a crisis of ideals for Kathy.Seeing this film now, I find it everlastingly pertinent, if not for how other minorities are observed. Frequently, when someone denies accusation of homophobia, they'll say, Some of my best friends are gay. Here, someone with an incontrovertible anti-Semitic penchant asserts Some of my best friends are Jews. Everybody knows that spewing hate and using violence against a certain group is intolerance, yet what some don't see is that smaller, more understated acts can be destructive. Many hold preconceptions but are loath to be truthful about them, even to themselves. This is something this cinematic indictment compels us to face, and that's why it's as commanding now as when it secured the Best Picture Oscar only a few years after Hitler.

When he learns that she is wanted, he takes the job in Information Retrieval to save her.This is where the idea of the beast and the damsel come in. At one stage in the movie, the girl whom Sam is chasing, dresses up as the girl in his dreams. This is not something that Sam tells her, but what she does for him. The beast is in fact the bureaucracy that is suffocating the society, and Sam manages to defeat it, temporarily. The one thing about this movie is that it is about shattered dreams. It seems that he has succeeded but everything comes crashing in when the efficient Information Retrieval arrive in his room, arrest him and kill her.Nothing is as it really seems in this movie because we are looking through Sam's hopes and dreams, and we will see him succeed only to discover that they have been shattered. The hopes of the people are keep in tow by the illusion that Information Retrieval are competent and work for them. The guards are dressed as WWII Nazi soldiers, which reveals to us the truth behind it all. The city is dark and polluted, and even when they are in the country there are only bleak hills and sign boards displaying a possibility of a real life. The only time the country is seen is in a deep dream of Sam's, and this is a dream that he is not going escape from. Friends are not friends really, and this is encapsulated in one statement you know we are close, so until this thing blows over, stay away from me. Sam, who believes that the girl is a terrorist, brings the anger of the establishment onto him, only to learn that she was a simple truck driver, her only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is revealed when she sees Tuttle and asks, who is he?. Even Tuttle, whom Sam believes to be a terrorist, is simply a rogue engineer who hounds and frustrates two other engineers.Brazil is an incredible and intelligent movie. There is so much in it, that it cannot all simply be brought out in one viewing. There are lots of allusions between the different aspects of the movie, as well as subtle uses of the camera and strange scenes which give you a perception of one thing only to undermine it seconds later. This is a movie that has deep meanings and a lot of provocation. Is it the state of things to come?

Unfortunately I didn't get to see it until recently and I am quite happy that I did. I quite like Kirt Russell as and actor the movies that he appears in tend to be very entertaining. I am thinking mostly of Tango and Cash and Big Trouble in Little China. Well, he didn't disappoint me in this movie either.Kirt Russell plays a business man moving from Boston to San Diaego with his wife. They have bought a new Jeep Cherokee and are taking the scenic route through the desert. On the way they almost hit a black pickup and the guy is not too happy. After a few words at the petrol station, they leave and break down along the road. A semi-trailer pulls up and offers to give his wife a lift to the nearest town. Unfortunately she never arrives and Kirt manages to fix the car up himself. When he catches up with the Semi, the man says that he has not seen his wife and shows him an empty truck.What has happened is that they have kidnapped his wife and are demanding 90,000 dollars, which he does not have, to get her back. Later in the film you discover that these people do this regularly, and even though they are rednecks, they are actually quite deceitful. The truck driver pretends to be a very nice loving man with a family and Billy plays the roll of a slow boy. The other two in the scam are simply muscle and use brute force to get their way.It is the start of the movie that is the most chilling because his wife has disappeared and there is no idea as to what has happened to her. Most people say that she has left him but he refuses to believe this. His love for his wife means that he will go to any extent to find her. This isn't a marriage of convenience or lust, but one truly of love. He is willing to put himself in danger to get her back.Breakdown is an enjoyable movie. My prediction from the previews was right. It is suspenseful and exciting. It is an action movie with a lot of suspense and the end leaves you gasping for breath. Breakdown is a cool movie and is recommended by me.

The father Lester Bernham played by Kevin Spacey is very depressed about his live and is going through a mid-life crisis. His wife Carolyn played by Annette Bening is upset that her family is not perfect and she wants to project that they are. Lester's daughter Jane Played by Thora Birch is upset that her father is not involved in her life and he has not talked to her in a long time about anything. The theme of the movie is a distorted view of the grass being greener on the other side. They each want something different in their lives and want things to suddenly change. They think life should be more exciting and fulfilling. Throughout the movie they change their life styles dramatically to try to create excitement. The father quits the job he hates and does what he did in a time in his life when he was happy, which was working at a fast food burger joint. He starts smoking pot and working out to get girls like he use to when he was in high school. The mother starts having an affair with the person she thinks is living the perfect life she wants. She starts a new hobby of shooting guns as well. The daughter starts dating the new neighbor kid, Ricky Fits played by Wes Bently which is a bit weird and she believes he understands her world. They boy is also the fathers drug dealer, but it is kept secret from the rest of the family. The acting done by Kevin Spacey is very good. He shows lots of emotion from his character. You really feel the sadness in his life. The director takes long close up shots to show that emotion coming from Kevin. The lighting is very natural and some scenes go all weird with sound and distorted images, but that is just the effect they use to show the Kevin Spaceys character is fantasizing. This movie touches home probably with a lot of people because the theme is universal. While watching the movie I could not help but compare my life to Lester's. I did what he had done and quit my job to return to school and try to get a job doing something I like doing.

Blind Man Jon Voight is eccentric. And teenage Jenny(Danes, convincing as a proper little Lolita-wanna-be) falls in love with every new male face she sees with the same eagerness as her ill-tempered boyfriend Toby(Phoenix) is to beat up everyone she as much as talks to. The characters are memorable, quirky and distinct(even though there are so many of them, they all get a good amount of screen time, and we don't forget any of them). The majority of the acting is spot-on, and this makes solid use of the considerable talent featured. This is shot rather well. The editing will get on some people's nerves(it's very clearly a Stone film, and it's one of his greatest ones, as far as entertainment value goes), and it does arguably try a little hard, if it does succeed in building an atmosphere of unbearable heat, constant new obstacles, mistrust, violence and dirt(literal and figurative).

This manages to not frustrate the viewer, at least not to the point where we are unhappy with the movie... instead, we sympathize with the people(in spite of none of them being likable, without them being obnoxious to the point where you turn this off... they're interesting jerks, and that makes up for it) and their situation. The music by Ennio Morricone is excellent, and really fits the mood and tone. There is a lot of disturbing content and strong language, a little blood, nudity and sexuality in this.

He and his friend Spike Nolan (John Candy) have dreams of joining the big league, but the problem is that nobody is interested in them. Everything hits rock bottom when they are locked up in gaol for brawling and are not bailed out by their coach. But a strange guy pops up, bails them out and takes them to New York City where Monty is brought into an office alone where three lawyers sit. Here he learns that he has inherited a lot of money, but there is a catch. His great uncle doesn't want him to be taken for a ride, but rather he wants him to use the money wisely, so he says that he has thirty days to spend thirty million dollars. If he makes it then he gets three hundred million, but if he fails he gets nothing. At the end of the thirty days he is allowed no assets, he can only give 5% away to charity and can only loose 5% gambling. When hiring people he can only get his money's worth. Nor can he tell anybody about it. As such he has to get rid of all of the money while everybody else is trying to get him to save it.This movie is based on earlier movies and the critics did not like this one that much. I have not seen the earlier movies (though would like to) but I enjoyed this movie. Richard Pryor and John Candy are both good, clean actors and comedians and the jokes are seriously funny in this one. It is quite amusing watching his friends wonder why Monty gets upset when he earns money and is joyous when he looses money.The whole purpose of this is to force Monty to get so sick of spending money that he won't blow away the money that his great uncle has earned. The lawyers want the money because if Monty fails then they get the 300 million. They don't think Monty can do it though, but when it seems like he is succeeding, they get scared and try to defraud him out of $20,000 so that they still get the money. Thus it becomes a competition with very high stakes. Monty looses nothing if he fails, but if the lawyers fail then they can be up for fraud.The interesting thing about it also is how people all come to bludge off Monty for the money. People swarm around him wanting jobs and simply money, and others try to swindle him, but Monty doesn't care. The fortunate thing is that when he wins, everybody is going to think that he is broke and they are not going to bother him anymore, while Brewster sits on millions of dollars. His friend Spike and the security guard show their friendship by collecting money for him after, so we can see beyond the movie that Brewster will remember them for their generosity.The cleverest thing Brewster did was run for mayor and then withdrawal at the last minute. This was a very fortunate occurrence that there was a mayoral election on at that time, because it would have been very difficult to get rid of it otherwise. The clever thing though was buying a very expensive stamp and then mailing it. It was this action that worried the lawyers and made them act against him.The critics did not like this movie but I do. This is a clever movie and Pryor and Candy are decent actors. Candy plays a good friend who is always there for Brewster and we know that this friendship will last even though Brewster has become a millionaire.Favourite Quote Spike to Monty when they are in gaol I don't think this is a race thing because I'm in here too (its funny to me since having seen Hanging with the Homeboys a few days earlier).

It is quite amusing watching his friends wonder why Monty gets upset when he earns money and is joyous when he looses money.The whole purpose of this is to force Monty to get so sick of spending money that he won't blow away the money that his great uncle has earned. The lawyers want the money because if Monty fails then they get the 300 million. They don't think Monty can do it though, but when it seems like he is succeeding, they get scared and try to defraud him out of $20,000 so that they still get the money. Thus it becomes a competition with very high stakes. Monty looses nothing if he fails, but if the lawyers fail then they can be up for fraud.The interesting thing about it also is how people all come to bludge off Monty for the money. People swarm around him wanting jobs and simply money, and others try to swindle him, but Monty doesn't care. The fortunate thing is that when he wins, everybody is going to think that he is broke and they are not going to bother him anymore, while Brewster sits on millions of dollars. His friend Spike and the security guard show their friendship by collecting money for him after, so we can see beyond the movie that Brewster will remember them for their generosity.The cleverest thing Brewster did was run for mayor and then withdrawal at the last minute. This was a very fortunate occurrence that there was a mayoral election on at that time, because it would have been very difficult to get rid of it otherwise.

He and his friend Spike Nolan (John Candy) have dreams of joining the big league, but the problem is that nobody is interested in them. Everything hits rock bottom when they are locked up in gaol for brawling and are not bailed out by their coach. But a strange guy pops up, bails them out and takes them to New York City where Monty is brought into an office alone where three lawyers sit. Here he learns that he has inherited a lot of money, but there is a catch. His great uncle doesn't want him to be taken for a ride, but rather he wants him to use the money wisely, so he says that he has thirty days to spend thirty million dollars. If he makes it then he gets three hundred million, but if he fails he gets nothing. At the end of the thirty days he is allowed no assets, he can only give 5% away to charity and can only loose 5% gambling. When hiring people he can only get his money's worth. Nor can he tell anybody about it. As such he has to get rid of all of the money while everybody else is trying to get him to save it.This movie is based on earlier movies and the critics did not like this one that much.

In a way this is true because most of the movie it is one or two people gunning down hundreds of thugs that are trying to kill them. This movie is not a martial arts extravaganza, but rather it is just an awful lot of gunfighting in numerous locations.This does not mean that the movie does not have a plot. John Woo seems to know how to weave cool action sequences into a rather interesting plot. An assassin, Jeff, is ordered to kill some guy in a nightclub but he accidentally blinds a night club singer there. Later he his hired to kill a rich drug-lord and is paid a lot of money to do it, but when he does it the only thing he gets is a lot of people after him. A tough cop, Lee, who doesn't follow the rules, is intuitively able to follow Jeff and attempt to catch him, only to become embroiled in this plot to kill him.Woo is also able to weave other ideas into his movies as well. Some may not think so but I highly disagree. One of the major themes of the Killer is that we are responsible for our actions. Jeff, who accidentally blinds the singer, takes her burden upon his shoulders and seeks to pay for a cornea transplant. He also sees one of the gangsters kill a little girl, and risks his life to take her to hospital. He sees that her life is his responsibility as it was his presence that results in her being seriously injured.It is also interesting how Woo uses doves in this movie. He has a church scene where Jeff goes because it is peaceful, and it this church there is a lot of light and a lot of doves. Jeff says at the beginning of the movie, I just come here for the peace, and this is what the doves represent. Yet the church is not a place of sanctuary as the gangsters storm the building and a huge gunfight begins. The church's presence is not to represent some holy ground where the killer cannot be touched, but as a sign to point to Christ. The layout of the church is also important for the cross in the window stands in the centre while the statue of Mary sits to the side. Later in the movie this statue is destroyed, reflecting on the mortalness of Mary.Blindness also plays a role in this movie. At the end, two people are blinded and crawl past each other, hearing each other but not being able to see each other. There seems to be the idea of the blind leading the blind, for Jeff is spiritually blind while the singer is physically blind. The only way see can see is if there is light, and by the end of the movie this light is gone. The light of Christ is the only way to remove our spiritual blindness, and to take that away leaves us only with darkness. It is interesting to note who she responds to the light being turned off. It is something that she responds to as the only thing she can see is taken away.The blindness shows how we can be taken advantage off. The singer is mugged and almost raped and is helpless to stop it, and it is only the intervention of Jeff that she escapes. But Jeff is able to conceal his identity from her due to her blindness. She follows him but only to the point where she finds herself in the middle of a gun battle and is injured herself.

However, if you want to have 92 minutes of non-stop laughter, with hilarious line after hilarious line, you must stop what you are doing and watch Happy Gilmore. There are endless scenes and lines of the movie that will make you literally Laugh out Loud. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet-considering it came out in 1996, I don't know what you are waiting for. In Happy Gilmore, director Dennis Dugan takes the conventional sports movie and throws a completely different twist on it. Personally, I think that if Happy Gilmore could've wrote the movie he would've made himself the most successful hockey player instead of a great golfer. The comedy Happy Gilmore takes arguably one of the funniest and loudest actors in history, Adam Sandler, and throws him into the calm, peaceful and serene game of golf. Who knows what could possibly happen from this? From the moment the movie opens with a captivating seen about Happy's past, one would never realize where the movie ends up going. The spin the director puts on the movie makes Happy Gilmore become one of the greatest sports comedies of all time.The audience is able to see in one of the first few scenes of the movie what type of character Happy Gilmore is and where the entire movie is going to end up. Right away the witty humor of Happy Gilmore is shown during hockey tryouts when he has this life long dream of becoming a professional hockey player when he can barely skate. Players and coaches mock him, but one thing that emerges from this, is his determination and will to succeed. This is one of the greatest character traits that Happy has and this is shown later on in the film. The movie is almost ridiculous in which you take a guy whose dream is to play hockey and put him in a situation where he needs to learn to play golf in order to succeed. The funny and ironic part about the whole situation is that golf and hockey are almost opposites. Although you get a glimpse of a hockey arena in the first scene the remainder of the movie takes place primarily on the golf course. Approximately 90 percent of the movie is seen on the golf course, and it is here that the great personality of Happy Gilmore is portrayed. One could make the argument that Happy Gilmore is actually crazy. Happy has such anger, rage and aggression toward everything and everyone involved with the game of golf. His ridiculous abilities to drive the ball further than any player has done before, paired up with his ridiculous stance for driving and putting, leads other to laugh and mock him. Most people would be able to ignore these distractions, but not Happy, he would go scream, punch and kick anyone that rubbed him the wrong way. He would constantly scream at his clubs and the small white golf ball various things such as, Are you too good for your home? This is extremely atypical behavior to see from anyone on the golf course but this is what contributes to the eccentricity of the movie.Happy plays the role of an underdog but not a typical underdog like in the movie The Replacements or Remember the Titans. His role as an underdog is quite odd and eccentric and because of that so many people root for him to win. Happy Gilmore is a stand out character in the world of sports movies because of how different he is than other sports underdogs. Due to the fact that he is not your typical underdog, he has this great ability to emotionally bring the audience into the movie, to both sympathize with, and cheer on throughout the movie. In the sport of golf he would typically be a person golf fans hate, but because of the eccentricity of the movie, Happy is the perfect underdog candidate. The director juxtaposes Happy Gilmore with the antagonist of the movie Shooter McGavin who is the exact opposite of him.The movie would be nowhere near the same if it wasn't for Christopher McDonald playing the role of Shooter McGavin with sheer brilliance.

It can speak for itself with all the Academy Awards it won such as Best Director, and multiple nominations like Tom Hanks for Best Actor. This movie released in 1998 is ahead of its time. After watching it, I considered it to be an instant American classic. The movie starts off in modern day with a family walking with their elderly veteran of World War II in a Memorial Cemetery. They follow him to a grave labeled Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) where he breaks down and begins to cry. The story then flashes back to 1994 following Tom Hanks as he storms Normandy Beach on D-Day. If you want to see a movie that reals you in right away in the first 30 minutes, then Saving Private Ryan is that movie. The first half hour of this movie are the U.S troops storming Omaha Beach in Normandy, and I believe this is the best war action sequence of all time. It is shockingly intense as it portrays the horrific realism of war at its finest. It really makes your stomach weak when it gives Tom Hanks point of view where he sees men literally trying to survive the onslaught American Soldiers. After the first 30 minutes, the story then goes on to tell how Captain John H. Miller and seven other men must search for a paratrooper, James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of 4 who served in the U.S. Army. The opening Omaha Beach scene reveals the death of the other 3 brothers who were killed in action. The morale of all these men are at an all-time low after watching their fellow soldiers being slaughtered on Omaha beach. To make things even harder for them, they are now chosen to go on a dreadful mission that increases the chances of losing their lives. The possibility of finding Private James Francis Ryan is almost impossible or as Miller says, it's like finding a needle in a stack of needles. All of the men have seen combat before except one, Upham, who is just a translator. They all have an internal conflict of why they have to put their lives on the line to save someone they don't even know is even alive. The movie is based off a flashback of a World War II veteran. The movie has the ability to suck you and make you feel as if you are in the battle yourself because of its realism due to sound and special effects of machine guns, grenades, army tanks, and explosions. What makes the movie so intense that there is no music throughout the story. Music is usually used to set the tone of a scene or hint things to the viewer. Adding no music to the story gives the viewer a hellish and gloom feeling for the characters. The only music is nondiegetic and is played before and after the flashback of James Francis Ryan. It is a brutal movie, yet that is what makes it so satisfying. This movie would not be what it is if the lead role was not performed by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks has the credentials after winning multiple academies for Best Actor in Philadelphia and Forest Gump and was nominated for Best Actor in this movie. He plays the role of a humble captain leading seven men on a nearly impossible mission. He does an amazing job displaying fear with his actions such as shaky hands before battle, and then shows great poise during battle. He still keeps in mind that the only way back to his wife is to find Private Ryan. The supporting cast does their job to create an epic movie, but do not nearly do as well as job as Tom Hanks. Edward Burns' Reiben, who appears to be one of Miller's best men in the film who uses pessimistic humor to cover up his doubts of the mission at hand. Jeremy Davies who plays as Upham, creates a character who will make you scream at his cowardice, but also makes it extremely believable and sympathetic because of the gruesomeness of war he witnesses. The climax of the movie is when Matt Damon, Private Ryan, is found. He plays his role very well as you feel compassion for the soldier after he hears the loss of his close brothers. There was only one little problem with the movie the movie although it still does not make the outcome any different about how I feel. When the men discover that Private James Francis Ryan was still alive, Private Ryan refuses to go home because it's unfair to the others. My grandfather was in the Korean War which was not even close to being as bad as World War II, and he left with no hesitation. My good friend told me his grandfather laughed at that scene because he said no man wanted to be there. If you talk to any war veteran they would say they would leave in a heartbeat. Especially in Private Ryan's case, he is the only remaining child in his family which should be motivation enough. However, one could depict it as commitment to military service or patriotism. Usually when I watch an American war film, it is either an action film of heroism or of tragedy. This movie contains both and that is what makes it unique and compelling to watch. The plot of this film is amazing because of gripping realism. I still cannot describe the outstanding intensity of the battle scenes throughout the movie thanks to the Direction of Steven Spielberg.

","genre":null},{"date":"28 October 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Steven Spielberg has created another masterpiece along with his famous Schindler's List. It can speak for itself with all the Academy Awards it won such as Best Director, and multiple nominations like Tom Hanks for Best Actor. This movie released in 1998 is ahead of its time. After watching it, I considered it to be an instant American classic. The movie starts off in modern day with a family walking with their elderly veteran of World War II in a Memorial Cemetery. They follow him to a grave labeled Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) where he breaks down and begins to cry. The story then flashes back to 1994 following Tom Hanks as he storms Normandy Beach on D-Day. If you want to see a movie that reals you in right away in the first 30 minutes, then Saving Private Ryan is that movie. The first half hour of this movie are the U.S troops storming Omaha Beach in Normandy, and I believe this is the best war action sequence of all time. It is shockingly intense as it portrays the horrific realism of war at its finest. It really makes your stomach weak when it gives Tom Hanks point of view where he sees men literally trying to survive the onslaught American Soldiers. After the first 30 minutes, the story then goes on to tell how Captain John H. Miller and seven other men must search for a paratrooper, James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last surviving brother of 4 who served in the U.S. Army. The opening Omaha Beach scene reveals the death of the other 3 brothers who were killed in action. The morale of all these men are at an all-time low after watching their fellow soldiers being slaughtered on Omaha beach. To make things even harder for them, they are now chosen to go on a dreadful mission that increases the chances of losing their lives. The possibility of finding Private James Francis Ryan is almost impossible or as Miller says, it's like finding a needle in a stack of needles. All of the men have seen combat before except one, Upham, who is just a translator. They all have an internal conflict of why they have to put their lives on the line to save someone they don't even know is even alive. The movie is based off a flashback of a World War II veteran. The movie has the ability to suck you and make you feel as if you are in the battle yourself because of its realism due to sound and special effects of machine guns, grenades, army tanks, and explosions. What makes the movie so intense that there is no music throughout the story. Music is usually used to set the tone of a scene or hint things to the viewer. Adding no music to the story gives the viewer a hellish and gloom feeling for the characters. The only music is nondiegetic and is played before and after the flashback of James Francis Ryan. It is a brutal movie, yet that is what makes it so satisfying. This movie would not be what it is if the lead role was not performed by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks has the credentials after winning multiple academies for Best Actor in Philadelphia and Forest Gump and was nominated for Best Actor in this movie. He plays the role of a humble captain leading seven men on a nearly impossible mission. He does an amazing job displaying fear with his actions such as shaky hands before battle, and then shows great poise during battle. He still keeps in mind that the only way back to his wife is to find Private Ryan. The supporting cast does their job to create an epic movie, but do not nearly do as well as job as Tom Hanks. Edward Burns' Reiben, who appears to be one of Miller's best men in the film who uses pessimistic humor to cover up his doubts of the mission at hand. Jeremy Davies who plays as Upham, creates a character who will make you scream at his cowardice, but also makes it extremely believable and sympathetic because of the gruesomeness of war he witnesses. The climax of the movie is when Matt Damon, Private Ryan, is found. He plays his role very well as you feel compassion for the soldier after he hears the loss of his close brothers. There was only one little problem with the movie the movie although it still does not make the outcome any different about how I feel. When the men discover that Private James Francis Ryan was still alive, Private Ryan refuses to go home because it's unfair to the others. My grandfather was in the Korean War which was not even close to being as bad as World War II, and he left with no hesitation. My good friend told me his grandfather laughed at that scene because he said no man wanted to be there. If you talk to any war veteran they would say they would leave in a heartbeat. Especially in Private Ryan's case, he is the only remaining child in his family which should be motivation enough. However, one could depict it as commitment to military service or patriotism. Usually when I watch an American war film, it is either an action film of heroism or of tragedy. This movie contains both and that is what makes it unique and compelling to watch.

His summer takes a rather interesting turn when, after his welcome-home party, Mrs. Robinson, a middle- aged family friend of the Braddock's, requests that Benjamin drive her home. Once there, she lures him inside and begins to seduce him; this seduction is made rather apparent not only by the use of diegetic mood music, but more so by the unforgettable under-the-leg shot. Before he knows it, he's trapped in a room with a naked Mrs. Robinson, offering her body to him, for use now and in the future. Shocked and confused, Benjamin manages to escape. Benjamin ends up taking Mrs. Robinson up on her offer and they maintain a steady affair for a few months, until he, against Mrs. Robinson's strict requests, takes her daughter, Elaine, out and falls in love with her. Benjamin then finds himself in a very undesirable position where he struggles to please just about everyone.Upon his arrival at the hotel for his first affair with Mrs. Robinson, the receptionist innocently asks Benjamin, Are you here for an affair, sir? Feeling nervous and guilty, he is utterly speechless. The Singleman party, sir? And with a sigh of relief from Benjamin, Ah, yes, the Singleman party. Obviously the chances that a desk clerk would use the word affair instead of something like event, or that the name of the party host would be Singleman are slim; this emphasizes the magnitude of Benjamin's conscience and his discomfort in the situation. Dustin Hoffman does a wonderful job portraying Benjamin Braddock as a naïve, awkward twenty-year- old who's having troubles finding himself. His facial expressions alone have the ability to make us squirm in our seats as we watch him interact with the other characters in uncomfortable situations. Benjamin seems to be having a bit of an identity crisis, but usually just when it comes to his naughty side. We are able to see that he clearly feels some outside pressure to act a certain way, but doesn't feel comfortable in his own skin, so he has trouble mustering up the will power to overcome this pressure by himself.Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft, also plays a convincing role as the selfish, sex- deprived, middle-aged woman with whom Benjamin has the affair. She inevitably plays a large part in his new lifestyle and once we get a taste of who she is, in light of Benjamin's character, it is not hard to see how she manipulated him so easily; she managed to strip any innocence that Benjamin had left in him. She firmly holds the reigns of their relationship and is able to get him to do almost anything, upon an insistent request. Mrs. Robinson appears to have regrets about her past and as a result, attempts to drag anyone she can manage into her bitter world so she doesn't have to suffer alone. She succeeds with Benjamin for a while, but as soon as he comes free, she tries to her daughter in the last lines of the movie, saying, Elaine, it's too late! but Elaine stands her ground Not for me! Both Benjamin and Elaine move on with their lives, leaving Mrs. Robinson in the dust. Through this, the film does a wonderful job of representing the incompatibility between young and old because of the newly increased generation gap.Just like the scuba diver figurine in the fish tank in his room, Benjamin seems to be caught inside a glass display for everyone&#x96;especially adults&#x96;to see and he struggles to escape it. This image is recurrent throughout the film, first with the fish tank and later as we find him twice in a telephone booth as he talks to Mrs. Robinson. Another scene that represents his unwanted position in the spotlight is when his father has bought him a scuba suit for his birthday and insists that Benjamin model it for the crowd of eager adults. This scene provides a memorable&#x96; inside-the-goggles&#x96;point of view shot, where the audience can hear only his breathing. This gives us a good feel for the suffocation Benjamin feels under the relentless control of his parents as he reluctantly walks toward the pool to test his new gear. Once again, he is on the inside of the glass for all to see. He hesitantly enters the pool, using the stairs to gradually make his way under water. At first we can see his resistance to getting in the pool, but as time progresses, he spends more and more time in the pool, never apprehensive to simply dive in and enjoy it. This scene is the first of many involving the pool, which seems to represent Benjamin's transition to independence, especially when it comes to his affair and how he changes as a result of it. In the same way, during his affair, he starts out very timid and nervous, but as time passes, it becomes a normal part of his life.The Graduate is definitely a well-acclaimed movie, having received many acting and film nominations. It portrays the generation gap in an unforgettable way through the relationships Benjamin has with a mother and her daughter. As we witness Benjamin's journey, it is easy to feel as though he's going in the right direction, but after an ambiguous ending, we are forced to decide if this new, revolutionary way of life is a productive one. Because this film is over four decades old, it is no surprise that it often gets overlooked by the average movie viewer in search of a good Friday night movie, but I would challenge you to consider giving yourself a chance to join Benjamin on his journey to independence in this ageless story that, at it's peak in 1967, had so many people enthralled.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"28 October 2011","score":"","review":" This is one of those anticipated movies and to be honest it did not disappoint. A movie based on the original modern fantasy story was going to come out as a film sooner or later, the question was always going to be, would it be any good. An attempt at making The Lord of the Rings was made back in the 70's and it flopped, so it is no surprise that these films were a long time coming. Now, as we all know there are three films, based upon the three books, but the same plot and the themes run through each of them. Secondly, it is not so much the films that inspire me here but the underlying books. There are some out there that will regularly reread the Lord of the Rings, however I am not one of them. Most of what I say will apply to the books, but Jackson was reasonably faithful to the books (and I do say reasonably as there were a number of things he did cut out) but it is not possible to look at these films in isolation from the books.The plot pretty much runs through all three books. The hero, a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, inherits a ring which turns out to be a powerful artifact that the dark lord Sauron wants back. However, very bad things will happen if it falls into the hands of Sauron, and it is decided that the ring must be destroyed, but the only way to do it is to throw it into the 'Cracks of Doom', a volcano where the ring was originally forged.Now, I will spend some time talking about the nature of the ring, and also look at the history of the middle earth as it comes up to the Lord of the Rings. Now, Lord of the Rings is unique in that the main antagonist is not so much Sauron, but the ring. The ring represents power, and whoever possesses the ring wields great power. However the ring has a very corruptive influence over all of its owners, and one cannot possess the ring without become made, or even coming under the influence of Sauron. This is what makes the ring such an awesome antagonist in that it cannot be used for good, no matter how noble the intentions of the owner are. It will always corrupt you.When Tolkien originally drafted the books he did not do so in isolation. Many fantasy novels (and films) are simply created out of a vacuum. Nothing really existed before and nothing exists after. All we see is what occurs in the action of the story. Granted there might be a rough history that leads up to the events of the story, but nothing all that deep. This is not the case with the Lord of the Rings. When Tolkein drafted his story he did it against a very deep and rich background. His Middle Earth is not a trilogy about a hobbit and a ring, but a living and vibrant world with a deep and colourful history.Granted, not everything in the history of Middle Earth is important to the plot, but it adds character and colour to the story. The actual story begins at the end of the second age when the king of men, Isildur, goes to war against the forces of Sauron, and while Sauron is defeated, Isildur does not have the last laugh. He removes the ring from Sauron's hand and is immediately corrupted by it, and then finds himself killed in an ambush as Gladden Feilds. That was 3000 years before the current events, and there is a lot that happens before and between them as well. This history is outlined in the appendix to Return of the King for those who are interested, and there are numerous other books containing tales from the history of Middle Earth (the best being the Silmarillion).However, I will finish off with Sauron. Sauron is the bad guy, but in the grand scheme of Middle Earth he is not 'the' bad guy. That title falls to his boss, Morgoth. Now, Morgoth vanishes at the end of the First Age when Belariand is destroyed and the world is remade. However, Sauron is his lieutenant, and when Morgoth steps out of the picture, Sauron comes in. He is a subtle and manipulative individual, and while we do not meet him in The Lord of the Rings (he always floats in the background, and we know that he is their and that he is powerful, but he operates through his minions such as Sauruman and the Nazgul) he does make appearances in the earlier story. What comes to mind is the tale of Numenor, which is Tolkien's version of Atlantis (more on that later). Numenor was a mighty and powerful human empire, but they were corrupted, and this came about because they allowed Sauron to become their king. It is not that Sauron does evil explicitly (he does) but that he goads others to commit evil, and he does this with the Numenorians when he goads them into sailing west to take on the Valar (sort of very power angelic beings). It is not Sauron that is punished though, it is the Numenorians as their empire is destroyed and they are scattered to the four winds.

His Middle Earth is not a trilogy about a hobbit and a ring, but a living and vibrant world with a deep and colourful history.Granted, not everything in the history of Middle Earth is important to the plot, but it adds character and colour to the story. The actual story begins at the end of the second age when the king of men, Isildur, goes to war against the forces of Sauron, and while Sauron is defeated, Isildur does not have the last laugh. He removes the ring from Sauron's hand and is immediately corrupted by it, and then finds himself killed in an ambush as Gladden Feilds. That was 3000 years before the current events, and there is a lot that happens before and between them as well. This history is outlined in the appendix to Return of the King for those who are interested, and there are numerous other books containing tales from the history of Middle Earth (the best being the Silmarillion).However, I will finish off with Sauron. Sauron is the bad guy, but in the grand scheme of Middle Earth he is not 'the' bad guy. That title falls to his boss, Morgoth. Now, Morgoth vanishes at the end of the First Age when Belariand is destroyed and the world is remade. However, Sauron is his lieutenant, and when Morgoth steps out of the picture, Sauron comes in. He is a subtle and manipulative individual, and while we do not meet him in The Lord of the Rings (he always floats in the background, and we know that he is their and that he is powerful, but he operates through his minions such as Sauruman and the Nazgul) he does make appearances in the earlier story. What comes to mind is the tale of Numenor, which is Tolkien's version of Atlantis (more on that later). Numenor was a mighty and powerful human empire, but they were corrupted, and this came about because they allowed Sauron to become their king. It is not that Sauron does evil explicitly (he does) but that he goads others to commit evil, and he does this with the Numenorians when he goads them into sailing west to take on the Valar (sort of very power angelic beings). It is not Sauron that is punished though, it is the Numenorians as their empire is destroyed and they are scattered to the four winds.

A movie based on the original modern fantasy story was going to come out as a film sooner or later, the question was always going to be, would it be any good. An attempt at making The Lord of the Rings was made back in the 70's and it flopped, so it is no surprise that these films were a long time coming. Now, as we all know there are three films, based upon the three books, but the same plot and the themes run through each of them. Secondly, it is not so much the films that inspire me here but the underlying books. There are some out there that will regularly reread the Lord of the Rings, however I am not one of them. Most of what I say will apply to the books, but Jackson was reasonably faithful to the books (and I do say reasonably as there were a number of things he did cut out) but it is not possible to look at these films in isolation from the books.The plot pretty much runs through all three books. The hero, a Hobbit named Frodo Baggins, inherits a ring which turns out to be a powerful artifact that the dark lord Sauron wants back. However, very bad things will happen if it falls into the hands of Sauron, and it is decided that the ring must be destroyed, but the only way to do it is to throw it into the 'Cracks of Doom', a volcano where the ring was originally forged.Now, I will spend some time talking about the nature of the ring, and also look at the history of the middle earth as it comes up to the Lord of the Rings. Now, Lord of the Rings is unique in that the main antagonist is not so much Sauron, but the ring. The ring represents power, and whoever possesses the ring wields great power. However the ring has a very corruptive influence over all of its owners, and one cannot possess the ring without become made, or even coming under the influence of Sauron. This is what makes the ring such an awesome antagonist in that it cannot be used for good, no matter how noble the intentions of the owner are. It will always corrupt you.When Tolkien originally drafted the books he did not do so in isolation. Many fantasy novels (and films) are simply created out of a vacuum. Nothing really existed before and nothing exists after. All we see is what occurs in the action of the story. Granted there might be a rough history that leads up to the events of the story, but nothing all that deep. This is not the case with the Lord of the Rings. When Tolkein drafted his story he did it against a very deep and rich background.

Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling.An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity.The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation.

Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind.The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or.

The 1980s became a time when cocaine use grew rampant across the United States. George Jung was at the heart of the Cocaine industry. George Jung's life has been depicted by Johnny Depp in the movie Blow, directed by Ted Demme. While the movie ends on a bleak note of infidelity and botch, this movie is not your typical drama. The movie is only superficially about drugs. It's about one man's choices throughout life. How he chooses to escape poverty and ultimately how he falls to his bottom. George only wants to be a good husband and a good father, much like his father was growing up. The movie opens immersed in the childhood of George Jung. The coarse and dull images of this time captured an era before drugs, when everything was wholesome. George witnessed his parents' difficulties with finances and their shaky relationship. He escapes New England with his best friend, Tuna, and resides in Manhattan Beach, California. The liberal Californian ideas of the '60s and '70s soon swept George and Tuna into the Marijuana business. They establish a connection with a local hairdresser, Derek, who also transpires to be the main supplier of marijuana for the area. What started as small and local deals soon spread to mass transactions across the country. Jung was moving kilos from coast to coast with the help of his girlfriend, Barbra, who happens to be an airline stewardess. Acquiring large amounts of marijuana from the U.S. was nearly impossible; George chooses to go beyond Derek and get pot direct from Mexico. He and his partners were making anywhere from $50,000-$100,000 per month. However, great rewards do not come without great risk. George is soon arrested in Chicago with 660 pounds of marijuana. He is sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. During his sentence he befriends his cellmate Diego Delgado. Diego has connections to a cartel in Columbia; and introduces George to the ins and outs of the cocaine industry. After getting out of prison, George and Diego are soon at the center of the cocaine business. George reconnects with his old partner, Derek, to help him distribute this new drug. With the work of his cartel and his friend Derek, he becomes the top importer of cocaine into the U.S. His new found success is short lived, his partner, Diego, cuts him out of the business. George vows to leave the industry for good. He cleans up his act and stays sober. Staying out of the business proves to be harder than expected and soon enough George is knee deep in cocaine. Johnny Depp's role of George Jung could not have been better. His ragged long hair and seventies apparel really captured the image of Jung. Depp was such a front-runner for this role because of his ability to look so similarly to his character. His part was very easy to empathize with, because he wasn't portrayed as a bad guy. Sure, he sold drugs and did drugs, but he was a kindhearted individual. He just wanted the best for his wife and daughter, and to be the type of father that he had growing up. Kristina Jung is played by Emma Roberts, for her early life, and Jaime King later on. Kristina is a shy and hesitant girl, but she is not afraid to speak her mind. Katrina quietly watches, as her mother and father get high of cocaine and other substances. After her family has fallen apart as a result of cocaine, she has a falling out with her father. George becomes devastated with his lost connection with his daughter. He is ashamed of himself for not being the type of father that he had when he was a kid. George has grand plans to make it up to Katrina, even in prison he reaches out to her. Blow has a very seventies feel to it. The cinematography was excellent, and certainly placed you in the time period. The freeze frame imitations and precarious magnifications make the flick feel like an Austin Power's movie, in a camera-work sense. The film seems a bit short budgeted, but it gives the movie a more realistic feel. There are not any intense action scenes or computer animated explosions that enhance this movie; instead Blow offers an The fast paced editing and visual appeal provide a simpler view on the drug trade. The costumes in this movie bring the film to a whole new level. The flashy shades, aviators, turtlenecks, and track jackets create a visual appeal to the movie and a very important trait. The film also had a very effective soundtrack. Songs from artists such as the Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynrd certainly grasp the time period and add to the rock star  lifestyle that George Jung was leading. Director Ted Demme chooses not to take a side on Jung's life. He doesn't denounce George for his lifestyle nor does he glorify it. He simply tells the story how it is. This provides an interesting aspect to the film because it allows the viewer to choose how they feel about it. Viewers get the chance to sympathize with Jung or condemn him for his life in vice. Maybe that's why I like this film so much, because in the end I get to take the stand on how I relate to the movie and how I relate to George. I almost feel sorry for George, regardless of that fact that he was a drug dealer. Jung was nothing more than a kindhearted person who wound up pursuing the wrong dream. He got mixed up in the drug world and made choices that ultimately brought his life to an end. The film had an excellent storyline, phenomenal acting, and was a well-directed film.

He was rescued by a tribe and trained to live with his habit. Twenty years later he returns to America a skilled swordsman to find his war buddy Frank Devereau. When he arrives in Miami he learns that Frank has divorced his wife and lives in Reno, where the only business is gambling and prostitution. Suddenly three thugs break into the house, kill Frank's wife but are foiled in an attempt to kidnapped his kid. Thus Nick must take the kid to Reno and rescue Frank from the hands of these thugs.I watched this movie because I have seen it before and liked it. Only near the end I realised why I liked it it was a sword fighting movie. I have never been much of a fan of martial arts, but I have always like sword fighting, especially Japanese sword fighting as their swords are of an extremely superior quality. The thug comments you can't stop a bullet, but we see that this swordsman manages to outwit and defeat many thugs with guns, and even manages to defeat a master swordsman at the end of the movie. Blind Fury isn't a movie with a twist, it is a simple action movie with a blind sword fighter as the main character for some laughs and thrills.The interesting thing about this movie I find are the characters. There seems to have been a little more thought into the characters of this movie that normally. The characterisation is not on the level of Edward Scissorhands, but it is far above other movies such as K9. Nick Parker, even though he is a master swordsman, is still very fallible. He isn't one of those unbelievable blindmen who can walk around just as if they could see. We are always reminded that he is not only blind, but his blindness is a weakness. At the beginning he walks along the road into Miama and finds an alligator, but mistakes it for a dog. He is also fooled by the kids little tricks, especially with the rock.The movie isn't really exciting, more average, but it is a level above most Hollywood movies. The bad guy isn't noble, as most tend to be, he is sadistic and doesn't care what he does as long as he gets the mission completed. The beginning where he shoots the woman dead is an example of this. The kid also begins resenting Nick but grows to rely upon him, especially after he learns that his mother is dead. Blind Fury is enjoyable but I wouldn't rate it with the great movies.

This was, after all, that brief era when it was acceptable for a period film to be scored with synths. Enthusiastically modernist as it undoubtedly is, I still love 80s cinema for its naïve charm, and the fact that beneath that cheesy veneer still lurked movies of sincerity and sophistication. Chariots of Fire is exemplary in this case.It would be hard for anyone to guess the movie had the makings of a classic though. Sports movies are generally dull (unless they're about boxing), and a bunch of British runners in the 1920s hardly sounds inspiring. And yet the Colin Welland screenplay is a thing of real intelligence and poignancy. It is not, like many sports pictures, basically a drama with the sport as a backdrop &#x96; it really is all about the running. And yet other issues and preoccupations of the characters are shot through it &#x96; Liddell's devoutness, Abrahams's struggle against prejudice and his seemingly at-odds love of performing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Lindsay's sacrifice to allow Liddell to run. A few liberties are taken with historical accuracy, but these are only for the sake of fine-tuning the dramatic power, without slipping into complete misrepresentation. What we get is an intimate story of credible figures displaying admirable dedication and camaraderie.The two lead players here &#x96; Ben Cross and Ian Charleson &#x96; were unknowns at the time and they have remained fairly obscure. And while neither of them is exactly outstanding (the roles don't really call for such a thing) they are fully adequate. Cross is genuinely able to sing and play the piano, but also convinces as an athlete. Charleson comes across as a supremely sedate and thoughtful man, and has a kind of charisma that makes him captivating despite his calmness. The biggest treats however are amongst the supporting players, a bevy of Britain's finest character actors. Ian Holm is especially impressive. Often chomping a cigar, his face half-hidden by a straw hat, the personality of Mussabini all comes through in those little gestures and mad energy. There are also memorable bit parts from a sniffy Richard Griffiths and a humourless John Gielgud.Like his stars, director Hugh Hudson is by no means amazing, but he gets the job done. His slow-moving, constantly-roving camera helps to give the picture a nice flowing pace. His camera placement often seems almost arbitrary, with tops of heads cropped and so forth, but he seems to be giving an in-the-thick-of-it look, without resorting to the clunkiness of hand-held camera. At some of the most emotional moments, such as Holm's personal celebration of his protégé's win, he keeps well back from the action. This gives a kind of respectful distance and allows the power of the moment to come across in body language rather than facial expression.But I feel the picture's greatest strength lies in the way it is all put together. There is this continual, breathtaking interweaving of ideas through music, for example, the singing of a church choir plays over one of Charleson's races, or He is an Englishman playing as Cross trains after his confrontation with the anti-Semitic deans. Slow-motion, usually a rather trite and obvious technique, is used here to such smooth and subtle effect, with some clever mixes of slow image and normal speed sound, or cutting from slo-mo runners to normal speed crowds. It all helps to pull what is essentially a rather disparate plot (Cross and Charleson barely have any scenes together), and bring out the tones and themes in a way that is purely cinematic. This is even where that seemingly inappropriate Vangelis score comes in &#x96; it has a kind of transcendent quality that makes its anachronism irrelevant. On the surface, this may look like a lot of 80s hi-tecness guilding the dramatic lily, but it is all just another form of expression in this beautiful medium.

And yet other issues and preoccupations of the characters are shot through it &#x96; Liddell's devoutness, Abrahams's struggle against prejudice and his seemingly at-odds love of performing Gilbert and Sullivan, and Lindsay's sacrifice to allow Liddell to run. A few liberties are taken with historical accuracy, but these are only for the sake of fine-tuning the dramatic power, without slipping into complete misrepresentation. What we get is an intimate story of credible figures displaying admirable dedication and camaraderie.The two lead players here &#x96; Ben Cross and Ian Charleson &#x96; were unknowns at the time and they have remained fairly obscure. And while neither of them is exactly outstanding (the roles don't really call for such a thing) they are fully adequate. Cross is genuinely able to sing and play the piano, but also convinces as an athlete. Charleson comes across as a supremely sedate and thoughtful man, and has a kind of charisma that makes him captivating despite his calmness. The biggest treats however are amongst the supporting players, a bevy of Britain's finest character actors. Ian Holm is especially impressive. Often chomping a cigar, his face half-hidden by a straw hat, the personality of Mussabini all comes through in those little gestures and mad energy. There are also memorable bit parts from a sniffy Richard Griffiths and a humourless John Gielgud.Like his stars, director Hugh Hudson is by no means amazing, but he gets the job done. His slow-moving, constantly-roving camera helps to give the picture a nice flowing pace. His camera placement often seems almost arbitrary, with tops of heads cropped and so forth, but he seems to be giving an in-the-thick-of-it look, without resorting to the clunkiness of hand-held camera. At some of the most emotional moments, such as Holm's personal celebration of his protégé's win, he keeps well back from the action. This gives a kind of respectful distance and allows the power of the moment to come across in body language rather than facial expression.But I feel the picture's greatest strength lies in the way it is all put together. There is this continual, breathtaking interweaving of ideas through music, for example, the singing of a church choir plays over one of Charleson's races, or He is an Englishman playing as Cross trains after his confrontation with the anti-Semitic deans. Slow-motion, usually a rather trite and obvious technique, is used here to such smooth and subtle effect, with some clever mixes of slow image and normal speed sound, or cutting from slo-mo runners to normal speed crowds. It all helps to pull what is essentially a rather disparate plot (Cross and Charleson barely have any scenes together), and bring out the tones and themes in a way that is purely cinematic. This is even where that seemingly inappropriate Vangelis score comes in &#x96; it has a kind of transcendent quality that makes its anachronism irrelevant. On the surface, this may look like a lot of 80s hi-tecness guilding the dramatic lily, but it is all just another form of expression in this beautiful medium.

This was, after all, that brief era when it was acceptable for a period film to be scored with synths. Enthusiastically modernist as it undoubtedly is, I still love 80s cinema for its naïve charm, and the fact that beneath that cheesy veneer still lurked movies of sincerity and sophistication. Chariots of Fire is exemplary in this case.It would be hard for anyone to guess the movie had the makings of a classic though. Sports movies are generally dull (unless they're about boxing), and a bunch of British runners in the 1920s hardly sounds inspiring.
