As an amateur filmmaker often guilty of hubris, I'm very critical of most current films by young filmmakers.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, however, are two enormous exceptions to this rule.  They've made a brilliant film that rises above all my expectations.  Rushmore is the best movie with an adolescent protagonist since Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  It's not strictly a movie about high school, however; it's more about the vitality of youth and the allure of a man who truly knows what he wants to do.  What Max Fischer wants to do is lead a fascinating life, and that's exactly what he does.  Neither about geek chic nor teen angst, the theme of the film is accomplish your dreams.The wonderful thing about this film (as well as Anderson and Wilson's first film, Bottle Rocket) is the balance of understated humor and delightful over-the-top action.  The humor isn't based on jokes, but on interesting and believable characters who don't fit into the real world's mold of a successful human.  Max is a metaphor for the voice inside our heads who gives us these wonderful ideas--ideas that never work in the real world. They don't always work in his world, either--in fact most of the movie consists of him failing miserably at one thing after another--but when they do, it's nothing short of miraculous.

If you like love stories and involved dialogue then this is a flick for you.  It is a quadruple love story with a small dose of extra marital affair, a fair look at a husband's search for himself and a sprinkle of mother\/son understanding.  Six stories to start and you must follow each of them.  All of these stories come together at the end in a way that really touches your heart.Beware of other comments regarding this movie in this area  - a couple of commenters have told the entire story.  Part of the joy of this movie is to try to figure out how all of these characters connect to each other.  I found it enjoyable to see I was right while I watched it all unravel. There's nothing wrong with predictability especially if you're not really *that* sure if you came to the right conclusions before the end.Angelina Jolie's acting is stunning and her repore with Ryan Phillipe is perfect.  I was surprized to see that Jon Stewart is a natural and Gillian Anderson can do no wrong in my eyes.  If nothing else, see it for Sean Connery who is always at his best.I think that people who don't like this movie don't enjoy the mystery of love.  Talking about love is like Dancing about Architechture.  How is this so hard to fathom?  The story is confusing because love is confusing. That's what this movie is trying to say.

This is because it doesn't follow the usual way a film is presented to the viewer. Rather than having the main suspense near the end of the film, Vertigo has this high level of suspense at both the end and middle of the film. Few could have pulled this off quite as well as Hitch.I really liked this film in the stylish way it was presented. Time is not overly spent getting into the characters here, they are simply presented for who they are leaving the judgement up to the viewer. The Vertigo special effect and the nightmare sequence were done like nothing I have ever seen for a film of this time and are enchanting and timeless. The plot and storyline of this film are both original and not cliched. The audience is taken by surprise during the middle of the film and from there on the film becomes even more suspenseful.Jimmy Stewart put another of his great performances into this film and played well opposite Kim Novak's dark and confused character. Stewart shows the full range of emotions as he is taken by the alluring Madeline (Novak) and is driven to a deep depression. Novak had been criticized for playing her role too darkly which is a claim I find completely unfounded. For a woman who is going through so much stress (or at least we are to believe that), she plays as well as this role could have been done. The interesting thing about the performances in this film is how much time Stewart and Novak are on the screen. For 95% of the film, there is not another character to add anything else to the plot. Other than Barbara Bel Geddes, who gives a short, supporting performance, the film revolves around the realtionship between Ferguson (Stewart) and Madeline.I must say that I enjoyed this film just as much as Rear Window and would even put this one above North by Northwest. Hitchcock does suspense so well and is quite obvious to see why he is imitated so much. A recommendation to all.8\/10 stars.

Unless the original was of undebatable achievement in every aspect, from technical to artistic (which the original SABRINA wasn't), the remake will usually be more refined due to the natural evolution of film making technique and sensibility. Side by side, the 1995 SABRINA is more clever in dialogue, plot, and filming. Let's not even get into how the Hepburn version is better simply because it's OLD, or a legendary actress was in it; who's to say 1995's SABRINA won't become a classic and Julia Ormond won't become a legendary actress? (Well, I think all Julia fans would agree that she's ALREADY legendary, from her debut, and throughout every single effort she's made.) On top of that, Harrison and Greg made much more charming and convincing Linus and David than the original cast. another touch that made it better was changing Sabrina's Paris trip to becoming a photographer instead of a cook. It gave her so much more confidence and validated her as an individual who's accomplished in artistic achievement and sensitivity(which matched her sentimental personality far better). It was also a great move to have Linus truly be the head of the family by taking out the father. That way, Linus became even more of a figure to be intimidated by, and the weight on his shoulders seemed that much heavier.

She seemed to appreciate this ability and the potential it could have added to her professional work as an architect. However, the only new thing we see go into her work after that are trees. (The scene in the abandoned building during the rainstorm was one of the best in the movie for giving us the insight into blindness that this movie needs.)Second, as darling and talented as Val Kilmer is, the only scene in which he displays any typical mannerisms of blindness (inappropriate head movements, lack of body language) is the final scene.

I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those Budget Theaters over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... HOPE.  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my favorite of all time, but they've all fallen far short of The Shawshank Redemption. So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.

It exceeded my expectations and that's putting it mildly. It is a wonderfully fresh and innovative way to look at Shakespeare. Even my friends who do not at all care for Shakespeare loved this movie. It's a lot of fun to surmise about what could have possibly inspired Shakespeare to write the things he did. This movie really gets the wheels moving. Definitely the year's best. My vote 10\/10!

Maybe I don't know how the marshall service works, but wouldn't she have to report to someone somewhere at some time?  And after all that happened, would they really let her be the one to drive him back to Florida?  Would they really send him back to Florida--I would think they would send him to a different prison since he already escaped from that one?  I hate to nitpick, but these kinds of details are important, I think, and when we are asked to ignore them, it gets in the way for me.

So it was quite a surprise when, as I was flipping through the channels, I caught them presenting Wes Anderson with an award for best new director.  At this time, back in 1996, I was but a promising but aimless high school student with a vague notion of what I might do in college.  Sometime later I found Bottle Rocket in a video store and gave it a try.  What happened then can only be described as a religious experience.  That was the day I knew I would major in film.  Though this film may be too low profile to have any more than the most subtle of impacts on the industry, I think that future films by this Anderson\/Wilson team will change the face of comedy.  The likes of the Farrelly brothers will find themselves in straight-to-video B-movie hell before long.  I guess you could call me an optimist.
