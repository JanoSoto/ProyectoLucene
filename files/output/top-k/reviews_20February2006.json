I like superhero movies, and this was one of the first to introduce a little known character. It was ambitious. I liked certain sentimental moments in the film. I also like Shaq. I think he has made another positive icon for the youth to inspire to be like and emulate. Black kids are in need of heroes they can relate to, and this movie tried to provide characters which are familiar to the youth. Not perfect characters but characters with flaws. Shaq portrays a young, brilliant weapons designer who's weapons are designed not to kill. I think the movie and all those involved made a noble effort to teach kids not to kill, and that they, too can build and create new technology. Moreover, the kids see that they,too, can be heroes. If it's true Shaq did his own stunts, I'm even more impressed with his performance. I'm a layman and I don't know good acting from bad acting. All I know is I was throughly entertained by this movie.

While an entertaining film in its own right, Son of Frankenstein does not live up to the standards of the first two films. Director Roland V. Lee doesn't have James Whale's flair or subversive sense of humor. Nor does this film reflect the same style of the earlier films, as is evident even in the sets. The sets, while interesting, are more modern and streamlined than the Gothic ones used in the first two films. The lighting and cinematography, while more than adequate, isn't as interesting as the expressionism of the earlier films. More importantly, however, the monster loses most of his personality. Boris Karloff managed to breath life into the creature in the first two films, inspiring both menace and sympathy, but becomes little more than a menacing hulk. His friendship with the boy Peter is both obvious and perfunctory. It was a pity the writer rendered the monster mute this time out. His voice gave him perspective and personality. This film marks the end of the monster as an interesting character. After this the monster simply becomes a menacing pawn in the hands of various unscrupulous characters. Still, this film remains entertaining. Bela Lugosi is a welcome addition to the series as Ygor. He gives one of his best performances in this film. Basil Rathbone also does a great job as Wolfgang Frankenstein, and Lional Atwill is excellent as Inspector Krogh.

Night Shyamalan, is an intense science fiction thriller. This film has two central themes one being the impending invasion of aliens on Earth, the second is the story of the main characters' personal lives and traumas. The basic storyline is of a farmer, his two children, and his brother who awaken one morning to discover mysterious crop circles in their cornfield. Throughout the movie, the audience is given glimpses into the characters lives and begins to relate the history to the present day situation. The film soon shows its true colors as the man and his brother face their frightening situation at home. Faith becomes a very real part of the movie as the aliens make their approach.Reverend Hess Graham (Mel Gibson) is our central character, although Merrill Graham (Joaquin Phoenix), the younger brother of Hess, puts in an astounding performance. We learn through these two characters conversations and flashbacks, the personal grief and struggle they have already seen. The Reverend is referred to as father and through a sequence of events we learn that he is not only the children's father, but also a former leader of a church. The question of faith is touched upon in a conversation between the two men Which type are you? do you believe everything is for a reason or do you believe in signs? Hess Graham asks his young brother while they anxiously await the arrival of the visitors from another world. M. Night Shayamalan cleverly invents a small, but important, role in the film for himself. The children are brilliant as they deal with the horror of an alien invasion.Signs has a profound effect on the audience. The plot is frightening in ways that many movies fail to be. The aliens are not huge graphics which overrule the theme. Instead we are given just enough to make it feel real and become afraid for the world and its characters. The overall feeling of the movie is excellent with two amazing themes running into each other at just the right moments. The visuals are good, the acting is superb and the movie shines. M.

The problems start with the casting. Edward Furlong is cast to play the 16 year old son of parents played by Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson, but at age 16 he appears to be roughly five inches shorter than Streep and is utterly dwarfed by Neeson. Furlong looks more like he was their 12 year old son than their 16 year old son.Next problem is that certain points you need to catch at the beginning of the film simply slip by far to fast to catch. In a murder mystery or something with major plot twists that might be tolerable, but not in your ordinary family drama.But to me the most troubling problem (and if you are determined to see the movie regardless you might not want to read on, because this will give away most of the movie) is that it simply does not make sense.The story is Furlong has pulled off the road with his girlfriend and parked in the snow, gets stuck, they argue and tussle with each other, with him pushing her and accidentally causing her to fall face-first on the car jack. He then flees. She's found, rushed to the hospital and dies. The movie then deals with the family struggle of how to deal with this in court. Getting the kids' story out takes at least half the movie and by the time it gets out things are moving fast and little things, like making sense, get lost in the wake. If Furlong and the girlfriend TOGETHER had been absolutely unable to get the car out of the snow, and the deep rut he had made in it, it makes no sense that after she is spread out on the ground and unable to help he then gets the the car out by himself -- that is the kind of inconsistency any prosecuting attorney would have latched onto, and which any defense attorney would have seen as a major problem in court (I make these comments as a criminal defense attorney).But that's not the only problem with the kid's story. It was supposedly an accident. He cared about her. He never wanted to hurt her. And yet after she is hurt he cleans up the scene, gets that stuck car out of there, leaves, she is found and is STILL ALIVE long enough for an ambulance to reach her, get her to an emergency room and have a serious effort to save her life before she dies on the table in the ER. The entire issue of her having BEEN ALIVE and left to die is ignored. Not mentioned once by him, his family, the girl's grieving mother, his defense attorney, the prosecution or the judge who heard the case. It is as if the director forgot that in the second scene in the movie we see Meryly Streep, a doctor in the film, called to the ER to help with efforts to save the girl, long before we know her son was involved in the girl's death. The scene leaves no doubt (I went back and watched it a second time to be sure because the inconsistency seemed so glaring) that the girl was still alive when she reached the ER.But she was left to die by the kid for whom we are supposed to feel sympathy.Not only are there problems with the issue not having been properly addressed by any of the characters who would have addressed it, the fact that we need to feel sympathy for the kid is a problem. Easy to feel sympathy for him in having his life thrown into chaos as a result of an accident.... hard to feel sympathy when he would have had to have left his girlfriend there to die, and when in cleaning up the scene he would have had to have had enough contact with her (she fell on the car jack, and he removed the jack and put it back in the trunk of the car) that he certainly should have noticed she was still alive.Despite strong performances from the actors and good cinematography, the movie was a bit disappointing because of direction, casting and the script.

I thought it was a bit too slow and even boring in some parts. I thought it lacked tension and didn't quite get it why people were referring to it as The best suspense-thriller of the year. One of the reasons for my disappointment, was because I was used to Sam Raimi's exuberant way of filming, as shown in EVIL DEAD en DARKMAN. At the time, I also compared A SIMPLE PLAN to that other snowy black comedy\/thriller FARGO, by the Coen brothers. I remember liking FARGO a lot more because of its occasional dark humor and the fact that the characters were a bit more 'crazy' and out of the ordinary, as opposed to the rather 'normal' people in A SIMPLE PLAN. I failed to see, at the time, that this was in fact the whole purpose of A SIMPLE PLAN Normal people doing evil things (when a considerable amount of money, the root of all evil, is involved). I also failed to see that A SIMPLE PLAN was an excellent story-driven thriller relying on solid acting instead of graphic violence. And I even failed to see that Sam Raimi had grown as a film-maker, making a film with a lot more contents, a different tone and visual style.The set up to the story is simple Two brothers and a mutual friend discover a crashed plane in the woods which contains a dead body and a bag with 4 million $ in it. They decide to keep it and divide it when the time is ripe. Now, you can expect that things will go wrong and that people will die. But you can't possibly predict how and when. Then there's also the question about the origin of the money. I can only say that this is one hell of an intelligent script with enough twists and one that also manages to have you think together with the characters. Because, what would you do if so much money could be yours? The characters are well-written with a lot of background and the acting is just superb. Especially Bill Paxton as Hank and Billy Bob Thornton as his slightly mentally challenged brother Jacob. There's one really strong scene were Hank and Jacob are tricking Lou into a confession. It is such a deliberately misleading scene (even Hank at one point got mislead), but it shows that Jacob really is a bit smarter than he looks. Brilliant scene, as well as the escalation to the conclusion of it.Like I insinuated before, this is a rather down-toned thriller, so don't expect a spectacular climax in the end. But the conclusion to where it all leads up to is extremely satisfying (in terms of cleverness, sadness and unpredictability). This movie has some sort of subtle 'finesse' to it which shines through in the visuals as well as the acting. Two random examples The wide shot were Hank, Jacob, Jenkins and Baxter all walk into a different direction towards the woods to look for the plane is beautiful (with the tracks through the snowy field and all) but also foreboding ('cause you know that the horrible conclusion will take place in those woods). And then, before all this, there was the scene were Jacob arrives at the point of rendez-vous, against all expectations. When Hank asks why he did show up after all, Jacob replies that he talked to Sarah and decided to come after all. Just look at Hank's (Paxton) reaction to that. For a second or two you can see him realize that Jacob now knows what he and Sarah already knew but Jenkins and Baxter don't. Hank then quickly gets back into his roll and they all head off to the woods.

I CAN NOT believe that they cut the part where they cut the horn off of the unicorn and reattach it. Who cares if there is a hare in the way? And the fact that they show the removal of the horn on the music video is even worse. I have loved this movie since the first time it came out on TV.

Comedy doesn't get much better than this. Danny Rubin's screenplay is funny and intelligent. Bill Murray easily gives one of his best performances and is perfectly cast. This is simply the best comedy Harold Ramis ever made up to now. This movie has had so many positive comments that there isn't much left to say actually. So I'm just here to throw in my two cents. Though the concept of reliving the same day over and over again is rather original to base a comedy on and the movie is build up flawless, having a lot of funny situations, it still is Bill Murray, with his almost natural sarcasm, that is the main attraction of this movie. I possibly couldn't have imagined another actor playing weatherman Phil Connors. Andie MacDowell was also perfect as Rita, the producer who was practically the complete counterpart of Phil. To put it simple She loves life, Phil hates it. It even felt okay when those two become romantically involved at the end, 'cause you really want them to (with Rita having such a positive effect on Phil and all).Scriptwriter Danny Rubin really explores every single possible thing one can do when there are absolutely no consequences the next day. Needless to say the possibilities are endless and this movie never becomes boring. Then why am I not rating it 10 out of 10 stars, you might ask. Well, the whole grumpy, egocentric person becoming a better man-thing was a bit obvious. And there's another thing the fact that Phil falls in love with Rita was totally plausible. After all he's got all the time in the world to get to know here. But Rita only had one day to get to know him. So it's a bit silly for her to, at the end of that day, agree with him to rent a house in Punxsatawney and having his kids. Well, it actually isn't suggested in such an explicit way, but still... You get the idea. But then again, this is a romantic comedy (with an underlying supernatural theme), and one of the best ones out there. And I also liked the fact that the phenomenon of the re-occurring Groundhog Day isn't explained in the end. Nice move, Mr. Rubin. GROUNDHOG DAY certainly is a movie that one can watch over and over, again and again. And who knows, you might even become a better person yourself after watching it.

The basic idea of KEEBLE was to show everyone's dream of actually getting revenge on all the obstacles of middle school, and that's actually a premise that can be done well, if it has a good writer. Unfortunately, the film had to be done by Disney, which means that the possibilities are at a limit, and that anyone who enjoys it the most will be little kids who think they know what middle school is like. Any elementary schooler who watches this movie will think they've got middle school planned out, but in a few years, they'll find that they had it all wrong.Max Keeble is supposed to be your typical unpopular kid, who after finding out that he'll be moving in a week, decides to live his remaining time at middle school to the fullest. And to do that, Max is going to get sweet revenge. Now we all know that revenge is sweet, but not when it could get you expelled from school, or even arrested. Several of Max's revenge plots should leave him in prison, and since Disney would never let that happen, Max gets away with everything. In a very embarrassing eighty-six minutes, we are exposed to Max ensuing chaos in his classroom, breaking into the school at night, and joyriding on a bulldozer.Another major problem with MAX KEEBLE'S BIG MOVE is its large amount of unrealistic characters. Troy McGinty, the school bully, gets away with harassing a student everyday. He even admits that he beats up kids to the school guidance counselor, and yet she does nothing. Dobbs, the school's money-maker (umm, what?) gets away with stealing money from kids. So it's bad if money is stolen at a bank, but no big deal if it's done at a middle school? That makes sense. Principal Jindraike and the Evil Ice Cream Man are both supposed to be mean, but we see them being so cruel that they really should be spending time.My least favorite part of the movie would have to be the fact that the Keebles find out they're moving a week before it happens. This would never happen, as it's not that easy to find a home quickly. Even worse is that we hardly ever see them packing. Yeah, I may over analyze some things, but that is no reason for an error that large to be overlooked. This comedy hardly has any laughs in it, and when I found myself laughing, it was usually at how ridiculous some scenes were. Basically, the only thing this movie has going for it are some good actors. KEEBLE does not deserve any special treatment for being a kids' movie. That's no excuse.
