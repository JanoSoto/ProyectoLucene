Just the bizarre images suggested a whole other nightmare world available on film - seeing the trailer for Eraserhead was another good teaser.Occasionally you'd get to see some of these incredible strange films, either on a friend's VCR - we didn't have one at home - or on late night TV, and they'd make a big impression - Xtro, Demon Seed, Harpya, Eraserhead, Videodrome - though they all became absorbed later into a growing knowledge of film and film history, and contextualised as bad or good films. POSSESSION, however, slipped through the cracks until 1998.*SPOILER ALERT! *SPOILER ALERT! *SPOILER ALERT! *SPOILER ALERT! *SPOILER ALERT! *SPOILER ALERT! Now that I've seen it, I'm happy to say it's almost exactly what I imagined it would be, and it sits in my memory in exactly the same spot it occupied before I saw it - meaning I still regard it as a weird horror film whose seriousness and disconnected strangeness give it an otherworldly quality. See it , as I did, for Carlo Rambaldi's hideous monster creations a strangely sentient patch of fungus that really does look like it's alive, a squid monster in two stages of development that Isabelle Adjani sleeps with; and see it for the scene where Adjani noisily and messily aborts something she and the monster have conceived, in a subway tunnel.I suspect the director had other intentions beyond horror, though. He seems to take his melodramatics terribly seriously  he was in attendance during the screening I saw, and got up and walked out when there were audience titters at some of the sillier scenes; also, as a side note, the Quay Brothers were a few seats away from me, which tells you something about POSSESSION's influence and its more serious audience .With its blue-on-blue colour scheme, and endless marital shouting matches, total paranoia  Sam Neill's male lead is a spy who doesn't trust his wife - and that's just the starting point, and identity crises galore, it seems to have something to say about ... identity? trust? the state of the world? Maybe there's some allegorical meaning to the monster I've missed but I think monsters are scarier than allegories, so I prefer to take it at face value.So... a bizarre art-house film with some potent images.

I had only seen minor animes before on television and the only full length anime I saw up until that point was My Neighbor Totoro. As an American growing up around Disney like cartoons, this film came as quite a shock to me. I was more horrified than stunned at seeing the PG-13 and even R like violence in the film. I very much shut out all interest in the film a week after I saw it although I still continued to watch animes.Nearly three years after first seeing Princess Mononoke I gained a greater amount of respect for animes that were farther from the seat of an American viewer. It was then that I finally came across a original Japanese poster for the film that featured the title character on the front. Upon looking at this picture the first thing that came to mind for me was a line that the main character in the movie said to the Princess Mononoke which I will not repeat here for fear of spoiler. From that moment I was digging my head into as much information as a could get about film and then finally seeing it again with a better understanding of the story itself. I say all of this before my review because being an American who never saw deep anime like this before came as a big shock to me, which is why anyone who is new to anime and is planning on seeing this movie, I advise them to start out slow with other animes like Kiki's Delivery Services and Spirited Away, so that this film won't bring on any bad carma upon the first viewing.With that said Upon my second viewing of Princess Mononoke I came to understand the themes that this film deals with. Ashitaka (the main character) is a young man, no older than seventeen, who faces the perils of a war that seems almost unstoppable. Although the film is intended for more adult audiences it still carries child like ideas such as seeing the world as a gift and not a tool, to live and enjoy life and not destroy it, to seeing the world as it truly is without real evil.This is one of the many things that I loved so much about this movie is that isn't simply and good guy vs. bad guy film. The story is more complex than that. We get reasonable and unreasonable arguments from both the nature side and the human side that in the end only spell that neither side is completely good. Each has there own qualities that make their argument unfit to be considered just.If there is any true innocence that runs through this story, than it is the love story between the main character Ashitaka and the title character San (the Princess Mononoke). The relationship that these two characters share is not anywhere near important in the story beyond themselves, and the movie is not specifically considered a romance. For the love story this works as an advantage because it is not the focus of the story it is very much cast to the side, allowing their relationship to develop in a more natural way through the events that unfold in the story. Also their love is expressed more through actions than through words which makes it more effective in dealing with the fact that love is seen hear as an emotion and not a story.I'm not proposing that anyone seeing this movie should be looking for Romeo and Juliet like story, but instead look for the hints at their growing relationship and how they regard one another through out the film. The love story in this film has grown to become one of my favorites of all time, the way in which the film maker, Hayao Miyazaki, deals with story and Ashitaka and San's relationship is further proof of his artistic talent.Hayao Miyazaki is well known and admired by animators and film makers alike as being a constant inspiration to their work and being one of the greatest and most important film makers living today primarily because of the way he relates the human and nature relationship of today in this film.

I mean, here he is in the person of David Jansen, and we know he's got a sconce full of medical knowledge and everything, yet he's running from town to town being a gardener or a pool guy or something, never able to show off his skills until the end of the program when he's called on to reveal his identity by saving someone's life. It was like watching Jimmy Stewart in Destry Rides Again, the newly arrived sheriff acting like a bumbling inarticulate naive idiot until half-way through he unlimbers his guns and leaves the town goggle eyed.The movie lacks the tension associated with that kind of status discrepancy.It doesn't really matter much that Harrison Ford is a doctor. He's only called on to exercise his skills once. And he never is hired as a handy man or chimney sweep so there's no real mystery about his true occupation to be unraveled.I'm pretty much skipping the plot of the movie because it must be pretty well known by now. But I will say that the episodic semi-mystery of the original, with Kimball getting involved in the lives of various locals, has been dropped in favor of a standard chase\/action movie, and not a bad one if you disregard certain facts. One of the facts to be disregarded, common to action movies of this caliber, is that the human body is destructible. Instance Dr. Kimball does this Brody out of a sewer outlet and falls down the greatest biggest most horrifyingly tiptoptoloftical cascade of water you ever saw. The scene reminded me of an old Tarzan movie in which Tarzan dives off one of the towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. Like Tarzan, Harrison Ford, emerges from the midwinter water, shakes himself off like a dog, and makes off through the woods with only a look of irritation to show for the experience.The solution to the murder mystery, when it comes, arrives rather suddenly and without earlier hints. All of a sudden there is something to do with falsified results of liver damage. I don't know what's the big deal about Provasic. I once asked a doctor to give me something for my liver. He gave me a bag of onions and that was that. The ending involves more human indestructibility, multiple shootouts, a helicopter with one of those bright spotlights, a chase across a roof, a fist fight in which middle-aged doctors throw punches that would stun a rhinoceros, and so forth.Harrison Ford is okay. We don't get to see nearly enough of Julianne Moore.She exudes intelligence as well as a peculiar beauty. Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding. He brings something unique to each role. And Joe Pantoliano is as good as always, which is to say pretty good. Joeren Krabbe is a smooth villain. Well, with a name like that, could it be otherwise? Come to think of it, we should have seen more of Sela Ward too, a Southern black-eyed susan if there ever was one. It's easy to understand why, after she was murdered, Ford carried a grudge against the perpetrators.Well, see it if it's on TV sometime. Or rent it if you want action.

Gleason seems to be having fun as the foul mouthed Smokey of the title and the action rarely lets up. Credit director Hal Needham for the pacing. On the flawed side Burt is never made aware of the connection between Sally Field and Jackie Gleason thus never figures out that Gleason is not after him for bootlegging. And we never see a clock on when the 28 hours start so the audience gets no sense of suspense as to how much time is left. We get the occasional update from Jerry Reed telling Burt (and us) whether they are ahead or behind schedule. I think it would have been more exciting to see for ourselves.All in all it's a fun picture. The best way to see it is on the big screen while sitting in your car with a beverage of your own. Perhaps with a little pretending you can experience what millions of us did in the summer of 1977.

It is a ridiculous love story set in 'tornado alley' in the Midwest. After reading some of the comments from my fellow 'reviewers' I see why this crapfest is rated so high. It is made to appeal to foreign markets and the young and\/or stupid American market (a large market indeed).In my opinion, the release of Twister in 1996 marked a turning point in Hollywood. It became apparent to movie makers that it really didn't matter if the dialogue was brainless or the plot was full of holes. It didn't matter if the actors could act or the script was convincing. What mattered was how loud and violent a movie could be. We in America love our violence and it translates well into any language. Since foreign markets make up a large percentage of a film's profits, it just makes sense to create long action sequences with as little conversation (or plot) as possible. In fact, Twister would have been improved had there been no discourse at all &#150; just people fleeing from the hundreds of tornado's that terrorize the American Midwest everyday. I can't wait for Twister 2. Maybe Carmen Electra and Ashton Kutcher will be in it and there will be a lesbian subplot.In short, if you have a nice home theater with surround sound and would like to have your intelligence insulted, I recommend giving Twister a go. Otherwise stick to something cerebral like the recently remade Starsky & Hutch movie. Carmen Electra is in that and she kisses another woman. No corporate sell-outs here baby, it's all about the science.

The cult believes it to be necessary for their ceremonies, while the scientists, marveled at the industructable jewelry, imagine themselves quite powerful if they were to own it (kind of like a Beatles version of the Hobbit). Everyone scrambles around in slapstick format like it was Blake Edwards 'The Great Race.' It is so comical and so simple, kids might enjoy the strange atmosphere and slapstick nature of this movie. I particularly like the little joke about the 'Royal Fuse' going out at the substation or when George tells Ringo that he should let them cut off his finger, because he'll get good money from the insurance, and probably more because he's a Beatle.It doesn't matter that the Beatles couldn't act. They didn't stick them in movies expecting to make cinematic masterpieces. They were just vehicles for their music (between scenes, you have your standard mini-videos featuring the famous 'Ticket to Ride' and title song 'Help!), and of course, the Beatles popularity. Their stiffboard expressions actually seem much funnier when compared with these insane people running around after them. Ringo, in particular, as he seems more like the youngest of the bunch, and perhaps, the most naive. I love how everyone disbelieves that anyone is trying to sabatoge him in the beginning, when the cult tries several clandestine and unsuccessful methods of stealing Ringo's ring.The movie does go on a bit too long, as most Beatles movies tend to do. After that George Harrison song 'I Need You' plays during their pseudo-war scenes, the remainder of the film tends to get dragged out a little too far. It would've been better to end it somewhere not far (minutes) once that song passes. It isn't the best of the Beatles movies (Magical Mystery Tour is in my opinion the worst) probably because it lacks the visual beauty and psychadellia that Yellow Submarine had.
