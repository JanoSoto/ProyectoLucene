The story is basically guy finds girl, girl dumps guy, guy can't get over girl, guy and girl run into each other again, girl explains why it will never work, guy must decide what he should do... Like I said, nothing profound, or original, but there's still fun stuff to be seen.The comedy in the film is what made the movie for me. Zack Galifianakis (Luke) is absolutely hilarious and plays a fantastic character. Jason London, David Denman and Derek Hamilton also have their share of comedic moments.I also feel very much obligated to mention the women in this film. This is reason enough to watch this film. Victoria Silvstedt (Inga) looks nothing less than perfect throughout the film. AJ Cook (Jenny) is also quite the looker and not a bad actress. The last woman I have to mention is Caroline Dhavernas (Anna), very nice!Normally I'm not one to pay too much attention to the music in a film (unless it's just atrocious), but anyhow, I thought the music choices are great in this film. The movie is packed full of great music (my favorites being Eve 6 - Anytime and Weezer - Island In The Sun).All in all, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes snowboarding or just likes comedies. Just don't go in expecting the best movie you've ever seen, it's not the best, but it certainly was worth my money. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have gotten it quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.

Totally down his street. This is almost Goodfellers Part II and to make this more obvious they even have some of the same cast - including Robert De Niro as Sam Rothstien the mob front man taking heat from the overworld AND the underworld.If this film had have been made before Goodfellers (probably the best organised crime picture ever made) then it would have been better received. This is not as good and requires too much setting up (almost documentary style) and we don't really care quite as much. It also has a nasty underbelly.The message is that gambling is for idiots and in this world nobody trusts anybody else. This is not a point that you have to go searching for, because it is pushed down your throat through voice-over and then underlined through action. People here are cold and in it for themselves; although this may be true-to-life.I love the little scenes that are truthful. The smiling receptionist setting up the robbery of the guest. People being lured in to debt for the fun of handing out punishment. Casino cheats being dealt with on the spot. It presents a view of 1970's Las Vegas almost as if it were a middle eastern country where thieves have their hands removed. The real thrust of this film is the feeling of being at the cross-roads. Where legitimate business and organised crime meet. De Niro has to play both sides and this is not without danger; as the opening and closing scenes demonstrate. Joe Pesci represents the old school rob 'em\/shoot 'em world of the mob. A thuggish money earner while de Niro is a rob'em through a fountain pen type. Uniquely, in my own viewing experience, they share voice-overs giving different spins on the same events.Despite being a thug I prefer Pesci because he is walking the only path that he knows.

The last is some pretty cool footage of stop and slow action scenes of traffic, crowds of people, and so on.  It begins with a rocket taking off and ends with the same rocket exploding.  (And no, it's not the Challenger, it's either a Delta III or a Centaur.)The images that had been fantastic twenty years ago seem tame today, especially after endless movies using film techniques far ahead of what this movie employed, and digital effects that didn't exist when filming started. As it is only a few scenes remain truly startling, several seem to have been done by amateur photographers--and considering how much is archival footage they probably were.What are we to make of this?  The general consensus is an environmental theme, that we have created a technological and ordered  world that will eventually destroy us--and being done in the Cold War pictures of atomic weapons figure prominently.  What is surprising is what's left out, we don't have the images you would expect of pollution or man's inhumanity to his own kind, or even the opposite of love or happiness.  (But lots of people staring uncomfortably at the camera.)We get a very elemental view of existence, that civilization itself is a life out of balance and our own technology is taking us over.  (In one of the film's best sequences a grid like city merges into a Landsat image and then into a electron microscope shot of a computer chip, and they really do look the same.)What the film does not provide is an answer--just what is a life in harmony, how do we find or restore balance?Unfortunately I don't think even the film makers know, and we're left to wonder.

Few movies can claim to have one of the greatest lines in the history of film; Fellini Satyricon can. Not the greatest movie by any means, but God bless it that line made me fall out of my chair. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie.Other than that, the movie is pretty much hit and miss. Well, not really miss, just more, well, hits with a dull effect. Or something. Fact is, this is by far one of the strangest films ever made, placing a camera in a time and place where a camera has no place being. Ancient Rome was decadent, as we all know, and Fellini puts us in the center of the decadence. We see Trimalchio's legendary dinner party in all its splendor, the murder of a Roman emperor, a battle with the Minotaur, and, most important of all, we see Encolpius' touching journey to get his groove back. I'd insert a Viagra joke, but I just don't have the energy.I found the film to be very watchable, simply because unless you've read Petronius' original version, you'll have no idea what's coming next, or why any of this is happening (I've read parts, so I sort of got it). Like Fellini's best films (this isn't one of them) after battling through an hour or so of pretentious weirdness you're forced to make a choice between walking out or letting go of your logic and desire to see a story. It's when you let go that Fellini grabs you. The fact is he's a masterful director, creating stunning compositions filled with designs worthy of master painters. The sets are absolutely incredible. And the music, mostly source music (or so we're lead to believe) is disturbing as all hell; Mr. Bungle fans should watch just for the Minotaur scene. You'll get a treat!Some might say the movie is pretentious, or that it lacks a clear plot. To them I say, well, yeah. Sorry. Don't go watching foreign films if you don't like pretentious and inexplicable. I agree that this isn't exactly Fellini's best work; it lacks the personal nature and beauty of La Dolce Vita and 8 1\/2. It has a few moments of mesmerizing transcendence, but just a few. But overall it was just weird enough to be enjoyable, and if you like Fellini or Roman literature, it's definitely worth seeing at some point.Two notes to the uninitiated in Fellini and\/or Roman culture 1. Yes, the dialogue is dubbed. That was the standard in Italian cinema at the time when Fellini was doing his best work. Yes, it is a tad annoying, but you'll have to get used to it to watch these films. It's not that big a deal. 2. Okay, in Rome, men enjoyed the sexual company of young boys. Yes, that is wrong and horrible viewed through 21st century eyes, but that's how it was in those days. Trying to apply modern morality to the sex you see in this film or in any depiction of Roman life is wasting your time; after all, the real perps have all been dead for about two millenia.

This kind of filmmaking is best suited for TV screens and THE HUNGER does play better on TV but it still doesn't change the fact that there's simply no story here.

Here we have one of the best couples in history, the odd couple themselves, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. We have a director who has brought us some silly, funny stuff. But Grumpy Old Men seems only to have silly stuff, and nothing really funny. As amusing as it might be to see old pals Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau mumbling, grumbling and bumbling around 24\/7, it gets a bit tiring. Perhaps with a stronger script the film could have sustained the feeling of warmth and humor that it set up in the beginning, but it seems that the story sets up the laughs, only to have them dissipate away before we can even smile. Seeing the men grumble constantly soon becomes irritable and boring due to the script by Mark Steven Johnson, of which seems to think that grumbling fills in for laughs.Walter Matthau (1920-2000) and Jack Lemmon (1925-2001) play two old men who constantly argue with each other, and who love to hate each other (or is it the other way around?). They fish together, yet at the same time seperately, every year. They live next to each other yet bicker continually. They like each other but pretend to despise each other. But things get really grumpy when both of the men fall in love with the exact same woman--a woman who just moved into their neighborhood and has immediately started to display interest in each of them. She rides her snowmobile around drawing attention to herself, and tries to lure the men into her web of love. Now the two old men will have another thing to be grumpy about until the whole thing is resolved, while, in the meantime, Lemmon's daughter, Daryl Hannah, starts to fall in love with Matthau's son, Kevin Pollack (these things will be sorted out in the sequel, Grumpier Old Men.).There are a few things I find hard to believe in this film. I find it hard to believe that Matthau and Lemmon's love interest in this film sees anything in these two old men, when they are about twice her age. With everyone in the neighborhood, she picks the two oldest men? I'm not a woman, so I have no idea about being attracted to other males--but if I were, I doubt I'd pick the oldest guys around. I can say that if I were to move into a neighborhood, I would not immediately look for the oldest women around.Another thing I find hard to believe is that Daryl Hannah would be attracted to Pollack's character after she sees him staring at her from across the street, from a window. In normal life that would be pretty freaky, and would end in the woman closing the curtains and calling the cops, but in Grumpy Old Men Land, it seems that odd, balding men staring at women through windows is attractive and sweet. Aw, how nice. In fact, if they had ever made another sequel to this film (Grumpiest Old Men), I see a possibilty in making Pollack's character a homicidal maniac who murders Hannah and then shoots himself. Call it a dream.Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are one of the best comedy pairings I've ever seen; after the success of The Odd Couple, it seems that filmmakers think that the charm of the film was a shouting match between the actors. But that isn't what made The Odd Couple.

Here we have one of the best couples in history, the odd couple themselves, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. We have a director who has brought us some silly, funny stuff. But Grumpy Old Men seems only to have silly stuff, and nothing really funny. As amusing as it might be to see old pals Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau mumbling, grumbling and bumbling around 24\/7, it gets a bit tiring. Perhaps with a stronger script the film could have sustained the feeling of warmth and humor that it set up in the beginning, but it seems that the story sets up the laughs, only to have them dissipate away before we can even smile. Seeing the men grumble constantly soon becomes irritable and boring due to the script by Mark Steven Johnson, of which seems to think that grumbling fills in for laughs.Walter Matthau (1920-2000) and Jack Lemmon (1925-2001) play two old men who constantly argue with each other, and who love to hate each other (or is it the other way around?). They fish together, yet at the same time seperately, every year. They live next to each other yet bicker continually. They like each other but pretend to despise each other. But things get really grumpy when both of the men fall in love with the exact same woman--a woman who just moved into their neighborhood and has immediately started to display interest in each of them. She rides her snowmobile around drawing attention to herself, and tries to lure the men into her web of love. Now the two old men will have another thing to be grumpy about until the whole thing is resolved, while, in the meantime, Lemmon's daughter, Daryl Hannah, starts to fall in love with Matthau's son, Kevin Pollack (these things will be sorted out in the sequel, Grumpier Old Men.).There are a few things I find hard to believe in this film. I find it hard to believe that Matthau and Lemmon's love interest in this film sees anything in these two old men, when they are about twice her age. With everyone in the neighborhood, she picks the two oldest men? I'm not a woman, so I have no idea about being attracted to other males--but if I were, I doubt I'd pick the oldest guys around. I can say that if I were to move into a neighborhood, I would not immediately look for the oldest women around.Another thing I find hard to believe is that Daryl Hannah would be attracted to Pollack's character after she sees him staring at her from across the street, from a window. In normal life that would be pretty freaky, and would end in the woman closing the curtains and calling the cops, but in Grumpy Old Men Land, it seems that odd, balding men staring at women through windows is attractive and sweet. Aw, how nice. In fact, if they had ever made another sequel to this film (Grumpiest Old Men), I see a possibilty in making Pollack's character a homicidal maniac who murders Hannah and then shoots himself. Call it a dream.Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are one of the best comedy pairings I've ever seen; after the success of The Odd Couple, it seems that filmmakers think that the charm of the film was a shouting match between the actors.

In this, our arch-capitalist who operates on such a god-like level of finance and irresponsible freedom is both like Godard's egregiously self-conscious Olympian film magnate, Mr. Prokosch, and like a sinister super-Raffles who has coldly repudiated the humanity of any emulation of the politically moralistic Robin Hood legend. He possesses more awful dignity than the first, and all the glamour of the last two figures. In terms of 1968, he is Che Guevara without a soul. He is in fact the Miltonic Angel of selfish materialism, who falls.The film works as if it was propaganda for the two amoral leads, but the objective perfection of the medium's relentless gaze eventually transforms our superficial admiration, for the expensively-dressed and produced- artifice, into critical distance.

Perhaps Jewison's greatest contribution to this film was in just letting Wexler, as his cameraman, parody so coolly the glamorous excess of power by means of his own greater understanding of the uses of such power?

Hal Ashby was considered one of the greatest directors during the mid 1970s. He edited the classic films In the Heat of the Night  and The Thomas Crown Affair and directed a string of quintessentials including the cult classic Harold and Maude, The Last Detail, Shampoo and Oscar winner Coming Home. It has been said that Ashby had a enormous passion for film, which drove him through the ranks of the Hollywood system from editor to director. Actors loved to work with the soft spoken and meticulous man, as he allowed freedom in which they could perform. Being There is a film like so many others from this period, depicting one character as an almost Christ- like figure, changing the lives of all he meets (others include One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, & Cool Hand Luke). `Chance' is a simple minded gardner, who can't read or write. He is let out into the world for the first time and similar to Forrest Gump, but on a much smaller scale, he experiences success and fame. Peter Sellers plays the part of `Chance'; Sellers died a year later from a cardiac arrest. His performance is one of his best, as he completely envelopes the character. Sellers should be called a movie actor as opposed to a movie star because he takes a script, and changes himself to fit the screenplay\/ character. Movie stars do the opposite. They change the script\/ character to fit them.When viewing Being There, you completely forget you are watching Peter Sellers and only think of him as `Chance'. The film has a very metered pace to it, which might turn some astray. But this film is directed by a great editor; once you fall into the rhythm of the film, you follow it without ever looking away. Ashby took a chance with this movie both on a financial level and with the story. The film is based on a novel, and it is always hard to adapt book for the screen. The film could have been ridiculous and cheesy, but the moments that have the possibility of being unreasonable or melodramatic are natural and charming. The film is one of Ashby's best. It is an extremely enchanting story and the film covers a wide spectrum of genres including comedy, drama, and even political\/ social satire (a culture of people who know nothing but what's on television). Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is breath taking, Peter Sellers gives a performance of a lifetime, and Shirley MacClain is also fantastic as the lonely and misunderstood wife. Melvyn Douglas is charming as the dying millionaire, and Jack Warden, who was in practically every film from the seventies, does a grea job as the rather lethargic president. Ashby would eventually fall into a pattern of self destructive narcotics abuse which effected him both personally and professionally. His films after Being There, are rather weak and uneven.

It lasted for many years, eventually culminating in the Napoleonic Wars and the Empire Waist dress.  It is surprising to the serious student of history that three causative factors were implicated, as the screenplay for the Affair of the Necklace alone is surely sufficient cause to put a few assorted heads on the block.The Affair of the Necklace involves a historical scandal in the court of Marie Antoinette. Hilary Swank plays a young woman in a marriage of convenience to Adrien Brody's character, who feels her ancestral lands and family name were unjustly seized and taken from her by the French crown. She thinks if she can get to court and lay her tragic history before Queen Marie Antoinette, that the Queen's feminine heart will be moved by her plight. So, she marries the Compte de la Motte in order to get a title which will admit her to court. Marrying Adrian Brody has to rank right up there with La Gwyneth's marriage to Colin Firth in SIL on the all-time Top 10 ranking of Least Odious Arranged Marriages of Convenience in Motion Picture History.There's a lot of skullduggery involving licentious, ambitious Cardinals, jewelers who never hit on the fruity scheme of busting up an unsold necklace they were seriously in hock for making and selling off the diamonds individually, and a very odd charlatan psychic type mesmerist\/seer played by the preternaturally-creepy Christopher Walken.I could tell you more, but why? This movie is beautifully-photographed, lavishly costumed, and by and large, dreadfully acted, edited, and directed. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad Hilary Swank is in it. The 1,000 word limit precludes that entirely.  And as for editing, when your cuts cause characters heads to jump around in the frame, that's bad.I didn't expect much, though, since from the very get-go, the movie violated Surreyhill's First Law of Bad Historical Costume Drama If the Dogs are wrong, forget the rest. They give Marie Antoinette a Chinese Crested as a lap dog, which is a big gaffe, since the first Cresteds were first brought to Europe in the mid 1850's, and this was to England, as part of a zoological exhibition. But then, I think that the Cresteds weren't the only members of the cast who were chosen for their interesting and unusual looks, as opposed to their actual suitability to play the part.The Cast is pretty high-octane for a movie that basically bombed at the box office and garnered lukewarm reviews. Christopher Walken is joined by Swank and Brody, and let us not forget Jonathon Pryce. Simon Baker is appealing in a beige pantyhose sort of way as the hero, but when your hero is a gigolo who hopes to personally profit from the sale of what is essentially stolen property, you are entering interesting territory, particularly if your lipliner also wanders around a bit, as Baker's does. The problem with Baker is that he seemed to have great difficult taking his lines seriously, and one can see why. There are some real clunkers in this movie, and also, it relies heavily on voiceover narration to make the plot comprehensible, and this is another sign a movie is in big trouble. It violates almost every rule of show, don't tell.I was disgruntled to find much time elapsed before first appearance of Adrian Brody. However, he does play The Compte and Surreyhill's Second Corollary of bodice-ripping clearly states that any male character under 45 who has the title of Compte de ________ is to be considered sexy, whether villainous or heroic, as Comptes are by definition, sexy.This Compte mutters his lines in a weird method hybrid of Brando and Queens, while the rest of the cast is assuming an English accent, which causes cognitive dissonance, since the movie is set in France and stars mostly Americans.Brody certainly does his best to kick some life into the plot, and he and Walken seem to be the only cast members who seem to have copped to the notion that they AREN'T in a serious, art-house type film which will accrue numerous Oscar nods, but that they are instead in the cheesiest of cheesy historical bodice-rippers and may as well have a bit of fun with it. There is little to ponder for most of the first third of the movie other than Simon Baker's neatly-tied queue, until this interesting and unusual-looking man shows up and starts waving a sword around.  Apparently, there is some sort of rule in this movie that all fights must be Shirts\/Skins, and in the case of the first duel, Simon Baker is shirtless while Brody is dressed to thrill.But unfortunately for those of us who would prefer an extended shirts\/skins dueling sequence, the plot grinds on and the necklace is put into play, and the Compte ends up being chased through the streets of Paris by a flatfooted officer of the guard. This has to be the lamest, most unathletic chase scene I've ever seen filmed. It also points up one of the main problems with the film, which is that some of the characters just were all over the map. The Compte has gone from being a agile hot-tempered duelist--quick to pull out his blade and make use of it, to an ineffectual drunk effete decadent, to a clever schemer, and now he is a man who cannot seem to get out of his own way, or out of the way of horses, fruitcarts, and peasants holding baskets of veggies. He finally escapes by jumping into a canal, or the Seine, or something, and presumably, this was in the days of open sewers, so the next place we encounter him is getting out of his bathtub claiming that he was so frightened he nearly soiled himself. He is bathing, moreover, in the presence of both his wife and her lover, Simon Baker. They're just all one big happy family of co-conspirators. Well, except that the Compte gets angered at some crack the lover makes about his manhood (they both mumbled their way through it as though both were embarrassed by the script so for all I know he was saying that the Compte's father was a hamster, and his mother smelt of elderberries), morphs into a dripping-wet, homicidal, Cesare Borgia clone, and goes after Simon Baker with a knife in one hand, while holding a towel around his waist with the other. I found it a bit tragic that the only conveniently-located weapon was a knife, and not a two-handed weapon, like a grenade launcher or Scottish claymore, for reasons that should be obvious, but the movie kept its R rating, I guess.One more observation from my notebook--the filmmakers seemed to have the idea that they needed to establish the Compte's Character by having him be either drinking, holding a glass of some sort of alcoholic beverage as if about to take a drink, reaching for a bottle, or going over to the sidebar to fill himself a glass in every scene. Yes, even the scene in the towel. Even when he is riding a horse, for the love of all mercy! Even when he is eating a bon bon. Even when he is having a bullet extracted from his hiney. The only real exception was when he was going after the gigolo with the knife, as it would clearly have been difficult to hold a drink, the knife, AND the towel without dribbling Beaujolais down all over his, er, without getting it all over the front of his towel.

","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 2003","score":"53 out of 75 people found the following review useful","review":"  Napoleon once said that the French Revolution was caused by The Seven Years War, the Phylloxera grapevine fungus, and The Affair of the Necklace.  It lasted for many years, eventually culminating in the Napoleonic Wars and the Empire Waist dress.  It is surprising to the serious student of history that three causative factors were implicated, as the screenplay for the Affair of the Necklace alone is surely sufficient cause to put a few assorted heads on the block.The Affair of the Necklace involves a historical scandal in the court of Marie Antoinette. Hilary Swank plays a young woman in a marriage of convenience to Adrien Brody's character, who feels her ancestral lands and family name were unjustly seized and taken from her by the French crown. She thinks if she can get to court and lay her tragic history before Queen Marie Antoinette, that the Queen's feminine heart will be moved by her plight. So, she marries the Compte de la Motte in order to get a title which will admit her to court. Marrying Adrian Brody has to rank right up there with La Gwyneth's marriage to Colin Firth in SIL on the all-time Top 10 ranking of Least Odious Arranged Marriages of Convenience in Motion Picture History.There's a lot of skullduggery involving licentious, ambitious Cardinals, jewelers who never hit on the fruity scheme of busting up an unsold necklace they were seriously in hock for making and selling off the diamonds individually, and a very odd charlatan psychic type mesmerist\/seer played by the preternaturally-creepy Christopher Walken.I could tell you more, but why? This movie is beautifully-photographed, lavishly costumed, and by and large, dreadfully acted, edited, and directed. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad Hilary Swank is in it. The 1,000 word limit precludes that entirely.  And as for editing, when your cuts cause characters heads to jump around in the frame, that's bad.I didn't expect much, though, since from the very get-go, the movie violated Surreyhill's First Law of Bad Historical Costume Drama If the Dogs are wrong, forget the rest. They give Marie Antoinette a Chinese Crested as a lap dog, which is a big gaffe, since the first Cresteds were first brought to Europe in the mid 1850's, and this was to England, as part of a zoological exhibition. But then, I think that the Cresteds weren't the only members of the cast who were chosen for their interesting and unusual looks, as opposed to their actual suitability to play the part.The Cast is pretty high-octane for a movie that basically bombed at the box office and garnered lukewarm reviews. Christopher Walken is joined by Swank and Brody, and let us not forget Jonathon Pryce. Simon Baker is appealing in a beige pantyhose sort of way as the hero, but when your hero is a gigolo who hopes to personally profit from the sale of what is essentially stolen property, you are entering interesting territory, particularly if your lipliner also wanders around a bit, as Baker's does. The problem with Baker is that he seemed to have great difficult taking his lines seriously, and one can see why. There are some real clunkers in this movie, and also, it relies heavily on voiceover narration to make the plot comprehensible, and this is another sign a movie is in big trouble. It violates almost every rule of show, don't tell.I was disgruntled to find much time elapsed before first appearance of Adrian Brody. However, he does play The Compte and Surreyhill's Second Corollary of bodice-ripping clearly states that any male character under 45 who has the title of Compte de ________ is to be considered sexy, whether villainous or heroic, as Comptes are by definition, sexy.This Compte mutters his lines in a weird method hybrid of Brando and Queens, while the rest of the cast is assuming an English accent, which causes cognitive dissonance, since the movie is set in France and stars mostly Americans.Brody certainly does his best to kick some life into the plot, and he and Walken seem to be the only cast members who seem to have copped to the notion that they AREN'T in a serious, art-house type film which will accrue numerous Oscar nods, but that they are instead in the cheesiest of cheesy historical bodice-rippers and may as well have a bit of fun with it. There is little to ponder for most of the first third of the movie other than Simon Baker's neatly-tied queue, until this interesting and unusual-looking man shows up and starts waving a sword around.  Apparently, there is some sort of rule in this movie that all fights must be Shirts\/Skins, and in the case of the first duel, Simon Baker is shirtless while Brody is dressed to thrill.But unfortunately for those of us who would prefer an extended shirts\/skins dueling sequence, the plot grinds on and the necklace is put into play, and the Compte ends up being chased through the streets of Paris by a flatfooted officer of the guard. This has to be the lamest, most unathletic chase scene I've ever seen filmed. It also points up one of the main problems with the film, which is that some of the characters just were all over the map. The Compte has gone from being a agile hot-tempered duelist--quick to pull out his blade and make use of it, to an ineffectual drunk effete decadent, to a clever schemer, and now he is a man who cannot seem to get out of his own way, or out of the way of horses, fruitcarts, and peasants holding baskets of veggies. He finally escapes by jumping into a canal, or the Seine, or something, and presumably, this was in the days of open sewers, so the next place we encounter him is getting out of his bathtub claiming that he was so frightened he nearly soiled himself. He is bathing, moreover, in the presence of both his wife and her lover, Simon Baker. They're just all one big happy family of co-conspirators. Well, except that the Compte gets angered at some crack the lover makes about his manhood (they both mumbled their way through it as though both were embarrassed by the script so for all I know he was saying that the Compte's father was a hamster, and his mother smelt of elderberries), morphs into a dripping-wet, homicidal, Cesare Borgia clone, and goes after Simon Baker with a knife in one hand, while holding a towel around his waist with the other. I found it a bit tragic that the only conveniently-located weapon was a knife, and not a two-handed weapon, like a grenade launcher or Scottish claymore, for reasons that should be obvious, but the movie kept its R rating, I guess.One more observation from my notebook--the filmmakers seemed to have the idea that they needed to establish the Compte's Character by having him be either drinking, holding a glass of some sort of alcoholic beverage as if about to take a drink, reaching for a bottle, or going over to the sidebar to fill himself a glass in every scene. Yes, even the scene in the towel. Even when he is riding a horse, for the love of all mercy! Even when he is eating a bon bon. Even when he is having a bullet extracted from his hiney. The only real exception was when he was going after the gigolo with the knife, as it would clearly have been difficult to hold a drink, the knife, AND the towel without dribbling Beaujolais down all over his, er, without getting it all over the front of his towel. And yet, the character is never actually shown as being sloppy drunk, despite drinking continuously from morning to night.Clearly, our Compte has a head like a cast iron skillet.
