[{"date":"27 June 1999","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  When filmmakers portray the American South, cliche reigns supreme. The ghosts of Margaret Mitchell and Tenessee Williams seem to hover over every scriptwriter's shoulder. Even those who write from personal experience are unable to resist the sleepy small town with its overbearing patriarchs and matriarchs, too much boozing, illicit liasions, dark family secrets, highly sexed youth and complaisant local cops and other officials keeping a lid on things. The whole thing is usually redolent with the feeling that Tiyam Has Parsed Theis Playce\/ Culture By. Not to mention of course the Race Question.In this comedy (alternatively billed as a murder mystery)  written by Anne Rapp and set in Holly Springs, a small (mythical) Mississippi cotton town, Robert Altman is able to combine all these ingredients to produce an entertaining story with a light satirical touch. Yet it is one in which it is possible to feel some empathy with the characters, who rise above the cardboard cut-out. For Altman it's a fairly straightforward piece though he uses some of the cross-cutting techniques that were so effectively used by him in films such as Nashville. Altman knows how to put a whole village on film without the audience losing track of the story or the main players.As Cookie, the matriarch still mourning her beloved late husband Buck, Patricia Neal with her gorgeous gravelly voice is spellbinding. Unfortunately, the story requires her to depart fairly early, but there are plenty of other characters to entertain us. There is Cookie's middle-aged black retainer and friend Willis (Charles Dutton), who regularly steals pints of Wild Turkey from behind the counter at a local bar and just as regularly furtively returns them. There are Cookie's two nieces Camille and Cora, (Glenn Close and Julianne Moore) one a harridan, the other an emotional basket case, still, in their 40s, sleeping in the same room and saying their nightly prayers together. There is Emily (Liv Tyler of Stealing Beauty), young, beautiful, feisty and independent, and her male bimbo policeman boyfriend (Chris O'Donnell - almost too dumb to be true but very funny). There is a host of minor characters including Lester, the old cop who has seen it all and whose great passion in life is fishing (Ned Beatty), and the canny old lawyer Palmer (Donald Moffat) who is wise in the ways of the Southern gentry and Southern cops.The story doesn't matter much except that it involves a suicide, an attempt to disguise it as murder, and a local church group's production of Oscar Wilde's Salome. It does end with a few surprises. More interesting is the characters and they way they rub up against each other. The South evoked is a sort of sleepy New South. Women as well as blacks have been released from slavery - Emily is a very modern miss. Blacks themselves are into the power structure at last - the most senior and powerful policeman portrayed is black. Willis the retainer is treated as an equal by his mistress and by the other white folk in town. Yet the catfish are still biting, the climate still humid and soporific and the way of life still languid. The New South is like the Old South, but with some of the nastiness removed. However this is a movie to be avoided if you do not wish to know how catfish are gutted.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"27 June 1999","score":"","review":"  Liar Liar may not be a new movie, but it's definitely one of those comically genius films that you just can't pass up. So, I want to review this movie for anyone who may have overlooked this flick when it first came out. If you did, you missed a real treat.Tom Shadyac whom you may remember from movies like Patch Adams, The Nutty Professor, and Ace Ventura directed this comedy. You know this guy has had some experience in comedies. He directed the movie that gave Jim Carrey his big break as the notorious Ace Ventura. The main characters are Fletcher (Jim Carrey), Max (Justin Cooper), and Audrey (Maura Tierney). They all have impressive acting talent that is displayed brilliantly throughout this film.The plot goes something like this Jim Carrey plays the part of Fletcher, a lawyer and failing father who deals with the recent divorce of Audrey, played by Maura Tierney. Fletcher gets the biggest case of his career, but his son Max makes a wish on his birthday that his dad couldn't tell a lie for a whole day. It comes true of course. Well, that turns Fletcher's world upside down, as you can imagine, because he is a scumbag lawyer who makes a living at lying. The whole movie takes over a period of just two or three days of him dealing with the fact that he can't lie.The storyline is totally original and well thought out. I 'busted a gut' laughing, and this movie didn't give me very many breaks in between bursts of tear jerking laughter. Jim Carrey was the absolute best actor for the part as the untruthful lawyer. I don't see how anyone else could physically match Jim Carrey's comically genius body language. It all seems to come naturally to him. He probably acts like that in real everyday life. This would have to be one of, if not the best, Jim Carrey Movie.That's enough about Carrey. Justin Cooper is a young kid who does a surprisingly good job of playing the cute little five-year-old son. You kind of feel sorry for the little guy when his dad stands him up on his birthday when he promised to be there. Maura Tierney's character (Audrey) is very natural. She can make you feel that she is a real person compared to her totally opposite and whacked ex-husband. Audrey's dorky boyfriend does a good job at being, well,&#133; a dork. By the time you are introduced to this character you really start to hate him, but that's what the director wants you to do. The screenplay and sound are very well done and extremely comical. The words slip off Jim Carrey's lips as easily as anything. The way he carries himself throughout the film makes you wonder if he wasn't some kind of monkey in a past life. I can't tell you how many times he falls over in this movie! He'll have you saying catchy lines like It was me! and That's just something ugly people say. Or maybe you would like this line Here goes, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit a Chevy, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes at a crosswalk, I changed lanes without signaling, while running a red light and speeding! or maybe not.There are many great scenes in this movie so it's hard to pick a favorite. I would have to say that my absolute 'fave' would have to be the witty scene where he tries to lie and say that the pen is red when it is actually blue. I can't describe in words how funny that scene was but just the way that he screams The pen is&#133;Bluuuee!! is just hilarious. There are practically no special effects in Liar Liar  but there are many outrageous stunts performed in Jim Carrey's place. I was surprised at all the stunt doubles I saw in the titles at the end of the movie.I really liked this movie a lot and it will be on my classic comedy list from now on. The only faulty part of the movie is the bad or crass language used in various parts of the flick. It's not over the edge with cursing in every other sentence but it does bother me a bit.This movie even has a strong moral to it. Lying to just get yourself ahead in life hurts others and will eventually catch up and hurt you. In one scene Fletcher is practicing the witness interview with his client and the client says something like, Oh, all we have to do is lie, that's easy. Then he realizes that what they are doing is wrong, and he can't ask the question if he knows it's a lie. Throughout the movie Fletcher learns a major lesson in dealing with life, and goes through a major morality change. I really liked how the movie sticks that moral issue in and makes you think. 'Cuz' a little white lie is the same as a big whoper if you think about it.If you can get over the language and get to the core of this awesome movie I think you would love it, except for you strange few who don't like Jim Carrey. (You know who you are!) Maybe you should give him another try, I promise you will enjoy yourself.

Like Mighty Joe Young, however, this film suffers from several structural flaws and a few crucial character bloopers that make this journey into the jungle stand far from becoming a memorable Disney experience.Tarzan is the story of a young couple and their baby boy who, while sailing at sea, encounter a disastrous event and become shipwrecked on a large tropical island. They adapt to the new climate and build a massive tree house to for themselves to live in.However, they are not the only family living on that island. For a group of wild gorilla's are active nearby.

In Tarzan, the first problem is the shipwreck, and the solution is the family building a tree house. There you have it, enough for an entire movie in itself. Why not detail the family's adventures stranded on a tropical island over the years instead of almost immediately creating an internal problem, the leader of the gorilla pack is against the new family member; Tarzan. Then, how about the boy's problem's with his differences from the rest of his family another internal problem--one that isn't meant to be solved. The relationship with Jane, another internal problem, will Jane stay with Tarzan or will Tarzan leave with Jane? And with all else happening, the filmmakers had to throw in a villain Clayton. See what we are dealing with here, one of these stories is enough, but we need not to see every one of them in full, for I was baffled at this film's childish yet complicated plot.The only reason why the above fault didn't totally wreak this movie is because each of the mini-movies is connected with somewhat of a through-line, a basis for story telling that connects events together. Tarzan smartly conceives a firm plot in which one happening leads to another.Another problem with the film is the villain, Clayton, who has no characteristics about him that make him overly nasty, aggressive, evil or memorable.

The scenes where Tarzan surfs though the trees and swings on stretchy vines are wonderful.

But if you want to see a movie with high standards and true morals go see Instinct, which like Tarzan details a character who feels different from the rest of us.

But if you want to see a movie with high standards and true morals go see Instinct, which like Tarzan details a character who feels different from the rest of us. But unlike Tarzan, that film was precise in it characters, plot, and  concepts for that it is possible to live in harmony with a different species. Tarzan only delivers the stale wish that there are answers out there.  ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"27 June 1999","score":"","review":" Fatherhood, it has its happy moments and very frustrating ones, especially for a goofball who is still a kid himself. That is what Big Daddy is all about, or maybe it's a how to guide on how not to raise a kid. Either way it has the right ingredients for a good comedy flick. Directed by Dennis Dugan (Who also directed Happy Gilmore) , Big Daddy is another winner on Adam Sandler's Part.  He definitely outshines his last quirky character as Bobby Bouche in The Water Boy. In this movie he seems to act more like his regular funny self, unlike the farfetched character of Bobby. Big Daddy reminds me more of Billy Madison where he interacts with little kids and acts like one himself. In fact, you may recognize the actor who plays the social worker in Big Daddy. He was also in Billy Madison playing the elementary school principle. You will also recognize Kevin who is played by Jon Stewart, the host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central. I hear Adam Sandler and Jon Stewart are best buds. The story goes something like this Sonny (Adam Sandler) finds a five-year-old kid at his doorstep named Julian. (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) This kid is supposedly the unknown son of his roommate Kevin. (Jon Stewart) Sonny ends up falling for Julian's cuteness and tells the social workers that he is Kevin and Julian is his son, which is totally false of course. Sonny agrees to take care of the boy until the social services can find a foster family for Julian. Well, he ends up liking cute little Julian and wants to be his father to impress his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson) who threatens to leave Sonny because of his lack of responsibility and a decent job. She ends up leaving anyway to be with some sixty-year-old because he has goals and has made something out of his life. Yeah whatever, just wait till you see what Adam Sandler says about that in the movie. (No I won't tell you, you will just have to go see the movie.) The rest of the movie is all about Sonny trying to keep and take care of Julian while also trying to win over his new love interest, the sister of his roommate's fiancé. Sonny seems to be sort of a loser guy and doesn't have a real job. His roommate seems to be a successful guy. He has a great job, his life is going somewhere, and he gets engaged on his birthday. This just leaves Sonny dreaming about the good ol' days. He works one day a week at a tollbooth. He supports himself with the money he got from suing a cab driver that ran over his foot. For one night of agony the judge thought it was worth $200,000. His Dad thinks of him as a failure and a disgrace to the family and his girlfriend leaves him because his life was heading nowhere. But that all changes once Sonny meets little Julian. Sonny has a very different approach to being a parent in the beginning of the movie. His theory (And I'm not lying) is let the kid do whatever he wants and eventually he will learn to pick the correct choice. Sonny blames fathers for all the messed up people in the world because they were too strict. I think it is actually the opposite, but that's Sonny's opinion. So in the beginning of the movie he lets Julian Pick whatever he wants. Julian changes his name to Frankenstein, eats ketchup for lunch, and wears huge boots with his underwear on over his shorts. It doesn't take long for Sonny to realize that his theory is incorrect, especially when he discovers that Julian, or Frankenstein, chose not to take a bath for a week straight. Then he decides to get a little more serious about this Daddy business. While watching the end credits I discovered that two people, Cole Sprouse and Dylan Sprouse, played Julian's character. You guessed it, the director pulled the twins trick on me again. I never even noticed.  Uh Oh! I'm getting flashbacks of Mary Kate and Ashley again. I hope they stop soon. Anyway, the kids did a satisfying job. They tried to make the Julian Character as cute as possible. Playing Julian's character would be very easy I would imagine. He hardly says anything during the whole movie. He just says various phrases like, I have to go to the bathroom, Are you my Daddy, and I can wipe my own a$$ His character has to be cute, very cute. He also seems to have some sort of a bladder problem. He urinates countless times during the movie and in various places like his bed, behind buildings, and on trees. Adam Sandler did an excellent job of course and so did Jon Stewart. I was a little disappointed in Sonny's new girlfriend though, her character just didn't flow well and she had a terrible voice. That doesn't hurt the movie very much. It's tolerable. Steve Franks did the movie's writing and story. He does a great job of putting good lines in the movie and adding goofy characters to give the movie a certain flavor. Like the old man at the bar who always tries to pick fights with Sonny and calls him a woman. He gets beat up every time of course but he's always thirsty for more. Then there's the deliveryman who stops and hangs out at Sonny's house every day. He has a strange accent and can't read. There's also the homeless man who keeps popping up at just the right time in the movie to deliver a good chuckle. There are many others, which show the great screen writing for this movie. There are all these good lines in the movie but I have a hard time remembering them all.I would have given the movie a better rating, but I didn't really like the ending. I was expecting it to end in a certain happy way but it didn't. The movie surprised me and had an ending that was different and not so happy. It wasn't a sad ending, but it wasn't the happiest ending either. It was semi happy. You will understand what I mean if you see the movie. I guess Dennis Dugan, the director, wanted to be different than everybody else and go against the flow. He didn't want to give you what you would expect. I guess you could call it artistic, but the audience might not like his artistic approach. We will see. Big Daddy does have a theme to it. Parents have a huge role in the lives of their children and it's their responsibility to teach them how to be responsible adults. It shows that being a parent is not an easy job. You have to teach kids right from wrong and spend a substantial amount of your time with them. Parents have to use every trick up their sleeve to raise a kid or kids. In the end it is worth it and you will be rewarded with a great family. All in all Big Daddy was an excellent movie despite its ending and other little complaints. I watched the movie to get a big laugh and I did. So, in my book this movie was a great success. Let's just see how Big Daddy can fare against other comedies that have come out recently like Austin Powers and Noting Hill. I really liked this movie, but considering I'm a total Adam Sandler fan you might not feel the same about it. I don't think you have to be a Sandler fan to enjoy this one. Trust me, it delivers the laughs. It's very creative and, well, it's just funny.

Professional critics seemed not to notice, or not to care, that the best woman in this film is one who gives up absolutely everything to be with her man, including a college education.Even if Dermot Mulroney was the most handsome, fascinating man on the planet--which he's not, unfortunately; his casting is the other crucial mistake in this film--I wouldn't like the idea of Cameron Diaz quitting school to marry him. Especially when Julia Roberts' character is presented as a selfish fool who lost the perfect man because she didn't want to be tied down.A much better approach would have been for Mulroney to also realize that he needs to make some compromises, too, that although he has a right to expect a woman to give up *some* things for love, he shouldn't expect her to sacrifice everything. Couldn't Mulroney have settled in Chicago for two years or so until Diaz finished her degree? Then they could travel to their heart's content.But I suppose it doesn't matter, in this story, if Mulroney gets hit by a bus and leaves a young wife with no secondary education. She wouldn't have to take some horrendously low-paying job, she could just go back to Daddy's money. Hogan seems to prefer the idea that women should be cute and dependent, surprising after the strong heroine of his Muriel's Wedding.That aside, My Best Friend's Wedding is a fairly well-executed movie, with the exception of Mulroney's character. Poorly dressed and wandering through many scenes with a slack expression and his mouth hanging dully open, you wonder if he and the director were *trying* to make the character look stupid. There is no way on Earth that two beautiful women, one rich, the other highly successful, would fight tooth and nail for him. Cameron Diaz shines all the brighter for being next to Mulroney; in fact, her performance is the only one that doesn't pale next to Rupert Everett's.Everett is, of course, marvelous. His scenes have so much more panache and energy than the rest, and the dialogue is so much better, that I wonder if he didn't ad-lib a good many of his lines. Julia Roberts also does well, but she appears a bit low-class next to Everett. Especially when she rips loose with that braying, donkey-laugh of hers--I know it's one of her trademarks, but it's like fingernails on a blackboard to me.

Professional critics seemed not to notice, or not to care, that the best woman in this film is one who gives up absolutely everything to be with her man, including a college education.Even if Dermot Mulroney was the most handsome, fascinating man on the planet--which he's not, unfortunately; his casting is the other crucial mistake in this film--I wouldn't like the idea of Cameron Diaz quitting school to marry him. Especially when Julia Roberts' character is presented as a selfish fool who lost the perfect man because she didn't want to be tied down.A much better approach would have been for Mulroney to also realize that he needs to make some compromises, too, that although he has a right to expect a woman to give up *some* things for love, he shouldn't expect her to sacrifice everything.

This time, he steps down from the directorial podium to allow Wolfgang Petersen to take control, and continues a streak he has had in the 90's that is unlike any other star from this decade. His next triumph is called In the Line of Fire.Clint reprises his Dirty Harry-type character as Frank Horrigan, a retired Secret Service agent who performs free-lance investigations on the side, assisted by partner Al (Dylan McDermott). When a mysterious caller who is attempting to assassinate the president (Oscar-nominee John Malkovich, in an intelligently evil performance) sets off Horrigan's overreactive intuition, Frank asks to be assigned to the advance team once again. Rene Russo is also along for the ride as a female agent, one who is turned off by Frank at first, but later takes a shine to him.Malkovich, whom I've always thought as one of the most accomplished supporting actors we have working today, plays this deranged assassin to a tee. He is a frightening character, not so much for his creepy voice on the phone, but because of his challenging intellect and how he uses it to Eastwood's disadvantage. He's one of those villains that is so entertaining but so hated at the same time. We become quite familiar with him by the end of the film, but still cannot crack the mystery that overrides his persona. In many ways, it is a brilliant performance, close to the situation, but also maintaining that edge of impersonality.Even though we recognize Eastwood as again immortalizing that Harry Callahan image in this film, he is still far outside that classic image at the same time. Frank Horrigan is craggy and arrogant, but still very likable and gallant. He is not always ticked off, but often with a kind disposition, sometimes becoming scared from Malkovich's threats as well as from his own personal demons. The suggestion that Horrigan was present on the Secret Service when Kennedy was killed surprisingly does not seem like a cultural whitewash here, but rather a moment in Frank's life that left him to question what his life would have been like if he had thoroughly done his job and saved JFK's life. This leads us to better understand his ambitious will to catch Malkovich, and as a result, attempt to find meaning again in his lonely life. Clint Eastwood's performance in this newer film may resemble Harry Callahan somewhat, but this portrayal is more calculated and overall more deeply felt.This is a thriller involving great minds and careful pacing rather than a lot of shooting. There are a couple of good action sequences in the film, but the real excitement comes from the cat-and-mouse game that Eastwood and Malkovich face off in. I have no idea what the real Secret Service thought of this picture and how it reflected their organization, but I believe they would have admired it just for how much In the Line of Fire focuses on dignity and taut investigation, instead of a bunch of would-be police officers with a prestigious individual to protect. Clint Eastwood shows us that after the glow of Oscar and at the age of 63, he can still keep on the cutting edge of great filmmaking. Rating Four stars.

The plot deals with the emotional turmoil of Beth and Pat Cappadora after their son, Ben, goes missing at Beth's high school reunion. The chief failure of the movie is in the screenplay - simply, too many stories are told in The Deep End of the Ocean.  Schiff (who adapted Lolita for the screen) does not focus the story on Beth or Pat or Ben or Vincent and a mish mash of incomplete vignettes is the result.  The characters are rather stereotypical, having little motivation behind their frequent emotional externalisations. Similarly, the confrontations between the family members in the rarely display the consequences that would naturally follow such arguments - the scene where the Cappadoras debate where Ben should spend Thanksgiving are never resolved - and events tie up a little too neatly at the end of the 105-minute movie. Ulu Grosbard has established a good name with films like Straight Time (1978) and Georgia (1996), but shows a lack of sensitivity in the pacing of scenes in The Deep End of the Ocean.  The first section, where Ben is kidnapped and the Cappadoras search for him is uneven and seems overlong, almost like a film in itself.  The second section is better, steadily building towards the climax of the film.  It is this section that will use up the tissues - although this is as a result of gross emotional manipulation, more typical of those Hallmark television movies than a large budget Hollywood tearjerker.

Williams provides good support for Pfeiffer, matching her well as the equally suffering husband. Goldberg, as the detective who handles the case, gives a standout performance in an almost-a-cameo role.  Kapelos likewise provides a solid characterisation as Ben's foster father. The children in the movie are also unusually good - perhaps too good, as they all appear rather articulate about their unusual situation. Jackson is, by turns, strong and sensitive as the older son and Alexa Vega is fine as the younger daughter.

If you didn't like 2001, wondering aloud what the heck you just saw, I suggest you do see 2010 since you'll love the directness of the workmanlike treatment.It's not a a put-down - it's just that the styles are so completely different that you have to consider the messenger as much as the message. 2001 was visionary in nearly every sense the word has -- it threw out the concept of the narrative (visual or otherwise) in an attempt to make you reach your own, personal conclusion of what happened. Rebirth? Ascension? Some Nietche-ish evolution to a superman? You tell me -- 2001 expects quite a lot from the viewer that 2010 would much rather even mention.By comparison, 2010 is very much an old-fashioned Hollywood movie. It explains *everything*, step by step, and includes a Roy Scheider voice-over to help thread the small gaps in time between scenes together. The voice over is often beyond silly - it's in the lyric of a series of emails from Heywood to his wife who, it should be noted, is fearful for her husband's safety. Any spouse sitting through a reading of the atmosphere braking technique will probably not sleep for weeks. Any husband who could write that deserves a slap for scaring the beegeezus out of her.2010 is not a strong film - frankly, it's quite derivative. It's visual sensibilities leech directly into Alien while inside the spacecraft (from the control buttons and displays on the Russian craft, to the lighting of the of EVA room as Baskin and Lithgow take their walk to Discovery, to the smoky atmosphere in the interiors when discussing the troubles at home). Outside, Hyams tries and is successful in the sense of scope and grandeur of space, and out pitiful size in relation to the course of the Universe. While he apes Kubrick, probably to establish a sense of continuity between the two films, he is at his best in the action scenes as the Leanov (sp?) enters Jupiter space. Either way, you watch this movie and get the feeling you've seen it all before.To be fair, Scheider is very good in his role of Heywood Floyd, that is if you dismiss the style of the previous occupant of that role, William Sylvester, as only a Kubrick mannequin. Again, the camps are divided -- I believe I understand the tact Kubrick chose to take, the sense of human alienation and evolutionary boredom, and while 2010 puts real people in space and makes the voyage to the stars more human, this wasn't the goal of Kubrick. Kubrick wanted to show man at a spiritual, cultural and evolutionary dead-end, and so human reactions (like 2001's Bowman going after HAL) only escape from people as their vestiges of civilization fail them. Different approaches, different movies. So why compare them? Well, life's just not fair, now is it?If you really don't need to compare the two, you can enjoy 2010.

It's one of those movies that you find while flipping through the channels on TV and it just takes you back in time when you were young. BTILC is just one of those movies that does that. In this great film, you'll encounter mystical Chinese magic, great martial arts, corny acting, excellent lines by cast, and goofy gunplay. Jack Burton (Russell) makes this film. He has all the best lines and come backs that you'll ever hear around. And Wang (Dun) is the best side kick that there has been in a long time. But I have to say that the powerful Lo Pan (Wong) steals the show. Whether he be in 'Ten Foot Tall Road Block' or 'Little Old Basket Case on Wheels' mode, He makes the perfect villain. Heck this movies got so much crazyness going on in it, even the some of the most popular video games\/movies around have copied ideas straight out of the movie! One guess...Mortal Kombat. Yep almost all the characters where ripped off from this cool film. Take Shang Tsung= Lo Pan (both old and younger versions), Johnny Cage= Jack Burton (both show off and try to get the girl), Raiden> Lightning (one of the three storms, an exact rip off), Lu Kang= Wang Chi (determined man searching for revenge), and even the orange beast thing at the end of the film, Street Fighter copied this one for Blanka!(Did they think nobody would know?)

It`s the movie that made a breakthrough in the horror genre in the 90`s, and it`s just a shame that churned out so many mediocre clones, including it`s own sequel. I didn`t really have high expectations for Scream 2, I estimated that it would be a reasonbly good follow-up, but nothing special. After I viewed it, I was quite disappointed. Scream 2 lacks a lot of the first Scream`s virtues, including cleverness and suspense, and even though there were some traces of those qualities,( with the exception of irony, which was quite well done) it felt like they were just recycled from before. Don`t get me wrong, there a few moments that are scary, but it`s shock value doesn`t do much for the overall movie. The reunion between some of the principal characters were cheesy, and they got old very fast. None of them seemed to have the same zest as they did in the first one, not even the most eccentric ones. Also, a lot of the death scenes were very unbelievable, people get butchered in broad daylight and on public streets and still nobody seems to be around to notice.  But the worst part about Scream 2 was probably its climax, suspense was completely absent, and some parts of it were quite humourous instead of frightening. When the killers expose themselves, the movie already starts to wane, probaly because nobody knows anything about them, and frankly, no one cares either. The resolution is sketchy, and conveniently almost all of the survivors of the first Scream live on. In simple words, Scream 2 has its moments, but it`s not a worthy sequel.

Not many films can do that except for maybe Schindlers List. Recently I rented it but could only watch it until half way through the Omagh Beach scene. I think this film is the kind that you can only watch once. My Dad watched it and it moved him also, he even had tears in his eyes by the end of it. I can't believe that some war veterans involved in D-Day could actually begin to watch this film, it must bring back some terrible memories. I think it's something that we all should watch because it brings home the horrific nature of war that books and even pictures cannot even begin to illustrate. Most kids like me should definitely watch this as it makes us realise just how trivial our troubles in life seem. we should not be allowed to forget the millions of ordinary men who were slaughtered in this conflict, what they died for and just how lucky we really are. My only critcism of the movie is how like many Hollywood films only concentrate on the American side of it all when many other nationalities participated. Ok I accept that Omagh was a mainly American thing but even now the American soldiers are all portrayed as the good guys who can do no wrong and the Germans as inhuman monsters, take that bit at the end for example when the german stabs the american. What I think the film fails to illustrate is that even the Germans were just ordinary men just like the American soldiers with mothers and families and I think portraying all the german soldiers as pure evil is a bit outdated and sad we should realise that now. I also wish that this film could have been about and dedicated to all the men whatever their nationality who gave their lives on D-Day, it wasn't just the americans. Despite this however I think the opening scene is about as close as we can come to how D-Day actually was and i think its about time we knew what the war veterans went through for us and how eternally grateful we should be to them.

Ok I accept that Omagh was a mainly American thing but even now the American soldiers are all portrayed as the good guys who can do no wrong and the Germans as inhuman monsters, take that bit at the end for example when the german stabs the american. What I think the film fails to illustrate is that even the Germans were just ordinary men just like the American soldiers with mothers and families and I think portraying all the german soldiers as pure evil is a bit outdated and sad we should realise that now. I also wish that this film could have been about and dedicated to all the men whatever their nationality who gave their lives on D-Day, it wasn't just the americans. Despite this however I think the opening scene is about as close as we can come to how D-Day actually was and i think its about time we knew what the war veterans went through for us and how eternally grateful we should be to them.

Chucky's new bride Tiffany has also found herself enjoying all the twisted, creative murders Chucky has made. Chucky and Tiffany have one goal to retrieve the Heart of Omzilla, an amulet that will thus allow both of them to return to their former human selves...You better watch out! Chucky is no more mister nice guy!BRIDE OF CHUCKY is a sinister guilty pleasure! The Chucky franchise earns its much desperately needed (and deserved) revision. Thanks to Ronny Yu's (who has directed so many Hong Kong martial arts films) direction and the wizardry of special FX make-up artist Kevin Yagher, Chucky is livelier...and deadlier than ever. Yagher does a great job giving Chucky such human traits and attributes. Chucky is one demonic and realistic character whom I would NOT like to run into in a dark alley! Chucky himself looks especially deformed, with the appropriate stitches on his face and everything. For a pint size villain, he packs one mean attitude! Also, the facial expressions of the killer puppets Chucky and Tiffany are so bizarre, yet wonderfully genuine. One fact for sure, I was impressed by all the elaborate special effects... Hey, you must also adore the cogent and delightfully deviant love-hate relationship between Chucky and Tiffany.John Ritter (!) is excellent (though unusually cast against type) as an uncompromising Security Chief Officer. Ritter should also earn an award for the best (and most unpredictable) demise. He certainly knows how to be dying in style! Brad Dourif really knows this Chucky character inside out. He delivers the wisecracks with impeccable timing before and after each killing. Alexis Arquette (THE WEDDING SINGER) is in top form as a Goth who encounters the devil doll. Jennifer Tilly is one fantastic, nefarious temptress.There's plenty of bloodletting in this pleasantly entertaining (and sleazy) thriller. Lots of gory murders abound to keep bloodhounds ingratiated. This grotesquely violent and sanguinary film will easily scare away the squeamish. In addition, there are lots of cool (and sometimes subtle) references alluding to other horror flicks. I also learned from this movie that a person should not take love for granted.BRIDE OF CHUCKY is an imaginative journey into everlasting terror. You will laugh and churn as you witness the brutal slayings as the consequences of this couple's rampage. If you appreciate dark, macabre humor, then this movie is perfect for you! By far the best film in this series. This movie is even better than the original CHILD'S PLAY ...RATING **1\/2 out of ****.

The original 1958 novel, Starship Troopers, is a classic of the genre, with great action, good plot, memorable characters, and enough political and technical ideas to satisfy any Poly-Sci or engineering enthusiast.  The movie...has great action.Admittedly, a book that is really primarily about political theory and the philosophy of warfare does not make for a good Effects-laden sci-fi shoot-em-up, so I am willing to cut this movie some slack.  The acting by the cast (mostly former Melrose Place or 90210 stars) is atrocious, the dialogue hokey, and the plot paper-thin.  However, if what you are looking for is a lot of explosions, some good-looking people, and a lot of effects and gore, this is probably a good bet.On the other hand, when you look a little deeper, the film does improve in my estimation.  Director Paul Verhoeven consciously was imitating WW2-era propaganda films like They Were Expendable, and he does a creditable job of that.  In Verhoeven's previous effort to make a special effects spectacular out of an idea-laden sci-fi book, Total Recall, he also stuck only loosely to the book, but he actually came up with a better story.
