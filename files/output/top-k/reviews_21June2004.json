I am quite sure in that basement where she did herself in-there was a washer and dryer?Also- when Gage went toward the road- what kinda parent would turn their back on their kid and let him walk to the road, knowing the trucks came by so fast all the time? And if you look, Dale Midkiff had plenty of time to run and grab him before he went into the road-maybe he was just a slow runner is all. He is a good actor, not to mention gorgeous. He is the highlight of the film. I like it when he goes to hunt Gage and he finds his wife's shoe and the house is all dead like a Cemetery. And he walks up to the shoe and touches it and everything goes back to normal. Quite cool. Very neat.Plus- I have a bit of a problem with the fact that he needed a pic and shovel to bury Elly's cat, and took his kid and wife and used nothing at all when he climbed the hill? Did he just put rocks on top and not bury them or what? A lot of screwups in this movie. I liked the ghost, Victor. I think it was neat. However-having been a psychic for almost 30 years I can tell you that ghosts or spirits do not come back and chat with you- as well as come back like they died. They are whole and not injured. I know, I have seen several spirits. But I continue to rent the movie, not just to look only at Dale Midkiff, hoping to see something extra in that bathtub scene. The rat, I could have done without. But cats, will be cats. I think it is a cute movie. A helluva a lot better than Pet Semetary II. That was just silly. Most sequels are. Except for the Godfather ones.I think they should have just made one Pet Semetary. And why the hell did Stephen King call it Semetary- I thought maybe it was like Septic? I don't know. I would be scared to talk to him if I saw him, since he bought a home down here in Florida- not 40 or 50 miles from our town.

One disclaimer - I am commenting on the movie, not the book. Those who've read the book all seem agreed that the Lincoln Rhymes character is great, the stories are great, and most of the problems with this movie, for them, appear to stem from the fact that this movie strays from the book in significant respects.Some people are comfortable writing a review even though they obviously didn't pay any attention to the film, leaving their comments misleading at best and downright ridiculous in some instances.THE GREAT As a forensics expert, Rhymes is brilliant. He did NOT immediately interpret the clues in all instances, and needed plenty of help from his trusted and trusting assistants, all of whom have worked with him, read his works, and know the guy is good. It's a well-functioning community where all respect each other's roles on the team. Watch Ed O'Neil's character Sellito to see this in the clearest action.The development between Rhymes and Donaghy is half-baked, the book will no doubt supercede what they cooked up on screen. In fact, the development of Donaghy herself is half-baked, although Jolie does a great job of showing internal conflict that evolves into a new sense of self-discovery and purpose, which reflects the change we are made to understand also happens for Rhymes.The manner in which Rhymes and his team collect and then analyse the clues is pretty nifty, seems close to authenticity. After all his years on the job as well as his academic merit, the subjective skill of interpreting the clues becomes abstract, so that he CAN make those jumps - see Se7en as another example. And, as in real cases so often, once your science gets you into the ballpark, it's often a stroke of luck that breaks it open. Nothing I could see difficult to accept here.The relationship between Rhymes and his nurse Thelma (ably conveyed by the beautiful Queen Latifah) is excellent. She is strong, devoted, loving, and thank merciful heavens she doesn't end up a jealous murderous madwoman as Donaghy and Rhymes clearly connect. No no, Thelma is genuine, and their relationship is pure. I'd say more, but that would spoil it.THE BAD Rooker plays the political cop boss guy, such a tired cliche. Rhymes is well-read, widely written, proven, he travels and lectures all over the world, and some city cop is lording over him, as though they are not all on the same team. So tired, so trite.

Don't want to spoil anything, so if you want, email me and we can talk about it.A FINAL CONSIDERATION...(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) Not sure it's fair to say there is a high degree of similiarity between this film and Se7en, but there are a few very strong connections.1. Both main cops (Washington\/Freeman) are leaving the force in about a week, for different reasons.2. Both main cops are extremely insightful. Washington for his academic intellect, Freeman for his experience on the force.3.

Luke's evolution is like peeling away the layers of an onion; one mistake begets another, then another and so on.  `Cool Hand Luke' also challenges the viewer to possibly question their own moral fiber; `Is what he did that bad?' `Does he deserve what he is getting?'   `Cool Hand Luke' sports some pretty interesting shots (I never thought I would see an extreme close-up of Harry Dean Stanton's singing mouth, nor do I ever think I want to again), pretty great acting, (George Kennedy won an Oscar for convincingly playing a real cracker) and a veritable `who's who' of virtually as-yet-undiscovered young male actors.  I managed to spot Joe Don Baker, Dennis Hopper, the aforementioned Harry Dean Stanton, and a couple of other actors that I was convinced I'd seen in subsequent films or television.  Probably the most obvious theme that I noticed in `Cool Hand Luke' is that it is definitely a `man's film'.  There are exactly two women in the film and they are each featured for less than five minutes each &#150; one being Luke's dying mother who comes to visit him in prison, and the other is the oft-imitated (and completely objectified) woman washing her car and taunting the road gang.  `Cool Hand Luke' is a film that on the onset is a fairly straightforward film, but upon reflection, even during the course of the film itself, is quite layered and thought provoking.  In addition to being hailed as a film classic, there are several films that have obviously used it as an inspiration, the most obvious being `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Oh Brother Where Art Thou'.  Nothing is black and white in this film, which I think is one of the factors that make `Cool Hand Luke' a classic.--Shelly  ","genre":null},{"date":"21 June 2004","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers`Cool Hand Luke' is a film I have wanted to see for over a decade, and I was not disappointed when, this weekend, I finally did.  `Cool Hand Luke', the story of a fairly ordinary man named Luke (Paul Newman) who does one stupid (and pretty harmless) thing that ends up being his eventual downfall, is definitely a film that is a lot deeper than it may initially seem to be.
