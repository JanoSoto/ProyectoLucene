The bare bones of the story are mostly the same with the Disney version directed by Clyde Geronimi, Hamilton Luske and Wilfred Jackson. The 12th canon film for Walt Disney Animation Studios, Cinderella tells the story a young noblewoman, Cinderella (Voiced by Ilene Woods), whom is forced to live with her crude & vindictive stepmother (Voiced by Eleanor Audley) when her parents died. Unable to get along with her step-family, they mistreat her by making her work as a servant. When the local prince (Voiced by William Phillips) holds a kingdom-wide ball, they refuse to let her attend, but she was able to go, when her fairy godmother (Voiced by Verna Felton) takes pity on her and outfits her for the ball. However, there is limit to the spirit's help Cinderella must return by midnight. Can she win the heart of the prince or the limited time, be too much for her to overcome? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much, the best known version of this story, is the one written by Charles Perrault in the 17th century call 'Cendrillion. When you hear the name Cinderella, you think of fairy godmothers, glass slippers, and a pumpkin turned into a coach, you're thinking of Perrault. In the1950, Disney adapted Perrault's story into a movie, cementing it in people's minds as the 'truth' story of Cinderella. Not a lot of people know this, but this movie help save the Walt Disney Company from being bankrupt. At the time, Walt Disney Productions had suffered a big blow, when their European film market was cut off, due to the outbreak of World War 2. They were in debt, after high production films like 1940's Pinocchio, 1940's Fantasia, and 1942's Bambi weren't making a lot of money when they came out. Disney was limited to making collections of shorts while many of their staff were drafted to the war effort. It's Cinderella that save the company from bankruptcy. It's no wonder why the Cinderella Castle is one of the company's main logo. Since then, the popularity for this movie, has somewhat died down, as a lot of people saw the Cinderella story as alright at the time, but somewhat dated for the modern viewer. Then, you got those, modern viewers that really get angry, when you mention the name, Cinderella. Their beef against the film, was how the film is sexist, due to fact, that it portray women as hysterical servitude slaves who can only be rescue, by men or magical forces. I can understand, a bit, of what they were saying. Cinderella was indeed, somewhat a submissive and meek character, but she also has a fighter side. She did make a choice, to go to the ball, against the wishes of her crude Step-family. She did try to escape her abusive environment, toward the climax and despite the abuse and neglect she had gone through, she still remained kind and forgiving. Any normal person would have become cynical if they had gone through this, but she didn't. Yes, she got married at the end. But how does that make this movie less feminist? Being a feminist doesn't mean you hate men, so getting married didn't make her any less of a strong character. There is nothing wrong, with caring. I know that whole essays have been written ripping Cinderella apart, but those are some good examples of her being more than the submissive, servile archetype. Also is the Fairy Godmother really damaging to children, convincing them someone will solve their problems, or is she a symbol of hope? There has been many of brave, productive people that believe in higher powers, throughout history. I really doubt of any of them, were call fragile. Maybe we just need to admit we don't know the character as we think we do, and leave our interpretation of Cinderella up to the individual. However, this doesn't stop the movie, from having other faults; like how the movie is call Cinderella, but most of the screen time, is with the mice. Another is how Cinderella's looks win over the prince, over her personality. The two of them, have little to no chemistry. The film also fails to explain, how the magic works. Why doesn't the Fairy Stepmother step up and save Cinderella, earlier? Why does Cinderella's magic end at midnight? Why doesn't the glass slipper, disappear when the clock strikes midnight? Could Cinderella really the only person in the kingdom who the slippers could fit? These things, really needed some more exposition. Anyways, the animation is alright, but it definitely marked down to form, compare to the painstaking and extremely expensive animation techniques of the earlier films. The songs were pretty catchy. I love all of them, but some songs do go, way too long. The voice acting is alright, for the most part. However, the prince is the worst of them, all with his limited role. Glad, the movie nearly goes all Brother Grimm with the story. It never goes too gory. We don't see the stepsister's gruesome acts of self-mutilation of foot-binding and cutting off limps. Then later, them being blinded by birds. Still, I can wish, they kept the part of one that one of the step-sisters was slightly less mean than the other one. Anyways, parents need to know that this Disney classic is one that whole family can enjoy together. Even, if kids saw the film, they will likely already be familiar with Cinderella and her Disney Princess colleagues due to a massive marketing effort behind the ladies. Cinderella got not one, but 2 Directed-to-Video sequels 2002's Cinderella II Dreams Come True & 2007's Cinderella III's A Twist in Time. There is also a 2015 live action remake with the same name. Overall while, not the best Disney movie, but it does have enough magic, to keep the magic going. Do recommended.

I was five years old then and I enjoyed. Over the years as I've become interested in film reviews and watched the film multiple times, I started the significant flaws of the movie particularly the dialogue. I understand there's a vocal crowd who passionately hate it, but I never could bring myself to doing so. I can't even dislike. I guess part of it is the nostalgia of the experience, but there's stuff to legitimately like in this movie. Some of the performances like Liam Neeson do a very decent job and while Ewan McGregor doesn't do much as Obi-Wan in this film, he gets better as the Prequels go on. The pod race I very much enjoy (though it could've been shot more interestingly) and the lightsaber duel at the film which saves it for many people is my 2nd favorite lightsaber duel in the film saga (first being the Luke\/Vader duel in Empire). Admittedly many performances in the movie don't pan out too well like Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. Though to be fair he was only 8 years old at the time he was in front of the camera and he got REALLY unnecessary hate after the it came out. In fact due to the hate he went through for his performance it forced him to retire from acting and hasn't been in front of the camera in over a decade. Kinda makes me wanna give the guy a hug for all the visceral hate he got over the years. Then there's the Midi-clorians; honesty I never had any negative opinion about them is I was never so picky with details in movies and pretty much just accept it as is. The one criticism I'd have (at least in Phantom Menace) is that they weren't explained enough. The Clone Wars TV series and the Darth Plagueis novel actually give a really interesting study on midi-clorians.

Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy decided to completely exclude any mention of them in The Force Awakens), but it just never edged the wrong way. The Phantom Menace is 100% canon anyway and so are Midi-clorians so people who hate them will have to accept them.

I started off thinking it might be a 7 rating movie, but every 10 minutes of so it gets a notch worse. A good movie should make you want to watch it within the first 10 minutes -- 5 if it is done by a master. This movie makes you want to turn it off after the first 10 minutes -- 5 if you have a sensitive stomach. If that's the way you feel, my advice is trust your gut. This movie is a gold-plated piece of coprolite. The greatness of the original Maverick series was in the classy, clever writing. Try watching another TV western from that era and you will see a lot of gunfighting, chases, cattle drives and covered wagon trains, ad nauseum. Maverick had a formula, and a lesson for life appearances can be deceiving. But in this remake, the deceptions are glaringly obvious and not at all clever. What James Garner is doing in this is not entirely clear, beyond the obvious window dressing. He never gets a chance to act. Back in the Fifties, Warner Brothers cheated him, and Garner left after two seasons with the help of a lawyer. Watching Warner so cluelessly bollixing this movie version, with Garner standing right there available for advice which surely was not sought, probably left Garner with some small satisfaction There was only one James Garner as Bret Maverick, and Mel Gibson ain't even close. Let me give you a clue, Mel the secret to Garner's Maverick was in his voice more than his face. Garner had an incredible voice (try watching Maverick TOS with the picture off). Mel, you aren't even in the same league with Jack Kelly's Bart Maverick, which I thought was excellent. Kelly and Garner were a sort of Yin and Yang that balanced things out week to week.This Warner movie makes Garner look like he is senile. To clear that up, just watch Space Cowboys, made six years later. Hmmm, I wonder what would have happened if Clint Eastwood had directed Maverick, the movie?As I have tried to watch this over several days, it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse. It's not just Mel's fault. I can't really blame Alfred Molina, who is a great actor, though I can't for the life of me figure out what his role is in this picture -- who is he and why does he hate Maverick? I don't like Jodie Foster's cloying over-acting. I have no sympathy for her character, which is not how the original series played the women. Usually, Maverick helps out some lady in distress, though you aren't always sure who that is going to be. Here there is just one obnoxious woman, aside from the bizarre wagon train of ugly missionaries -- what's with that? So the bulk of the blame must fall to the director, Richard Donner, and the writer, William Goldman. Sorry, Maverick is not Superman, nor Princess Bride, re-set in the wild West. The Indians speaking in 21st century lingo was close to the last straw. Is this a remake of F Troop in disguise? As I say, it just keeps getting worse and worse. There is no integrity to the script; things just happen for no particular reason, aside from a cheap gag. Gibson's Maverick doesn't think his way out of trouble, he just sort of stumbles along. Except for his super-human ninja-level fist fighting and Superman-level skill with a pistol. This is Maverick as a cartoon character super hero. Well, I have watched 1 hour and 20 minutes of the movie, and my movie rating has gradually dropped from 7 to 3. I am afraid if I watch the last 40 minutes, my rating will be minus 1, which is not possible on IMDb. If I were being paid to write this review for IMDb, I would grit my teeth, take an Alka Seltzer, and do my best to watch the whole thing. As I am not, I will cease this masochistic movie torture. Let me give other viewers a bit of advice If you like this movie version of Maverick, you will love the original TV series F Troop. If you liked the original TV series Maverick, don't bother with this movie. The only thing the two have in common is the title and the studio. But do watch Support Your Local Sheriff. That is the closest thing to a Maverick movie, with some great supporting acting by Jack Elam and Bruce Dern, et. al. It is wonderful fun.

Try watching another TV western from that era and you will see a lot of gunfighting, chases, cattle drives and covered wagon trains, ad nauseum. Maverick had a formula, and a lesson for life appearances can be deceiving. But in this remake, the deceptions are glaringly obvious and not at all clever. What James Garner is doing in this is not entirely clear, beyond the obvious window dressing. He never gets a chance to act. Back in the Fifties, Warner Brothers cheated him, and Garner left after two seasons with the help of a lawyer. Watching Warner so cluelessly bollixing this movie version, with Garner standing right there available for advice which surely was not sought, probably left Garner with some small satisfaction There was only one James Garner as Bret Maverick, and Mel Gibson ain't even close. Let me give you a clue, Mel the secret to Garner's Maverick was in his voice more than his face. Garner had an incredible voice (try watching Maverick TOS with the picture off). Mel, you aren't even in the same league with Jack Kelly's Bart Maverick, which I thought was excellent. Kelly and Garner were a sort of Yin and Yang that balanced things out week to week.This Warner movie makes Garner look like he is senile. To clear that up, just watch Space Cowboys, made six years later. Hmmm, I wonder what would have happened if Clint Eastwood had directed Maverick, the movie?As I have tried to watch this over several days, it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse. It's not just Mel's fault. I can't really blame Alfred Molina, who is a great actor, though I can't for the life of me figure out what his role is in this picture -- who is he and why does he hate Maverick? I don't like Jodie Foster's cloying over-acting. I have no sympathy for her character, which is not how the original series played the women. Usually, Maverick helps out some lady in distress, though you aren't always sure who that is going to be. Here there is just one obnoxious woman, aside from the bizarre wagon train of ugly missionaries -- what's with that? So the bulk of the blame must fall to the director, Richard Donner, and the writer, William Goldman. Sorry, Maverick is not Superman, nor Princess Bride, re-set in the wild West. The Indians speaking in 21st century lingo was close to the last straw. Is this a remake of F Troop in disguise? As I say, it just keeps getting worse and worse. There is no integrity to the script; things just happen for no particular reason, aside from a cheap gag. Gibson's Maverick doesn't think his way out of trouble, he just sort of stumbles along. Except for his super-human ninja-level fist fighting and Superman-level skill with a pistol. This is Maverick as a cartoon character super hero. Well, I have watched 1 hour and 20 minutes of the movie, and my movie rating has gradually dropped from 7 to 3. I am afraid if I watch the last 40 minutes, my rating will be minus 1, which is not possible on IMDb. If I were being paid to write this review for IMDb, I would grit my teeth, take an Alka Seltzer, and do my best to watch the whole thing. As I am not, I will cease this masochistic movie torture. Let me give other viewers a bit of advice If you like this movie version of Maverick, you will love the original TV series F Troop. If you liked the original TV series Maverick, don't bother with this movie. The only thing the two have in common is the title and the studio. But do watch Support Your Local Sheriff. That is the closest thing to a Maverick movie, with some great supporting acting by Jack Elam and Bruce Dern, et. al. It is wonderful fun.

That was the first time I ever wished that I was watching Ghost Rider in lieu of another movie.Everything about this movie is bad. The story makes absolutely no sense and it seems like it was written on a sheet of ad lib paper rather than an actual script.

To Peter Berg's misfortune, the evil TV repairman practices a form of black magic that enables himself to become impervious to electricity and somehow gives him the ability to possess anyone's body with his own spirit......I guess it sounds fun on paper, but only at around an hour and forty minutes long, Shocker sure seems to feel three hours in length. There comes a point in watching the movie when all the stupidity and bad acting just becomes monotonous and tiresome and completely pointless. Furthermore, Shocker seems like a film Craven made just so he could experiment with visual effects. It's a movie completely devoid of any form of sense or reason that it just leaves you feeling dumber by the end.

I thought about watching it, because I recently saw the first one which I also wrote a review on. I also felt like watching it, because you remember how the turtles like pizza and in this one, one of the main characters is the pizza delivery guy, Keno. While watching it, a lot of the movie didn't entertain me that much. It might have a good storyline, dealing with the ooze the turtles mutated from. But, a lot of the movie seemed too kiddish for me. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of kid entertainment. Like my favorite movie in the entire world, which I also left a review on is a movie called Junior High Spy, even though that movie has bad acting. I also feel like if you want to go to places like Disney World, you still have some of your youth inside. Sometimes if something is too kiddish, it just seems too cheesy to watch and doesn't entertain you as much.Now, there's the first one which is entertaining. I enjoyed the first film, I like the dark atmosphere in the film. I also like how they show the Foot Clan and teen boys from back then entertaining themselves. This movie is the 2nd in the series, and we miss the days when the turtles were stuntmen in costumes. This movie while meant to be a sequel from the first, seemed to leave things out as sequels often times do. I mean, April seems to change in this one. Yeah, she's played by a different actress. But, in this one she lives in a nicer apartment in a nicer area of the city. She also seems to appreciate antiquity in the first, which isn't shown in this one. Also, Danny was a main character in the first film who even hung around April in a deleted ending scene. It doesn't look the same without him, or his Dad Charles Pennington, especially at April's Channel 3 News. It also isn't quite the same without Casey Jones, even though Keno probably replaced his role. The foot also seems different in this film than the first.What else do I want to say. I saw the 3rd one recently, as I have a Blu Ray set with the first 3 TMNT movies. I saw on wikipedia how the 3rd one got mostly negative reviews, including one review of somebody who considered it only entertaining for kids and almost as if that movie was written by kids.

I thought about watching it, because I recently saw the first one which I also wrote a review on. I also felt like watching it, because you remember how the turtles like pizza and in this one, one of the main characters is the pizza delivery guy, Keno. While watching it, a lot of the movie didn't entertain me that much. It might have a good storyline, dealing with the ooze the turtles mutated from. But, a lot of the movie seemed too kiddish for me. Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of kid entertainment. Like my favorite movie in the entire world, which I also left a review on is a movie called Junior High Spy, even though that movie has bad acting. I also feel like if you want to go to places like Disney World, you still have some of your youth inside.

I enjoyed the first film, I like the dark atmosphere in the film. I also like how they show the Foot Clan and teen boys from back then entertaining themselves. This movie is the 2nd in the series, and we miss the days when the turtles were stuntmen in costumes. This movie while meant to be a sequel from the first, seemed to leave things out as sequels often times do. I mean, April seems to change in this one. Yeah, she's played by a different actress. But, in this one she lives in a nicer apartment in a nicer area of the city. She also seems to appreciate antiquity in the first, which isn't shown in this one. Also, Danny was a main character in the first film who even hung around April in a deleted ending scene. It doesn't look the same without him, or his Dad Charles Pennington, especially at April's Channel 3 News. It also isn't quite the same without Casey Jones, even though Keno probably replaced his role. The foot also seems different in this film than the first.What else do I want to say. I saw the 3rd one recently, as I have a Blu Ray set with the first 3 TMNT movies.

I had watched this movie the year it came out in 1996. It looks as good now as it did when new since it was set in the late-1890s and looks like it. Gorgeous, magical cinematography. The setting is lush and very African-specific, as it should be. The main actors, background characters, and direction were perfectly executed. Magnificent actually. I had also read that William Goldman (screenwriter) had written this true story based on a 1910 book by the main character, Colonel John Patterson. It's scary, and this event really happened. Just not entirely as written for the screen...Basic story Col. Patterson (Val Kilmer) is a charismatic and visionary bridge builder who has a tight time-frame to build a railroad across a specific river in Africa to keep Great Britain ahead of the French and German railroads in a race for African dominance in the days of empires. If he succeeds, it's a knighthood. If he fails, his career is finished by his sadistic benefactor. Once he arrives, almost immediately workers start mysteriously disappearing. They realize a lion is attacking them. What they don't realize is this is no mere hungry lion. It's a man-eater. And there are two of them. Through a series of events, they hire a legendary hunter, Charles Remington (Michael Douglas), to track down and kill the blood-thirsty beasts. What transpires is a cat-and-mouse game (pun intended) where who is hunted and who is the prey is always in question until the very end.This is a good movie. Don't get me wrong. I watched it again last night for a reason. However, had this story not started with the narrator telling us, ...And no matter how outrageous it seems, all of it is true, it would have been easier to take. That part is not factual. For one --- there is no Michael Douglas character in real-life. When the cover of the poster and DVD cover shows two main characters -- and one of them isn't factual -- yet your narrator says everything we see really happened... You see where I'm going with this. Had they just stated, This is based on a very real, very scary story in the heart of Africa, I would have understood artistic license. Douglas was fascinating as the fictional Remington btw and well worth the addition to the script. Dramatically, the story was enhanced in some very keen ways. Unfortunately, that true story part keeps rearing it's ugly head. Oh well. Minor issues I guess.Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie adapted for the screen. Kilmer is terrific as Patterson (although his Irish (I think?) accent comes and goes at mysterious times). Douglas is mesmerizing as the mercurial Remington. The supporting natives and landscapes are breathtaking and fantastic. Just don't go in with expectations this is the entire true story of The Man-eaters of Tsalvo. You'll have to read the book for the facts. Watch this movie expecting to see a stunning African tale of overcoming terror in the jungle by an unstoppable force of nature and you will be rewarded with a first-class production. Think Jaws in the African plains. It's that terrifying for the natives. 8.5 out of 10 from that perspective. But I rate it a 7 out of 10 simply because it lauds the facts openly and proudly but ignores them for the production. Pretend this is an original, well-written, FICTIONAL screenplay that could possibly happen in real-life (because it did) and enjoy the show. Worth watching for sure.

I did like Jude Law's portrayal of Bosie and Sheen's of Robbie Ross, though I don't know how accurate those are,but as it is a film, that doesn't matter. I do have to say that I'm better at picking the points I thought could be better from something,so I probably don't think as badly about this films as it might look to you. I think I'd mostly recommend it to people who are low key interested in the life of Oscar Wilde. It definitely lets you know more about him and the film is quite good, but if you ain't really interested, it probably won't be worth watching.

Their power source is actually the screams of human children. So everyone who works at Monsters Inc., in the scare facility, use special doors to go into children's rooms whilst they sleep, and scare them. They then collect the screams.

As for the movie, I did like, where I've seen it now, four to five times. This is an interesting cop drama with an interesting though simple plot, the movie that falls on the verge of a blaxploitation one, a little saggy though in part. Quinn plays a near retiring detective, 55, worn and weary, where he's spent 60 percent of his life in his occupation. His unconventional methods of force, as he says get's results. After a mob money rip off by three small time ex cons, where a couple of black cops get in the line of fire with some other casualties, being that of the mob boys, he's assigned with a black cop (Yaphet Kotto) who as he says, is running the show. That he is to Quinn's dislike, where the two form a kind of partnership and mutual friendship. Now we know, stolen money is dead money, and if it's mafia involved, those three thugs lives are dwindling, their fate so foreseeable, the last of three, creating a memorable and honorable death, followed by a shock passing from Quinn's character. We too get into the three black guy's lives, and their conflict with their partners, over their fateful actions, which I liked. Anthony Franciosa (Finder Of Lost Loves, Tenebrae, really is the standout in this and if you push his buttons, the fun is watching in how he responds. Antonio Fargas, an actor I've always liked and enjoyed watching, with his ugly black mug, is fun to here, as he is in other pics, as one of the low life money stealing who meets a short demise. At the other end of this bar, it's always a privilege fine actor Quinn, and here he's top form, giving reality and believiability to this character, even though his unjust methods are kind of reprehensible. This oldie but goodie seventies movie, isn't the best of it's time, but still stacks up pretty well, due to it's story, with some heavy and impactful violence, and it's other asset, Franciosa.

Walter is a failed showbiz agent who kills himself to work and pay the debts left by his father, who fled with the money of brokered artists. Anna is violinist and member of the orchestra directed by her ex- husband, Max, a conductor with a blonde hair only smaller than your ego. Forced to move from the apartment where they live and faced with the real estate jungle of Manhattan, they end up buying a small mansion in a deal that seems like a dream come true... a dream that will crumbling slowly, as the weaknesses of the old house are becoming evident, for madness of the two lovebirds and delight of the audience.Walter is represented by a young Tom Hanks, in a stage of his career where he made several comedies. Despite the youth, we can recognize many of the characteristics of this actor which we can see, more developed, in films of his maturity. Anna is embodied by Shelley Long, a actress particularly skilled in comedies. Joe Mantegna also has a role as Art Shirk, a quite wealthy plumber. The film was directed by David Giler and Steven Spielberg, and is the beginning of a good collaboration between Spielberg and Hanks, who will result, in the future, in some successes like Saving Private Ryan. The jokes of context and situation prevails, as well as the hilarious grimacing of the two main actors and a fabulous (and famous) Hanks laugh, well-remembered by those who like this film. In the midst of so many good points, just one less good note I believe the script superficially explores the comic opportunities brought about by love triangle Walter-Anna-Maestro, introducing elements of conflict very late and giving them lightly solutions at the end of the film.In the beginning, this comedy doesn't seem to have anything new or special. It's just a comedy of the eighties, a decade when this genre was very exploited and, to be honest, battered by several absolutely disastrous films. But is exactly by that, partially, why The Money Pit deserves to be noteworthy because it's so good and works so well. This film, a remake of a forties comedy, is a guarantee of laughter, no matter we are watching for the first time or the hundredth time in our lives.

The cinematography is wonderful as we are shown the white sandy beaches of Amity Island. My favorite shot is of Chief Brody looking out to the ocean after an attack on some locals. That shot embodied the vast space if ocean the Chief was about to enter.
