This $100 million dollar plus opus is the second major Hollywood disaster flick to explode across the big-screen, trailing the Sylvester Stallone epic Daylight. Meanwhile, Dante's Peak imitates but never surpasses previous classics like the 1972 version of The Poseidon Adventure or the 1974 opus Earthquake. Interestingly, audiences will find little in the way of sex, nudity, violence, and profanity to complain about in this harmless, PG-13 rated, special effects laden melodrama.Brosnan plays volcanologist Harry Dalton who has just recovered from a South American blast that claimed his girlfriend's life. Four years later, as Dalton is about to embark on a vacation, his boss sends him off to the Pacific Northwest to check out a sleeping volcano. Dalton arrives in the small town at the foot of the volcano as its Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton of The Terminator) accepts an award for hailing her hamlet the second best place to live. When Dalton alerts them about the volcano, the townspeople start to fidget. They have just convinced an investor to erect a million-dollar business in their town. Dalton's boss rolls in not long afterward and calms their fears. He appreciates the damage that a false alarm can do and tells Dalton to take a hike. Dalton decides to stick around as much for the volcano as the pretty mayor.Daylight scenarist Leslie Bohem's less than molten script criss-crosses scenes from Steven Spielberg's Jaws and James Goldstone's When Time Ran Out. Dante's Peak turns out to be just as formulaic as both Jaws and When Time Ran Out. You know that the dog that gets lost will be rescued before the lava flows fry him. The characters that shrug at the idea that the volcano will ignite get their just comeuppance.Dante's Peak gets off to a riveting start with a volcanic eruption in South America, and then subsides as the filmmakers lay out the story and deploy their characters. Of course, Mayor Wando has been left high and dry by his husband and has two children to raise. Gradually, signs of danger appear and Dalton smells the ash in the air before the mountain blasts itself to smithereens. Two lusty teenagers die early when a hot springs pond scorches them alive. Despite solid computer evidence to the contrary that the volcano won't explode, Dalton keeps crying wolf until it is too late.The early matte shots of the volcano look rather cheesy, but the eruption sequence is as well done as the nuclear blast in Andrew Davis' Chain Reaction. Freeways collapse and buildings crash into rubble as extras dodge flying debris and howl in agony. Director Ronald Donaldson, who also helmed Species, The Getaway, and The Bounty, seems more preoccupied with hysteria than gut-wrenching shock tactics. Nothing really scary or gory jumps out at you in Dante's Peak. A couple of decent scenes stand out in an otherwise staple plot. A boat ride down a river turned into acid yields a chill or two, and your skin will crawl when Dalton legs it ahead of a lava flow.Dante's Peak suffers because the cast consists largely of unknowns, so you won't feel much sorrow when a character croaks. Nobody dies a genuinely nasty death as in either The Poseidon Adventure or Earthquake. Of course, Mayor Wando's children are thrust into harm's way so that Dalton and she can rescue them. Dante's Peak features a fearless grandmother that willing to risk death to save her relatives. Only toward the end when everything seems undeniably bleak does it look like our hero and heroine will survive this catastrophe.

I couldn't find this movie for years and I finally got the chance to watch it on TV and I was pleasantly surprised, they taken away the Horror\/Comedy element from the 2nd one and just kept the horror element which I was pleased with and they kept it to a similar tone the first one had. It seems that this time Leatherface has taken up with a new family this time and moved to a different part of the country. The opening of this movie has Leatherface having his wicked way with 2 ladies had me hooked, this sequel is like a pumped up polished version of the first one They were starting over with this one, ignoring part 2, avoiding its slapstick and going for a straight-up, no bull, shockfest with the hopes of giving birth to a healthy franchise, in other words saving the franchise from becoming a farce. Well, for one, Leatherface the man behind the dead skin mask is back with a vengeance and he's in scary mode! He wasn't the pussy he was in part 2 and looked like a psychotic heavy metal head-banger with a leg brace.Although far removed from the gritty feel of the first, it still had some spooky impact to it. The night scenes, in particular, were extremely well shot with an axis towards bleak atmosphere. Another plus was that there was some great ideas here when it came to the physical action. We get a badass truck causing havoc, a brand new chainsaw the size of John Holmes' schlong entering the ring and some booby traps in the woods.

Featuring as it does stunning visual images and some almost poetic sequences, this film gives us much more than typical zombie mayhem (although genre fans should not be disappointed by the lurching undead here; I especially enjoyed that zombie Boy Scout troop!). The picture offers much in the way of strangeness (those ignis fatuus floaters, and Gnaghi's romance with a severed female head), comedy (I love the line She was the most beautiful living woman I have ever seen) and mystery (why does the actress Anna Falchi--still a stunner, as a modern-day interview reveals--appear as three different women, and what does that existential, cliffside ending mean?). Rupert Everett and Francois Hadji-Lazaro are just perfect as Francesco and Gnaghi, and yes, the entire film is something of a gas; a genuine cult item if ever there were one.

As a sincere but superficial tribute to all Gloucester, Massachusetts' fishermen that have perished in the sea, The Perfect Storm stirs up more tear-jerking, soap operatic sentimentality than it does meteorological menace. Despite its briny documentary realism, an ensemble cast of ship-shape stars, and a seaworthy raft of Industrial Light & Magic computer generated special effects, this Warner Brothers release about men against the sea charts too many courses, contains too many irrelevant characters that win minimal sympathy, and gives its monstrous gale-force weather systems the short shrift.Imagine a soggy synthesis of John Sturges' The Old Man and the Sea, Ronald Neame's The Poseidon Adventure, and the Yul Brynner air\/sea rescue epic Flight from Ashiya, and you have the basics of Bill (Legends of the Fall) Wittliff's improbable, uneven, and convoluted screenplay. First, based as it is on an actual event, Storm tries to cover two stories at once but does justice to neither one. Director Wolfgang Petersen cross-cuts erratically between the swordboat fishermen and a pleasure craft cruising sailboat captain with two female mates. Second, Petersen and Wittliff concern themselves with a far larger number of characters than they can develop beyond the usual stereotypes. Indeed, while they go to outlandish lengths to flesh out and humanize the fishermen, the filmmakers neglect to sketch in details about either the sailboat characters or the Air National Guardsman helicopter crew. Finally, despite its title, The Perfect Storm emerges as far from perfect. Petersen and Wittliff wring little more than a splash of suspense from the inclement weather in this waterlogged maritime melodrama. The scenes featuring a New England weatherman who rhapsodizes about 'the storm of a lifetime' could have been left on the cutting room floor as could the parallel story about the sailboat survivors. Undeniably, the characters attain greater significance than the raging storm that engulfs them. Clearly, Petersen and Wittliff found it easier to dramatize the more tangible human elements rather than the intangible weather phenomenon that Junger described with a bounty of scientific detail.Initially, Storm focuses on New England fishermen, principally Captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney of Three Kings) and the ragtag crew of the Andrea Gail, a 72-foot swordfishing boat. This salty saga unfolds in the fall of 1991 after Tyne has just gotten back from fishing on the Grand Banks with a less than spectacular haul of swordfish. Inexplicably, unlike fellow fisherman Captain Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio of The Abyss), Billy cannot seem to find the fish. Tyne's run of bad luck irks his crew, especially rookie sailor Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg of Shooter) and veteran angler Murph (John C. Reilly of Magnolia) who had counted on fatter paychecks. Bobby wants to marry his divorced girlfriend, Christina Cotter (Diane Lane of Untraceable), but they are financially strapped and need every cent so they can move out of their room at a local wharf-side tavern into a place of their own. Meanwhile, Murph has just divorced his wife, and she is relying on his checks, too. The greedy owner of the Andrea Gail, Bob Brown (the ever cynical Michael Ironsides of Starship Troopers), warns Tyne that if his luck doesn't improve, Brown will make him walk the plank. If there were ever a Blue Collar version of Captains Courageous, The Perfect Storm is it! Tyne chaffs because Greenlaw has caught twice as much swordfish. The issue of catching enough fish to make it worthwhile for his crew to ship out with him obsesses Tyne. Moreover, Billy fears that his professional reputation has been harpooned, and he feels compelled to deliver no matter what the cost or the consequences. All the guys in Storm tangle with too much testosterone and wind up acting like mini-minded morons.Against Greenlaw's better advice as well as one of his crew who refuses to weigh anchor with him again, the guilt-ridden but reckless Tyne launches one last voyage to make up for their minuscule catch. Bobby, Murph, Bugsy (John Hawkes), and Jamaican ladies' man Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne) sign on for one more trip. Tyne replaces his missing crew member with David 'Sully' Sullivan (William Fichtner of Armageddon), then learns that Murph and Sully hate each other. Nevertheless, although he has picked a dangerous time of the year with the threat of hurricanes looming on the horizon, Tyne plans to ply the far-off but fabled waters of the Flemish Cap where he claims they will find the catch that will 'set the market.' Meanwhile, vigilant Boston TV weatherman Todd Gross (Christopher MacDonald of The Skulls) tracks three storms about to converge offshore in 'the storm of the century.' Before our heroes cast off, Petersen and Wittliff foreshadow the dire straits that lie ahead for them. All the women, from Bobby's mom to Captain Greenlaw, behave like the mythical Cassandra. Bobby's mom warns that The Grand Banks are no joke in October. Comparably, Christina begs her boyfriend, Don't go, Bobby. I got a bad feelin'. While Petersen treads water in familiar territory, he achieves none of the success that highlighted his U-boat classic Das Boot. The action occurs either on the turbulent high seas or in the calm harbor. Interestingly, Storm and Boot start similarly as the mariners return to port and indulge in a subsequent drunken binge. Effectively, Petersen steeps audiences in the environment and the economics of the Gloucester fishermen and the ominous sense of dread that hovers over the townspeople when Tyne and his crew head out to sea. Ultimately, instead of a death-defying melodrama of men against the sea, The Perfect Storm turns into a moribund memorial service that leaves you with a sinking feeling.

And his screams are incredible, as well as his funny facial expressions and his lines. We end up liking him. Sonny also makes a reference to the Attica scandal. He even calls squirrel to one of the women in the bank.Aside the opening song Amoreena by Elton John, there is no soundtrack at all in this film. Also, the opening credits have little to do with the rest of the movie. They show lots of places and activities in New York city, probably to show that the story takes place in a hot Summer day (a dog day afternoon).The best Al Pacino's movie I've seen so far and clearly better than the 1997 remake Mad City with John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"20 March 2008","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Urban Legend director Jamie Blanks takes another whack at the slasher movie genre with Valentine and stabs himself in the foot. His superficial but straightforward slice and dice saga about a demented lunatic who wears a shiny plastic Cupid's mask and slays a gaggle of gorgeous twentysomethings lacks originality, suspense, and charismatic characters. The scene aptly epitomizing Valentine occurs after a curvaceous cutie finds a heart shaped box of gift chocolates on her doorstep. When she bites into one of the rich, gooey pieces, she discovers to her horror that maggots are squirming around in it! Valentine doesn't get any better that this allusion to Dario Argento's classic Suspiria. Although the body count rises every quarter-hour with robotic monotony and the filmmakers spill enough blood for an R-rating, the comparatively generic murders capture little of the adrenaline edge required to set your heart to trip-hammering. Hardcore horror aficionados that relish the good stuff will feel cheated. Generally, Valentine recycles all the formulaic clichés and conventions of slasher from the 1970s & 1980s but sacrifices any sense of ingenuity and inspiration. Without the humor of the Scream trilogy or the gore of the Friday the 13th flicks, Valentine leaves a taste as yucky as a half-eaten maggot. Obviously, the people that made Valentine missed Scary Movie. The Wayans Brothers skewered virtually every murderous scene here so the whole movie suffers from a bad case of déjà vu! The action unfolds at Robert F. Kennedy Middle School during a sixth grade Valentine's Day dance. Eleven-year old Jeremy Melton, a naïve, goofy-toothed geek in heavy-framed spectacles, asks the prettiest girl to dance. Three turn him down rudely; one says 'maybe,' and Dorothy&#151;heftier than her haughty friends&#151;convinces Jeremy to make out with her beneath the bleachers. While they are necking, several bullies harass them. Mortified, Dorothy reels in alarm and accuses Jeremy of attacking her. The bullies drench Jeremy with red punch (similar to Brian De Palma's Carrie where Sissy Spacek got baptized in pig's blood) then strip him to his shorts and send him packing out of the gym. The trauma of this ordeal scars Jeremy so badly that his nose bleeds whenever he stresses out. His bleeding snout emerges as a recurring character trait that symbolizes the closure of each murder. Later, when our heroines confer with a cop in what amounts to an obvious bout of exposition, we learn that Jeremy went to reform school but wound up in an insane asylum. Eventually, we learn that Jeremy's parents died in a mysterious fire, and photos of Jeremy survived the blaze.Indeed, not only are Blanks and his scribes not content with making a slasher, but they also try to forge an Agatha Christie whodunit. They manage to assemble all the appropriate elements, but they have overlooked adding enough red herring to challenge audiences. No matter how many bathroom breaks or concession stand forays you make, you should have little difficulty in cracking this mediocre whodunit. The characters are so stupid that they never see the end coming, and the ending of Valentine is so contrived that even the surviving characters should have known better.Anyway, thirteen years elapse in a flash. All five dames have matured and embarked on either a career or college. Nobody gives poor Jeremy a second thought. Kate (Marley Shelton of Sugar & Spice, a sweetheart who struggles with alcoholic boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz of TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer), have become a journalist. Hard-to-get Paige (Denise Richards of Wild Things) admits in retrospect that they mistreated Jeremy. Medical school student Shelly (Katherine Heigl of 27 Dresses) has gone her own way to college. She prefers to dissect male cadavers rather than dine out with a real-live fellow. Slutty Lily (Jessica Cauffiel of White Chicks) still lets her hormones rule her and hangs out with Paige, while insecure rich girl Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw of Minority Report) takes advantage of her wealth and affluence to host big parties for her friends. Aside from Kate, none are remotely sympathetic despite their stunning looks. The girls haven't had any reason to stay in touch until the authorities discover Shelly's mutilated remains in the morgue of the university. Somehow, the Cupid killer gained access to the morgue and caught Shelly hiding in a body bag before he stabbed her repeatedly to death. Before long, the girls receive sicko Valentine Day cards with messages like Roses are red\/ Violets are blue\/They'll need dental records to identify you. Eventually, our masked menace in a Navy watch coat tracks them down and kills them with a vengeance that recognizes no restraint.Sadly, Valentine qualifies as a predictable, run-of-the-chills slasher. Consistently, the women behave like clueless cretins. They display the singular knack of isolating themselves in dark, dead-end places away from any source of help and get the axe. Typically, the slasher never breaks a sweat. He trudges along with the comatose gait of a zombie and always seems to get his guy or gal. Blanks competently stages the murders in a variety of creepy settings, and lenser Rick Bota's atmospheric, widescreen photography enhances the mood. Unfortunately, because the victims act so much like morons when the killer confronts them, you feel like you should cheer the villain instead of the heroines. Oddly enough, if anybody should win our sympathy, Jeremy should. After all, he was the one who was humiliated and whose life was destroyed. Nevertheless, Blanks blurs the morality when the heroines show what wenches they are. Apart from Kate, each shows herself in a negative light that alienates her from audience sympathy. Moreover, everything between the death scenes in Valentine generates little urgency. Far too much to the story relies on contrivances rather than character motivated movement.Altogether, Valentine qualifies as half-hearted hokum.
