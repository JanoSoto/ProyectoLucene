I felt I needed to write about this film just to get some of the emotion out of me and into some words. So this review may be more for me than for you.I don't know how this movie escaped me in the first place for so long, but when I saw an ad for it just a couple of days ago I wasn't too sure it was my kinda thing, especially since 'that Mandy Moore girl' was in it. But seeing there was nothing else to watch I'd give this a try.Boy oh boy oh boy.... I fell in love with this movie. It brought me to a hyperventilation of tears. It was innocent, simple and so so beautiful. The acting was right on. I was shocked my Moore's amazing rendition of Jamie Sullivan, I couldn't believe this girl could act in this way. All this time I had her pegged as the run of the mill Disney 'pop star' plastics. I was WRONG. This girl (now a woman) is very talented indeed.The character of Jamie Sullivan will break your emotions into a million pieces, if you have any soft bone in your body she will find it. I have never been much of a crying person but this movie, that character, really borough it home for me. Taught me a few home truths - to be true to who we really are, to be kind, thankful for what we do have and to live like it's our last day...Though this film has religious (Christian) undertones, I thought it was very subtle and never forced, so regardless of what your beliefs may be this film will leave you reeling and get you thinking about life and how we should treat each other.It's impossible not to fall in love with Jamie Sullivan whether you're a guy or a gal. She is angelic. The epitome of what we all strive to be, what we want to see in each other.All I can say is dang you Nicholas Sparks for writing this story and dang you Mandy Moore for breaking me into a million pieces with no mercy at all!!!

The Movie starts in the 1958 where the car (a 1958 Plymouth Belvedere) or Christine Injures one factory worker kills another and when you first see its red while the cars around it are white. This scene does more than just show you how Bad to the Bone Christine is. It's a prelude you might not catch on right away but it shows that first of all Christine is demon possessed as Christine can do things on her own even though she is a car. Second she knows what she wants. She doesn't want to be white, to blend in. She wants to be the car you brag about this is Christine and she is one amazing Vehicle. Third Christine can just decide what she looks like. Now let's Jump forward to 1979 and meet Arnie Cunningham. Arnie is a dweeb fortunately he is good friends with hot shot Wide Receiver Dennis Guilder who makes life livable for Arnie literally he almost gets killed by, psycho named Buddy Repperton who is the main bully. But Arnie soon finds Christine the car he becomes instantly attached why you might ask like Arnie said, Maybe it's just that for the first time in my life, I've found something that's uglier than me. And I know I can fix her up. So he dose fix her and there is an immediate change in his character he is now a complete greaser. From his attitude to dressing like The Fonz. Then the bullies brake in and destroy Christine. When he finds out he yells at his girlfriend.

It has great acting, a good story and the most important aspect for a family film, it appeals to kids and adults while never talking down to either group ONCE. Kids see this movie and are swept away into the magic of Oz, adults get a taste of what its like to be a kid again for a couple of hours.So what is the plot to this film? Dorothy is sent to an electric healer by Aunt Em and Uncle Henry to cure her dellusions of Oz. She escapes during a storm and gets swept into the magical world of Oz. Although if you're expecting munchkins and the overall delightful background of the last movie...you'll be beyond disappointed. The Yellow Brick Road is destroyed as is the Emerald City and the citizens of Oz are all turned to stone. She meets companions such as Bellina, Tik Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead and a Gump (I'm not going to try and explain that, I don't even know how).The acting is absolutely marvelous, Fairuza Balk is who I think of whenever someone says Dorothy Gale to me because she just took that part and made it hers (which, considering the original was Judy Garland, thats not easy. Especially for an 8 year old!), Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh play threatening villains incredibly well and the voice acting fits the puppet work and claymation to a tee.The visual effects still hold up as being impressive. I find this element the one that really does pull the audience into the fantasy world that Walter Murch created. Its also Oscar nominated visual effects (why the hell didn't they win?!).Okay, this film is actually one of the darkest family films you're likely to encounter however I think it comes with the medium pretty well. Kids like being scared, otherwise, why would they go out for Halloween? In fact, I think one family film director said you can throw any emotions you want at kids, as long as you give them a happy ending and this film does have that happy ending and somehow keeps the charm of the 1939 film.Now I've glorified this film (and for me that was as easy as counting) I should name some things I didn't like about it. The film does feel short and for me, that is a problem (although if this was a 3 hour epic, I'm sure I'd still be saying that), and for one that I feel is legitimate - The Nome King's plan is revealed very abruptly. Although one major complaint is not this film's fault - I never saw this as a kid. I would have loved to have seen this back then but sadly, that time has passed and all I can do is love it as an adult...the next best thing.The major thing that really does give this film strength against the other countless crap Oz sequels is that it actually has the heart and soul of a family film. Modern family films are ooh, look at the great visual effects. and everything else in terms of story and characters are unengaging and dull, the script talks to the audience as if it needs to hold its audience's hand through everything. This film just entertains and pulls the audience into an experience through the film. A lot like the original Star Wars trilogy.Overall, yes, this review might be bias due to how much I respect and love it but despite what critics who saw this film back then said, this film is an enjoyable film if you can let it sink in that there are Oz reboots, you'll find something to enjoy about this film. I put a guarantee on that, THATS how much I love this film.PS. The obvious question after this is what did I think of the 1939 film?

We do get the dreaded off screen deaths, but this sequel is pretty good when it comes to gore. We get a bloody slit throat, stabbings, gunshot wounds, beating with a golf-club, and the finale at the amusement park will have gore hounds howling. It's some pretty nasty stuff. My main problem with this sequel is that there were too many missed opportunities, storyline wise. The ending from Child's Play II is ignored, which is kind of a shame.They could have at least pulled a Halloween V with this one, and have Christine Elise (Kyle) from the second movie, make an appearance, and kill her off, or&#x85; They could have had Andy & his Mother on the road, with Chucky chasing them down. They had plenty of better things they could have done. It takes place a YEAR later, a YEAR. Yet you butcher the storyline by having Andy join the army, and befriend that dinky nuisance of a kid, Tyler? Come on! It was just so moronic. Aside from the fun, gory times at the amusement park, the finale was awful. It turns into a mini war battle of sorts, and it just got ludicrous. I get they wanted to add in some action, but it lacked suspense, and came across as superficial, like much of this movie. Brad Douriff rocks as Chucky once again. Justin Whalin is actually not bad as Andy. He's a bit wishy-washy at times, but overall I dug his innocence, his vulnerability, and the fact that he tried hard. Too bad he's in a crappy movie.

And i got to say that unsurprisingly my opinion has changed, the thing is that it changed much more than i though it would, because this is quite something.An out of work pulp fiction novelist, Holly Martins, arrives in a post war Vienna divided into sectors by the victorious allies, and where a shortage of supplies has lead to a flourishing black market. He arrives at the invitation of an ex-school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident.From talking to Lime's friends and associates Martins soon notices that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. The Third Man is almost a perfect Noir, although not the column one, a man trying to find the truth, he sees himself dealing with criminals, he sees himself in love, he is completely confused and Joseph Cotten shows that perfectly on screen. And its funny to think that this 64 year old movie, actually had me in the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen, quite a few times.The movie's power is enlarged by some AMAZING cinematography, The Third Man, might have the best cinematography i have seen from a movie that was made in the first half of the century. Most of the movie is shot in some peculiar angles, the shadows are amazingly beautiful, the cinematography adds A LOT to the movie, we feel this gloomy feeling on the air, it truly captures the devastated Europe after WW2. Quite weird to see that Robert Krasker only got this Academy Award win and nomination, because he shows here some very impressive work. Another two great technical things that the movies has, is its score by Anton Karas and its editing by Oswald Hafenrichter, both very impressive worthy of AT least a nomination.Then we get to the performances, and Joseph Cotten is the star of the movie, to say that Orson Wells is the star, would be very unfair to Cotten who does here some of the best work of his career, quite sad to see that such a good and charming actor never got any recognition. Alida Valli, is probably more known for some foreign language movies, but this one is by far the best English movie she did, she great in the movie, she does not play the usual girl that was in almost every movie made at this time. She proves that in the end of the movie, and what an ending. Orson Wells is undeniably great, as the charming manipulative villain, but the thing is that, i felt like he was not enough on the movie, i mean the plot is about this character, but just has 15 minutes of screen time, but he is great in every single minute.Carol Reed does here some fantastic job, he truly made a masterpiece here, an almost flawless movie that manages to survive time, a great story, with a big moral issue ( should you support your friends even when they are doing bad things, or should you try to stop him no matter what consequences) does rat on your friend make you a bad person, we know what Anna Schmidt thinks.The Third Man also has some great charming performances, good writing, amazing cinematography,score, editing and direction, it is one of the best movies of the 40's, and i would not raise an eyebrow if someone told me that this was some of the best work he had ever seen.

He arrives at the invitation of an ex-school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident.From talking to Lime's friends and associates Martins soon notices that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. The Third Man is almost a perfect Noir, although not the column one, a man trying to find the truth, he sees himself dealing with criminals, he sees himself in love, he is completely confused and Joseph Cotten shows that perfectly on screen. And its funny to think that this 64 year old movie, actually had me in the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen, quite a few times.The movie's power is enlarged by some AMAZING cinematography, The Third Man, might have the best cinematography i have seen from a movie that was made in the first half of the century. Most of the movie is shot in some peculiar angles, the shadows are amazingly beautiful, the cinematography adds A LOT to the movie, we feel this gloomy feeling on the air, it truly captures the devastated Europe after WW2. Quite weird to see that Robert Krasker only got this Academy Award win and nomination, because he shows here some very impressive work. Another two great technical things that the movies has, is its score by Anton Karas and its editing by Oswald Hafenrichter, both very impressive worthy of AT least a nomination.Then we get to the performances, and Joseph Cotten is the star of the movie, to say that Orson Wells is the star, would be very unfair to Cotten who does here some of the best work of his career, quite sad to see that such a good and charming actor never got any recognition. Alida Valli, is probably more known for some foreign language movies, but this one is by far the best English movie she did, she great in the movie, she does not play the usual girl that was in almost every movie made at this time. She proves that in the end of the movie, and what an ending. Orson Wells is undeniably great, as the charming manipulative villain, but the thing is that, i felt like he was not enough on the movie, i mean the plot is about this character, but just has 15 minutes of screen time, but he is great in every single minute.Carol Reed does here some fantastic job, he truly made a masterpiece here, an almost flawless movie that manages to survive time, a great story, with a big moral issue ( should you support your friends even when they are doing bad things, or should you try to stop him no matter what consequences) does rat on your friend make you a bad person, we know what Anna Schmidt thinks.The Third Man also has some great charming performances, good writing, amazing cinematography,score, editing and direction, it is one of the best movies of the 40's, and i would not raise an eyebrow if someone told me that this was some of the best work he had ever seen.

Indeed, whether you expect a detective story or a horror\/thriller, the result has to be highly atmospheric, and in the case of Angel Heart, the epithet is a huge understatement.The film opens in January 1955, with Mickey Rourke, as a down-at-heel and down-to-earth Brooklyn detective, charming with ladies, cynical at times, but never failing to look sympathetic. On that level, Rourke embodies his role like a successor of Bogie and Brando tailor-made for the 80's. His co-star, not the least, is Robert De Niro as a sinisterly suave rich man, holding a cane under pointing fingernails and a heavy thick beard that makes him look like the evil twin of Martin Scorsese. The film is also stars Lisa Bonet, taking a risky, yet effective, departure from the family-oriented Cosby Show.The beginning feels like a faithful reminiscence of hard-boiled Raymond Chandler's stories, with the typical dark and shadowy shots of New York's streets, until it suddenly takes us to a creepy journey into a weird devil-worship and voodoo-culture in New Orleans. In the process, Angel Heart reveals his fear of chickens and avoidance of mirrors that make his presence in New Orleans even more uncomfortable. His interactions with Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) are effectively creepy but De Niro finds the right note in his performance, keeping so much coolness in a rather hot setting that we never give a second thought about his name.Angel's mission is to find a crooner and WWII veteran named Johnny Favorite, who has an old business to settle with Cyphre. Angel goes to the hospital where Favorite is supposed to be cured from shell-shock, and finds out from the morphine-addict doctor that the records have been falsified to let a man and a woman take Favorite to the South. Locking the doctor without morphine, Angel expects more information, but when he comes back, the doctor strangely turned into a corpse, all signs indicating it was quite a brutal murder. This is the starter of a series of fresh corpses punctuating Angel's track, and pointing the same accusing finger on him.Cyphre meets a reluctant Angel again and accepts to pay him 5000 dollars to find Favorite's new whereabouts in New Orleans. Angel gets in touch with all the persons who knew Favorite, professionally and privately, from a musician to a fortune teller played by Charlotte Rampling, but the closer he gets to the truth, using his street-smarts and occasionally his way with ladies, the more enemies he makes. He tries to contact Favorite's secret love, only to find out that she's dead, leaving her only child, Epiphany Proudfoot, Bonet as a precocious 17-year old mother. A strange relationship grows with a disturbing smell of deviation, peaking at the infamous love scene.Naturally, Alan Parker indulges himself to the most gruesome details like during the frenetic sex scene, when pours of rains turn into blood, as to suggest a disturbing correlation between sex and violence, as if both were the rotten fruits of the same evil tree. The sordid details don't shock either because the religious undertones that fill the story make them strangely acceptable. The merit of the disturbing voodoo-scene where an entranced Bonet slits a chicken's throat and hysterically dance with her blood-covered face is to desensitize us enough to the sight of blood to handle the ultimate confrontation.So it comes to this, Angel Heart is a film of heavy, threatening and nightmarish atmosphere, a sort of dead-trap no one can get away from it, not even Angel, and this is why the conclusion was the only satisfying one, it does provide disturbing answers but we never discuss their plausibility because we had already been plunged in that supernatural universe, made of animal sacrifices, creepy talismans, smelly herbs and heart-pounding cries. And the ending makes the cinematography's point, by highlighting the curse of a humanity carrying evil germs in its dirty womb, from the sordid streets of New York to the dirty swamps of the Bayou.Angel Heart has often been praised for being a mix of Chinatown and The Exorcist, but in its own way, Alan Parker recreated the 50's more realistically than Polanski's treatment of the 30's, and with its predominance of black and red, some details gets even scarier than The Exorcist, I'm thinking of the sex scene with Lisa Bonet that even rivals with the infamous crucifix moment. Visually speaking, the film is a spectacular masterpiece showing how far a director can pushes the button of morbidity, almost having fun with it. And to keep on the religious vocabulary, the film is blessed with magnificent cities and stairs shot, working as a true homage of German expressionist cinema, making the color feel like it's black and white.And God, there is Rourke's performance that even surpasses De Niro during the mind-blowing last minute. Both Angel's coming-to-realization and your own understanding of Angel Heart, cut straight to yours, literally. And I have goose bumps remembering his raspy scream and his repeated denial I know who I am. Why, one thing you sure is, Mickey is one hell of an actor, and your performance as Angel, proves it.The most memorable shot of Angel Heart is of an old Otis elevator cage interminably descending into an unknown destination &#x85; and while watching the film, I had the feeling I was the one trapped in that cage with Alan Parker as a sadistic bellboy grinning at the anticipation of what I would find when the door opens.

He tries to contact Favorite's secret love, only to find out that she's dead, leaving her only child, Epiphany Proudfoot, Bonet as a precocious 17-year old mother. A strange relationship grows with a disturbing smell of deviation, peaking at the infamous love scene.Naturally, Alan Parker indulges himself to the most gruesome details like during the frenetic sex scene, when pours of rains turn into blood, as to suggest a disturbing correlation between sex and violence, as if both were the rotten fruits of the same evil tree. The sordid details don't shock either because the religious undertones that fill the story make them strangely acceptable. The merit of the disturbing voodoo-scene where an entranced Bonet slits a chicken's throat and hysterically dance with her blood-covered face is to desensitize us enough to the sight of blood to handle the ultimate confrontation.So it comes to this, Angel Heart is a film of heavy, threatening and nightmarish atmosphere, a sort of dead-trap no one can get away from it, not even Angel, and this is why the conclusion was the only satisfying one, it does provide disturbing answers but we never discuss their plausibility because we had already been plunged in that supernatural universe, made of animal sacrifices, creepy talismans, smelly herbs and heart-pounding cries. And the ending makes the cinematography's point, by highlighting the curse of a humanity carrying evil germs in its dirty womb, from the sordid streets of New York to the dirty swamps of the Bayou.Angel Heart has often been praised for being a mix of Chinatown and The Exorcist, but in its own way, Alan Parker recreated the 50's more realistically than Polanski's treatment of the 30's, and with its predominance of black and red, some details gets even scarier than The Exorcist, I'm thinking of the sex scene with Lisa Bonet that even rivals with the infamous crucifix moment. Visually speaking, the film is a spectacular masterpiece showing how far a director can pushes the button of morbidity, almost having fun with it. And to keep on the religious vocabulary, the film is blessed with magnificent cities and stairs shot, working as a true homage of German expressionist cinema, making the color feel like it's black and white.And God, there is Rourke's performance that even surpasses De Niro during the mind-blowing last minute. Both Angel's coming-to-realization and your own understanding of Angel Heart, cut straight to yours, literally. And I have goose bumps remembering his raspy scream and his repeated denial I know who I am. Why, one thing you sure is, Mickey is one hell of an actor, and your performance as Angel, proves it.The most memorable shot of Angel Heart is of an old Otis elevator cage interminably descending into an unknown destination &#x85; and while watching the film, I had the feeling I was the one trapped in that cage with Alan Parker as a sadistic bellboy grinning at the anticipation of what I would find when the door opens. ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"9 October 2013","score":"","review":" Emulating many non-American filmmakers and American movies' admirers, such as Melville, Polanski or Kurosawa, the British Alan Parker ended up making the best tribute to the movies that nourished his cinematic dreams a film noir.In '78, Parker proved his value as an atmospheric director with the nightmarish Midnight Express, but only in the reverse year of '87, he could fully express his personal skills, because of the very requirements of the genre. Indeed, whether you expect a detective story or a horror\/thriller, the result has to be highly atmospheric, and in the case of Angel Heart, the epithet is a huge understatement.The film opens in January 1955, with Mickey Rourke, as a down-at-heel and down-to-earth Brooklyn detective, charming with ladies, cynical at times, but never failing to look sympathetic. On that level, Rourke embodies his role like a successor of Bogie and Brando tailor-made for the 80's. His co-star, not the least, is Robert De Niro as a sinisterly suave rich man, holding a cane under pointing fingernails and a heavy thick beard that makes him look like the evil twin of Martin Scorsese. The film is also stars Lisa Bonet, taking a risky, yet effective, departure from the family-oriented Cosby Show.The beginning feels like a faithful reminiscence of hard-boiled Raymond Chandler's stories, with the typical dark and shadowy shots of New York's streets, until it suddenly takes us to a creepy journey into a weird devil-worship and voodoo-culture in New Orleans. In the process, Angel Heart reveals his fear of chickens and avoidance of mirrors that make his presence in New Orleans even more uncomfortable. His interactions with Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) are effectively creepy but De Niro finds the right note in his performance, keeping so much coolness in a rather hot setting that we never give a second thought about his name.Angel's mission is to find a crooner and WWII veteran named Johnny Favorite, who has an old business to settle with Cyphre. Angel goes to the hospital where Favorite is supposed to be cured from shell-shock, and finds out from the morphine-addict doctor that the records have been falsified to let a man and a woman take Favorite to the South. Locking the doctor without morphine, Angel expects more information, but when he comes back, the doctor strangely turned into a corpse, all signs indicating it was quite a brutal murder.

This is not as good as Magnificent Obsession, which preceded it, but it's still top notch in terms of production values and acting. The one thing that the film suffers from is the different world we live in today. Small towns are still small towns, but the almost town-wide peeping into Jane Wyman's life would be so much less today than it was back in 1955. Nevertheless, it's a fairly good story if you put it in perspective of its era.For the most part, the critical players here do fairly nicely. Jane Wyman was too young for the part as the older woman, but she actually pulls it off quite well. Rock Hudson is just fine as the younger love interest. Agnes Moorehead is sort of torn between a character with a heart, but still a town gossip...but she handles it well. Conrad Nagel does nicely as an older love interest, although it's a small (though critical part). Virginia Grey is quite good as Wyman's friend...an underestimate character actress in my view. Gloria Talbott was decent as the daughter, although most will perhaps remember her more as an early television actress. I can't quite decide if William Reynolds, as the son, was just a lousy actor or if he was directed poorly...but his performance is totally unconvincing. Donald Curtis as a letch...thumbs down.If you can only watch one, opt for Magnificent Obsessions, but this is a fairly good film with a relatively interesting story.

When i think about the plot it's so far from what i usually likes, but just following Andy Dufresne's story is just so entertaining.
