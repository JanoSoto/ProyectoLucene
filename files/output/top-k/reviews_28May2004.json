Those three things, of course, do not make a great movie. He just somehow always finds a way to incorporate them into his movies, which are usually great. This is a science fiction action film, with social commentary and obvious stabs at America in general(but mainly the politics and their seeming obsession with solving any conflict by violent means). You'll see the typical narrow-minded(American) individuals who dehumanize(yes, I realize that they *are* aliens, but still) the enemy in every possibly way, you'll see propaganda, there's even a scene where a member of a debate refuses to even think the thought of the enemy actually being intelligent beings. As an action film, it reminded me a little of RoboCop, but nearly everything was on a much larger scale. There are several epic battle scenes in this movie, and they are very well-made. The action scenes are all intense, and capture war conditions pretty good. The special effects are also very well-made, and add to the intensity by giving us a chance to see some very gruesome deaths and alien\/futuristic weaponry. The film also has several camera pans and angles mainly used to show human death and misery. I think that was a good way to show how pointless and grotesque war really is. The plot is very good, and moves along at a great pace; I wasn't really bored at any point in the film, and I've seen it four or five times now. The acting is mostly just below standard, but sometimes it drops several notches and goes to being ludicrous, and actually making the viewer snicker or laugh at what would have been a serious scene, had it not been painfully overacted. The characters all seemed fairly well-written and credible, though a few of them were stereotypes. The film also does have its share of clichés, but none of them ruin the movie. I haven't read the book this film was based on, but I doubt that it could present the social commentary much better, or done a much better job of mocking the general ignorance usually involved with war and the likes. If it does, I might just have to find it and read it sometime. I recommend this to fans of Verhoeven's other films, especially fans of RoboCop. If you're into social commentary and\/or sci-fi action, you'll probably like it, too. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Paul Verhoeven has a knack for making entertaining films that involve sex, violence and action(not always the first, but the two last mentioned he always manages to deliver).

Well, let's start with that the original's quite different. These two have nothing in common. That's why, don't compare them, Hooper built the characters just like they could be in the real life. Everything is very natural here. The music is replaced with noises (don't worry, it's one more plus) which are going to scare you more you can imagine (of course if you have enough nerves not to turn away from screen or not to turn the volume down).  The only problem is that if you've had an opportunity of watching the original first and then just the final one, then it's O.K., but if you watch the 74 chainsaw the second, then you may not like it at once. You see, in the remake it's clear that leather face enjoys working with chain saw; it's like his favorite toy, right? Well, from this point of view, the original is just `Texas massacre' without `chainsaw' because the maniac starts enjoying the saw only in the final scene on the road after he loses Sally &#150; this part I call `the saw-dance', it's really a wonderful part and excellent ending.

They are plenty - the atmosphere you won't see anywhere else, super photography, specific soundtrack (and still actual nowadays like the whole movie), actors' brilliant play and something that couldn't be here so high taking into account the low budget and the year, these are the effects.

O Brother ranks near the top for me and is one of my all time favorites although I really did not appreciate it the first time through.  I think some of the comments regarding the plot lapses are valid, but for me they are beside the point.  This film is one incredible series of set pieces with three terrific characters at their center  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson.  Each one does a great job with their character.  Once you've seen the film at least two times, you can jump in at any point and just enjoy scene after scene.  If you rate a movie by the number of lines you can remember from it, this is one of the all time greats.  Much has been said of the soundtrack.  I am NOT a fan of gospel and old timey music, but it just works so well here.  The theme that holds the film together is everyone is searching for answers and, guess what, you usually don't find them.    My advice is to get acquainted with the characters and enjoy each scene as it comes along.  You can get many hours of enjoyment out of this movie. 9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  While I like many of the Coen brothers films, there are quite a number that I don't care for.

My basic guideline, however, was it needed to have Johnny Depp in it. I adore him! He is a fantastic actor and i knew any film that i chose that had him in it would be worth while. Boy was I right. there it was sitting on the bottom shelf tucked behind classics like the Abyss and Lock Stock but i thought, Meh, what the hell I'll give it a try, i didn't even know what it was about.Now normally i hate horror movies but this was so good. The story line though loosely based on the history involving Jack the Rippper was very engaging and had twists and turns in it that i had not expected, the only way i figured out who the killer was was the fact that the actor has a very distinct voice, apart from that i was guessing until the end. Sometimes acting left a lot to be desired, it was quite like a school play in some parts where the actors were just hanging around to say their lines there was no real feeling in it and i feel that Heather Graham could have been put to better use. Even though she is good actress i didn't feel that she worked in this film. However the pairing of Robby Coltrane and JD was inspired they worked very well off of each other and made the film that much more worth while. JD seems to be a chameleon when it comes to parts, he just becomes that person and his Cockney was spot on. Johnny Depp will forever be my favorite.

With a mixture of love, action and scandalous plot developments not once in the 175 minutes of watching it did looking at the clock to see how much longer it would be come to mind.  There is such a sympathy created for the Corleone family that you end up rooting for them, even though they are a mafia related family.  It's crazy to think about really, for instance, this reviewer can't remember the last time she felt sympathy for a murderer&#133;  The Godfather is amazing, it's well written, and the cast just meshes well on screen.  The names can be confusing because they are all Italian and people address each other by their last name most of the time, but after a while it starts to make a little sense.   \tThe lead character of the movie is, surprisingly, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  This story follows his coming of age from a young man wishing to get as far away from the business to his deep involvement after some family catastrophes.  Upon first introduction Michael is dressed in his service uniform and bringing a new love, Kay (Diane Keaton), to the wedding of his sister.  When Kay asks about his family, and his father in particular, Michael explains to her that his father is a mafia leader and he wants nothing at all to be like him.  So far, he had been doing very well at trying to keep himself separated, until one day when his father gets shot in the back several times and is put into the hospital.  Well, of course, the henchmen aren't going to be satisfied with just putting him in the hospital, they want to finish the job.  Luckily, Michael goes to visit his father and upon arrival realizes that there is no one there keeping guard over his father.  He calls his brother to get backup and places his father in a different room in the hospital.  The suspense in this scene is SO heavy it's almost suffocating, in a good way.  There are distant footsteps heard coming toward Michael's father and this reviewer felt her hands clench and her heart beat racing; it was so well done.  But this is the point when Michael really starts to enter the mafia; and he only gets deeper and deeper into it as the movie plays out.   \tThere is, however, one death scene that is a bit too played out.  A character is in a car and suddenly there are a gazillion guys around the car and they all have rapid firing guns.  Well, the character is shot while in the car and proceeds to crawl across the seat and exit out the passenger side of the car.  At which point, the character puts themselves in full exposure to the henchmen.  Why?  No clue, but then another 70 or 80 shots are successfully taken AND THEN one of the henchmen proceeds to take a few shots at close range and throw in a few kicks.  This is a bit excessive upon reflection but at the time, this reviewer almost cried.  It was SO unfair!  If it wasn't for the fact that it is completely impossible, jumping into the screen to save the victim was all this reviewer could think of.  Once again, it's amazing because the victim wasn't exactly an angel to say the least. \tThe story is truly what manipulates the audience to feel sympathy for this family.  They seem to be falling apart left and right, which is tough to see because they used to be such a strong unit.  The values of family love seem to be falling apart with each new marriage, the men are trying to stay ahead in the game but they keep getting attacked from behind because there are traitors amongst the alliances.  Personally, this reviewer can't wait to see the two following films in this trilogy and compare them to the first, because topping this one will be extremely difficult.  \tIf your looking for an awesome drama, watch The Godfather, it's got a little bit of everything in the story for everyone.  It's a great movie to watch on an icky day when you're stuck at home, because it will make time fly so fast.

Although I was too young to grasp the legal technicalities and complications that the plot involved, I was still deeply touched by the simple yet powerful story Frank Galvin (Newman), a lawyer who is on the brink of alcoholism and professional bankruptcy, takes a case involving a medical malpractice in which a young woman who was about to give birth has fallen in a terminal coma. Although the defendants are prepared to offer a good amount of money to the victim's family as an out-of-court-settlement, Galvin refuses to accept it, going for a trial instead; this is done against the advice of everybody, including his partner, the presiding judge, and even the plaintiffs themselves. Galvin sees this case as both an opportunity to show his capabilities again after many years of idleness, as well as a rightful struggle to punish those responsible for committing a shameful act who are now trying to get away with it lightly. Against him stands the formidable defense lawer E.J. Concannon (Mason) and his well-organised team, and Galvin's chances to win get bleaker day after day... Amidst all this, Galvin bumps onto an attractive woman (Rampling) who complicates his already complex life further.Viewing the film again now with the mind and experience of someone in his early 30s, I can make a more balanced, thorough, and accurate review. However, it is astonishing that my conclusion is the same as it was more than 20 years ago The film is superb, and Paul Newman definitely gives an amazing performance.

The story is about a young man named Ren, played very well by Kevin Bacon, who moves from the big city to a small town where dancing is outlawed. Of course this is absolutely ludicrous to Ren, a guy who enjoys rock music and loves to dance. The law was passed after a group of kids were killed in a car accident after they had been out dancing and drinking.I liked the performance of John Lithgow as Rev. Shaw Moore, the iron-handed preacher with his rousing God-fearing speeches on morality. I had seen him at the Hollywood Bowl in My Fair Lady this past summer, and he is an excellent actor. There is Ariel, who plays Lithgow's daughter and Ren's romantic love-interest, played by Lori Singer, who secretly rebels against her father. Although, her character annoyed me a bit at the beginning for some unknown reason, she grew on me once she and Ren get to know each other. I also liked Chris Penn as Ren's friend Willard, whom he teaches how to dance.I have a problem with one scene in this movie. Early in the movie, Ariel goes off for a joyride with her friends after church and her boyfriend pulls beside them in his truck on a country road. She manages to climb out of the window as they're driving and she actually balances on both the truck and the car while they're driving side by side! Unless you're an Olympic gymnast, there's NO WAY someone could pull such a stunt. Sure, this scene is meant to show how crazy and rebellious Ariel is, but they could have done a better job in portraying her rebellion. It doesn't move the story along in any way, but despite this unrealistic scene, the rest of the movie was very enjoyable.I liked the quick editing of the dance scenes in the film, it was very much like an MTV music video would have been back in those days. I love the intro of the film with all those legs dancing, a remiscent flashback of what people wore on their feet in those days, high heels with socks, leg warmers, loafers, boots, etc. The scene at the diner where Ariel pops a tape into her stereo and all the kids get down with the music is pure fun, and even a little sexy as well.It has a good message about censorship and religious hypocrisy. During the 80s there were actually people who were rallying against the corruption of young peoples' morals because of rock music and music videos, so I'm sure this film must have hit home back then. The main message behind Ren's fight against the anti-dancing law wasn't so much about teenage rebellion, but also about the right for people to enjoy life.

I have to say here that the story is simplistic because it really boils down to John Rambo fighting a One Man War for his very life but really for no reason. His plans to visit an old Vietnam friend are crushed when he learns that that friend died of cancer that he developed from Agent Orange in Vietnam, and so he immediately becomes a drifter. Evidently he had no other plans and came from nowhere, and therefore has nowhere to go. I won't go into whether or not the book went into more detail about where Rambo came from or why he has no destination whatsoever beyond visiting his friend, because I haven't read it.I have, however, seen the movie, and at this point in the trilogy, I find it rather surprising that Rambo has become something of a cultural icon because of this film and the two sequels. In First Blood, as he wanders aimlessly down the highway, he stumbles into a small town and right into the town sheriff, who politely escorts him to the town limits, saying that drifters only cause trouble but he's more than welcome to grab a bite to eat 30 miles down the road. After being dropped off, Rambo promptly walks back toward town, is promptly noticed and arrested, and ultimately ends up in an all-out battle with what has to be the most incompetent police force on earth, then with the most incompetent state police force on earth, and finally the most incompetent national guard on earth.First the town police can't even get Rambo to put his fingerprints on the paper, then he manages to punch his way completely out of the police station while unarmed, then the state police starts a massive manhunt, apparently unable to find Rambo, who is conspicuously hiding out in his enormous log cabin in the woods, in which he builds a nice fire and takes a nap, and then the national guard is afraid to pursue him in a mine shaft, so they fire a grenade into it instead, but only after the senior officer importantly says, 'Wait, lemme get outta the way first&#133;' Just so you know, the type of elite military forces that would be sent on such a mission are just that. Elite forces. And by that, of course, I mean these guys don't mess round. They don't respond to orders with 'No way, I ain't going' in there!' The commanding officer of such a company would never, while under fire, call out, 'Who's got the rocket launcher?' Nor would he say 'Give that man a cee-gar!' 'Bullseye!' or, heaven forbid, 'Come on you guys, shoot!' Rambo's rampage is somewhat justified by the mental scars that he suffered from his training and work in the Vietnam War, although that topic only comes up right at the beginning of the film and then in the closing scene, when he suddenly starts ranting and raving about how bad the Vietnam veterans have it back in America, spouting more dialogue all at once than he had in the entire film up to that point. If he had been able to explain any of this to the idiot police officers in the beginning of the film, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. Sure, we wouldn't have had a movie that way, but he wouldn't have had to throw himself off the side of a sheer cliff and into a tree to avoid getting shot, either. Not a bad trade-off, I should think.The reason it seems curious to me that this movie has inspired two sequels and a cult following is that, while it's true the movies are certainly fun to watch, the logic is nonexistent, even for a cheesy action movie. Rambo allows himself to be taken into custody by men that he could snap like twigs, then doesn't react to anything, including such benign queries as 'Name?' until he has a razor to his throat. By the way, this is the nicest criminal justice system I've ever heard of. Not only do they assign you a court date the very morning after your arrest, they even assign half of the police force to be on hand while they give you a shave so you'll be presentable in court. Even worse, the whole movie is based on irreversible combat training that Rambo is acting on, in massive self-defense, which is what causes him to enter into a one-man war against the town police force, the state police, and the national guard. Sure, soldiers come back with post-traumatic stress syndrome as well as the remnants of dangerous training that can lead to harsh reactions to small provocations and sleepless nights, because these people have been so heavily trained for combat that some of that remains after the war. What the movie catastrophically forgets is that, along with combat training, soldiers also come out of the military with intense respect for authority figures, especially those in uniform. Not Rambo. Not only does he treat the police as well as the national guard like the subjects of a hunt, he doesn't even respect the very guy that trained him. Somewhere along the way, it seems, Rambo snapped and lost all control of his abilities, becoming a dangerous weapon, a lethal weapon, if you will, who does, in fact, need to be stopped. Unfortunately, the guys who should be the good guys are such morons that it is impossible to root for them, even if they weren't led by the sheriff, who is the only really bad guy in the movie. First Blood is fairly clever as a manhunt film, but as an informational movie about what it's like for Vietnam veterans it's pretty outlandish. Sure, there are tons of problems surrounding that war and the soldiers did return and get pretty bad treatment, but Rambo is such a two-dimensional character that it's almost a shame to see him representing them. He came from nowhere and goes nowhere at the end, all we see is him going nuts. I hope the movie hasn't actually contributed to the problems that Vietnam veterans have had to face.

This is one of my favorite movies. It's got everything on it, humor, horror, fun, beautiful chicks, medieval castles, and a guy with a buzzsaw attached to his left hand to use as a weapon... you name it, this film has got it.Although it's part 3 of the Evil Dead Trilogy, you don't really need to watch the previous ones to enjoy this... maybe only part 2. Actually Evil Dead 2 isn't a continuation of Evil Dead 1, but a remake with more budget. But you get a good enough synthesis at the beginning of Army of Darkness of what happens on Evil Dead 2.It has quite good special effects for its time, I would say... The army of skeletons is very well made.

If you like a movie that ties everything up for you in a nice bow, then this ain't your movie. If you don't like to think during a movie, you likely won't enjoy it. A thinking audience is what makes this movie enjoyable, and almost interactive. So if you like layers- deep corridors of pleasantly distracting dialogue, and creative plot twists, then you will enjoy this quite a bit. My recommendation is to view yourself more than the movie the first time you watch it. Learn your own reactions and responses, but keep your speculations to a minimum. After the initial viewing, you can enjoy analyzing this movie as many times as you want. The people in this movie are beautiful to look at. There is a dark undertone, and if that's your thing, you'll find the ambiance very comfortable. The soundtrack starts off well and gets better. By the end of the movie, the music haunts you as much as the plot. The camera angles and filming are intoxicating. When you see a very empty Times Square, keep in mind that there's no computer animation here, that's really Times Square on a Sunday morning-it's amazing that they were able to do that.For me, this movie was pure candy, and the flavor sticks around for a while. Spoilers follow.A few beginning scenes may make one wonder where the splice actually happened. But then the main character's dreams are prominent and sometimes nearly prophetic in the film, so one can still take the splice explanation at face value. Also, after the splice happens it is interesting to witness the dialogue from the perspective of how life would unfold for David if he could always have his way. You get to see what David really wants for the people around him right after the spice. Especially how much he wanted his best friend to be his own person, and for his love interest to believe in him. Then as the Lucid Dream System's glitch rears its ugly head, David's happiness is suddenly punctuated with horrible and bizarre events. The fun in analyzing is watching the different perspectives unfold. Its fun to wonder why he chose the splice to happen on the day it did. Why didn't he choose the splice to happen before the accident? Was he willing to remember the disfigurement for the sake of keeping his stalker dead even in his Lucid Dream? The pinnacle of this movie can change at each viewing as well. It may be the moment he realizes he is in a dream, it may be the moment of the splice, or it may be the moment he decides to get in the car with his stalker. The weight to relevance of this film's many circumstances shifts more than the NASDAQ. The time line for the film is a sort of buffet- a bit of this, a touch of that. When one adds dream sequences between scenes of bliss and System Glitch to these time jumps, you end up with a delightful thinking person's plot. There are concepts in the movie that are fun to let your brain chew on. For instance, a scene that I found most amusing was when David screams for Tech Support. Wouldn't it be cool if when life started to suck, one could scream for Tech Support, and have someone show up and make everything okay? The movie proposes deep questions like how to measure the quality of life. Is a pleasurable and stimulating life worth less when it is orchestrated, rather than created by chance? Which would you choose? When you do finally learn what really happened, your head is spinning so much that you might miss the explanation. If you chose to watch it over again, you will notice something new or different every time. The backgrounds and dialogue have new things to discover and look for as well. Pop culture, trivia, and innuendo were liberally spread about in the set and script. Finally, the plot gives enough wiggle-room for the viewers to decide on the reality for themselves. Favorite quote 'You're dead and I'm frozen... and I love you.'
