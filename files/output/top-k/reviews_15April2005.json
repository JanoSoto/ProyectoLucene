It's a great werewolf film, and definitely one of the better ones out there (since i am not a fan of werewolf flicks), however i like a few and this was one of them. One of the main reasons this movie works, is the excellent chemistry between Nicholson and Pfeiffer, and it also helps, that it has a strong script and perfect pacing as well. This is one of the best werewolf movies i have seen in ages, it's a must watch!. The Direction is very good. Mike Nichols the veteran does a very good job here, with excellent camera angles, some really cool shots, creating some creepy atmosphere, and keeping the film at a very good pace!, very good job. There is a bit of blood. someone spits out blood,bloody wolf attacks,gory attack on a dear (hated in totally unnesscesary),2 severed fingers,a couple bloody slashings,pitchfork in the shoulder, and a few bloody gunshot wounds. The Acting is FANTASTIC!. Jack Nicholson is AMAZING as always, and is phenomenal here, he plays crazy like no one can, has excellent chemistry with Michelle Pfeiffer, was extremely convincing, and was tons of fun to watch!, Jack is one of the best actors of all time as far as i'm concerned (Nicholson rules!). Michelle Pfeiffer is STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS and is amazing here, she is absolute fantastic in the acting department, her character was unpredictable, and damn is she sexy!, she is especially awesome in the end all dressed in black with (spoilers), werewolf eyes!. James Spader is great as the weasel, and did his job extremely well. Kate Nelligan does her job well as the cheating bitch. Christopher Plummer adds class in his scenes, and did what he had to do perfectly, wish he had more screen time though. Overall i highly recommend this werewolf film!, it's one of the best out there. ***1\/2 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 2005","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Great werewolf film, with 2 amazing performances from Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer!.It was great to see one of my favorite actors and actresses in the same film together, and the film has great effects,however it is slow paced, so some viewers, may get impatient, however i found the pace perfect, and engrossing!.

He probably got the experience from doing 9 to 5, which also starred his co-star Lily Tomlin. Lea Thompson and Rob Schneider (Laura and Tyler) play two cons who are trying to steal the Clampett fortune. They should've known better than going up against the Clampetts. There were many other great and hilarious performances from stars like Cloris Leachman, Erika Eleniak, and Diedrich Bader.Humor There was the prefect balance of humor and seriousness in this movie.

I assume it must like an arrest warrant, but instead of arresting the target of the warrant, Van Damme gets to kill them. Pretty simple really. I mean, if Jean-Claude was only intending to ARREST the antagonists, it would be a pretty boring movie, right? Van Damme plays Louis Burke, a Canadian Mountie who never wears the proper Mountie uniform, which is a damn shame because those Mountie hats are cool. Burke is on assignment in Los Angeles, tracking down a villain known as the Sandman, bullet-proof serial-killer extraordinaire. After taking down The Sandman in the first few minutes, Burke is given another assignment The inmates of the local maximum-security prison have developed a nasty habit of being killed by ice-pick to the head. Burke's assignment is to go undercover (naturally) and find out where all these ice-picks are coming from and who is behind it. Is it a prison-gang war, or a massive conspiracy involving corrupt officials and mad scientists? Have a guess.Naturally, one would assume that a Van Damme movie - set in a prison - called 'Death Warrant' would be action packed. Unfortunately, 'Death Warrant', much like 'Legionnaire', proves that not all Van Damme movies are excuses for a showcase of spin-kicks. It is a shame that 'Death Warrant' is not as action packed as I would like it to be.

I just saw CLERKS this morning, and I enjoyed it for the most part, but it's not my favorite Kevin Smith film. It is much more subtle in its comedy, more chatty, which is fine, but somehow I like Smith's more slapsticky stuff, like MALLRATS AND J&SBSB, a lot better. Still, the annoying customers and the dead guy in the bathroom incident are very funny.I didn't like the alternate ending, so I'm glad it was left out. I guess it would have made a thoughtful statement about the irony of life and how it can suddenly end after a crummy day, but to me, it was just depressing and took away from the light mood of the film.

The movie itself have always been underrated. It was a scandal at the epoch and we can easily see why. Actually, the erotic atmosphere created by BB in Et Dieu... crea la femme is amazing even for today standards (immensely superior to that of current movies, in my personal opinion). At any rate, the scandal made the movie be automatically considered bad (needless to say, people went crazy to see it). Curiously enough, a dozen of years later several ugly movies were automatically considered good by the critics because of the scandal they raised! Now that our modern eyes no longer see the scandal, we may judge Et Dieu... crea la femme a nice film, made VERY special by Brigitte Bardot's presence. The stunning locations of a still tourism-free Cote d'Azur are beautifully photographed. The story is interesting and entertaining. Melodrama is systematically avoided. The script contains a good deal of typical French wit sharp, cynical, but with a melancholic subtext. A couple of instances. The mature gentleman Eric Carradine, trying to justify Juliete's bad behavior I am the only one to be guilty of that and the old woman Don't delude yourself, sir.... Again Carradine I fell in love with a young girl and I gave money for her to marry another man. How do you call it? and a friend I call it wisdom.Bardot brilliantly plays Juliete, a remarkably interesting character. Probably, more than her free and mindless attitude toward love affairs, Juliete's true personality may be described as anarchist selfishness. She doesn't give a damn for others. She just does everything she wants, not caring people's opinions, prejudices or feelings. She loves animals, though. A further point of interest is that, according to her own autobiography, BB's personality has some in common with that of Juliete's. I don't comment Brigitte's sex-appeal. Words are not enough, just look at her and enjoy. The life at the village on the sea and the various other characters are described with accuracy. Jurgens, Trintignant and the remainder of the cast work well.The cult-scene of the movie is Juliete's Mambo dance. Here we understand what Europeans of the 1950s thought to be a torrid scene. We also see that they were right!Seeing the movie, many are displeased that (seemingly) a dose of heavy slaps turns the wild Juliete into a devoted spouse. That looks machist ideology.

But, above all, do you think Juliete-Brigitte tamed by few hits? Come on! She accepts the slaps only because in that very moment she has thought it good to take them. But who knows the future?

But here is this part-2 which actually invented Jason and also the films' basic formula and so far, I consider this the best of the lot ( Jason Lives coming as the close second best and Jason goes to Hell being the worst). The cheesy formula of all the Friday slasher movies bunch of youngsters in Camp Crystal Lake... night falls... some have sex... one\/two girls get skinny-dip in the lake... (the lead female always most decently dressed)... silent Jason with sharp weapon... killing begins... others discover bodies before themselves become victims... Now they all started from this movie, not exactly from Part-1. And here the kills, I should say, are actually creepy.Now there are few things in this movie that are completely potty. For example, first, the girl from the first movie getting killed and second, the disgusting cloth Jason used to cover his face. It's a relief they introduced the famous hockey mask later in the series. But as I said before, every content of the slasher movie formula virtually started from this movie, balancing violence, suspense, nudity, sex and also comedy quite well.
