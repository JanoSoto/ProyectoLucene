Although author Jack Finney always played down the analogy that the story paralleled some of the political and societal paranoia of the 20th century (from the rise of Communism to McCarthyism), it ranks as one of the best films of its type, partially because of the leanness of the script and the fine acting. Finney insisted that it was simply a good story and had nothing to do with political or social commentary. But a writer is not always the best interpreter of his own work.The story is relatively simple, and that's how Finny began it. At first, a strange man, seeming close to paranoia, runs into the busy streets of a town. He is Dr Bennell and resides in the next nearest town. After being picked up and taken to a precinct by local police, Bennell tells his story. A few weeks early, people in his town started coming to him not to for medical treatment but for another reason. They think their spouses and\/or closest friends and family are somehow different. (Apparently Finny began with this premise and did not know the how of the story until later.) Tentatively Dr Bennell dismisses their concerns, thinking that it is just a psychological reaction to stress or some other rational explanation. The movie almost acts nonchalantly about the first patient. But slowly, more people begin to describe their feelings about those closest to them. Bennell realizes that a pattern is emerging that he can't ignore. Something larger is happening to the town.A great suspense\/science fiction\/horror drama that probably has no equal in the 1950's. The story takes itself seriously which prevents it from lapsing into comedic farce. And the acting is believable enough to take us all the way. A triumph of film-making on every level and influenced many later movies such as Halloween. This was originally a B picture which shows what filmmakers can do with a small budget but a great script and good actors. Few suspense movies today are as well written.

While Rebecca finds a job and tries to move on, Enid doesn't know what to do with her life and spends most of her time with Seymour (Steve Buscemi, playing the most humane variation of all the 'losers' he's been playing his whole life, and that's why he's so great at it), a lonely older man whose biggest pleasure is collecting rare, old records.The more I watch Ghost World, the more I like it. This is a very special, really beautiful film, that speaks to the heart. It's both hilarious (really one of the funniest films I've ever seen - Enid's yard sale, her first day of work at a movie theater, just to name a couple of favourite scenes, crack me up every time) and moving, with a bittersweet feel to it that's underlined by David Kitay's musical theme. Terry Zwigoff's (Crumb) script, co-written by Daniel Clowes based on his own comic books, has a remarkable respect for its characters, most of them adorable and pathetic at once - including Josh (Brad Renfro), a boy Enid and Rebecca love to mess around with. One week ago, when I was re-watching this movie with some friends who had never seen it, we commented on how miserable Josh is - and how sad it was to hear about Renfro's premature death a few days later.If you ever felt lost in your own world, not knowing what do with your life, you're gonna relate to this film. The feeling I get from it is a little similar to THAT other film with Scarlett Johansson, the sublime Lost in Translation.

Newman magnificently portrays Sully, a 60-year-old man living in a small town in upstate New York. He has a bad knee; he's suing his boss, the hard living Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis) for back wages; he flirts with the boss' wife Toby (Melanie Griffith); he rents from his old school teacher Beryl Peoples (Jessica Tandy) who depends on him; he plays poker and drinks at the local bar; and he plays the Trifecta every day. When his son Peter (Dylan Walsh) comes to town, Sully has to come face to face with the man he abandoned as a child, as well as his ex-wife. (The scene where he sneaks out of her house as everyone screams at each other is a riot.) He gets to know his little grandson, bonding with him as he never did the boy's father. Sully, who in his own way has been taking care of a lot of people in town - and driving some other ones crazy - learns the importance of a family connection and what it entails.A marvelous script, a marvelous cast, great direction by Robert Benton - Nobody's Fool is a small movie with a big message about life. Newman portrays Sully with all of his complexities. He's more a son to Beryl than her own son. He takes care of his workmate Grub (Pruitt Taylor Vance) as he never did his own son. He is there for Toby as she talks about Carl's infidelities, but he was never there for his own wife. What's most wonderful about the script is how character-driven it is and how all its messages come out of the characters. The audience is not beaten over the head with them. When Sully speaks bitterly about his late father, he turns to Peter and says, That's what you'll say about me when I'm gone. You were gone, dad, Peter says. I've already said it. Yet the two men try, without ever verbalizing that they are trying. He's there for Tandy, without a sentimental scene.Tandy is excellent as a woman who fears the loss of her independence, and fans of Nip\/Tuck will get a kick out of seeing Dylan Walsh as he was 14 years ago with his mop of hair. He does very well in his role. Bruce Willis is amazing - relaxed, funny, cheating with a smile. Philip Seymour Hoffman, before stardom hit, has a hilarious role as a policeman trying to nail Sully and not having much luck.You can't really call what Newman does acting because you won't catch him doing it - he just IS Sully. He creates an unforgettable character in this must-see film.

Think about it, did anyone give a damn about K-1, MMA or anything like that in the early 1980's? Out comes this movie and 20 years later kickboxing has become more popular than regular boxing and wrestling.Based on true events, Bloodsport centers around a secret underground kickboxing tournement called the Kumite (pronounced Koo-Mitt-Tay) that has been around for thousands of years. Jean Claude Van Damme plays Frank Dux (as in put up your dukes), an American of French decent who stumbles upon an old Chinese martial arts teacher who teaches him the way of the warrior so to speak. Many years later the teacher is near death and Frank pledges to win the Kumite in his honor. Standing in his way is Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) , the current champion along with Helmer and Rawlins (Forrest Whitaker), two American agents assigned to bring Dux back to the US unharmed since its revealed Dux is a captain in the US military and wasn't supposed to be in this thing.I say the actual Kumite scenes were done well in terms of the actual fighting but the transition and timing was downright awful. In one scene Chong Li snaps Suan Parades (Tong Po from Kickboxer) leg and then the next scene shows Dux fighting someone else with Parades sitting in the stands unharmed. I think the Parades\/Chong fight was supposed to be one of the last but it fit better in the music montage so they jumped the gun with it. Later on the big sumo Pumala is visbily shown sitting behind Jackson and Lin, and while he's fighting Dux and Monkey Man you can clearly see him sitting in the same spot while he's supposed to be on the runway. Also, Dux and Chong Li looked to have fought about 10 guys between them in the first 2 days of the tournement yet Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) fights twice on the first day yet makes it to the last fight of the second day? One last thing, Dux beat his guy in 12 seconds to set the world record and later on I timed a fight where Chong Li beat a black guy in 6 seconds....wouldn't that mean he got his record back? The good news is the actual fighting and different styles more than made up for the clumsy editing and the story lines\/sub plot fit well with the overall point. Donald Gibb was hilarious in his role, and its always nice to see Tong Po with hair. Bolo Yeung looks younger than Van Damme and was a short time away from his 50th birthday during the course of filming, I didn't even believe it until I checked the bio....hell he's pushing 75 now and I bet he could make a comeback in one more flick.I don't want to give away too much but if you want full contact bloodshed and Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds throwing people around one more time, this is the movie for you. Yes there is a love plot between Van Damme and Leah Ayers and if thats not your thing hit the fast forward button, otherwise sit back with your gi and enjoy the movie.

Think about it, did anyone give a damn about K-1, MMA or anything like that in the early 1980's? Out comes this movie and 20 years later kickboxing has become more popular than regular boxing and wrestling.Based on true events, Bloodsport centers around a secret underground kickboxing tournement called the Kumite (pronounced Koo-Mitt-Tay) that has been around for thousands of years. Jean Claude Van Damme plays Frank Dux (as in put up your dukes), an American of French decent who stumbles upon an old Chinese martial arts teacher who teaches him the way of the warrior so to speak. Many years later the teacher is near death and Frank pledges to win the Kumite in his honor. Standing in his way is Chong Li (Bolo Yeung) , the current champion along with Helmer and Rawlins (Forrest Whitaker), two American agents assigned to bring Dux back to the US unharmed since its revealed Dux is a captain in the US military and wasn't supposed to be in this thing.I say the actual Kumite scenes were done well in terms of the actual fighting but the transition and timing was downright awful. In one scene Chong Li snaps Suan Parades (Tong Po from Kickboxer) leg and then the next scene shows Dux fighting someone else with Parades sitting in the stands unharmed. I think the Parades\/Chong fight was supposed to be one of the last but it fit better in the music montage so they jumped the gun with it. Later on the big sumo Pumala is visbily shown sitting behind Jackson and Lin, and while he's fighting Dux and Monkey Man you can clearly see him sitting in the same spot while he's supposed to be on the runway. Also, Dux and Chong Li looked to have fought about 10 guys between them in the first 2 days of the tournement yet Ray Jackson (Donald Gibb) fights twice on the first day yet makes it to the last fight of the second day? One last thing, Dux beat his guy in 12 seconds to set the world record and later on I timed a fight where Chong Li beat a black guy in 6 seconds....wouldn't that mean he got his record back? The good news is the actual fighting and different styles more than made up for the clumsy editing and the story lines\/sub plot fit well with the overall point.

There are some truly sublime set-pieces, particularly those of the planet's interior that still stand firm against most presentations today. Anyone never having seen this movie before and being suddenly presented with those tiny humans wandering about inside the colossal Krell machine would never guess that they were watching something from over 50 years ago. At the time, on the big screen, it must have been an astounding spectacle - on a par with the opening battle scene from 'Star Wars'.Panoramic landscape shots of the planet's surface also bear up pretty well under scrutiny. There's just a certain sense of 'studio' in the foreground that is reminiscent of early 'Star Trek'. That's still a very favourable comparison though - for an item dating from 1956! Certainly the star of the show is a robot called 'Robbie' that seems to take an age just to say anything. Even so, it is at least as believable as R2D2 or C3P0 - once again, creations from some 20 years later. Another commentator has suggested that it cost $10,000 to build. Factor-in inflation and that would probably translate to $250,000 dollars today. Serious Money for one piece of kit.As to the human cast; I'm no particular fan of Walter Pidgeon, he always left me with the impression of someone who thought he was better than he was. But the part of 'Morbius' exactly suits this character and he plays it with adequate - if stuffy - conviction. As to Leslie Neilsen playing a straight leading man? Well; clearly times have changed. He and his B-movie cast just about get the job done, but no cigar.And then there's the leading lady, who does what leading ladies were supposed to do in the 1950's. She provides a little interplanetary sexual dalliance. 'Ripley' she ain't. It might be science-fiction and set in the future, but all of the tiresome and sexist social mores of the 1950's appear time-proof. Ah-well; you can't have everything.

'Alien\/Aliens', 'Pitch Black', and even 'The Thing' follow a broadly similar theme.This time the beastie is human subconsciousness made manifest by Alien technology, and an excellent little chiller it proves to be. Though it does bear a passing resemblance to the 'Loonytunes' Tasmanian Devil. Perhaps, like me, Morbius has been watching too many old movies. There are some spooky moments when the entity's stealthy approach is detected by technology but yet unseen by the human characters (it's invisible, you see) a slowly-paced electronic booming-noise like an amplified heart-beat is matched by huge and bizarre footprints just appearing in the soft earth. An electric-field apparently shorts-out for no reason... That 'magic footprint' trick is also seen in 'Night Of The Demon', whilst electronic detection of the unseen is likewise reprised in Alien(s).And naturally there are some ray guns - at least as good as 'Star Trek's' 'Phasers'.Rather experimentally, there is no theme or incidental music to this movie. All of the audio 'infil' is provided by a seemingly endless and random electronic noise. You may or may not like the effect, but it's a brave effort nonetheless.

There are simple visual touches, amid what looks like a standard-shot thriller (when compared to, say, M, which is Godly in its vision of the darkness of humanity's layers peeled back). But it's got the kind of grit to it that most likely inspired Dirty Harry, even if, arguably, Glenn Ford isn't quite as great a star as Clint Eastwood. He's got a style to himself, anyway, like someone who is almost TOO good, and knows it, which is why he'll get the job done even if it means some busted knuckles and a few cracked heads. He's a compelling force as Dave Bannion, and he's perfectly cast against a bunch of sinister, slimy characters (save for the women, and even one of them is just rotten).After a cop seems to have killed himself, the case looks open and shut. But there seems to be more for Bannion, as he didn't seem like a guy, from some accounts, to do himself in. Turns out there's a big cheese named Lagana who wants this put hush-hush like, and pays off the widow to keep a letter he wrote under wraps. But Bannion is suddenly put to the test, if only of himself, when his family is put in danger (with, of course, tragic results). Lang doesn't stop for a detail that isn't worthy of the attention of the narrative, and there's a connection that he makes between the world of the criminal underworld and the law it's a place where there's some gray, but the black and white aspect rings through due to the situation at hand corrupt cops, dirty criminals, and only a couple of dames to trust in the mix of it (one of them Debby, played in another great turn by Gloria Grahame, takes a savage incident with a pot of coffee via Lee Marvin's hand to wise up).It might not have the depth of an M or Scarlett Street, but the Big Heat is about as solid a genre piece as one could ask for, getting more harrowing from the first gun shot of the picture all the way to the final moment when Bannion leaves the office for a hit-and-run case (a cop's work is never finished, one might suggest). It's also got more intelligence for its conventional roots with the little things; for example, there's a point in the movie where something pivotal could've happened with Bannion's daughter and the thugs, but Lang makes a good step to push aside it, keeping the focus squarely on the task at hand instead of sidestepping the climax into cliché. Land understands how, for the sake of a piece of pulp fiction like this, to keep the lines in order, even if it might seem standard for today keep Bannion's family wholesome, maybe TOO wholesome, with stories of three little kittens, and keep the criminal elements savage, sinister in their grins and suits and violence brimming underneath.One things for sure, it doesn't get much less thrilling than seeing Ford and Marvin in an unpredictable shoot-out.

Then you have some idea of what Elia Kazan was trying to say in A Face In The Crowd. A few years later there's no way on the planet that Andy Griffith could have been cast as Larry 'Lonesome' Rhoads the John Doe of American nightmares. Griffith had starred on Broadway in No Time for Sergeants, cut some comedy albums, did some television appearances, but he was not a big or a small screen name. So with no image to counteract, Elia Kazan could cast him and he gives one powerful performance. But it never would have happened had he been Sheriff Andy Taylor first.Local radio station manager Patricia Neal discovers this country boy philosopher in the local jail in her Arkansas home town. Seeing he's got charisma, she puts him on the air. She figures she has another Will Rogers on her hands, but Griffith proves to be a far more malevolent person than Will Rogers ever was. Rogers was the guy who said he never met anyone he didn't like. Griffith feels there isn't anyone he ever met he couldn't clip. The frightening thing is he comes real close to proving it.Some future stars make some early appearances in A Face In The Crowd besides Griffith. Anthony Franciosa is the smooth talking ad man who rides a good thing when he sees it and that comment can be taken a lot of ways. Lee Remick is the wide-eyed cheerleader seduced by Griffith, and the good life. Walter Matthau who in his early years played a lot of hoodlums in this case is the writer who catches on early what Griffith is all about. My favorite is Kay Medford however. She has only one scene in the film with Patricia Neal. But she really scores with it as Griffith's forgotten wife who even when tipsy knows exactly how much of a piece she can get on his celebrity.A Face In The Crowd is written by Budd Schulberg who along with Elia Kazan were friendly witnesses at the House Un American Activities Committee. The ironic thing is that both these guys considered themselves as men of the left and certainly A Face In The Crowd wasn't written by any Republican. The unkindest cut of all to Elia Kazan was the fact he got booed at the Oscars when he received a deserved Lifetime Achievement Award and was eulogized eloquently by Pat Buchanan when he died. What a world.Eleven years after A Face In The Crowd came out, Kazan and Schulberg proved to be prophets of sorts when George C. Wallace ran for president. If his campaign wasn't a 'Lonesome Rhoads' special I don't know what was.Of course Griffith falls, but how he falls is something else. I won't reveal it, but think back to that much imitated ending from another Elia Kazan masterpiece, A Streetcar Named Desire.A Face In The Crowd is a very relevant film today considering the influence some of these pious country types have in the religious right of today.

Johnny Depp stars as the title character, a man - made boy whose inventor father dies before he could replace Edward's scissor hands with human hands. Living alone in an old mansion, the local Avon lady visits and takes Edward under her wing, introducing him into a society through his topiary and hairdressing skills. There, Edward learns that the power of love in some people can overcome physical appearances, while in others; it merely causes fear and anger.Depp's performance is, in one word, extraordinary. Even with very few lines, he has this incredible ability to be as physically expressive as silent stars; he is (I believe) one of very few actors who can achieve this expertise today. Always a very attentive performer, Depp creates an Edward that is rigid, self - conscious, and apprehensive in many ways. The various emotions that play across his face throughout the film is why Depp is, or if not should be, classed as one of our best character actors in the 2Oth Century. From the first moment I saw Edward, I immediately felt sorry for him. Subject to his facial expressions and the way he talks and acts around the unusual surroundings he encounters, Depp's character is almost like a little child lost in a world he has never known before, which he portrays brilliantly.Burton's creation of fantasy films seems to come naturally to him, which is why this film works so well and shows off his outstanding talent and imagination. How he manages to create a world that is so intristic, yet to the audience it doesn't seem legitimate, amazes me. He dreams up a town that is so pastel and like everyone living in that town is stuck in this bubble, which in some way Edward seems to pop that bubble and open the residents to see the real world. No other director could make a film that contains that mix of fantasy added with humour and drama and actually make it work more than Burton.The use or eerie music helps to establish each scene as individual and unique. Created by Danny Elfman, each piece of score identifies with the characters, more so with Edward, as when he creates his topiary; the fast score fits perfectly with the scene. In some way it displays Edward's concentration and talent while producing his art to its full extent.For me, the best part of this movie is just how Burton combines the different genres used horror, fantasy, romance, drama and comedy. His capability to do this blows me way and added with Depp's truly stunning performance, this film makes me want to watch it over and over again.

Fortunately, The Big Red One doesn't fall into either of those categories. Maybe its the fact it was directed by Samuel Fuller, a real life combat veteran, but it presents war in the way I'd imagine it to really be like.

There's the boring and watered down PG13 tripe, the lousy and suspense free torture porn (exemplified by the absolutely worthless Eli Roth), or smug self-referential slasher flicks that follow in the footsteps of Scream (at least the later category seems to be fading out a bit recently). Thats why I really enjoyed Session 9. Sure, its far from perfect, but it honestly tries to create something original and frightening. Its a modern American horror film that doesn't make you feel like a complete idiot afterwards. Brad Anderson has fashioned an engrossing (and quite scary) exploration of the human mind. The film is original and free of clichés, which makes it quite refreshing when compared what gets labeled horror nowadays.Anderson's direction itself is pretty good. Its rather slowly paced, which will probably turn off a lot of horror fans. Still, its worth sticking with when it gets to the scares in the second half. It proves that with a bit of imagination and enthusiasm, it doesn't matter how low your budget is. The fact I was engrossed despite knowing the twist ending ahead of time (from having it spoiled for me by a review) is very impressive - the less you know about this one though going in, the better. After watching this and The Machinist, I have a lot of hope for Anderson. The acting all around is superb - creating realistic working stiff guys you actually manage to feel sympathy towards. Peter Mullan (who was impressive in Trainspotting a while ago but than seems to have disappeared) is particularly impressive as the crew leader who's going through a rough time.Ultimately, what made Session 9 worthwhile was the fact that after watching it, my two friends and I debated what actually happened and tried to put the plot and themes together for a good half hour. How many horror flicks can you say that about? Session 9 is the best psychological thriller since Jacob's Ladder.

Bob Guccione's Caligula might have been something truly memorable and noteworthy, but it ends up being nothing more than simply notorius. It isn't just the eye-opening hard core sex and violence that mars this film. The film is hurt every bit as much by the terrible editing, lack of cohesive plot, and the general ugliness of its tone. The film is still viewed regularly, and has more than made a profit. Mostly because of the curiosity factor. Once the viewer gets used to the copious amounts of gratuitous nudity, torture, and explicit sex, they quickly notice that there isn't much else to this project.A very entertaining project could certainly be made about the pagan ruler Caligula of early A.D. Rome. And Malcolm McDowell is certainly a great choice for the title role. As Caligula, McDowell basically gets to extend his lusty fantasy he has mid way through A Clockwork Orange. Imagine Alex from that film as emperor of the known world, and that's the perspective this film takes. There really isn't much of a linear story here. Gore Vidal wrote the original script but who knows how much of the finished product is his idea. Likely not much since he would later disown the film. Director Tinto Brass did likewise after producer Guccione insisted on editing the film himself. He is apparently the one to blame for all the incessant zooming in and out throughout the film. It seems like they rarely even knew the right perspective in which to shoot most of these scenes. The post dubbing of voices is all too apparent, and the running length is ultimately just too long. Some of the sets look impressive, and it must be noted that the acting is often very convincing. There are some big named actors here like John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole that should be ashamed for appearing in this. McDowell has always been a daring performer who brings such effort to his character that he can be forgiven. Incredibly, Bob Guccione was originally trying to get John Huston and Jack Nicholson. At least they had the good sense to pass.Overall, it was the mean and cynical tone of the film that put me off the most. The technical problems were also too much to overlook. Another problem was the lack of historical perspective. The film never really defines Caligula, or the times in which he ruled. And there really aren't enough actual porn scenes to satisfy the horny voyeur who might only be looking to get off. The film is pretty much a failure at every level.

Pressburger once said of his colleague He knows what I am going to say even before I say it &#151; maybe even before I have thought it &#151; and that is very rare. You are lucky if you meet someone like that once in your life. Though I had previously seen and loved 'Peeping Tom (1960)' Powell's solo effort, a shocking and daring horror\/thriller that arguably brought down his career, I remained keenly interested in seeing my first P&P collaboration, and so I was delighted to find the Criterion Collection DVD of 'I Know Where I'm Going! (1945).' Perhaps it's the extensive on-location photography, or the distinctive local accents, but there's something about this film that sets it apart from Hollywood romances of the era, in the same way that the Ealing Studios comedies of the 1940s and 50s are like nothing ever to come out of the United States.The first thing you'll notice about 'I Know Where I'm Going!' is the absolutely exquisite cinematography by Erwin Hillier, who captures the Scottish countryside in glorious, crisp black-and-white, shooting the entire film without a light meter. The pristine landscapes are absolutely breathtaking; you can almost feel the soft breeze blowing against your face, the silent shudder of the trees as a storm rolls overhead. This environment is the perfect stage for the events of the film, as ambitious and independent Englishwoman, Joan Webster (Wendy Hiller) comes to meet an array of lively and free-spirited locals, representing a simpler lifestyle that she could never have imagined falling in love with. 'I Know Where I'm Going!' is also a miracle of clever editing, considering the male co-star, Roger Livesey, never came within 500 miles of the primary shooting location having an unavoidable stage commitment in London. Editor John Seabourne was given the monumental task of seamlessly blending close-up shots of Livesey in the studio with middle-distance shots of the actor's double in Scotland; the result is perfectly deceptive.Powell and Pressburger, as was typical for their pictures, shared a writing credit for the film, which is a celebration of the common man, a popular theme of British cinema, I've found, during that time period. Wendy Hiller's heroine, an independent but somewhat conceited woman, is hampered in her attempts to join her older, wealthier fiancé, Sir Robert Bellinger, on the island of Kiloran. Instead, she is left with Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesey), a humble naval officer on leave from the military. Despite initially feeling foreign and uncomfortable in the unfamiliar lodgings of the locals, Joan eventually comes to appreciate their unashamed simplicity, most noticeable in the stark contrast between the upper-class residents' dull, stuffy bridge game, and the servants' lively and musical birthday celebration for one of their oldest residents. Despite her insistence that she knows where she's going, Joan also discovers that fate might be nudging her in a completely different direction. Why can't she travel to the island to marry Sir Bellinger? The answer to this question might not have anything to do with the weather at all perhaps, deep down, she knows that she can do a lot better.
