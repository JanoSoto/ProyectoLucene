I don't buy for a second, that Cameron cared about the real tragedy, the victims, or the heroes! I firmly believe that Cameron's sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet! Critics praised it as a masterpiece, Teen and preteen girls swooned, and before you knew it, this rancid, vomit inducing, cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time! Before I begin, let me just clarify one thing I don't hate this movie because it was a hit, I hate this movie for much more than that! So the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the Titanic. They're searching for something, but we don't know what that exactly is yet. They find an old safe, and decide to bring it up to the surface. They cheer, pop champagne bottles, and celebrate that they've found what they've been looking for. However, once the safe is opened, they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace. Some time later, a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters' expedition. An old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing, contacts the leader of the expedition, and they bring her to where they are. We find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace, and that she is the woman in the drawing. So the film then goes into her story, and to sum it all up, we get the same old cliché-ridden love story, we've all seen before! Two people from two different worlds fall in love, and everything is working against their union. Some of you out there might be thinking that I hate this movie because I'm a guy, and generally, guys hate love stories. but that's not the case. I liked the movie Moulin Rouge, and I loved the movie The Notebook. The difference between those movies and this movie is They actually did something NEW with that basic plot! Unlike Titanic, in which the only thing new is that that it happens on the Titanic. In the story, we meet characters that have the names of real people. These people include Captain E.J. Smith, Designer Thomas Andrews, Builder Bruce Ismay, Crewman William Murdoch, and passengers, John Jacob Astor and The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them? NO! These Characters are nothing more than plot devices! THIS, is the reason why I hate this movie! It is an insult to these people's family and memory to portray them this way! Specifically, William Murdoch's and Molly Brown's. In reality, these people were heroes! In this film however, Molly Brown is used as a comic relief, and William Murdoch, is made into a villain! James Cameron, How dare you!! In 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released, and everyone hated it. People have said that the movie was poorly written, the plot was horribly cliché, and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy. What people fail to realize is This is exactly what Titanic was! Why is Pearl Harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage, while a few years earlier, Titanic did the EXACT same thing and it's labeled a masterpiece! If you're going to hold Michael Bay's feet to the fire for Pearl Harbor, you might as well do the same to James Cameron. I know a lot of people still love this movie, and that's fine, to each their own. In my opinion however, there will never be enough hatred for this film, Even if everyone in the world turned around and suddenly hated it, it still wouldn't be enough!

But at the same time couldn't help but be amazed at the same time because your seeing something big just tear down structures that over tower you, there's something strangely gratifying about that. This film was the first and in my book is still the best, it's also one of my favorite movies in general.Despite how old this version is, I still think it's holds up the best because it's doing it's own thing and back then it was never sought to be a franchise. Here this is a straight forward sci-fi horror that pretty much fits in with a long line of the sci-fi in the 50's like The Thing from Another World and many others back when there were Movie Drive Ins (damn I miss them).Everything about this film for me is great, I do love the special effects because their practical. I really liked the construction of the miniatures, you buy that their the actual buildings. Well OK, in some places you can tell one or two are miniatures, same could be said even in the latter films but I feel in a strange way that's part of the film's charm, giving it an almost a small light hearted sensibility let alone at least with the miniature they tried, much like in the effects for those amateur web series like Video Game High School.However I really like the destruction effects which are very cool because like I sad practical, all those models\/miniatures that you see blown away are all real pyrotechnics.But the main attraction is Godzilla himself whom doesn't disappoint and still doesn't to this day, I really like the old design of the costume, the make up affects I thought were fantastic, he looks shaped almost like and looks a bit like a T-Rex but with reptilian features to make him unique enough and stand out on his own. He's both really cool but at the same time really menacing where one look at him could make anyone almost nervous.And the features like the growl which to this day still would shake anyones boots, there is almost a strange emotional sensibility about it as it seems like a growl of angry but also immense pain which almost gives the creature a sympathetic sensibility. And just seeing him just deconstruct Tokyo is a lot of fun and a bit scary at the same time, the fun of seeing him destroy the city is almost like how any kid would play with building blocks building tall structures and then just knocking them down. And my favorite feature is the radioactive breath which is cool, much like a dragon with it's breath of fire.The human characters are solid they serve their functions, however the one that stands out is Professor Tomoe whom is a sympathetic and tragic human protagonist, whom has a weapon that can possibility destroy Godzilla but it could also do great damage to mankind whoever hands possess it. It pretty much the damned if you do, damned if you don't dilemma, either way your kinda fraked.But what I also love the most is the music, the theme song is one of my favorite theme songs of all time, it fits with the character as it has an epic and menacing tone. And the cinematography is excellent, it has a documentary style to it which really adds to the darkness of this film because it gives it almost a sense of reality. One of the series of shots that stands out was seeing the aftermath of the destruction. Unlike most super sized foe films or even comic book films, those series of shots shows how the dire consequences of that destruction. As we see the amount of casualties there are, some people even a little girl has severe burns, I'll admit seeing those images was a bit shocking and sad. It really makes you concerned about the lives of everyone in Tokyo real made you feel what's happening matters and also made you question may'be even a little ashamed at some of the joy you took from the demolition scenes, hence the reality of destruction it's never without consequences.However what makes this Gozilla to me stand apart from the rest is just the fact that this wasn't really meant to be just a fun and games monster fest like the rest in the series were but it actually had some substance and heart.The film was also meant to be a metaphor on the fear of our sick and addictive need for weponization and progress and paying the price for it in the aftermath. Or how something we don't entirely understand or control in science will eventually destroy us. But also our conflicting dynamic between savagery and civility, from the weapons that we currently create and the gratification we sometimes get from destruction shows despite how many rules and advancements we've made in time, deep down we still might be bloodthirsty savages.Godzilla has made a big impression on Tokyo and our hearts.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Gozilla has always been a figure in my childhood and was the first monster in film I've ever seen, I remember when I was 7 the concept of a big monster rolling in to destroy your hometown kinda terrified me, who the heck wouldn't be afraid of something as big as a dinosaur trying to destroy you.

Both of them are single, lonely, missing the father, and feeling they've achieved what they could in their lives. She always retains control even when not the only authority(even in that situation, she doesn't give any), keeps her distance, doesn't smile, and claims to have no emotion. Her love of the music, that we are at times given rich explanations of, fits with her personality, and vice versa - clear rules for what is right and what is wrong, intelligent and reserved, refusing to cater to the masses. But she does have violent fantasies, and when she meets the young enthusiast of the classics Walter(Magimel, fantastic, holding his own against a woman 20 years his senior), she may be able to live them out - even if doing so poses great risks to herself.This is gripping from start to finish. It is not for everyone, and I mean no offense to those who aren't in the intended audience. There are a lot of long takes with few people in the shot, a lot of silence, few cuts or close-ups, little in the way of movement of the camera, and largely basic angles and compositions. It's driven by the acting and dialog(with many mean, even cruel, lines, to an extent equally divided between the leads - there is no room for failure in the perfectionist world of performing arts that require that much talent, nor is there a way to impress, at most, be thought to be good enough). There are no real plot twists, merely a spiral towards the inevitable awful outcome. This sets up some themes and characters, and explores them, thoroughly. Our protagonist has no make-up, and this is an example of this not holding back, not covering up imperfections, it is bare and harsh, and all the better for it. This is only the second film of Michael Haneke I've watched, the other being The White Ribbon, but I love both of them, and will be seek out more of his work.This goes into selfishness vs. sacrifice, disgust vs. understanding, complete acceptance vs. unrepentant rejection, what is proper and what is not. Add to that the way the world of yesterday's sensual (in direct contact with, not theory but talent for playing, composing) love of art being shoved aside by, and for the sake of, modern intellectualism(study of theory) and crowd-pleasers such as sports. Most of all, it is about sado-masochism. This goes into that subject without misrepresenting(unlike 50 Shades of Grey) and free of judgment. It is, however, deeply unsettling, showing the negatives that can come from it, whilst clearly showing that they aren't inherent to it. When it isn't practiced in a healthy relationship based on trust, where the partners use safe-words, consent and aftercare. Because when someone has suppressed something for the longest time, it can be an explosion when the faucet is finally turned on. We see how the greatest perversity may be borne of the strongest repressive environment, and that just because one's sexuality has not been expressed, doesn't mean it's gone.This contains a near-constant tension, mostly regarding disturbing content, a lot of sexuality, some of it graphic and\/or violent. It is a movie that is sometimes arousing, other times revolting, one that dares you to look on yet is impossible to take your eyes off. I recommend this to everyone who is not put off by the subject nor the unflinching approach to it. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Being a piano teacher in a school isn't necessarily the most compelling job.

It's driven by the acting and dialog(with many mean, even cruel, lines, to an extent equally divided between the leads - there is no room for failure in the perfectionist world of performing arts that require that much talent, nor is there a way to impress, at most, be thought to be good enough). There are no real plot twists, merely a spiral towards the inevitable awful outcome. This sets up some themes and characters, and explores them, thoroughly. Our protagonist has no make-up, and this is an example of this not holding back, not covering up imperfections, it is bare and harsh, and all the better for it. This is only the second film of Michael Haneke I've watched, the other being The White Ribbon, but I love both of them, and will be seek out more of his work.This goes into selfishness vs. sacrifice, disgust vs. understanding, complete acceptance vs. unrepentant rejection, what is proper and what is not. Add to that the way the world of yesterday's sensual (in direct contact with, not theory but talent for playing, composing) love of art being shoved aside by, and for the sake of, modern intellectualism(study of theory) and crowd-pleasers such as sports. Most of all, it is about sado-masochism. This goes into that subject without misrepresenting(unlike 50 Shades of Grey) and free of judgment. It is, however, deeply unsettling, showing the negatives that can come from it, whilst clearly showing that they aren't inherent to it. When it isn't practiced in a healthy relationship based on trust, where the partners use safe-words, consent and aftercare. Because when someone has suppressed something for the longest time, it can be an explosion when the faucet is finally turned on. We see how the greatest perversity may be borne of the strongest repressive environment, and that just because one's sexuality has not been expressed, doesn't mean it's gone.This contains a near-constant tension, mostly regarding disturbing content, a lot of sexuality, some of it graphic and\/or violent. It is a movie that is sometimes arousing, other times revolting, one that dares you to look on yet is impossible to take your eyes off. I recommend this to everyone who is not put off by the subject nor the unflinching approach to it. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"14 May 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Ten Lessons I Learned With The GodfatherLesson IA truly rich man is one who has powerful friends.

Of course, like many, I was deterred by the B&W, but eventually I just decided to try it. I went into the movie, thinking thoughts like,come on greatest war movie of all time, show me what you've got!. As the movie began, I was quickly impressed not only by the excellent cinematography, but the outstanding script as well. As the plot sets itself up, you will notice that the film provides fantastic atmosphere, and deals with major subjects going on during world war 1. For example, when the General talks to the shell shocked soldier, and the sheer brutality with which he handled the situation was magnificent, and was very believable. I loved the fact that the movie doesn't leave a single issue of world war 1 untouched, from the shell shock to the mice and rats that infested the trenches. By now I was very interested, but it wasn't until shortly after during the actual battle sequence that I was utterly consumed by the movie. The scene where Colonel Dax was just walking through the trenches past his soldiers so determinedly, not even turning his head for the madness around him can not be described as anything other than pure genius. The rest of the movie grips you and never let's you let go, and throughout depicts many subtle messages, that not only detail the horrors of war, but also study the psychology of man. You just need to watch it with an absolute open mind to fully understand it, as this movie does not shove symbolism into your face like Pearl Harbor. Instead it subtlety displays various messages which could be deciphered by different people as to mean different things.

They are present in the material world no matter how many times they're resurrected from the dead. That is, except for Freddy Krueger, who is the exact opposite of every other character. He literally doesn't exist, unless you're asleep. If you're asleep, then you should worry. Who knew that while even sleeping you couldn't be safe? Well, this is what happens to a group of teenagers who discover they are being haunted by the same creeper every night when they fall asleep. Sounds fun.The girl who realizes this ongoing trend is Nancy Thompson played by Heather Langenkamp. Langenkamp is another one of those special actresses where credit must be given for giving her character amiability. Just like Kirsty Cotton from Hellraiser (1987) and Laurie Strode from Halloween (1978), Nancy is a character that shows strong courage in the face of severe danger - even if they do scream. But then again, who wouldn't if you truly had to face these menacing demons? Freddy Krueger is played by Robert Englund and although he barely has any dialog, the fact that his cackle is all that he really needs, makes him all the more intimidating. Aside from these two main actors, audiences will also get to see John Saxon from Enter the Dragon (1973) play Nancy's father, Charles Fleischer who later plays as Roger Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and playing Nancy's boyfriend is the now ever famous Johnny Depp.The writer behind this movie is Wes Craven (who's also directing). What helps this movie elevate itself among other horror franchises is the fact that it relies on a whole different way of surviving. Forget running away. You can't escape your dreams if you're tired enough. At some point, you will fall asleep. Most people can not avoid sleep so either way, Freddy will find you. Adding to this different angle of suspense are Wes Craven's heavy-handed gore scenes and uncomfortable imagery. Many of these scenes involve realistic looking practical effects, which will keep the audience guessing whether the character is dreaming, or not. Also, there are some scenes that are just downright creepy. Being haunted by ghosts are not the best memories people would like to relive.But perhaps one the weaker parts of Craven's writing is the explanation to Krueger's special abilities. His backstory is elaborated on which is great, but the actual information about his demonic powers are never talked about. It would be nice to know. Plus, there is a point in the film where it's kind of explained on how he continues to exist but even then there isn't much explanation given. Not sure if it was supposed to be left unexplained but it could've have been, to clear things up. Finally, the last element that really helped this film was Charles Bernstein's score. His main theme which consists of a tune not only fits the story well but is rather unsettling. Although the music is enjoyable, at points it did sound like Bernstein couldn't come up with not very many other new tunes. It could've been worse though. Overall very entertaining.Wes Craven changed the game of horror when he added Freddy Krueger to the mix. Only the insomniacs are safe. The special effects are great, along with a unique story, likable characters and creepy music. Some explanations are needed from time to time though.

Well, this is what happens to a group of teenagers who discover they are being haunted by the same creeper every night when they fall asleep. Sounds fun.The girl who realizes this ongoing trend is Nancy Thompson played by Heather Langenkamp. Langenkamp is another one of those special actresses where credit must be given for giving her character amiability. Just like Kirsty Cotton from Hellraiser (1987) and Laurie Strode from Halloween (1978), Nancy is a character that shows strong courage in the face of severe danger - even if they do scream. But then again, who wouldn't if you truly had to face these menacing demons? Freddy Krueger is played by Robert Englund and although he barely has any dialog, the fact that his cackle is all that he really needs, makes him all the more intimidating. Aside from these two main actors, audiences will also get to see John Saxon from Enter the Dragon (1973) play Nancy's father, Charles Fleischer who later plays as Roger Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and playing Nancy's boyfriend is the now ever famous Johnny Depp.The writer behind this movie is Wes Craven (who's also directing). What helps this movie elevate itself among other horror franchises is the fact that it relies on a whole different way of surviving. Forget running away. You can't escape your dreams if you're tired enough. At some point, you will fall asleep. Most people can not avoid sleep so either way, Freddy will find you. Adding to this different angle of suspense are Wes Craven's heavy-handed gore scenes and uncomfortable imagery. Many of these scenes involve realistic looking practical effects, which will keep the audience guessing whether the character is dreaming, or not. Also, there are some scenes that are just downright creepy. Being haunted by ghosts are not the best memories people would like to relive.But perhaps one the weaker parts of Craven's writing is the explanation to Krueger's special abilities. His backstory is elaborated on which is great, but the actual information about his demonic powers are never talked about. It would be nice to know. Plus, there is a point in the film where it's kind of explained on how he continues to exist but even then there isn't much explanation given. Not sure if it was supposed to be left unexplained but it could've have been, to clear things up. Finally, the last element that really helped this film was Charles Bernstein's score. His main theme which consists of a tune not only fits the story well but is rather unsettling. Although the music is enjoyable, at points it did sound like Bernstein couldn't come up with not very many other new tunes. It could've been worse though. Overall very entertaining.Wes Craven changed the game of horror when he added Freddy Krueger to the mix. Only the insomniacs are safe. The special effects are great, along with a unique story, likable characters and creepy music. Some explanations are needed from time to time though.

He doesn't plod along and kill you right away, he savers the kill, allows you to run and run until you can't anymore, like a boxer waiting for the opposing fighter to tire himself out. Freddy waits until you are at your most unstable, your most vulnerable, and then, he becomes your worst nightmare, and then you die. Maybe its my sick, twisted mind, but I love that about Freddy. He knows when and how he's going to kill you, he just takes pleasure knowing that you don't know. The Freddy here is far different Freddy from the sequels. Yeah he's got a small bit of that black comedic humor about him, but for the most part, he's just flat out disturbing. The knives against the pipes, the face only slightly revealed by light, he cuts of two of his fingers and then smiles about it... thats down right mental. Always with the smiling as well, always smiling, planning, he's a cunning b@st@rd and he knows it.Of course, I couldn't make this all about Freddy. The cast of characters are the best iv seen in a slasher. They all have great personalities, there isn't any obvious person who's going to die, it seems crazy characters like this are in a film even considered a slasher. Nancy is a strong, independent character that isn't the wimpy, constantly crying character or the weirdly over-tomboyish character, she actually feels like a, get this, real person. I loved Johnny Depp here as well, his character has a name but I just call him Johnny because, well its hard not to considering how big he's become. On a side not do you think thats why a lot of young people star in horror films?, because they saw how big Depp got and thought 'I can do that', I know nobody has ever thought of that, but it would be interesting.The special effect are very good for the budget this film had. The anti gravity death scene, the blood gushing from the bed, Freddy coming out of the wall, its all really wonderful practical special effects and shows you that you don't need a big budget to produce quality effects. Overall, I cant rate this highly enough, fantastic film that works without trying to shock or scare you, it just disturbs you, it gets right under your skin and invades your safe place, your dreams. Its a film that has remained timeless even after more than 30 years and heres to 30 more years of Freddy terrorising the kids of Elm Street.

In the wake of the mammoth success of The Lion King in 1994, film studios decided to jump onto the band wagon and competed Disney at their game at making and producing quality animated films, by ripping off practically everything featured in a Disney animated film. Only a few would be as worthwhile as the Disney films, while a significant number of others failed or failed very hard. When I was very little, I used to go crazy over Quest for Camelot and I loved it so much. Times have changed and after when I finished watching the film a year ago, I saw that this film was really terrible and stupid, lacking in anything worthwhile to make this any better.I'll go into further depths about why this is an all-time worst. Kayley, who clearly rips off both Ariel and Belle, wants to become a warrior and a Knight of the Round Table, but when she gets to the forest, she becomes another damsel-in-distress who wants her a man to help her, who happens to be Garret. Bad screen writing. The obvious relationship between Kayley and Garret is not great and has little depth. That two-headed dragon, Devon and Cornwall, are absolutely and gut-wrenchingly annoying in every scene they are in and have no purpose to be in the film to begin with, except to delight the children audience, for the time being. Ruber makes for a really bad villain, character-wise. It doesn't even help that Ruber has no personality, a bland song, and some awful dialogue. Gary Oldman is a terrific character actor and this is what he had or wanted to do? He couldn't save the character or the film, when he's got a horrible script and even horrible director to work with. I want to point that chicken in the film named Bladebeak (played by Jaleel White) is the most unnecessary and worst character in the film. That chicken serves no purpose in the film (except for when he untied Kayley in Ruber's wagon and that's it) and to the moral essence of the story. To make matters worse, he would sometimes quote lines from Dirty Harry and Taxi Driver, whom he ruins the two films for me and probably everyone else. There was this scene where he takes out one of Ruber's guards and while Lady Julianna notices it, she watches the big, fat female chicken next to her that Baldebeak is her man. Honestly, Lady Julianna is meant to be a strong-willed and wise person, yet the best she could do is to watch that and not help out by fighting off Ruber's goons and protecting the people in Camelot from Ruber's ambush attack? Shameful.I cannot believe that I actually liked this movie in the first place. Quest for Camelot is a really terrible film and an awful piece of garbage that will make your head ache worse, at least when the film is in its second act. This film clearly suffers from irresponsible direction by Frederick Du Chau (Racing Stripes and Underdog, which should come as no surprise to many), unimaginative and underdeveloped screenplay, mediocre animation along with some of the most ugliest computer animation I've ever seen in a film, mostly forgettable and inane songs, childish and uninspired use of Disney-related formulas, and the most misaligned and terrible cast ever assembled in an animated feature film. Would you ever imagine people like Jessalyn Gilsig (Glee, Vikings, Nip\/Tuck), Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Glory, Robin Hood Men in Tights), Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight trilogy, Harry Potter trilogy, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Eric Idle (Monty Python), Jaleel White (Family Matters), Don Rickles (Toy Story trilogy), Jane Seymour (Wedding Crashers, Heroes), Pierce Brosnan (James Bond, Mrs. Doubtfire, Dante's Peak), Gabriel Byrne (The Usual Suspects), and Sir John Gielgud (Gandhi, The Elephant Man) to be in an animated film, featuring the respective voices of characters that do not have good character development and lacking in strong chemistry with other characters. NO!!!!! Well, that's what happened and it made matters worse. The voice acting wasn't all that spectacular anyway.As a musical, I don't like that the characters constantly burst out into song like the entire sequence is devoted to a song and not treat a sequence with respect that it's still part of the story and that a right song can bring more depth and gravitas to the character and story, you know? The songs, for the most part, are inane and forgettable. Kayley's theme On My Father's Wings does not hit the high notes and is nothing like Part of Your World. United We Stand and I Stand Alone was meh, If I Didn't Have You is too silly and childish, and Ruber's song has no merit. There are only two good songs from film, which are also the one thing that I will tolerate of the film Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli's incredible The Prayer and both the film and LeAnn Raimes version of Looking Through Your Eyes. I like the film version of the song, only when I picture the song not from the film and not within the context of the story.In conclusion, there is absolutely nothing special or extraordinary about Quest for Camelot. The script and directing are so invested in ripping off Disney, that they took the easy way in crafting the film's story, characters, and direction by filling in Disney-type character and story moments, without taking right and risky decisions that would have made the film a lot different with substantial dramatic improvement in character and story, that probably would have made the film more better and mature. Instead, this what we get a really terrible film void of originality and surprise and an awful piece of garbage. It's arguably one of the worst animated films I've ever seen.

In the wake of the mammoth success of The Lion King in 1994, film studios decided to jump onto the band wagon and competed Disney at their game at making and producing quality animated films, by ripping off practically everything featured in a Disney animated film. Only a few would be as worthwhile as the Disney films, while a significant number of others failed or failed very hard. When I was very little, I used to go crazy over Quest for Camelot and I loved it so much. Times have changed and after when I finished watching the film a year ago, I saw that this film was really terrible and stupid, lacking in anything worthwhile to make this any better.I'll go into further depths about why this is an all-time worst. Kayley, who clearly rips off both Ariel and Belle, wants to become a warrior and a Knight of the Round Table, but when she gets to the forest, she becomes another damsel-in-distress who wants her a man to help her, who happens to be Garret. Bad screen writing. The obvious relationship between Kayley and Garret is not great and has little depth. That two-headed dragon, Devon and Cornwall, are absolutely and gut-wrenchingly annoying in every scene they are in and have no purpose to be in the film to begin with, except to delight the children audience, for the time being. Ruber makes for a really bad villain, character-wise. It doesn't even help that Ruber has no personality, a bland song, and some awful dialogue. Gary Oldman is a terrific character actor and this is what he had or wanted to do? He couldn't save the character or the film, when he's got a horrible script and even horrible director to work with. I want to point that chicken in the film named Bladebeak (played by Jaleel White) is the most unnecessary and worst character in the film. That chicken serves no purpose in the film (except for when he untied Kayley in Ruber's wagon and that's it) and to the moral essence of the story. To make matters worse, he would sometimes quote lines from Dirty Harry and Taxi Driver, whom he ruins the two films for me and probably everyone else.

Hiring karate expert Mike Barnes, the two men pair him with a couple of former Cobra Kai students, in order to force Daniel to defend his championship at the prestigious karate tournament. When Mr. Miyagi refuses to train Daniel (who at first is open to the idea of defending his championship) Daniel is disheartened by Mr. Miyagi's decision, but comes to see his mentor is right in his choice of not doing so. However when Barnes & his two partners humiliate Daniel countless times & bring him to his breaking point, he agrees & signs the contract. When Mr. Miyagi yet again refuses to train Daniel, Daniel turns to Terry Silver for training who causes him to abandon everything Mr. Miyagi taught him & trains him in a much darker form of martial arts. When Daniel discovers Terry is really a devil in angels clothing, he re-teams with Mr. Miyagi who finally agrees to train him in the days leading up to the tournament.Third film in the KARATE KID series while watchable, sadly is nowhere near as good as the first two films. The problem is, is that this third film feels tired & really adds nothing new to the KARATE KID universe. Even by the time of THE KARATE KID II, you could tell that the story between Daniel LaRusso & Mr. Miyagi was pretty much over. However never doubt the power of the almighty dollar, as Columbia Pictures clearly got greedy & wanted another film in order to squeeze more cash from the KARATE KID franchise. I think the main problem I had with the film is that the script by Rob Kamen who also penned the first two, is illogical & full of holes, it not only is much darker & mean spirited than what the first two were in terms of the villains, but the villains here are so over the top, they come off as laughable, including Thomas Ian Griffith, who is so hammy as the millionaire villain, one can't help but chuckle & the film is really nothing more than a rehash of various elements of the first two, only executed with less enthusiasm & heart. The formula is here, but the magic that made it work is not. Daniel comes across as an obnoxious, whiny, complaining cry baby & clearly looks to have put on some pounds in the the years between the second & third movie & is a bit to old to be reprising the role he made his own in the original. His character of Daniel LaRusso has seemingly neither matured or evolved emotionally & even more confusing is how Daniel seems to have no memory of everything he was taught by his sensei up until this point. LaRusso is clearly nervous about facing the karate champ Barnes, which makes no sense at all, since while Barnes is a tough opponent, the match they are fighting in is for the championship only & not a fight to the death match like he had in Part II, so why is he all the sudden afraid of losing his title? Surely if he could overcome his fear of death & being scared at the end of the second movie, a title match with an opponent like this, surely wouldn't bother him. While both Ralph Macchio & Pat Morita still retain the same chemistry in their scenes together it doesn't really help all that much & Mr. Miyagi's platitudes are so trite they tend to invoke chuckles, rather than any kind of life lesson. The film yet again sets up what looks to be another new love interest for Daniel in the character of Jessica (Robin Lively) who works in the pottery shop across the street from the two men, however this plot thread proves to be utterly worthless when it turns out that she is leaving town about midway to go back & try to patch things up with her old boyfriend, which begs the question Why include her into the films story if they were going to do nothing with her? her role could so easily have been written around since the scenes with her are just pure filler. Originally she was supposed to be another love interest for Daniel, however a the request of Macchio, this was written out of the final script, when it should have been written out completely. Centering the story around the Cobra Kai leader John Creese was not needed since that story was closed in the opening shots of THE KARATE KID PART II. Returning director John G. Avildsen does well behind the camera & while the same writer & producer of the first two return, the rest of the crew is pretty much brand spanking new. The final showdown between LaRusso & the main villain at the climax lacks the power & drama & uplifting feel good climax of the original. LaRusso's mother & the weird old lady sitting outside the apartment in the original film, both make cameo appearances. Regardless of it's short comings the film marks the end of the LaRusso storyline.

Avildsen does well behind the camera & while the same writer & producer of the first two return, the rest of the crew is pretty much brand spanking new. The final showdown between LaRusso & the main villain at the climax lacks the power & drama & uplifting feel good climax of the original. LaRusso's mother & the weird old lady sitting outside the apartment in the original film, both make cameo appearances. Regardless of it's short comings the film marks the end of the LaRusso storyline. Followed by THE NEXT KARATE KID.*** stars ","genre":"Action, Drama, Family"},{"date":"14 May 2014","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" (Only mild, kinda vague spoilers so...be brave and read!)Gooooood gooooogly mooooooogly people!It's a psychological mind game!

Depicting the events of the Son of Sam serial murders in New York City (summer of 1977), Summer of Sam periodically delves into the search and capture of famed murderer (dubbed the .44 Caliber Killer) David Berkowitz. It also peeks into the lives of the people that inhabit one of the Bronx neighborhoods he was terrorizing. Sam carries with it a majestic sense of time and place. However, it packs in very tightly, too many plot layers to go along with the central story. And the fact that this is all done in almost 2 and a half hours is a jaw-dropping miracle.Seeing this film for the first time in 7 years, it made me revert back to one of my favorite Spike Lee joints which would be Clockers. With shades of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and hints of Saturday Night Fever (especially the overhead shot in Sam of the two main characters entering a discotheque), Summer of Sam is similar in structure to Clockers. But it's unable to juggle the plot points effectively like that 1995 film did. The reason It could be the script which feels too abrasive and without thoughtfulness or ambiguity. Most of the characters talk in a racist manner with huge stereotypes to go along with it. Was that the culture of New Yorkers at the time? I'm not sure because I'm not from NYC and I was only 3 when these events took place. Regardless, this could create a rather large unlikability factor with the audience, an audience who invests their time to view this flick. In essence, Summer of Sam is the epidemy of restless, scatter shot film making. Spike Lee has harbored this style ever since he burst onto the scene with 1986's She's Gotta Have It. Sometimes he gets away with it and sometimes he doesn't. But you can't fault him for directing films that feel alive and have a pulsating sense of urgency. With his plot over plot over plot way of doing things, he unfortunately gets a mixed review from me. Bottom line Sam is a mess but it's an ambitious mess with a couple of really powerful scenes that hint at what a great film this could have been (one of the best sequences is a fantastic montage of sights and sounds accompanied by the tune of The Who's Baba O' Riley). With this vehicle, you get a great soundtrack (a mix of classic rock from The Who and disco) and two edgy performances (John Leguizamo as Vinny and Mira Sorvino as Dionna) that highlight the strong points. Also, the appearance of real life columnist Jimmy Breslin (he received letters from the killer and narrates the beginning\/ending of the movie) is a nice touch. But like I said earlier, Sam tries to include everything. You have plot elements such as the infidelity of Vinny in his marriage to Dionna, the glory of the 1977 New York Yankees, the supposed birth of the punk rock movement, and even the local mob joining the police to find the would be Son of Sam murderer. So OK, let's be honest, Summer of Sam is not that bad of a film. But it's way too cynical and ideological to be great. I'll leave you with this notion In New York City, the summer of 77' was one of the hottest on record. After viewing Lee's exhausting, profanity laden marathon of a movie, you may feel just lukewarm.

Though, gotta give it that The movie is still pretty funny, which, however, is expected of a comedy movie.Even though this movie is a tad longer than the first part, I just could not find myself puzzle over the (admittedly rather Indiana-Jones-like) case this time, whereas I had much fun doing that over the case in the first one. Simply put No suspense whatsoever in this one.As stated above, though, I did have to laugh quite a few times at the jokes presented in 'Ace Ventura When Nature Calls', which is not the only good thing (of course). This movie does still have an interesting story, which I believe to be quite surreal compared to the first movie, though that adds some more ridiculous vibe to this comedic title.Summarizing, there is only one thing left to say If you solely watch this movie for the comedic purpose, you shall have a great time!
