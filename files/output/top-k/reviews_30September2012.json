The Hey Arnold Movie confirmed the idea that a movie based off a TV show is the death of the series. The plot to this movie was silly, the voices were off, and even the animation didn't look right. I wanted so much more from this movie and I was so disappointed because I loved the series itself so much. It was one of my favorites and as a fan I felt betrayed by this piece of garbage. The plot to this movie is a millionaire named Scheck wants to destroy Arnold's neighborhood to build a mall complex. That's it, and it was pathetic. First of all, that is the big problem in the movie and we find that out within the first five minutes of the movie. Arnold and Gerald are walking down the street and then a giant TV shows up with Scheck's face on it explaining his plan. I thought it was weak. The major problem came up and appeared way too soon. Build a story, a backbone, and then develop a conflict. It was upsetting, and then it got worse when Arnold had about a month to save the neighborhood. Noble of Arnold to be the hero and try to save the neighborhood and obviously that works for the story and fits his character. Arnold is the main character and the hero, and as the hero he does his job. Here was a major problem, they had a month and in a short montage the month passes and ideas t save the neighborhood disappeared. The block party was a great idea but it came and went so fast and was so unimportant. The countdown literally goes from thirty days to two days in a matter of seconds. Time was wasted and so much potential was lost. Businesses and houses had to sell and just a few days before the demolition, Grandpa tells a story of the tomato incident. Long story short, the boarding house and the rest of the neighborhood is a national landmark. Hope remains for little Arnold and his neighborhood. I was perfectly fine with the story of the tomato incident and how Scheck was involved. It was a story that fit with a cartoon and certainly was entertaining. Why was this story not told earlier? Now the rest of the story has to be crammed into two days for Arnold to save the neighborhood. There was so much time wasted for nothing. This movie was only 76 minutes, that's only a little over an hour. Most animation films are around 90 minutes. Nonetheless, Arnold and Gerald go on a mission for one last hurray before the bulldozers destroy their past and future. Big Bob Pataki had to be involved somehow; he is a sort of villain throughout the entire series. He has a deal with Scheck to build a beeper emporium and promises Helga she will be rich. Thus creates an inner problem with Helga, which was perfectly fine. I will give the movie credit; they do stick to some of their roots and gave some fans what they were looking for. Her role in the movie was appropriate but she exposed her secret. She proclaimed her love to Arnold and a major part of the series was keeping that a secret. Now, I had mixed emotions for that scene. A big part of me hated it because it is a line a cartoon should not cross. A cartoon never reveals a question like that; It would be like Plankton getting the Krabby Patty recipe. Another part of me likes it and gave the film credit for taking that risk and making that jump. Arnold now knows and nothing will ever be the same. It could have been the destruction of the series, or a risk worth taking. In the end Arnold asked Helga if she meant it and she obviously denied the entire thing so I guess it really doesn't matter but that is up to the viewer. In the end Scheck loses because he burns the document proving the neighborhood is a landmark and he loses. And overall, this movie was incredibly disappointing, and I wish t could have been remade. The animation was sloppy. Everything looked so depressing and dirty. The characters even looked different and the voices were different. It had a different vibe that was not the Hey Arnold vibe. This movie was an abomination to a great TV series and joins Dinotopia and Passion of the Christ in getting the WillyT seal of disapproval. The seal of disapproval is the seal of approval turned upside-down and just means shame on the director and actors for trying. They disappointed their true fans and is a disgrace. Don't watch it, don't buy it, and don't even download it for free. It is not worth it, take it from me, I am the expert.

This film shows Indy racing with the Nazis to attempt to uncover the lost Ark of the Covenant from the Christian Bible. Through the movie he faces many dangerous scenarios, cunningly escaping with a combination of wits and physical prowess. Aided by his now-famous whip in tight confrontations, and aided by his professor's cunning in puzzle situations, he skillfully demonstrates the ability to come out on top of every encounter.In the first scene of the movie, Indiana Jones is on an expedition to some country in South America where he goes into a cave and has to outsmart different levels of puzzles to eventually get a golden idol. He evades every trap, gets to the idol, and then outruns a giant boulder to the exit. Upon arrival at the exit, his archenemy Belloq confronts him with a small army and takes the idol from him. Seeing Indy escape so many perils with such skill foreshadows his ability to escape from great peril throughout the movie. Pretty early in the movie Indy meets with a woman named Marion who will have some clue about the location of the Ark. It becomes clear that she and Indy had a romantic past and shortly thereafter we learn that she also had a past with Belloq. Whenever a movie has two archenemies and a common romantic interest, the bad guy will take the girl captive and the hero will rescue her. Believe it or not, that all happens later on.One of the subtleties that are fun to watch throughout the movie is the famous Indiana Jones hat. Throughout every action scene, whether he is in a fist fight, in a pit of snakes, leaping across a bottomless pit, or racing through busy streets knocking over baskets carried on top of people's heads, it stays on his head, never once falling to the ground. Indy's always stationary hat is an adamant reminder of his unrelenting pursuit of good. The thing that makes Harrison Ford such a good Indiana Jones is how the acting in scenes of endless crises. When he falls into a pit of snakes, with Marion, and the tomb gets sealed by Belloq, Ford doesn't revert to cheesy facial expressions or unnecessary gimmicks; instead he faces it with a calm demeanor that shows his analyst nature, always looking for the light at the end of the tunnel. One of the less subtle things that are pervasive is the use of the Nazis. They are shallowly developed characters, but that isn't necessary to the storyline. What keeps the story going is the symbolic motif that Nazis are bad with anti-Nazi instigations. Nazi symbols burst into flame when near the Ark, the Nazis are all killed when they open the Ark, and when Indy tries to cling to a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament it snaps right off, Mercedes being a German company. The anti- Nazi symbolism used throughout the movie is pervasive enough to be noticed and humored but small enough to not create any serious backlash.The biggest thing that bothers me about solo action hero movies is that there is never any real fear for the main character. With only one main good guy, when he is in peril early on in the movie, there is always the notion that he will unduly escape and save the day. When a movie encompasses a group of good guys that the story connects, then the audience gets more fearful knowing that at any time anybody in the group could die. Indiana Jones is the sole purpose for this film, so putting him into danger as early as the first scene isn't necessarily for the danger aspect, but simply to build his character and reputation. Indiana Jones is the, not a, the, archetypal action hero. You can replace dozens of action heroes in other movies with Indiana Jones and you will often find the same result Good guy saves the day, bad guys lose. Indy set the tone for generations to come for being a noble and skillful hero without accrediting fame or fortune he taught when he wasn't on an adventure.

Hanks carries the role very well, never for a second giving you the impression that hes just acting, he makes you believe he's there, making him the soul of this film. his interaction with Wilson is believable and well done, creating this sort of one sided relationship that battles the loneliness of the island, keeping him going. another device used to keep him going is a package. some packages float ashore from the plane crash, and he opens most of them except one, a package with wings on, which he is determined to deliver. it keeps in with his character and makes him all the more believable to watch.the thing is though, it always seems to be when its just Hanks on screen that the movie becomes really strong. I liked the part towards the end where hes now off the island. he has new shoes, he has ice, all the food at the party, the lighter, all these things that he never had for those 4 years are just there, and it makes him appreciate them more. its the little things that you take for granted is part of the message and its done really well.one thing that did annoy me on the island though is the pacing. it felt rushed, some scenes barely lasting a minute, not giving you enough time to let it sink in. if zemeckis had cut some shorter scenes out, allowing more time for more meaningful scenes i would have liked it more.

The movie has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that the viewer finds them self engrossed. The director's use of foreshadowing makes those aha moments that come later on in the film even more exhilarating, and allow one to wonder if these events are happening within a 24 hour time frame. While it's fascinating to examine and dissect all that went into the making of Casablanca, the greatest pleasure anyone can achieve from this movie comes from simply watching it. There are several events that occur throughout the film that allow us to make generalizations because these little peculiars add up. One of the many events that stick out in my mind is every time the plane to America flies overhead, the refugees look up, their faces longing for escape from Hitler's tyrant rule. We're reminded that old Hollywood was populated with those fleeing from Europe, and the creases in their faces say more than any studio narration used to set the scene. The use of facial expressions sets a common tone displayed throughout the movies. Another form of symbolism one can draw is that Rick represents the image of America during World War II. Rick did not want to get involved in other individuals business much like our war tactics during this time. Towards the end of the film he has no choice but to get involved and make sure Ilsa gets on that plane out of Casablanca, representing the protection of Pearl Harbor. Much like those refugees at the start of the picture, his life experience is written on his face throughout the film. The use of music also plays an important role in building emotion through the movie. Rick's saloon sets an atmosphere of paranoia, exoticism, and liveliness, and then comes romance, in the form of piano player Sam's rendition of It Had to Be You. The paranoia is a result of those individuals trying to obtain traveling papers so they can flee the country, the exotic rush from gambling at this speakeasy which allows for liveliness during a time of despair. The underlying message throughout the film is Rick's building relationship with Ilsa. The story takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France. Ilsa and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo, wander into Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. Her husband's character feels more like an abstract idea rather than an image of freedom, unlike the letters of transit that allow people safe passage out of Casablanca which are concrete items. The two are on the run from the Nazis, and have come to the American-owned nightspot to lie low. But the German government is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the letters of transit he came for, then escape. Little does Ilsa know that the café is run by Rick Blaine, the one true love of her life. When the two see each other, sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back. Through the use of flashbacks,we find out that Rick and Ilsa had a romantic experience in France and Ilsa leaves Rick with nothing but a broken heart and an extra train ticket. This draws us to conclude that this is a major struggle for Rick and may be the reason why he sticks his head out for nobody. It's not much of a stretch to say that Hollywood doesn't make movies like this any more because the bittersweet ending is almost uncommon in today's society. If Casablanca was produced today, Rick and Ilsa would escape on the plane after avoiding a hail of gunfire from the police. Who knows what would have happened to Victor Laszlo, but he wouldn't have gotten the girl. One of the things that makes Casablanca unique is the way it stays true to itself without giving into crowd-pleasing tactics. And because of this, not despite it, Casablanca has become known as one of the greatest movies ever made.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"30 September 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the family business. The family business is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk business, they often use the phrase, It's not personal, it's just business. They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men's family business and the women's family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men's work, usually by a door.The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren's life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other's sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she's been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family.

","genre":null},{"date":"30 September 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Godfather is a beautifully written piece about the inner workings of a mob family between 1945 and 1955. The main storyline is about a mob Don, Vito Corleone played by Marlon Brando, and his two sons, Sonny and Michael, played by James Caan and Al Pacino respectively. Michael starts out as an outsider, with no interest in joining the family business. The family business is a term that is used frequently and carries heavy significance. Whenever they talk business, they often use the phrase, It's not personal, it's just business. They use it to convince not only society and the surrounding people but also themselves that what they are doing isn't as violent as it actually is. Using the family business ideal and constantly reminding themselves that what they are doing is business, not extortion, racketeering, and murder, helps them to cope with the violence and the guilt that comes with such activities. I think that one of the things that helps this movie along profusely is the acting of the mob members. The transformation of Michael portrayed by Al Pacino is the reason that this movie works. Michael starts out as a college kid with a girlfriend who wants nothing to do with the family business. He shows respect to his family, but declines interest in the illegal aspect of their business ventures. Once things start spiraling out of control, he proudly steps into any role they need him to fulfill, even if it means he has to leave the country for a few years. Once he returns, he continues to develop into a leader, with the calm contentions of his father and the intelligence and youth of a new generation, all the way until he replaces Vito as the Don of the Corleone family.Coppola uses doors as a symbol of the clear separation between the men's family business and the women's family business. Whenever the men are about to discuss their ventures, they close the door to the outside world, both for security purposes and because they are the only ones who have the authority to make those decisions. While the men talk about that business, the women cook, clean, and tend to the younger children, clearly separated from the men's work, usually by a door.The biggest key to being an effective don in a mob is being respectful. In the meeting of the five families, Don Vito swears on his grandchildren's life that he will not break the peace they have decided upon, and hugs the don who had his son killed. Seeing those two men hug even after they had each other's sons killed clearly indicates that respect is something that is vital in this criminal underworld. One of the big moments in the movie is when Michael decides to do whatever is necessary for the family by agreeing to shoot Sollozzo in the diner. Michael changes his beliefs toward the family business in order to help his family. Later when their sister calls Sonny and says she's been beaten again, he rushes out the door without taking any bodyguards with him in order to protect and defend her. Later when the Corleone family is trying to buy the casino in Las Vegas, they ask Johnny Fontane to sign a contract to help their business, and he signs it without a second thought, because they are like family.

So, I decided to watch this on a VHS copy that I used to have until it vanished and I was officially moved by it.Before I could get to the positive aspects, I've heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film. Well, I will admit that this film does have some flaws, they're outweighed by it's redeeming qualities. The three hour length is longer, but I was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script, while staying true to the tragedy of the ship, has it's cheesy moments. The film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful. It also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects. The music from James Horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heart-rendering song My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema history.The direction from James Cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it. The story is very rich in detail, gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story, while obvious, is really moving. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the climax of the movie for has drama, heart, and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting, emotive, and likable. Leonardo Di Caprio gives out one of his best performances as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose, and Billy Zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and over-the-top performance. Other actors like Kathy Bates, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazing.Overall, Titanic isn't nearly as excellent as James Cameron's previous films, but this is a beautifully moving and a 15-year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema.

Specifically to review the bad guy. If you want the lowdown on the substance of the film go directly to other reviews rated 1 - they are very helpful and largely accurate. Jeremy Northam plays the brainbendingly badly written role of Jack Devlin. The acting wasn't bad per se but whoever wrote this stinker of a role (John D Brancato and Michael Ferris you know who you are) needs to go back to Movie Writing 101. Let me paint the picture. Jack Devlin is a smooth talking, handsome and incredibly IT savvy killer. He has a big boat, a gun and a way with words. Problem is he is comically hopeless at catching, much less killing his target - Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock. She is a socially inept computer programmer with no pretensions to know how to defend herself much less fight off a killer but spends the whole movie making Jack Devlin look like a first rate buffoon. Here is a summary of the killers incompetenceFirst encounter - Jack lures Angela Bennett to a remote location, constructs the theft of her personal belongings, kills a local low fi criminal, jumps on a boat, has a quick very personal physical encounter with a person he is apparently supposed to be killing (what the?) then leaves his gun in his jacket which Bennett puts on. She knocks him out and escapes. D'oh.Second encounter - Bennett's identity has been stolen. He tracks her down and is ready to pounce - except she steals a phone and runs away by sneaking out the toilet window - that old favourite. He follows her in his car but the IT geek gets away on foot.Third encounter - Jack Devlin sends a stooge, pretending to be an FBI agent to collect Bennett from the police station where she is being held. The plan works - except she sees through the ruse. After driving a long way from the cop shop she has been detained in she grabs the wheel of the car and crashes into - wait for it - Jack Devlin's car! Who wrote this stuff! It is diabolical. She gets away from the trained killer on foot again. Ba ha ha.Final encounter - Bennett breaks into a building to do some super mega sneaky IT stuff. Devlin and his accomplice track her down except Devlin jumps in to prevent her IT derring do and presses ESC on the keyboard. With all those IT skills Devlin believes he has smashed per puerile attempt to alert the authorities. But no. Bennett tricked him - he in fact destroyed the whole database that was the reason he was trying to kill her. Yes - by him pressing ESC. So the chase is on. Devlin shoots his female colleague dead. Then gets knocked cold with a fire extinguisher and plummets to his death. What a loser. The only people this killer killed was a Mexican hustler and his colleague. Despite having a gun and Bennett standing in front of him for about a third of the film he failed to lay a finger on her. Is Devlin the worst role written for a baddie in the movies.

And most of them will bring this 1976 version, the Jessica Lange version, up short.But a certain attitude will help--this is a purposely campy movie. By camp I mean a deliberate exaggeration so that the stereotypes and clichés play out as a kind of ongoing laugh. If you click into that you'll rather like this monstrosity of a movie. And this isn't just making the most of some crappy movie-making--there are lots of cues toward camp, beginning with the atrociously overacting acting and ending with the graphic match cut of the World Trade Center with some Kong-land rocks. Between these two is a weird sexual encounter between Lange and the ape and a giant gasoline pump as a patriotic animal cage cover. There is no way to take this movie seriously--so don't.In its defense there is also a kind of inventive intention here, simply to make the King Kong story contemporary, which in this case means the 1970s oil crisis slick disco era. Remember, Saturday Night Live was the next year, and it will be five whole years before the more outrageously funny Airplane that takes exaggeration to new heights. Some liberties are allowed the writers, such as an island that somehow still evaded satellite discovery because of permanent cloud cover, but then it's a step by step echo of the original. I hope it doesn't give too much away to say that the climax doesn't occur on the Empire State Building but a bit further downtown at another iconic skyscraper site. That alone should appeal to many.One big disappointment? The filming itself. This is an era where the camera work could rather easily have made the most of the fantasy scenes on the island and the Kong on the loose scenes in New York. It comes to a disappointing peak n the final attack on the monster--with helicopters--that lacks visual excitement, replacing it with a surprising amount of blood packet gore. If there is one part of the film that doesn't lend itself to camp, it's the famous ending, and there is no redeeming energy. Just forced sadness.Lange is sort of terrific, despite the awkward shortcomings, even taking the movie for what it is. She plays a beautiful object beautifully, surely, but she is the one character who makes clear the humor in her exaggerations. The other actors being campy look more like bad actors, unfortunately. And the leading male, a scruffy Jeff Bridges, is a huge bore, perhaps the second biggest reason for the film falling flat in so many scenes.The biggest reason is the director, who has to take the rap for all the missed opportunities, for making an amazing ending dull, and for not sucking us into the ambitious sets and novel updating of the now-classic story. John Guillermin has directed more than his share of clinkers, including the apparently terrible sequel King Kong Lives which gets a whopping 3 stars out of 10 on this site. His most famous film, The Blue Max, looks increasingly dated to my eyes, and it goes downhill from there. Which means that someone somewhere might do a contemporary twist on the original tale someday. The two other archetypal Kong movies include of course the original, which we might call the Fay Ray version, which is amazingly good considering the limitations to it all. And there is a fairly recent version, the Naomi Watts version, which avoid lots of problems by setting the movie back to 1933, and which has the most outrageous, over-the-top special effects with the monster. For sheer acting, Watts is the best of the three women, and because of her this latest version might be the most moving, though it is very long, even longer in the extended version. For originality and unmatched compact punch, head for the first one, the RKO breakthrough.

And most of them will bring this 1976 version, the Jessica Lange version, up short.But a certain attitude will help--this is a purposely campy movie. By camp I mean a deliberate exaggeration so that the stereotypes and clichés play out as a kind of ongoing laugh. If you click into that you'll rather like this monstrosity of a movie. And this isn't just making the most of some crappy movie-making--there are lots of cues toward camp, beginning with the atrociously overacting acting and ending with the graphic match cut of the World Trade Center with some Kong-land rocks. Between these two is a weird sexual encounter between Lange and the ape and a giant gasoline pump as a patriotic animal cage cover. There is no way to take this movie seriously--so don't.In its defense there is also a kind of inventive intention here, simply to make the King Kong story contemporary, which in this case means the 1970s oil crisis slick disco era. Remember, Saturday Night Live was the next year, and it will be five whole years before the more outrageously funny Airplane that takes exaggeration to new heights. Some liberties are allowed the writers, such as an island that somehow still evaded satellite discovery because of permanent cloud cover, but then it's a step by step echo of the original. I hope it doesn't give too much away to say that the climax doesn't occur on the Empire State Building but a bit further downtown at another iconic skyscraper site. That alone should appeal to many.One big disappointment? The filming itself. This is an era where the camera work could rather easily have made the most of the fantasy scenes on the island and the Kong on the loose scenes in New York. It comes to a disappointing peak n the final attack on the monster--with helicopters--that lacks visual excitement, replacing it with a surprising amount of blood packet gore. If there is one part of the film that doesn't lend itself to camp, it's the famous ending, and there is no redeeming energy. Just forced sadness.Lange is sort of terrific, despite the awkward shortcomings, even taking the movie for what it is. She plays a beautiful object beautifully, surely, but she is the one character who makes clear the humor in her exaggerations. The other actors being campy look more like bad actors, unfortunately.

This film takes place in a rural neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York in 1989. Do the Right Thing also takes place is the racial era when there was still tension between African Americans and Caucasians. Mookie, the main character, is a young popular neighborhood boy that works as a delivery boy at Sal's Pizzeria. His dream is to make money but working hard isn't his strong point. He is constantly late for work and when he is making deliveries he decides to make extra errands along the way. In Sal's Pizzeria, where Mookie works, there is constantly conflict and arguing about who does what and other little skirmishes. In the long run, Sal's eventually get burned down during a riot due to racial tension. After Sal's is gone, conflict seems to die down and the streets of Brooklyn are calm. A phrase that you constantly here throughout the movie is fight the power. This phrase comes from the popular rap group at the time, Public Enemy. This phrase is rebellious and sends a message to the African American community to fight the injustice thrown at them by the government. A movement that is also frequently present in this film is a fist in the air. This gesture was used by African Americans as a symbol of unity and that unity would mean that together they would be more powerful as a race. In this film a boom box was used to project the phrase throughout the movie. This boom box represents freedom of speech because you can play whatever you want at any time. Playing the music of your choice can't be silenced.This film would meet my standards of good writing because it has a good plot that can be followed. The flow of the movie is smooth and there aren't any parts that seem to be missing or hard to understand. The writing is has emotion to it and it fits all the scenes at the appropriate times. The writing of the movie builds up with this emotion to the point where towards the ending; all of it comes out in during the riot.During the film, the viewer can notice several groups of people that are always together in a scene. One group of people is Sal and his son's Vito and Pino. Usually these three are all together in a scene that takes place in the pizza restaurant. Another group is Radio Raheem and his boom box. They are usually found walking through the streets of Brooklyn sharing music to everyone that is willing to listen- or unwilling. The next group that the viewer is likely to see is Da Mayor and Mother Sister. Both are elderly young and are icons of the neighborhood. Da Mayor is constantly trying to get the affection and approval of Mother Sister but she is constantly playing hard to get. The last group of people frequently seen throughout the film is three men named ML, Coconut Sid and Sweet Dick Willie. These three spend their day sitting on the corner criticizing one another and the world around them.Seeing this small Brooklyn neighborhood struggle with racism exemplifies how bad the rest of the United States was able to handle it also. (Induction) All films are eye openers. Do the Right Thing is my MLK film, therefore it is an eye opener. (Deduction) From this film I learned back then if you looked any different from what you were then you were automatically an enemy.This film was made to emphasize how racism tremendously affected everyone as human. It also shows how it tears us apart as Americans. In addition this film shows the result which is violence.

It raises as many questions about life and people in general as it answers about the mysteries of the plot which is the foremost reason why this movie will never lose its relevance even though few of its ingredients are past their expiry dates.The movie doesn't take too much time to draw the viewer in, thanks to a fabulously shot long opening scene which has at display the acting prowess of Newman and Taylor along with a continuous piano instrumental in the background which makes the conversation all the more interesting and intriguing. The tonality of Taylor's dialogue delivery and the pauses she takes are so typical of those times and are yet so charming that they can make you fall in love with her. She is arguably the most charming diva of the 20th century, yet it is never difficult to imagine her portraying a character which is most of the times transmitting negative vibes. She has a special gift, with a little change in her glance and a minor change in her eye liner, she can create a different version of herself. In fact, as the movie reaches its culmination one begins to realize that the part of Maggie is so carefully constructed that the option to not like her has been completely left to the audience ,of course at their own risk!Brick, an alcoholic ex-footballer is played by Newman, who pulls it off without any crutches. He is playing a man who is a fighter, yet hell bent on losing the battle, is an optimist at heart but decides to traverse the path of indifference. I do not know whether it is Brooks' style or Newman's improvisation, there are scenes where Brick would enquire further to a statement made by Maggie by asking 'Is it Maggie?'. The tone of this query borders between sarcasm and apathy and that just takes the scene to another level altogether.Being an adaptation to a stage play,COAHTR has done fair justice to it by being a compilation of long sequences(not long shots, that would have been epic!) which are shot within a house. Also, it is quite evident that while adapting the play into a feature film, Brooks had chosen not to include certain direct references taking into consideration sensitivities of 50's audience and censor which actually has worked in favour of the movie by making it even more interpretive in nature at certain critical junctures. There are two philosophical questions pertaining to morality and death which are at stake in the movie. The manner in which focus shifts from one to another is much like how a stage play would be divided in two halves.Unlike conventional cinema where a character develops as the story progresses, here the circumstances and their portrayal is such that the major characters indulge in the discussions pertaining to their past making you feel as if some one is literally peeling off the character's skin and you suddenly get to see a new layer with a different formulation. There has to be a special mention for Burl Ives, who I had never heard of before watching COAHTR and I certainly can not forget him after this. If he received an Oscar for a different movie in the same year he was nominated for his role in COAHTR, I will have to watch his winning performance very soon. Burl Ives is by far the best actor in the movie, as he literally explodes into a power house actor as the story unfolds. His mannerisms, voice modulation and depiction of moments where Big Daddy's stature\/arrogance is challenged combine for a supreme acting display. It is an out and out drama but, in so many ways it pans out as a thriller. It will always make questions pop and float in your head and would draw you ever closer to catch the Cat. If you are a fan of drama, its salivation time, if you like thrillers, there is enough to keep you glued and if you just like good cinema, it certainly is good by being 'not-straight' to say the least.www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in ","genre":null},{"date":"30 September 2012","score":"","review":" Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, unlike what the title suggests, is as dark, depressing, profound, layered and pervasive as any drama film can ever be, aptly shot within a limited perimeter with a handful of characters.

It stars Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole and Eriq La Salle. Music is scored by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek and cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth.Sy Parrish (Williams) is a loner photo technician at SavMart's one hour photo shop who becomes obsessed with a family whose photographs he develops....No one takes a photograph of something they want to forget.2002 was a stellar year for Robin Williams, it saw him give two dramatically potent performances that dampen down the bile spewed up by those who haven't been able to forgive him his comedy excesses. Insomnia has (rightly) found a more appreciative audience since 2002 because of the rise of its director, one Christopher Nolan. One Hour Photo, though, still seems to be striving for recognition for its qualities, in fact, for its understated qualities.It's evident now that many have gone into the film expecting some psycho stalker movie, and subsequently have been disappointed to find One Hour Photo is nothing of the sort. What unfolds is a sedately paced story of a fractured mind, of a loner who is so detached from society he imagines himself being part of a family, by way of his job, that he thinks is perfect. When the family of his selection turns out to not be a bastion of Americana, the little thread in his head clinging to sanity finally breaks, and then......Here's the problem. This is no slasher, people need to understand that mental illness or isolation from society does not mean psycho death killer, and thus Romanek's film becomes an observational character study of someone detached from realism. Creepiness permeates the picture, big time, but you shouldn't be putting this in the horror genre. Romanek always holds the upper hand, structured as it is, we the audience find ourselves holding on to see just how far Sy Parrish went with his pursuit of family harmony? With that comes the question of if the finale delivers substance? Well that depends on if you want red blood histrionics or brainy grey area.There were cuts and studio interference, and in the finale an explanation for Parrish's mental issues reeks of a writer being handed a solution by the studio paying his bills. Yet this is mature pot-boiling stuff, a film that dares to simmer and not let the pot spill over for multiplex appeasement.

Their sexual turn-on is car wrecks, and they cause them when they can't find them by chance. This movie, directed by David Cronenberg, is based on a novel by J. G. Ballard.This is a disturbing film. The sex scenes approach soft core porn, as the characters paw and grope each other, and there is rampant fetishism as well. However, I was unable to care about the characters. Casting James Spader as the lead guarantees a performance of flat affect. This sometimes works (as in sex, lies, and videotape, when he plays a weird voyeur), but when he is the main character and I can't begin to like him or feel sympathy for him, it wrecks the movie for me.The problem with the film from my point of view is that I'm never given any reason to identify with these people and to care about their drive for this particular form of fetishism. I suspect the sex aspect of the film was too difficult for the director and\/or the actors (including Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, and Deborah Kara Unger) for them to develop their roles fully. Instead of some fascinating insight into a world I'd never heard of, I saw moments of soft core sex interspersed with dialog from affectless characters about whom I learned nothing.

But when he successfully fends off hostile agents, he earns the respect of the beautiful Natalia, who requests his assistance for her defection. Woody uses this request as leverage to use the CIA's resources to bring his comic book creation, Condorman, to life to battle the evil Krokov......If you look at my lists, this month I'm watching a few bad movies. While this one obviously has a fan base, it was a flop on its initial release and nothing has really been seen of it since.And I can see why. The only time I remember this being on TV was on ITV in the eighties at five on a weekday, not a good thing for such a big release, and starring one of the biggest TV personalities (at the time) in the UK.And the main problem? Its boring on the verge of wanting to turn it off, and just when you think Crawford could save he movie, he opens his mouth and releases a truly awful American accent, probably for the overseas audience, because no on could really see a Brit as a hero (a bit pathetic really).So for the rest of the movie, we have some poor James Bond spoof, featuring a flying bird man, with a dodgy yellow car, and a dodgy boat, that fires silly lasers.For a bona-fide kids film, it's very violent indeed, and poor old Oliver Reed is in the middle of it looking like he hates himself.It's a shame that Disney couldn't take a chance and let Crawford use his real accent, instead we get this mundane stuff.The funniest part of the movie, was the promise of a sequel, that made me chuckle.
