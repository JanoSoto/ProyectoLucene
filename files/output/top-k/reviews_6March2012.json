The result is visceral. It seems so incredibly real.But MEDIUM COOL occupies this bizarre, hollow land on the spectrum of cinematic realism. Realism is an abstraction. Never attainable and, at least in cinema, never wanted. By nature, movies present a clearly fictionalized atmosphere where events, people, and influences from reality are inserted. MEDIUM COOL inverts that system by inserting fictional characters into situations constructed from genuine human anger and fear. As far as cinematic innovation goes, this may be the most dangerous.Wexler is fabricating reality. Our culture is so full of corporations, politicians, and interests trying to construct their own portrait of reality. The movies might be the most famous example of this abstraction. However, MEDIUM COOL's danger exists in its presentation. Wexler was a genius. How he thought he could get away with this film I will never know. He inserts Eileen into the climactic riot, helplessly walking against the tide of police officers, clueless about the issues and only concerned with finding her son. His confidence in such direction points to the horrifying fact that he also believes that history is a malleable material. By inserting a fabrication, a symbol, into tangible human danger, Wexler argues for his ability to alter history. That delusion wouldn't be so dangerous if the material were not presented as a veritable document of late-1960's violence and ethics. The counterargument asserting that all cinema is presented such only strengthens this point -- if all films possess the trappings of realism, MEDIUM COOL attempts to create one anew. Ultimately, the moral argument is murky and Wexler's left-wing fortitude is made silly by the bookending car-wreck. The film turns out to be a self-indulgent autobiography on Wexler, himself. He doesn't try to hide his Godardian influence, but it becomes trite and facile with the final hijacking of LE MEPRIS. His obsession with the power of the camera eventually usurps fringe cultural concerns like Racism, Violence, Political Upheaval, and Feminism.

Unmoved and unshaken in the face of tragedy (the opening, for example), he is depicted as someone who lives for the camera. As footage of MLK is shown (who was shot that year), he says Jesus, I love shooting film. Cassellis is Wexler -- a grounded permutation of heroic behavior. But with plenty of faults to balance everything out.Maybe the most interesting question is -- why Wexler? why 1968? why distort filmic tradition now? The answer might be revealed when Wexler films a series of Black adults in the ghetto. They make (somewhat garbled) pleas for Cassellis to get in touch with the real people. What was the late-60's revolution but a demand for individual attention and the premature glorification of youth? In MEDIUM COOL, Wexler makes an impossible attempt to faithfully represent the little man.

The film is a very well known haunted-house classic, spawning numerous sequels (including one that just recently came out direct-to-DVD) and even a big-budget theatrical remake a few years back. And while it is still a well-known and widely-loved film, I just can't quite put my finger on why it is so highly regarded. It's a good haunted house film, sure&#x85; but it didn't seem all that special to me.It follows George and Kathy Lutz, a young couple raising Kathy's young children from a previous relationship, as they move into a large, cozy home in Amityville, Long Island in New York. At first the house seems perfect, even though it has a history- a year prior, the previous family was murdered inside, but the Lutz are willing to try and forget this. However, strange events begin to plague them, including odd sounds and bizarre feelings of anger, and George seems to be changing&#x85; becoming more violent.The film is, to its credit, pretty effective for a horror movie. Rosenberg's direction is more than adequate, and in particular, veteran composer Lalo Schifrin's haunting and iconic singing girls theme song is absolutely chilling. The film does have quite a bit of atmosphere, and there are some frightening moments, including a troubling scene where a babysitter is locked in a dark closet by some unknown force.The acting is all very solid. Brolin plays the role of George well, and you can tell he cares about the family even though he's a bit too hard on them and himself. And when the house begins to affect him, he does become fairly frightening. Kidder is also great in her role, and is quite lovely and caring. But I feel the film doesn't give her enough to do for her talent. She's there for you to feel scared for, and nothing more, it seems.I'm also a little torn on a few other aspects of the film. For one, though interesting, I do find the story to be&#x85; a bit&#x85; boring at times. The film is about two hours long, and it feels like 10-15 minutes of filler could have been taken out, easily. In addition, some of the scares are a bit silly. From a goofy scene with glowing eyeballs that looks like Christmas-tree lights, to the infamous special effects pig in the window, some of the more effects-driven scares in the film fall flat. Finally, for a horror film, there isn't that much to really scare you&#x85; More often than not, the house and the evil forces\/spirits don't feel like credible threats outside of one or two sequences. Also, the rules aren't established well, which caused me a lot of confusion. (Ex. The house is haunted, yet it can also apparently curse anyone who goes inside, yet it doesn't always do this?) But all-in-all, though flawed, The Amityville Horror is a pretty solid haunted-house ride. I'd give it a pretty good 7 out of 10, and would recommend it to fans of horror.

A prodigal son returns narrative, the film watches as Roth returns to his family home. Though his relatives still distrust him, Joshua is idolised by his younger brother, little Reuben Shapira (Edward Furlong). The film ends, as most prodigal son tales do, with Reuben dying, paying for his brother's sins.Little Odessa was Gray's debut. It's a very good drama, well acted by the always electric Tim Roth, but the film's ethnic details are unconvincing and Gray falters in his final act with an obvious, overblown sequence in which little Reuben is accidentally gunned down.Gray followed Odessa up with The Yards (2000), a crime drama set in the commuter rail yards of New York City. The film's structure is similar to Odessa, and sees Mark Wahlberg playing an ex-convict who returns home after a short stint in prison. Wahlberg attempts to stay clean, to keep his nose out of crime, but is drawn back into the criminal underworld by a friend played by Joaquin Phoenix. The film retains the brotherhood dynamics of Odessa, Wahlberg playing the good son who eventually turns on his suffocating sibling. Once again the film ends with a ridiculously over-the-top death sequence.While The Yards has a certain, smothering pretentiousness about it, convinced about its own importance (it's lit like Rembrandt, street fights are filmed like Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers and it's reaching for the tone of Coppola's The Godfather), Gray nevertheless cooks up some wonderful strokes, like a beautifully sensitive welcome-home party, a wordless assassination attempt and a fine, aching performance by Wahlberg. It's a great mixed bag.Gray then directed We Own The Night, arguably his best crime flick. The good brother\/bad brother motif returns, this time with Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix playing a pair of brothers on either side of the law. Phoenix's a perpetually high playboy who owns a nightclub frequented by drug-runners and mafia types, and Wahlberg's a straight-arrow cop trying to keep the streets clean. When the mafia unleashes an assassination campaign on local cops, Phoenix switches allegiances, goes undercover and attempts to take down the mob. There are touches of Donnie Brasco, Rush, Point Break, Serpico, State of Grace, Infernal Affairs and every other undercover cop movie you can think of, but the film is beautifully lit, is atypically straight-faced and features a superb, rain-soaked car chase.Some have suggested that Gray's trilogy should be celebrated for working in a classical, almost conventionally Greek mould. That his conventionality suggests that all his characters are at the mercy of already in place contours, their fates forgone. Mostly, though, Gray's trilogy highlights the ways in which contemporary artists have struggled to conceive of a response to postmodernism. The crime movies of, say, Tarantino and Scorsese, are unashamedly postmodern, toying with and regurgitating clichés from 1930s Warner machine gun operas and MGM crime flicks. They aren't about crime, so much as they're pastiche jobs, jazzed up films about crime films. As a response to this aesthetic, artists who deem themselves serious, who rightfully ask what exactly comes next?, tend to look backwards at what came before, as though post-war modernism, by virtue of being modernism, is intrinsically the solution. This leads to classically shot and written but wholly regressive fare like Gray's trilogy, which essentially unscrambles the world's Scorseses and Tarantinos and puts you right back in the 1940s, minus the irony and flippancy.But you can't go backwards in this way; your audience will always be ten steps ahead and there will always be a huge chasm between your solemnity and the tired insights your film delivers. This is why true progressive works in the genre, for example fare like The Wire, which actively attempts a cognitive mapping of both global capitalism and crime, are neither modernist or postmodern, whilst possessing the vital traits of both. Philosophers have alternatively coined this new movement neoprimitivism, pseudomodernism, participatism, post-post modernism, but the one that seems to be sticking is new modernism.Whatever you call it, this hypothetical movement rejects postmodern nihilism (nothing matters, there is no truth, it's just a film), actively tries to convey the complexities of our world, and covertly believes that it is possible and necessary for individuals to make value judgements, take stands, approach objectivity, and back facts up. It is modernist in its desires to understand, teach, decipher and make better the world, and in its emphasis on culture, society, technology and politics. The movement doesn't reject postmodernism, but co-opts its tropes and bends them to suit its aim, questioning agency, subjectivity and attempting to piece together the fragments and multiple perspectives that typify complex systems. In short, truly relevant crime films simultaneously simulate our contemporary environment of junk, noise, commerce and static, before proceeding to decode, organise and target roots. As William Gibson said way back in the 1980s, future great artist will function like search engines, mapping and making sense of the detritus.

Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken spent all the time imitating poorly Clint Eastwood's man-with-no-name; the reference book of his anti-heroic character (though I thought he was more like Steven Seagal; with the same whispering voice and dead performance !). I didn't find anything different in Russell's character, except his eye patch and filthy talk sometimes. Isaac Hayes was more pathetic. OH MY GOD, here's the most trivial evil guy ever appeared on screen. He had none to do, or to say, but winking by his eye hysterically (Was he mute ?). Again, I didn't find anything different in his character, except his Cadillac with chandeliers on it ! Adrienne Barbeau wasn't better off; she did nothing but supplying the movie with some cleavage, and fondling her gun's barrel naughtily !There is no actual dialog, because there are no roles. The conversations of Russell and Lee Van Cleef were tasteless, with no particularities or even one-liners, so when Van Cleef told Russell at last We'd make a good couple I didn't know what the heck he was talking about !! At the climax, the weakest character around &#x96; the American president &#x96; was the one who saved Plissken, and the day, by shooting down the bad guy; so does Anti-hero here mean No-hero ?!! The tape's content was never revealed or understood. The lead's moral speech to the president at the end seemed out of place, forced and leaning on thin air; since the people who died in the road of freeing and saving the president weren't people in the first place; they were cardboard characters with no real patriotism or any clearness.The bore is powerful, especially when the action is nonexistent. Frankly, and shockingly, this is an action movie without any action. And when there is any, it's done too weak it's embarrassing (the fistfight at the train station for example). Carpenter just filled it with dark streets, wrecked buildings, many thugs, and that's it. The editing is heavy-handed, with not much to meditate on (let alone that we're supposed to be in an ACTION ?!!). Carpenter's music was the worst music you can dance to in a 70s disco. Indistinct was its main mark. And when he put it on the so-called action scenes it increased their bad campiness !I liked the main ambition as a thriller \/ action \/ sci-fi, with you have only 24 hours to finish the task, otherwise you'll be killed. I liked the taste of it as a kind of futuristic western with melancholic world. And I liked some of the cinematography; it was elegantly dirty at most of the time. It did draw my attention while using the Steadicam (the shot of going out Brain's home). But overall, all of what I liked was pure colors for a very good painting I didn't enjoy, rather see ! For instance did the Steadicam serve the action ?, or &#x96; ha ha beforehand &#x96; the story ?! Nevertheless, it ranked as a big hit at its time. It was produced by $ 6 million to earn $ 50 million; that's more than 8 times its budget, which &#x96; in a way &#x96; makes it more successful than Titanic. So despite that it artistically doesn't have it, sure it has another thing; some secret appeal to it, which did make it interesting to the audiences of 1981. Firstly, its formula  cool looking Anti-hero + apocalyptic dark future + no law + tortured but humiliated American president (proved to be something always cool for the American viewers) + rescuing on the nick of time. Apparently all of that, as merely the plot's skeleton, worked. Plus, maybe at the moment the Americans needed Snake Plissken as a mix of so cold soldier-to-criminal man with no name, peevish anti-authority Dirty Harry, with touches of being a war machine like in-the-future Rambo which this movie is a prophecy of (Rambo would show up firstly in First Blood &#x96; 1982 to be a real Vietnam vet, not a shadow of it). That mix was an appropriate son of the missed up America of the 1970s, and a good reaction towards its heavy scandals and defeats; like Watergate, Vietnam,.. (btw, Carpenter wrote the script in the mid-'70s as a reaction to the Watergate scandal). Although deep down inside Plissken is a good guy, but with having very personal moral codes, and being against the system that betrayed him. So when he does the forced official mission successfully, he doesn't forget to serve his own, almost nihilist, goals. He's a black point in the government's white image, yet a light black point in his so black version of the same image. Ahh, the 1970s was cruel, and needed as &#x96; or more &#x96; cruel lead I presume. Also, it has what we can call apparent subliminal messages  America is desolate and ruinous, being run by craven clerk. Its streets are full of loose crime while the possible heroes are the ones in jail. But ultimately, the satiric substance wasn't solid, and the surface B movie wasn't good either.

The lead's moral speech to the president at the end seemed out of place, forced and leaning on thin air; since the people who died in the road of freeing and saving the president weren't people in the first place; they were cardboard characters with no real patriotism or any clearness.The bore is powerful, especially when the action is nonexistent. Frankly, and shockingly, this is an action movie without any action. And when there is any, it's done too weak it's embarrassing (the fistfight at the train station for example). Carpenter just filled it with dark streets, wrecked buildings, many thugs, and that's it. The editing is heavy-handed, with not much to meditate on (let alone that we're supposed to be in an ACTION ?!!). Carpenter's music was the worst music you can dance to in a 70s disco. Indistinct was its main mark. And when he put it on the so-called action scenes it increased their bad campiness !I liked the main ambition as a thriller \/ action \/ sci-fi, with you have only 24 hours to finish the task, otherwise you'll be killed. I liked the taste of it as a kind of futuristic western with melancholic world. And I liked some of the cinematography; it was elegantly dirty at most of the time. It did draw my attention while using the Steadicam (the shot of going out Brain's home). But overall, all of what I liked was pure colors for a very good painting I didn't enjoy, rather see ! For instance did the Steadicam serve the action ?, or &#x96; ha ha beforehand &#x96; the story ?! Nevertheless, it ranked as a big hit at its time. It was produced by $ 6 million to earn $ 50 million; that's more than 8 times its budget, which &#x96; in a way &#x96; makes it more successful than Titanic. So despite that it artistically doesn't have it, sure it has another thing; some secret appeal to it, which did make it interesting to the audiences of 1981. Firstly, its formula  cool looking Anti-hero + apocalyptic dark future + no law + tortured but humiliated American president (proved to be something always cool for the American viewers) + rescuing on the nick of time. Apparently all of that, as merely the plot's skeleton, worked. Plus, maybe at the moment the Americans needed Snake Plissken as a mix of so cold soldier-to-criminal man with no name, peevish anti-authority Dirty Harry, with touches of being a war machine like in-the-future Rambo which this movie is a prophecy of (Rambo would show up firstly in First Blood &#x96; 1982 to be a real Vietnam vet, not a shadow of it). That mix was an appropriate son of the missed up America of the 1970s, and a good reaction towards its heavy scandals and defeats; like Watergate, Vietnam,.. (btw, Carpenter wrote the script in the mid-'70s as a reaction to the Watergate scandal). Although deep down inside Plissken is a good guy, but with having very personal moral codes, and being against the system that betrayed him. So when he does the forced official mission successfully, he doesn't forget to serve his own, almost nihilist, goals. He's a black point in the government's white image, yet a light black point in his so black version of the same image. Ahh, the 1970s was cruel, and needed as &#x96; or more &#x96; cruel lead I presume. Also, it has what we can call apparent subliminal messages  America is desolate and ruinous, being run by craven clerk. Its streets are full of loose crime while the possible heroes are the ones in jail. But ultimately, the satiric substance wasn't solid, and the surface B movie wasn't good either. So yes, (Escape from New York) is one of the most successful movies John Carpenter ever made, and one of his worst too. The best part is that he went to remedying it while remaking it through the sequel (Escape from L.A. &#x96; 1996) which had almost all of its antecedent's plot points, characters, and end, yet done way Way WAY better. The thing is while being more enjoyable, (..from L.A.) was less interesting, passing as another violent actioner, without any original formula, clickable lead or satire. For many people it clicked at its time, but **for me** **now** this is pale and dated fun. Rating it highly, along with enjoying it, can be exclusively American I believe.

Harris, who also adapts the screenplay from the novel Blood on the Moon written by James Ellroy. It stars James Woods, Lesley Ann Warren, Charles Durning, Charles Haid and Raymond J. Barry. Music is by Michel Colombier and cinematography by Steve Dubin.LAPD detective Lloyd Hopkins (Woods) is investigating the gruesome murder of a woman and comes to believe it is the work of a serial killer whose crimes stretch back for 15 years. But with his superiors troubled by his methods of working and his home life crumbling apart by the day, Hopkins is short of support professionally and emotionally. Working alone as a rogue cop, Hopkins will stop at nothing to prove his theory right and nail the killer in the process.All of these little girls have one thing in common-disillusionment.Met with much indifference by critics upon its release, and chided by the Ellroy purists, Cop is a film that may be a flawed take on the source material, but none the less it's one that remains a compelling neo-noir dripping with cynicism, sleaze and violence. From the off we are given a clue to what lies ahead for us as a man is frantically trying to report a murder by phone, he gets the runaround by the voices at the other end of the line, only when he announces that he will have to use his stolen credit cards to make the call does he at last get put through to someone who needs to hear what he has to say. Enter James Woods on twitchy, sardonic and intense form. Who we then quickly find at the murder scene calmly sitting at the victim's desk leafing through her literature as her shredded corpse hangs from the ceiling behind him. It's cold, troubling and poignant, the marker is set and Cop as a film in this respect never loses focus.Harris and Woods (co-producers as well) paint a decidedly muddy L.A. that harks back to noirs of yesteryear. It's not enough that our rogue cop protagonist, an ultimate anti-hero, is deviant, shallow and perhaps unhinged? But the flow of support characters are seriously kinked in persona's too. Crooked, kinky, out-there, damaged goods, God bothering and simply sick. Take your pick, they are all in here getting a caustic prod from Harris and Woods. There's even humour here as well, some of it black, but often it's a fleeting ray of warmth when between Hopkins and Dutch (Durning great), the only person Hopkins (and the film) can count on as being normalish....To say Cop is solely a star vehicle for Woods is not unfair, for without him the movie would flounder on the rocks. An excellent actor who can put likability into the most compulsive of characters, Woods gives the film its heart beat. With Hopkins cynical and often led by what resides in his underwear, it's not hard to envisage some viewers losing sight of the fact that he is still a great cop, determined to clear the streets of a scumbag killer. Yes he does indeed skirt the boundaries of good taste as he goes about topping up his libido needs, and he thinks of nothing to breaking into somewhere to nab a clue, but the picture sneakily asks us if this is OK as long as Hopkins gets his man? Woods revels in the role and makes Cop an essential viewing for fans of the actor.Rage in the Womb.With Woods' dominance comes the flaws elsewhere. The killer's motives are sketchy enough as it is, but the perp is barely formed as a real being. Those warped support characters, too, are only that because we have had the smallest amounts of character morsels to feed off. That is except for Lesley Ann Warren's troubled feminist poet, Kathleen McCarthy, who gets much to do in the latter stages of the film, but is miscast and done no favours by the makers who reduce her to being an air-head. A bastion of feminism she is not! A victim of Harris choosing to extract the feminist thump from the source material to leave a sour taste tingling the tongue. Yet if you can forgive the flaws that evidently many others can not? Then this is still a biting and potent neo-noir picture.

For the uninitiated who might not recognize the scope of such an achievement, just know that's incredibly rare and very impressive.

The novel was originally based on Kesey's own experiences working as an overnight orderly in a sanitarium, the movie is said to very slightly (the book was written from the first-person perspective of the Chief, a supporting character in the movie) but otherwise remains accurate. Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is transferred from a work farm penitentiary to a psych ward when his penchant for fighting arouses questions of his sanity. McMurphy sees his new home in the ward as a chance to cruise an easy life until he is released but fails to realize when it entails. The ward is overseen by the strict Nurse Ratched, a cold-hearted woman who takes her position unwaveringly seriously and shows little interest in seeing her patients as human beings. In his time at the ward, McMurphy makes it his goal to inject a little life into his new feeble-minded friends and light a fire under Nurse Ratched's miserable rule.Nicholson rightfully won the Academy award for his role here as McMurphy. It's probably my favorite role he's done; one of his best, right up there with his insane performance in THE SHINING. He's an over-confident, free-spirited goofball and you immediately rally with him on his crusade against Ratched. He struts into the ward one day and immediately rattles the establishment. His explosive approach to life begins to work more effectively on the patients that anything Nurse Ratched has attempted. For the first time, the patients on the ward are speaking their minds and it isn't sitting well with the staff. Louise Fletcher is the iconic Nurse Ratched, a performance that has been paid homage to hundreds of times over the years. Ratched is considered one of the top cinematic villains of all time, but I have a hard time buying into that. Ratched is a horrible person, no doubt about that (and played to cold perfection by Fletcher). But she doesn't come across to me as someone who's inherently evil. She's just doing her job and happens to totally lack in compassion. Her perpetual restrained anger and steadfast desire to follow procedure, regardless of how miserable it leaves the residents of the ward, makes for a fun conflict between her and McMurphy. Still, as great as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the real scene-stealers in this film are the exceptional supporting cast.Let's name some of the highlights Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd (in his first major film role), character actor Vincent Schiavelli, and the debut of Brad Dourif. The patients on the ward are a great collection of eccentric performances and great personalities. DeVito is hilarious as Martini, a feeble-minded man who appears to find infantile joy in just about everything, and Lloyd is downright psychotic as Taber. He plays the character with just a hint of rage inside (you can see if in the end as he's staring on during the final McMurphy\/Ratched confrontation), but enough that you kind of wonder how he's allowed with the general populace. As for Dourif, I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the movie. He does an amazing job for his first major film and I'm a bit surprised he went on to more eccentric genre performances than valuable dramatic roles. And these are just the recognizable faces in the crew; everyone in the ward does an astounding job of earning the audiences affections, especially Sydney Lassick as Cheswick. It's impossible not to feel sorry for the poor guy as he begins to cling to McMurphy, practically idolizing him. The cast in this movie is superb and the best part of the experience.

Louise Fletcher is the iconic Nurse Ratched, a performance that has been paid homage to hundreds of times over the years. Ratched is considered one of the top cinematic villains of all time, but I have a hard time buying into that. Ratched is a horrible person, no doubt about that (and played to cold perfection by Fletcher). But she doesn't come across to me as someone who's inherently evil. She's just doing her job and happens to totally lack in compassion. Her perpetual restrained anger and steadfast desire to follow procedure, regardless of how miserable it leaves the residents of the ward, makes for a fun conflict between her and McMurphy. Still, as great as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the real scene-stealers in this film are the exceptional supporting cast.Let's name some of the highlights Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd (in his first major film role), character actor Vincent Schiavelli, and the debut of Brad Dourif. The patients on the ward are a great collection of eccentric performances and great personalities. DeVito is hilarious as Martini, a feeble-minded man who appears to find infantile joy in just about everything, and Lloyd is downright psychotic as Taber. He plays the character with just a hint of rage inside (you can see if in the end as he's staring on during the final McMurphy\/Ratched confrontation), but enough that you kind of wonder how he's allowed with the general populace. As for Dourif, I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the movie. He does an amazing job for his first major film and I'm a bit surprised he went on to more eccentric genre performances than valuable dramatic roles. And these are just the recognizable faces in the crew; everyone in the ward does an astounding job of earning the audiences affections, especially Sydney Lassick as Cheswick. It's impossible not to feel sorry for the poor guy as he begins to cling to McMurphy, practically idolizing him. The cast in this movie is superb and the best part of the experience. The movie itself is engaging and contains some of the most iconic moments in recent cinema history (the Chief's escape has been parodied just about everywhere). It can move a littler slower at times and it sort of gets off track for a moment when the patients take a field trip, courtesy of McMurphy. Otherwise, it's a totally engaging film and a memorable experience.

In this case, the sequel is so funny that there isn't time enough for its weaknesses to register. One gag follows another so quickly that the viewer is overwhelmed.There IS some repetition. What was funny and surprising in the original is no longer surprising but still funny. Well, I'll give an example. In the end credits of the first movie we see the name of the Best Boy, and it's followed by a credit for the Worst Boy (Adolf Hitler). Here, the end credits give us the name of the Set Painter, followed by the names of Impressionist Painters, Vincent van Gogh and Edgar (Skip) Degas.The story, which doesn't count for much, is organized around an evil cabal of oil and coal millionaires who want to defeat any efforts to switch to renewable energy sources. I can imagine some among us being offended. More socialist propaganda. And the actor who plays George H. W. Bush comes off as rather a dull bulb but, as far as that goes, I don't know whether the writers have humiliated him more than they humiliated Queen Elizabeth II in the original.Much of the humor is fresh and a lot of it takes place in the background. When Frank Drebbin is depressed he winds up drinking in a bar specializing in depression. While a singer moans out lines about wishing she could wake up dead, we see large photographs of disasters on the walls -- the San Francisco earthquake, the Hindenberg explosion, the sinking of the Titanic, the Ford Edsel, and Michael Dukakis.The cast is as good as it was in the original. Leslie Nielson handles the part of Drebbin well, although he's a little old for Priscilla Presley. Though -- I don't know -- if her IMDb.com biography and my arithmetic is correct, she was in her mid-30s when this was shot, and could pass for someone ten years younger. George Kennedy, always affable, provides excellent support. Seeing O. J. Simpson is depressing, even when he's involved in one of the gags.One of the funniest gags, really outrageous, is when Richard Griffiths is bound to his wheelchair against some metal shelving. The shelving is being shaken by accident. The objects that fall from the top shelf and hit him unerringly on the head are hilarious -- a bowling ball, an anvil, a can of oil followed by a carton of Styrofoam peanuts.I don't want to spell anymore out but must mention that the dialog is as sharp as the action.

Unable to match Mozart's talent, Salieri uses his influence in court to sabotage the young upstart's career.

Foreign films to me are slow and about nothing. So I naturally went to see Life is Beautiful with a chip on my shoulder. I wanted to hate it. I wanted it to be just another movie that Hollywood was praising to show that they were an intelligent bunch of people. Oh boy was I in for the surprise of my life. Not only is this film good, I honestly believe that it was the second best film of 98, next to Saving Private Ryan. The mere fact that Shakespeare in Love won best picture over not only Ryan but over this, is a joke. It's actually funny.Benigni did everything in this film. He wrote, produced, directed and probably swept the floors at night. There is that much raw energy in this film. There really is. For someone to have that kind of vision is truly incredible. And not only is the film a terrific cinematic experience because of the importance and seriousness of the subject matter, but it is one of the funnier films I've ever seen. When Roberto is translating the German soldiers insructions to his son so that he isn't scared, it is at that moment that you realize you are under his spell. He's got you and no matter how much sceptisism you may have about the film you know you're witnessing a classic in every sense of the word.I loved this film. Loved everything about it and I am so glad that I got to see it and cheer Benigni at the Oscars. He certainly deserved his best actor award and he should have gotten more.

Before dieing Reese unleashes an evil spirit called Azabel . Having captured the murderous , Hobbes is convinced that cops are the chosen people and he turns up on television smiling and proud . Soon after the execution the killings start again , and they are very similar to Reese's style . Azabel's aggressive spirit is passed along with touch , as a fluid is taken into the bodies , in a crowed city of Philadelphia anyone can become villain . Things get worse , however , when Hobbes is drawn to the biblical injunction 'hide your works' and strange words on walls and corpses . This thrilling film written by Nicholas Kazan packs intrigue , action , chills , suspense , twists and turns . Hybrid of cop-thriller and supernatural story contains solid interpretations and eerie atmosphere similarly to ¨Seven¨ including a surprising final . On a metaphorical level , this does sense AIDS and a fear of the city are central to the 90s . Very good Denzel Washington as an obstinate cop who becomes involved about cruel ominous copycat murders but slow to realize an explanation beyond the normal . Magnificent support from John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Robert Joy , Gabriel Casseus and special mention to Embeth Davidtz . Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Newton Thomas Sigel, including the fidgety camera zooms in fascinating way . Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tan Dumb who the next year would win Academy Award for ¨Crouching tiger , hidden dragon¨. The motion picture is well directed by Gregory Hoblit , a fine professional who works as TV , he's co-producer with Steven Bochco , as Cinema in successful pictures such as ¨Fracture¨, ¨Frecuency¨, ¨Hart's war¨; his greatest hit is ¨Primal fear¨ . Rating  6,5 . Good film , but some moments doesn't pay off and takes much too long to get where it's going . Worthwhile watching .
