[{"date":"1 August 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This flick has its funny moments and it had a lot of promise but it fell down flat somewhere midway the movie, and none of the characters were interesting enough to carry the story the rest of the way through its 92 minutes. There seems to be no point to the plot because the story is just as thin and shallow as the lead characters. At the end of the movie I found myself wondering what the heck it was all about anyway. Was this a story about friendship, lust, and falling in love? Was it about Gabriel's confusion about his sexual identity? Was it all about Billy's life as a long-suffering and hopeless romantic in search of the elusive Mr. Right? Or was it a tale about a never-to-be romance between two unbelievably hollow people? I suspect the screenwriter attempted to do a combination of all of the above and simply failed to come up with a smoother and more logical ending.Brad Rowe plays the role of the handsome hunk Gabriel, a painfully stereotypical butch-boy character that most gay men can only fantasize about. At First Gabriel seems to be a really cool, down-to-earth, nice, charming, sensitive, and sweet guy. But he, quite predictably, turns out to be an insensitive, flake who toys with the emotions of his rather average-looking admirer, Billy, a gay victim-of-unrequited-love stereotype played quite well by Sean Hayes.All through the movie, Gabriel keeps us guessing about his sexuality, from his troubled relationship with his girlfriend (whom we never see), to his homoerotic lead-ons with Billy (especially in the bedroom scene), and to his hanging out with a really goodlooking guy and girl at the Catalina sioree. Billy eventually convinces himself that Gabriel is probably questioning his own sexuality and extends a hand of friendship to help him come to terms those feelings. But the cold and unfeeling Gabriel then tells Billy that he was never unsure about what he wanted at all, and he walks away hugging his gorgeous model boyfriend whom he had apparently been seeing all along, leaving Billy standing on the beach. Now, that was cold! At the end of the movie we want to feel sorry for Billy, his having been dumped by Gabriel for a super goodlooking guy. But it is unfair to say that Gabriel dumped Billy because they were never really 'together' in the first place. It just doesn't make any sense that Gabriel made such an effort to befriend Billy and to lead him on the way he did, unless he was interested in being more than just platonic friends, or, at least, in platonic friendship, albeit with an undertone of homoeroticism. But, the way Gabriel discarded Billy during that beach scene made it clear that he wasn't really interested in Billy's friendship at all. Something is missing here, and it is the key that would explain Gabriel's transition from being a nice guy to the son-of-a b*tch that he turned out to be. Did he ever really have a girlfriend, or was that just a lie he made up to keep Billy at bay? Was Gabriel's 'girlfriend' really the dark-haired guy that he eventually ended up with? Did Gabriel ever even like Billy as a friend, or did he just use Billy as a means to get the modeling contract and the Catalina shoot? Unfortunately, the movie ends without even attempting to explain it.Notwithstanding, as much as we like Billy, its difficult to muster any empathy for him because he's really a victim of his own superficial fixation on having a prettyboy stereotype for a boyfriend. This begs the question is it really so that lonely gay men like Billy are doomed to a life of singleness because they can't find Mr. Right. Or, is the singleness self-imposed because they're holding out for fantasy stereotypes like Gabriel? Unfortunately for the producers of this film, they've successfully made a statement in support the latter argument.I give this movie 3 stars out of ten. It could have been a lot better.

It is a true story though the character played by Robert De Niro didn't exist in real life. This story is a story that inspires a lot of people to do things they have been oppressed and hindered to do. It reaches out the people who have dreams they want to fulfill and have had 'stumbling blocks' on their way and through it all the succeeded and fulfilled the heart's desires.Racism has been a continuous problem in the world. It has hindered a lot of talented people to fulfill greatness. These people are not only black people, but the people named minorities, such as Hispanics, Asians, and a lot more. This movie speaks to a lot of these undermined people telling them to persevere, because even though there are 'stumbling blocks' believe in yourself and not what others tell you. The character, Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., portrays the behavior of a man who believes in himself, even though he was educationally challenged, because he dropped out of school in the seventh grade to help his family on the farm, he didn't let that stop him from achieving his goal. He worked day and night to prove himself worthy to be a diver and in the process met his future wife. That is what people need to understand, to achieve goals and dreams; one must work very hard to prove that it is truly deserved. Once again, his relentless acts of perseverance, is shown in the scene in the bar where he enters a holding of breath contest with his Master Chief Petty Officer, Billy Sunday, which is the endearing role played by Robert De Niro. He won this contest and set a record for the amount of time of holding breath, which was previously held by Robert De Niro.I was highly impressed and touched by this movie because it is the epitome of 'grass to grace'. It gives hope to those who are in the same classification as the character Carl Brashear. It relates to the real life crises people face and how they overcome them. At the beginning, Cuba Gooding Jr. starts with no friends and no support system. And it comes to a captivating close where he ends with his dream being fulfilled. Carl Brashear is the embodiment of courage and perseverance. Through out the movie he constantly proved himself worthy and came out on top. He saved lives and made history. And though his leg was amputated, he walked in a diving suit that weighed tons, with the support of only his good leg. That last scene of the movie gained my respect for the character and the real man who endured all this hardship.I would rate the directing average because there are certain points in the movie that were never addressed, such as the past life of Billy Sunday. The director didn't do much to make sure the movie's visualization related to the audience.I rate this movie an eight out of ten because the directing could have been a lot better than it was.

I was quite surprised when I learned that it had a religious theme. In case you've never heard of the stigmata, they're the wounds that Jesus apparently had when he got crucified.In the movie itself, Vatican representative Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) gets sent to the United States, where punk Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) has been experiencing the stigmata. So what is this all supposed to mean? Well, it's a little hard to determine. The movie mostly appears to be looking at Catholic Church cover-ups - and this is before The Da Vinci Code - but the graphic scenes of Frankie getting the stigmata sort of overshadow that. And it seems that they were really trying to be as graphic as possible with those scenes.Another aspect is the fact that someone like Frankie is getting the stigmata. Supposedly, only Catholics can experience those marks, but Frankie is an atheist punk. Maybe that was an allusion to the spread of religion over the centuries, and how it crushed other belief systems.All in all, I thought that the movie was worth seeing. If it has any problems, it's that - as a previous viewer noted - some characters are underdeveloped. Other than that, it's an interesting look at religion. But be warned this movie is not for the squeamish. Also starring Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Rade Sherbedgia and Portia de Rossi.

In case you've never heard of the stigmata, they're the wounds that Jesus apparently had when he got crucified.In the movie itself, Vatican representative Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) gets sent to the United States, where punk Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) has been experiencing the stigmata. So what is this all supposed to mean? Well, it's a little hard to determine. The movie mostly appears to be looking at Catholic Church cover-ups - and this is before The Da Vinci Code - but the graphic scenes of Frankie getting the stigmata sort of overshadow that. And it seems that they were really trying to be as graphic as possible with those scenes.Another aspect is the fact that someone like Frankie is getting the stigmata. Supposedly, only Catholics can experience those marks, but Frankie is an atheist punk. Maybe that was an allusion to the spread of religion over the centuries, and how it crushed other belief systems.All in all, I thought that the movie was worth seeing. If it has any problems, it's that - as a previous viewer noted - some characters are underdeveloped. Other than that, it's an interesting look at religion. But be warned this movie is not for the squeamish. Also starring Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, Rade Sherbedgia and Portia de Rossi.

Ford was a master of offering glimpses into a character's motivation - which, if you blink, you miss. And that moment is what makes you watch the movie for more. Once I saw Martha Edwards smoothing Ethan's coat with her hands and realized she was in love with Ethan instead of her own husband, I was looking for more...signs of Ethan's love for her. Had she married the safe one and regretted it?The emotion that you see is the blood from the stone. The characters in the Searchers (like most of the characters in Ford's films) break down only under overwhelming pressure... and but for a moment. Life is hard, they know it, they just keep putting one step in front of the other... they're Texicans. You see when Marty matures, because he stops talking so much, and tells Laury he didn't know he had to say he loved her - he thought she knew. In stark contrast to the at times wild and ungoverned emotion of the children and teenagers - emotion that has dangerous consequences.The actors don't miss a step. Ward Bond blusters his way through, offering local authority and comic relief; Patrick Wayne did perhaps the best acting of his career (if only he had started directing right after this movie), while Jeffrey Hunter shows what his career could have been if he had made better choices. Natalie Wood fills the screen when she appears (nice that the Comanche had lipstick), as does Vera Miles. Olive Carey is incredibly touching; a complete standout in her role.And John Wayne. The character he plays here, I believe, is one of the most complex and dark of his career - truly setting him apart as an actor. The family Edwards certainly likes him, in spite of the many questionable facets to his character. We follow him through the movie like Marty - on the one hand, hoping he'll find Debbie; on the other hand, hoping he won't. And if he does find her, how can Marty (immature in so many ways) stop Ethan from killing her? The fate of Ethan Edwards in Ford's movie strays from the novel on which the movie is based. I saw the movie first, and I find the novel suffers a great deal in comparison.Although Ethan compromises what we thought was his driving position in the film, he never opens his heart; he remains an enigma to the end. And we still want to know more about him.I have never seen, by the way, any non-fiction about native American white female captives that indicated the birth family didn't want them back due to defilement. Even Cynthia Parker, the mother of raider Quannah Parker (pardon my spelling), was searched for by her family for over 15 years and taken back by them several times after her Comanche spouse died and while her son was actively raiding and killing Texas ranchers. It has been documented, however, that captives in Texas were sometimes abused and defaced rather than adopted; in a harsh land, equally harsh and poorly-educated parents might see death as a better option to lifelong loneliness and a half-Indian child.About Monument Valley not being in Texas well, Lone Pine and the Missouri Flats are in California, but they've been used for almost every western movie and series ever made. They just look generic so apparently few movie watchers notice. John Ford used a spot with lovely scenery, for which I'm grateful. That land belonged to the Navajo nation, so a little cash went in their direction. It's unfortunate Texas lacks Monument Valley and we all know it, but I'm willing to suspend belief so that I can enjoy the movie. That sort of scenery helps me understand why someone would actually fight over living there rather than pick up and move to a better climate.I do have one issue with this film the cavalry charge into the village. It is so much easier to be standing, and shoot someone running at a full gallop in a straight line on horseback, than it is to shoot from a galloping horse with a long gun at someone standing (and then hiding). If that was the sole strategy, the Rangers would have been wiped out and the Comanche would have won. Good thing the Rangers had I have to WIN, I'm the Good Guy on their badge and the Comanche had Miss on their guns. It's a rousing scene, but I find it odd that Ford would make such a mistake. Quite a bit has been said about the Native Americans depicted in the film. John Ford unfortunately didn't, in this movie, use a Native American in the Scar role. And he wasn't working with, or on the land of the Cheyanne or Comanche, but the Navajo. But he did employ Native Americans extensively in this and other movies as well as use their land at at time when funds were desperately needed. And he did evolve in his thinking about how they were depicted (see Cheyanne Autumn in which Richard Whidmark plays one of the first army men with a conscience, paving the way for so many more, less accurate but more PC, movies).From what I've read, Ford wasn't the greatest guy ever, and could be really hard to work with, but I think he was one of the greatest filmmakers ever. And this, having been completely ignored by the Academy Awards - is imho one of the greatest films ever.

It's a not much talked about movie, that certainly deserves to be talked about. It has got a great compelling story and it is professionally directed by Christopher Nolan and acted by the fine cast.The movie starts of as a rather basic thriller but as the movie progresses it takes some nice turns. The story remains compelling throughout its entire running time for several reasons; the cast, the settings and the nice twists in the story.The movie its story is very well constructed. It works well as a murder-mystery\/detective movie but luckily the story is so much more than this, thanks to some original twists in the story. The movie really starts to get good and interesting from the moment when the detective and the perpetrator are somehow forced to help each other to conceal both their crimes and form an unholy alliance but without ever fully thrusting each other. It makes the movie mostly unpredictable and provides the movie with some nice twists and tense moments.With Al Pacino in the lead, you just can't go wrong. He plays his character with eye for detail and in a sympathizing and honest way. He plays his part interesting, as well as realistic. This way we can always feel and cheer for the main character, even though some of his actions are far from being morally the right. Plus he looks like a very convincing insomniac as well. Also really excellent was Robin Williams in the role of the murderer. In One Hour Photo he already showed how well he can handle a non-comedy role but his role in this movie is perhaps even better, since the character itself is probably a more realistic every day person. Other fine actors such as Hilary Swank and Maura Tierney are also present but their roles aren't very challenging. Three Oscar winning actors together in one movie!The settings also work really well for the movie. At first sight, Alaska would seem like an unlikely cold and boring place to set a movie in. The nature however looks beautiful and certainly as well adds to the movie its atmosphere. Of course also the beautiful cinematography and subtle directing adds to this.From start to finish a great compelling thriller from talented director Christopher Nolan, with some superb acting in it.8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2006","score":"","review":" Somehow I have the feeling that his movie is an underrated one.

It's a not much talked about movie, that certainly deserves to be talked about. It has got a great compelling story and it is professionally directed by Christopher Nolan and acted by the fine cast.The movie starts of as a rather basic thriller but as the movie progresses it takes some nice turns. The story remains compelling throughout its entire running time for several reasons; the cast, the settings and the nice twists in the story.The movie its story is very well constructed. It works well as a murder-mystery\/detective movie but luckily the story is so much more than this, thanks to some original twists in the story. The movie really starts to get good and interesting from the moment when the detective and the perpetrator are somehow forced to help each other to conceal both their crimes and form an unholy alliance but without ever fully thrusting each other. It makes the movie mostly unpredictable and provides the movie with some nice twists and tense moments.With Al Pacino in the lead, you just can't go wrong. He plays his character with eye for detail and in a sympathizing and honest way. He plays his part interesting, as well as realistic. This way we can always feel and cheer for the main character, even though some of his actions are far from being morally the right. Plus he looks like a very convincing insomniac as well. Also really excellent was Robin Williams in the role of the murderer.

It is plain and simple easy to see why Fistful of Dollars has become such an utter classic and there is three main things that make this film exactly what it is and on top of that makes the follow up films (which are not sequels) equally as brilliant. The first is the star Mr. Clint Eastwood. Eastwood is the exact definition of cool. The man oozes masculinity and there is never anyone faster with a gun, tougher in a fight, or more modest on screen to always allow his character to get the crap beat out of him at least once because he always comes back. The second is the extreme talent of Director Sergio Leone who was way ahead of his time. If Mr. Leone were alive today and given the 100-200 million dollar action budget of Hollywood the man would be an absolute superstar. I say this because he made incredible western, action flicks of budgets of less than one million dollars. In fact Fistful of Dollars was more for approximately 200 THOUSAND DOLLARS and it's one of the most entertaining action flicks I've seen in ages. You would never know the low budget with the exception of the sound being off a little in some places. The third thing is the western atmosphere. To someone who is not a fan of westerns then Fistful of Dollars would likely bore you to pieces. Myself...I just recently became a fan, discovered through my love of Eastwood as an actor that I love Westerns and Fistful of Dollars is the quintessential Western but set in Mexico.Clint Eastwood is the man with no name again...although he is referred to as Joe, so I'm not sure why he has no name?? Anyways Eastwood is the fast gunned, smart talker who sees that there is some money to be made in a small Mexican town by playing two rich families of smugglers against each other. The Rojo's on one side, the Baxter's on the other and me in the middle...sound like there is money to be made. Eastwood's character this time around is a little lighter than others. He's not as dark and brooding and even has a bite of sarcasm and humor to him at times. Out of all of his Stranger performances this is his most fun and most watchable because he's a cinematic hero. Quick witted, and action oriented. Gian Maria Volontè plays the head of the Rojo family, Ramon. He is set up as a bit of a villainous hero in the area until Eastwood saunters along to make him eat his words. He is very good as Ramon and definitely the more evil of the two families. Sieghardt Rupp plays Ramon's brother Esteban and although he is not quite as villainous he does a good job in his role as well.The rest of the cast all play their roles very well in one way or another however small. The film flows at breakneck speed and every scene is riveting and compelling. The film reminded me a great deal of another great movie from a few years back with Bruce Willis called Last Man Standing. I just discovered now that indeed both Fistful of Dollars and Last Man Standing were based on the same 1927 story which explains the comparisons. If you're a fan of Westerns you'll love the gun fights and the ambiance they have created and a sub story regarding the American forces being set up during a gun deal and if you just love action films you'll love the in depth and incredible story of two families with Eastwood in the middle turning them against each other. It's definitely one of my favorites from here on in. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2006","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" A Fistful of Dollars is generally considered director Sergio Leone's leap into Hollywood, not to mention rocketing a small time TV Star to western fame and a Hollywood career surpassing nearly everyone else.

And a bit of fear evident in the town's people. It also turns out that their father had been murdered a few months before that and their ranch now belonged to James Gregory. When questions are asked, trouble starts.One thing is clear though, none of her kids has quite turned out the way she hoped, but the three oldest are going to see that young Anderson becomes some kind of success in life. Despite some glaring plot weaknesses The Sons of Katie Elder is a film that is sold by the sincere playing of its leads. I'm not quite sure why the Elder boys didn't come back with the news of their father's death and settled things back then. Or why Michael Anderson was so resistant to some higher education.This was a special film for John Wayne, the first post cancer operation film he made. And he did it and all his subsequent films with essentially one lung. One thing about Duke was that he really loved MAKING movies. I've always thought on some level he wanted them to make money because that way he could make more of them. Wayne just loved being out on location, working all day and partying all night, this was him. Although his health gradually deteriorated and he became more testy and irritable and he had more and more need of an oxygen tank as years past, he wouldn't give it up until he HAD to. For John Wayne it really was a labor of love.Wayne surrounded himself with a good cast of familiar players for the most part. This was his second film with Dean Martin who after completing this film started on his highly acclaimed variety show. And his guest on his first show, John Wayne to plug the upcoming release of their film. They are an interesting pair of older Elder brothers. Wayne who lives by a strict code and Martin who gets by on his wits and a larcenous streak. Still the affection the two had for each other in real life comes forth on the screen.Dino has a real moment to shine when he sneaks out and brings Dennis Hopper back to the stable where Wayne and a wounded Anderson are holed up. One of his best acted scenes from any of his films.George Kennedy plays a menacing gunman that James Gregory hires and he also gets quite a clout from John Wayne with a two by four after Kennedy was bullying John Doucette. It's a great cinematic moment from a Wayne film, but afterwards you can't find any trace of injury on Kennedy for the rest of the film. I remember in Joe Kidd when Clint Eastwood gave Don Stroud a similar clout, Mr. Stroud looked every bit the injured party for the rest of that film.Though we never see Katie Elder we get quite the picture of the uncomplaining pioneer mother through the townspeople that knew her and their sons. I'm still also not sure though why Earl Holliman was supposed to be such a bad role model, he's a hardware merchant in another town. Still the other three Elder boys want Anderson to aim higher than that.Elmer Bernstein's musical score is one of the best that is featured in a John Wayne film. Wayne films were always distinguished by good use of music, something the Duke learned from John Ford. Bernstein and the Duke first worked together in The Comancheros and this one is every bit as good as that rousing score.The action sequences are the best part of the film and the last half hour with the ambush on the bridge by Gregory's men right up to the explosive climatic battle with Wayne and Gregory, the excitement doesn't let up for a New York minute.

What about becoming an ally with your main rival in order to find a guy capable of dating the older sister?Larisa Oleynik plays Bianca, the pretty, always in fashion but rather shallow, younger sister. Kat (Julia Stiles) is the older sister. She is the one that has to go on a date first, if her younger sister can go out too. The problem is that Kat is unpopular and incapable of human interaction.

Cameron with his friend (David Krumholtz, in a role that provides some good moments of laugh) will have to try and persuade the wild and scary Patrick (Heath Ledger), who may not be that wild and scary after all, to go out with Kat. Of course, there is the bad guy, played by Andrew Keegan, who will try to mess things up, just when everything seems to lead to a happy ending.I especially liked the Kat-Patrick couple.

I first heard of this film while eulogising Galaxy Quest, and it's perfectly true Three Amigos did do the same idea first. Unfortunately the result for me isn't nearly so funny, because in this case the film doesn't even make a gesture at taking itself seriously -- Galaxy Quest manages to have its cake and eat it by being both a spoof of pulp SF and an exciting pulp SF adventure in its own right, but Three Amigos doesn't attempt to be internally consistent. A character gets shot in one scene and proceeds to do a song-and-dance routine a couple of minutes later without so much as a wince, for example a laugh could equally well have been got by having him attempt energetic gestures without thinking and so break off hopping around in agony (I wouldn't have found that terribly funny myself, but it would have been on a level with the comedy in the rest of the film), but that would have involved a petty-minded concern for continuity that the writers of this script clearly shrug aside.Basically, I found the level of humour a bit puerile; if that makes me a snob, then so be it. (Since I didn't like Blazing Saddles either, I'm beyond the pale already!) There's a good deal of comic potential, but a lot of it gets wasted the cantina scene, as has been noted, is probably the best, being set up neatly and capped with a twist at the end. Much of the film, though, came across as a series of improvised skits that needed editing by a less indulgent hand, and it's hard for me to like a picture where I find the characters so unsympathetic I don't find stupidity inherently endearing.It's unfair to criticise a spoof for misrepresenting its source material (and somebody did a good research job in mocking-up those title cards), but a song-and-dance trio really aren't the most likely stars of *silent* Westerns (singing cowboy films, for obvious reasons, didn't come in for another twenty years), and the characters in the 'film within a film' that Carmen sees aren't making even the slightest attempt at silent film style acting they're simply reciting lines rather pointlessly at the screen and then having a caption pop up to explain what they said... But then I have a problem. I actually know who Dorothy Gish is -) I still think the basic idea is a good one, but I don't think this treatment is a particularly funny result. It does have its entertaining moments, but they're surrounded by an awful lot of flat jokes, and I prefer my comedies to have some internal logic, however topsy-turvy their world where are the three actors riding off to in the finale, for example? They've already explained that they've got nothing and nowhere to go back to, and (unlike for the characters in Galaxy Quest) nothing has happened to change that. I know you're very clearly not supposed to worry about that sort of minor detail, but in the sort of comedy I'm used to, the finale is the place to tie up loose ends -- not create new ones...It would be interesting to see what the Monty Python team, Ealing Studios, Waner Brothers circa 1935, or Buster Keaton, respectively, could have made of this same material. A lot of potentially very different films could have been based around the original concept, and sadly most of them would probably have suited my taste better than this particular one. I did laugh in places, but overall I found the humour was outweighed by the general frustration factor.

I know you're very clearly not supposed to worry about that sort of minor detail, but in the sort of comedy I'm used to, the finale is the place to tie up loose ends -- not create new ones...It would be interesting to see what the Monty Python team, Ealing Studios, Waner Brothers circa 1935, or Buster Keaton, respectively, could have made of this same material. A lot of potentially very different films could have been based around the original concept, and sadly most of them would probably have suited my taste better than this particular one.

This movie is all in good fun but it does manage to hint at a good deal of real life trifles that particular people suffer in that highly-influential and barely survivable place that we geeks and outsiders call high school. Well, maybe not high school (probably closer to HELL), but anyone who was picked on or unjustifiably ostracized gets the picture.The endearing Rachael Leigh Cook and Freddie Prinze, Jr. star in this sugary ditty about a dude named Zack Silar (Prinze) who is ditched by his long-time armpiece Taylor Vaughn (O'Keefe) only six weeks before the prom. He suffers public humiliation in front of his jock companions and, moreover, the entire school. His less-than-sympathetic pal Dean (Walker) proposes a bet which the illustrious school president can't pass up Dean will hand-pick the geekiest girl in the school and within the time allotted, Zack must transform her into a mega-babe and make her more than eligible for the elite status of prom queen. The deal is on and within only two minutes of searching, the scary and inaccessible Laney Boggs (Cook) makes her appearance by falling flat on her face in the courtyard - Dean has found his guinea pig. From here, Prinze and Cook do the traditional and recycled theme of geek-to-goddess. Suspension of disbelief is a pre-requisite for this transformation - the pretty and petite Cook is hardly an ugly duckling by any standard, her luminous brown eyes and almost pixie-ish beauty a complete distraction, even when she is supposed to look mousy (tortoiseshell glasses, stringy hair, sloppy clothes, etc.). Prinze comes off humble and sweet even when he is trying to be suave and arrogant, but this doesn't ruin anything. We rather want to see him that way because we want to believe that he really does care about Laney and that his reputation is the last thing on his mind. Prinze does this remarkably well. Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is a riot as a fictitious Real World cast member Brock Landers, a character that is obviously modeled from the obnoxious and insensitive Puck from Real World San Francisco. Of course, he's a lot more likable because his character is a complete farce and Lillard almost steals the show. Almost unbearable is Paul Walker as Dean Sampson, the narcissistic jock who places the bet with Zack and manipulates it in his favor. Walker's delivery is so forced and obtuse that one would believe that is truly HIS nature and not just his character. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe is a comedic queen as the vacuous Taylor Vaughn, and Kieran Culkin and Eldin Ratliff are again part of the same cast list (The Mighty) but this time as Laney's younger brother Simon and her best friend Jesse, respectively.

Also the 3D sequence at the end (Complete with a very awkward note to PUT YOUR GLASSES ON note as if we couldn't figure it out on our own) was laughably bad and overall it showed us a sequel that was exhausted and bored with itself.1\/2* out of 4-(Awful) ","genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"1 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven a rock star who was killed on the night before his wedding along with his girlfriend Shelly(Sofia Shinas) however a year later Draven rises from the dead and looks to avenge himself and his girlfriend's death. David Patrick Kelly, Michael Wincott and Ernie Hudson co-star in this dark yet romantic vigilante thriller. I remember reading about how Brandon Lee died on the set of The Crow and all the comparisons to his father and all that jazz, however despite Lee's tragic death, The Crow is easily his best work. (Keep in mind I haven't seen Laser Mission and Legacy Of Rage, although I have ordered Legacy on Amazon) Brandon Lee is an action star who I have always thought of as too much of a nice guy to really get down and dirty to take out the bad guys, this time this usual weakness actually becomes the film's biggest strength. Lee's nice guy approach to the madness that occupies his character works in creating more impact than usual. Also it helps that Lee speaks almost beautiful dialog when dispatching the bad guys. In fact there is one startling scene where Lee doesn't even speak and let's the bad guy figure it all out on his own, to which the bad guy says Abashed the devil stood and felt awful goodness is... This is a great movie. I can see why so many people like it, it is one of the few revenge movies out there that actually rise above guilty pleasure and provide a show worth seeing over and over again.* * *1\/2 out of 4-(Very Good) ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Brandon Lee stars as Eric Draven a rock star who was killed on the night before his wedding along with his girlfriend Shelly(Sofia Shinas) however a year later Draven rises from the dead and looks to avenge himself and his girlfriend's death.
