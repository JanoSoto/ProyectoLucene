In order to clear his swamp of the squatters, Shrek agrees to undergo a quest to rescue a Princess from a dragon and bring her to Farquaad's castle.  However on the journey back Shrek and Princess Fiona being to become friends, but can a Princess love an ogre?This is one of the best animated films that I've ever been able to see.  Not only is it really funny but the story is great - it's deep if you want it to be deep, but there's plenty on the surface if you just want that.  The whole thing about true love and love finding it's true form is very moving, and the characters are developed to the extent that you fully believe them (despite them being donkeys, ogres and mini-tyrants!).  In terms of comedy I expected more - but only because I thought it was a spoof film rather than a well plotted fairy tale.  However many bits are really funny, Murphy's Donkey gets the most laughs, but there are plenty of other great scenes that range from adult laughs to people falling down for the kids - the gingerbread man scene being my favourite (the muffin man?).Like Toy Story this succeeds by having a great story, great characters and a huge number of jokes for adults that are a) clever, b) funny and c) not forced in the least.  This mix makes for a wonderful film.  Mike Myers is great as Shrek - he gets very few jokes, I assumed that he would ham it up, but he plays the sensitive role very well and carries the emotional core of the film.  Murphy is brilliant as the donkey, gets all the best lines and is the best animated character - it's his role to carry the bulk of the comedy.  Lithgow is great as Farquaad and the animation just reflects him perfectly.  Diaz is OK as Fiona but at times her vocal abilities aren't good enough to bring the character to life.  This is especially evident during Fiona's transformation where the role needed a lot more emotion to win us over.Overall a wonderful film - there aren't many films that can combine great comedy, strong characters, moving and meaningful story and be original and inventive.  To find all these things in a cartoon makes for a great 90 minutes.

And then, when the images appeared on screen, I was lost. Lost in the visual genius of Peter Jackson. I experienced the Shire, with Bilbo's birthday party. It was happiness and gaiety all around. It was truly peaceful, and it was more than I ever imagined would be possible on screen. I was introduced to Gandalf, Frodo, and the rest of the Hobbits, and I found myself smiling at the innocence of life in the Shire. Of course, that's when the story began, and before Mordor, Isengard, or any of the other places were portrayed. With all the critical distance I had tried to keep, all was lost in the first ten (or was it five, or two?) minutes.Cinematography Oh, my. How can I describe what is not to describe at all? How can I put in words what surpasses it so much more? An image is more powerful than 1,000 words, so they say. Watch the film, and believe it. I could not begin to describe the beauty of Llothlorien, of the Shire, of the Elven woods we call `Bruchtal'. Or the imposing danger of Isengard, and Mordor. The dirty reality of Bree, and the dark tunnels of Moria make up for so many words I cannot write them all. Suffice to say that the scenery, the landscape in between locations, is so breathtakingly filmed, it is pure joy to behold. How are the characters set into frame? Peter Jackson and his crew employ many camera slides, when the frame moves through the landscape before finally finding the characters, or even keeping them in view all the time. How they manage to give the Ring, which is only a small piece of metal, the appearance of a real character is phenomenal. There are a lot of headshots, but no unnecessary zooming or confusing totals in a defining moment. The battle scenes are great, too. They are hectic, confusing, thrilling. The camera turns and twists between and around the protagonists, and even though we only see glimpses of many battles, you get a sense of what is going on. I really felt as if I was standing alongside Legolas in Moria.Actors Can I count the ring? I would like to, but I can't. But I can talk about the rest of the cast. Elijah Wood. Has he appeared anywhere before? How? He is Frodo, after all, and Hobbits don't seem to get any good jobs these days. Well, jokes aside, he is doing a magnificent job. He, and the other Hobbits, bring to life all that made the small race so appealing. But Elijah Wood and the actor of Samwise truly embody the two friends for life, and without them working so well together, I could not believe what the two end up doing for each other. Sir Ian McKellen is a great actor that I admired for various roles before this movie. In contrast to Sir Alec Guiness, however, I think he would be happy to be remembered as Gandalf. He did such a remarkable job that it's a pity he is so old, or he would be the coming actor for Hollywood's next decades. As it stands, this honor now falls to other people. Christopher Lee as Saruman is in his usual best. He is intimidating, imposing and all he should be. Viggo Mortensen. How could he not be the superstar he deserves to be until now? He was good in other roles, but he fills Aragorn's presence with life. He is Strider, the dark and unkempt ranger. Still, he's already got this certain streak of nobility in his appearance. I am so looking forward to seeing him at the end of the story, when he wears his newly-forged sword and is the heir of Gondor truly. All in all, it is baffling how well the casting department has worked on this movie. Cate Blanchett - if there ever was an elven queen, here she is. Huge Weaving - Please, give this man more work! He is great, nothing less. Legolas and Gimli are truly what they need to be. Gimli (is it really John Rhys-Davies under that beard??) is a tough fighter opposed to the D&D-Movie-dwarf, and Legolas is a killer with his bow. Some shots of him were truly astonishing, even though he did nothing more than stand and fire. Sean Bean really gets my sympathy for always playing characters that leave the story early (as he did in Ronin). But he embodies Boromir, and I hope Faramir can stand up to him when he actually appears. Ian Holm as Bilbo has a small but pivotal role, and as could be expected for a man of his renown, he does it great. One final note Although I know about the `Arwen controversy', I found Liv Tyler refreshing and the role of Arwen not needlessly broadened.Effects The costumes and set designs are genius. The ease of making hobbits and dwarves appear smaller than they are is baffling. The CGI is employed in a very smart way, not dominating the images, but supporting the atmosphere. It is simply astonishing to see the Shire come to life, or any other part where CGI has a major role. The orcs and urug-hai are the beasts they always needed to be. Ugly, revolting, and very evil, they wear their character on the outside, as opposed to Saruman who is a depraved, but still looks human. Finally, there are some true beauties that I cannot talk about without spoiling. I will just name them. Gollum. The Nazgul. The swelling river. The cave troll. AND THE BALROG - OH MY F*****G GOD! IT IS SO MAGNIFICIENT!Music The greatest compliment I can make about the music is that most of the time, it did not dominate the shots. It was not all-encompassing, but instead supported the images as it should be. Only when certain topics resurfaced did I notice specific parts of the music - otherwise it just heightened my experience. I am inclined to say that it couldn't have been different with this movie, seeing that everything else went so well.Conclusion The best part of the whole story is, that all the time I was watching this movie, I was watching this with all my heart. Not only as the geek I am, but also as the normal person I propose to be. I did not regard the movie as a fantasy film, and I didn't relish in the fantastic elements like I would have done in other flicks. It is a great film in its own right. It is the movie I was waiting for, and more. I am not sure this film will draw so many fantasy films to be made, as it is so much more than a fantasy film. It is simply a story told in a certain way, but a story that relates to us as much as to the hobbits and dwarves of middle-earth. This is the kind of film that filmmakers will need to surpass, no matter what kind of film they make. It is a deep, emotional, thrilling, scary, hopeful, satisfying, wondrous ride through one's imagination. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"18 December 2001","score":"","review":"  VANILLA SKY (2001) Rating 9\/10I went and saw this movie the last showing on Saturday night (Dec. 15) and walked out of the theater at 1230 tired, yet amazed at this movie wanting to discuss it with people. So I'd definitely suggest, before watching it that you bring your imagination, intellect and your sense of wonder to this film, along with a friend if someone's handy. You will need all four - the latter is critical to talk through your impressions and the film's possibilities over a nice café mocha after the show.It's not another date movie of the kind Hollywood routinely churns out. There's a lot to like about this movie. It demands to be watched Closely! Open your eyes... (where'd I here that? ;) Now there's nothing wrong with fun fare of, say Charlie's Angels (8\/10) and Shrek (8\/10). To all flicks, a purpose. Those are frolicks. This one is more comparable to a philosophical lecture, where the professor insists you learn by immersing yourself in the experience. Each has entertainment value. This one simply demands your full attention to get it.It's a lot more weird and different then the commercials make it out to be. It turns out to be more of a fantasy film actually. And it is a thinking film that made me want to talk about afterwards, which is always cool with me. There are also lots of humor and witty dialogue throughout the movie, much more than you would expect from seeing the trailers.

Cameron Diaz is in the film a lot less then the trailers make her screen-time out to be, but she does the most with it, playing a suicidal ex-lover. I also think she deserves a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Jason Lee and Kurt Russell were excellent as well.Anyway, this will not make a lot of money.

However, the introduction of a new unit that are genetically engineered to be better soldiers leaves the first unit obsolete.  One soldier, Todd,  finds his body dumped on a distant garbage planet and nursed back to health by residents of the planet.  However when the new unit is dispatched to patrol the garbage planet with instructions that any life found should be considered hostile, Todd must take on another battle.This much maligned film, sat around in the UK for ages waiting for a release date.  It was eventually sneaked out on video.  This isn't terrible, or the worst thing ever made - but it's not brilliant either.  The writer described this as a side-quel to Blade Runner, because it happens in an earlier version of the future where man hasn't reached replicants yet but are breeding people for set purposes.  The first 15 minutes are good because this idea is shown from Todd's birth through his training.  However after this is done really all that's left is an average action movie.  The clever idea of bred soldiers isn't expanded - with Blade Runner the idea of replications was built on and had plenty to keep you thinking.  This has nothing left after the first 15 minutes.The action is quite good, some scenes are quite exciting as Todd takes on the genetic unit by stealth methods, although this only accounts for the final 30 minutes.  The worst bit is the section up to this on the garbage planet where Todd is taken in, rejected and accepted by the community while learning to live in a different world with different values.  This section drags really slowly - partly because nothing happens of any great interest but also because we're focusing on Todd all the time.  This focus is dull because Todd is such a dull character - I'm not too bothered by the lack of dialogue (although more would have helped) but lets not forget that he's only a human, not a robot.  However he behaves like a robot all the time.  For example, one of the old unit, Riley, asks if his unit will be given weapons only to be told that only soldiers get weapons - not only does he speak without being spoken to, but you can see in his face and hear in his voice the hurt and disappointment that he and his men have been dumped.  However with Todd there's no emotion at all - why are the other soldiers made out as more human but Todd is cold, silent and emotionless?  More dialogue might not have helped but it would have given Russell more to do and perhaps have created a better character.Russell does a reasonable job here.  He doesn't have much to work with but does OK with the silence.  However I though he was given the role instead of an Arnie type so that he would bring emotion to the role.  I don't understand why he played a betrayed, emotionally abandoned man as a cold robot - just having a single tear run at one point isn't enough.  He should have learnt from James Black (Riley) who only has a few lines and a few minutes on screen but is more believable as the soldier hurt by becoming obsolete - he brings out more character in two lines that Russell did in the whole film.  Sean Pertwee is ok as Mace but you do feel he got the role because of director Anderson.  Isaacs is a poor Colonel - he just seems to weak and ineffectual to have reached the position of power that he's at.  Gary Busey doesn't have much to do but at least it better that the rent-a-psycho roles he's been doing recently.  Similarly Lee has a minor role but is pretty good - he looks really bulked out since the last time I saw him.Overall the film has good ideas and good action scenes, but the middle section is dull and meaningless.  Russell plays the lead too cold and rips the emotional core out of the story.  It's an OK film but a dull story that quickly runs out of ideas and a poor lead character takes a lot away from the role.

There are very few films made in the past 2 decades or so which have been able to capture the nuance and detail of the 1940's so as to make you feel as though you were actually transported back to that period.  This, along with Woody Allen's Radio Days, is the quintessential example.I had actually avoided seeing this movie back in the early 80's BECAUSE of Bob Clark's involvement, not seeing it until Christmas '86 on Television.  Needless to say I was instantly charmed and it's been part of my Christmas viewing every year since.People who hated it and registered negative comments here to do with lack of plot etc just don't get it.  It's a filmed memoir with comedic trappings and as such all the set pieces happening around Little Ralphie's quest to obtain a his Red Ryder BB Gun speaks more volumes than any three act contrived plot could possibly have done.It's all about detail, those affectionate things from the past which fleet past in everyone's life no matter the decade.  I am a child of the the 60's but the 40's have always held a fascination for me.  Things that are sprinkled around in this film, if you care to notice them, ring true from Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters on the radio to Little Orphan Annie to Look Magazine, to the Wizard of Oz characters, to the cars and trucks on the street to the snow, which even manages to look 40's.  It's Christmas as if Rockwell had painted it.But the nuances aren't only visual.  Peter Billingsley registers what must be one of the 10 most effective and affecting performances in movie history.  The story needed just the right kid to play the part or else it might have fallen flat.  Just any kid wouldn't have done and Billingsley proves that some things are just destined.  The whole cast in fact is simply perfect and give memorable performances.Amongst the lighthearted sequences, there are still a couple more touching moments which are handled gently and are quite moving.  The whole scene after Ralphie snaps and whoops on the bully, and is led home by his mom rings truth in every way, from his kid brother hiding under the sink, to Ralphie's very real dread of being punished for his use of foul language. Gen Y kids will of course find this ludicrous as they pretty much come out of the birth canal these days uttering those kind of expletives, but back when I was a kid even in the 70's we didn't get away any easier than kids in the old days for swearing within earshot of adults.The payoff scene where Ralphie finally gets his much sought after Red Ryder rifle, while his dad glows, slipping back into his own childhood for a brief moment, is simply priceless.Aside from maybe the slightly overdone Santa Claus scene there is nothing in this story I would change.  It's the only Christmas movie produced theatrically in the last 50 years which can be regarded as a classic. Other lame and half-hearted efforts like Prancer, Santa Claus the Movie, and the recent The Grinch have done nothing to capture the magic of Christmas.  A Christmas Story stands alongside the greats - It's a Wonderful Life, The Bishop's Wife, the original Miracle on 34th Street, and Alastair Sim's version of a Christmas Carol.  A must-see holiday gem.

There are very few films made in the past 2 decades or so which have been able to capture the nuance and detail of the 1940's so as to make you feel as though you were actually transported back to that period.  This, along with Woody Allen's Radio Days, is the quintessential example.I had actually avoided seeing this movie back in the early 80's BECAUSE of Bob Clark's involvement, not seeing it until Christmas '86 on Television.  Needless to say I was instantly charmed and it's been part of my Christmas viewing every year since.People who hated it and registered negative comments here to do with lack of plot etc just don't get it.  It's a filmed memoir with comedic trappings and as such all the set pieces happening around Little Ralphie's quest to obtain a his Red Ryder BB Gun speaks more volumes than any three act contrived plot could possibly have done.It's all about detail, those affectionate things from the past which fleet past in everyone's life no matter the decade.  I am a child of the the 60's but the 40's have always held a fascination for me.  Things that are sprinkled around in this film, if you care to notice them, ring true from Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters on the radio to Little Orphan Annie to Look Magazine, to the Wizard of Oz characters, to the cars and trucks on the street to the snow, which even manages to look 40's.  It's Christmas as if Rockwell had painted it.But the nuances aren't only visual.  Peter Billingsley registers what must be one of the 10 most effective and affecting performances in movie history.  The story needed just the right kid to play the part or else it might have fallen flat.  Just any kid wouldn't have done and Billingsley proves that some things are just destined.  The whole cast in fact is simply perfect and give memorable performances.Amongst the lighthearted sequences, there are still a couple more touching moments which are handled gently and are quite moving.  The whole scene after Ralphie snaps and whoops on the bully, and is led home by his mom rings truth in every way, from his kid brother hiding under the sink, to Ralphie's very real dread of being punished for his use of foul language.

Before the release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling's fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book's intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me.  With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling's best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book's story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It's like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We're left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects.Harry Potter certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He's then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He's sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn't like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry?The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn't give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don't really care about the mystery because we don't know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn't encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain's identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle Home Alone and sweet-natured Stepmom, many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. Harry Potter contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It's missing the dark atmosphere Rowling's novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it's childish story and pre-teen characters, many define Harry Potter as a film for all ages. While that's debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion It's a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they've read the books.

It was around ten years ago that story appeared in the West, now Perfect Blue ably picks up the mantle.  And it's probably the best psychological thriller I've seen for a long time, filmed or drawn.Much has been said about it along the lines of Hitchcock goes to Japan and it's not far wrong.  Most of what people call thrillers these days are actually over cooked detective stories.  However helpless or innocent the protagonists, they usually operate with the resources and\/or sanction and authority of some official body, be it the cops or the FBI or someone else.  These stories can be great, but there's something more thrilling about fairly ordinary folks with no such know-how dropped into horrible situations.  It's hard tale to spin and none did better or more often than Hitchcock.  Now we have an anime proving it can cut it in this tough sub genre.The story, as if you didn't read the front page, goes like this Mima is a sheltered girl, living in a protective publicity bubble as a member of the squeaky clean J-pop trio called Cham.  They've had some modest success and have a good following, but haven't really got off the ground in a major way.  At a small comic fair appearance she announces her retirement from the group to pursue acting.  When she gets home she starts getting strange phone calls and faxes.  She also fumbles her way onto the internet after being rattled by an obtuse, but innocent, fan letter.  There she discovers a web site put up by someone speaking as her, detailing everything about her life right down to her thoughts and regrets about her new job, her superstitious habits and her every purchase.  As things go along it seems without the group she really is a nobody.  The acting isn't an instant success.  Her standards begin to slip in grabs for acceptance and publicity.  And under the weight of the job, fear, regret and loneliness she gradually cracks up.  Then people around her start dying.This film is brilliantly put together.  In the slow and deliberate early stages we watch her uneventful life for a while, pushing for more air time in a drama series and a few mildly unsettling moments (letter bomb aside), nothing much happening really.  Then we're slammed in the face.  The script even foreshadows it beautifully; Mima, your character undergoes a psychological transformation after a brutal gang rape in a nightclub.  Then we watch them film it; take after take, camera set up after set up, long lurid close ups for what seems like forever.  The crew and production staff seem slightly ashamed, to say nothing of her managers.  People in the audience are turning away.  I'm one of them, but I have to grin about how damn brilliant this is.  It's just an unevenly dubbed cartoon isn't it?  Well this is just the start of the rollercoaster ride.  The effectiveness of this also speaks volumes about the character development, notable in Mima herself and her managers.  Handling this sheltered and delicate personality whilst trying to do their job and get her work and publicity in an unforgiving business (to say nothing of the fact that the rest of Cham are still with the agency and are starting to become quite a breakthrough success).  It's all very well done.  Another example; when her vague and hallucinatory behaviour seems to be getting too intense and prolonged (despite the rape scene and other things) the explanation is handed to us, perfectly timed.  She's been reading the stalker web site religiously as a sort of emotional crutch.  While the site itself has slowly changed tone to one of describing (as her) the kind of life she should have had.  And she starts to agree, or maybe she is updating it.As others have noted, this film seems to echo a couple of reality bending films, beating them to the punch in some cases.  Requiem for a Dream, Memento and even Fight Club spring to mind. The former involving dreams, ideals and regrets sitting alongside a slide into usettling seediness (and stealing a great moment shot for shot from Perfect Blue, as others also note), the latter two having scenes that are confusingly without proper context or meaning until a bit later in the film and generally being about losing your self and forgetting what you have or have not done. Although I found the ending a little awkward (they usually are in this kind of film) I didn't see it coming and it does sit well with everything else.  The light epilogue being another somewhat Hitchcockian touch.  Don't let all my comparisons distract though.  It's a damn fine film in its own right.  I imagine it's even better with the original dialogue.  See it on the big screen if you can.

Despite the sci-fi fantasy and giant robots the genre is famous for, it's perfectly capable of making any sort of film.  Take Wings of Honneamise for example; basically a sweet drama about the first space program of a (spectacularly designed) fictional world.  It was around ten years ago that story appeared in the West, now Perfect Blue ably picks up the mantle.  And it's probably the best psychological thriller I've seen for a long time, filmed or drawn.Much has been said about it along the lines of Hitchcock goes to Japan and it's not far wrong.  Most of what people call thrillers these days are actually over cooked detective stories.  However helpless or innocent the protagonists, they usually operate with the resources and\/or sanction and authority of some official body, be it the cops or the FBI or someone else.  These stories can be great, but there's something more thrilling about fairly ordinary folks with no such know-how dropped into horrible situations.  It's hard tale to spin and none did better or more often than Hitchcock.  Now we have an anime proving it can cut it in this tough sub genre.The story, as if you didn't read the front page, goes like this Mima is a sheltered girl, living in a protective publicity bubble as a member of the squeaky clean J-pop trio called Cham.  They've had some modest success and have a good following, but haven't really got off the ground in a major way.  At a small comic fair appearance she announces her retirement from the group to pursue acting.  When she gets home she starts getting strange phone calls and faxes.  She also fumbles her way onto the internet after being rattled by an obtuse, but innocent, fan letter.  There she discovers a web site put up by someone speaking as her, detailing everything about her life right down to her thoughts and regrets about her new job, her superstitious habits and her every purchase.  As things go along it seems without the group she really is a nobody.  The acting isn't an instant success.  Her standards begin to slip in grabs for acceptance and publicity.  And under the weight of the job, fear, regret and loneliness she gradually cracks up.  Then people around her start dying.This film is brilliantly put together.  In the slow and deliberate early stages we watch her uneventful life for a while, pushing for more air time in a drama series and a few mildly unsettling moments (letter bomb aside), nothing much happening really.  Then we're slammed in the face.  The script even foreshadows it beautifully; Mima, your character undergoes a psychological transformation after a brutal gang rape in a nightclub.  Then we watch them film it; take after take, camera set up after set up, long lurid close ups for what seems like forever.  The crew and production staff seem slightly ashamed, to say nothing of her managers.  People in the audience are turning away.  I'm one of them, but I have to grin about how damn brilliant this is.  It's just an unevenly dubbed cartoon isn't it?  Well this is just the start of the rollercoaster ride.  The effectiveness of this also speaks volumes about the character development, notable in Mima herself and her managers.

On the other hand perhaps I shouldn't have watched the whole thing at 001 am (earliest possibility for 'ordinary' people in Vienna on the 19th).- Geography. Lots of references, where they might be or are actually going, but you don't get the big picture.- The ending. Such a cliff-hanger. Not everybody will be happy about it, even though there probably was no other way.This movie is still the second-best I have seen this year (after 'Memento'), perhaps I just expected more since the books had been my favourite since childhood. I will watch it again, probably then I will see it more as a standalone movie and not a book-adaptation. For now I give it a 8\/10.

So their latest effort, Shallow Hal, would unfortunately seem to suggest. In classic sellout Hollywood fashion this film presents a superficial (shallow?) air of comic audacity that masks a core of commercial timidity. It serves us the cake of fat girl and deformity jokes, but promises to keep off the weight by popping us with politically correct diet pills. Jack Black, the talented comic actor who stole High Fidelity, makes a valiant stab here at reconciling Shallow Hal's contradictions, but the more sensitive he becomes to the skin-deep nature of beauty, the more maudlin the film becomes and the more the comic center of the film shifts to his really shallow (not to mention nasty and obnoxious) friend Mauricio. Sad to say, Jason Alexander, who plays Mauricio, does not break his consistent string of unfunny performances in unfunny movies ever since Seinfeld's demise. The waggish reversal mechanism that provides the resolution of Maurice's problems with women (much more disturbed than the essentially good natured Hal's) is too embarrassing to mention and further highlights the uncomfortable collision of farce and sentiment in the film. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the other hand, does an admirable job of making Rosemary, Hal's hefty heartthrob, a credible and likable character, both in her slimmed down version as seen through Hal's mesmerized gaze and in the obese, `real' version she bravely plays through weighty makeup and costuming.In short, Shallow Hal fails as a physical comedy (the four good bits are in the trailer) and is completely disingenuous and unconvincing as a reverse Beauty and the Beast romantic tale. About the only thing a viewer takes away from the film is a reaffirmation of David St. Hubbins' insight in This is Spinal Tap that the line between clever and stupid is indeed a fine one. So is the line between taboo-breaking humor and simple bad taste.

It's a challenging comedic satire that does pep up humor and outrage! The décor of the oversized mansion obviously match their characters! And the viewers are not given shots of the familiar Manhattan spots. Instead, Anderson's New York feels more like an invented city with crummy `Gypsy cabs', the miserable shot of the Hudson River, and the outdated streets where viewers keep seeing the Green Line bus. Heck, is this the only bus-line serving the streets?  Yep, it's definitely Anderson's bizarre universe with the most offbeat (just look at how they're dressed!) and unimaginable characters to twitch your stomach muscles at the most unexpected moments. It's a dark tale about family ties, with themes of manipulations, child exploitations, loyalty, jealousies, betrayal, and parental blindness!  It's looking at how things can go wrong even with a family of `geniuses'! Hackman's fallen-out-of grace conniving character is nastily funny. So are all his precocious family members. But Anderson's characters are created not to allow the viewers to laugh with them, but to laugh at them. Solid dark humor that does put me to shame for laughing! Overall, Anderson has made a good satire out of his characters, with everyone seeping with flawed traits.  Unbelievable! This film is interesting it does tackle the characters' neurotic catastrophes and eccentricities.  Put them all under one roof and observe the mess!  Nice ensemble of actors&#133; gosh, the two Wilson brothers seem to share the same vocal tone!  Overall, the cast's characters are certainly fun to watch but their emotional pains are not cringing my soul with as much empathy as I would have liked. Only Luke Wilson's Richie has the capability of moving me.  His performance is captivating!The closing chapter seems cold and rather lame.  Perhaps, I'm unconvinced by the characters' facial expressions to conclude that they have finally reached a change of hearts!  With Anderson's thoroughly unusual directorial style, this film is a worthwhile piece to see.
