Its significance here is that written on the wind denotes something impermanent and fleeting, and some of the characters in this story are certainly unable to commit to permanent relationships. It has been called a thinly disguised account of the real-life scandal involving the tobacco heir Zachary Smith Reynolds and his wife, the singer and actress Libby Holman, but in view of the Production Code and the laws of libel- Holman was still alive in 1956- the disguise actually had to be fairly substantial. The Holman character, Lucy Moore, is not a showbiz figure, and no reference is made to her having many lovers of both sexes, as her bisexual real-life counterpart did. Jasper Hadley, a Texas oil baron, has a difficult relationship with his children. His son Kyle is a selfish, alcoholic playboy who has little interest in the business. The man whom he would like to see succeed him is Mitch Wayne, the son of an old friend now working as a geologist for his company. This scenario- a successful patriarch saddled with a useless, irresponsible son and having a decided preference for an unofficial adopted son- was a common one in films from the fifties; two others which use it are the Mann\/Stewart Western The Man from Laramie and the Burt Lancaster vehicle Vengeance Valley. Jasper hopes that Mitch will marry his daughter Marylee, but Mitch shows no interest. He knows that Marylee is in love with him but realises she is as spoilt, irresponsible and hard-drinking as her brother. Unable to win the man she loves, Marylee drifts through a series of self- destructive relationships with unsuitable men. The relationship between Kyle and Mitch is a difficult one. The two were childhood friends, and they still occasionally refer to one another as such, but it is clear that they actually dislike one another. Kyle resents his father's all too obvious preference for Mitch; Mitch sees all too clearly what sort of man his boyhood friend has become. The director Douglas Sirk said that he intended to imply a homosexual attraction on Kyle's part towards Mitch, although in the fifties this could not be made explicit. (Mitch is played by Rock Hudson, who was of course gay in real life). Things become even more difficult after Kyle's marriage to Lucy. His drinking and abusive behaviour soon cause problems in the marriage, exacerbated by jealousy of Mitch. Moreover, this jealousy is not completely unfounded. Mitch has long been in love with Lucy and, as relations with Kyle worsen, it is suggested that she returns his affection, although there is no sexual relationship between them. Of the four leads, the weakest is probably Lauren Bacall, whose style of acting wasn't really suited to melodrama, and who never makes Lucy charismatic enough to explain why two men should have fallen obsessively in love with her. Hudson is better as Mitch, making good use of his talent for portraying quiet, steady men of decency and integrity. (His stage name Rock may have been assumed as a reference to this side of his persona). Robert Stack is certainly good as the drunken playboy Kyle; whether he was good enough to have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar ahead of Anthony Quinn in Lust for Life, as he believed he should have done, is another matter. Dorothy Malone did indeed win Best Supporting Actress, and deserved it. She makes Marylee spiteful and unsympathetic enough to make us realise just why Mitch has no interest in her, despite her good looks, but not so repellent that the final scene, in which Marylee redeems herself with one unselfish gesture, becomes unbelievable. There are similarities between this film and Giant, another family drama set in the world of the Texas oil industry, which also came out in 1956 and also starred Hudson. (These two films seem to have been the inspiration for the TV series Dallas). Melodramatic dramas like this were a staple of Sirk's output, but he took them seriously enough to try and turn them into art. His work is characterised by his accomplished use of colour; here his backgrounds are generally muted and dominated by greys and browns, but there is generally a prominent, brightly-coloured object in the foreground, normally red, yellow or green. (Blues and purples are little used). With some directors such prominent colours might have had a symbolic significance, but here Sirk's purpose in using them seems to be to provide a sense of artistic unity holding the film together. Roger Ebert wrote of the film that William Inge and Tennessee Williams were taken with great seriousness during the decade, but Sirk kids their Freudian hysteria. I am not sure that I go along with Ebert's theory that Written on the Wind is a disguised comedy, a subtly hidden spoof of fifties melodrama. I am not particularly familiar with Inge, but the main reason Williams was taken seriously was that he was a serious writer, the author of plays which inspired films as good as A Streetcar Named Desire or Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and I can see no indication that Sirk was trying to mock or parody films of this type, even if some of them may seem faintly ludicrous to more cynical twenty-first century eyes. In fact, this film, and some of Sirk's others, fall firmly within the same tradition. An undistinguished script means that it is not in the same class as the two films I mention above, but Sirk does enough to show that melodrama is not always a synonym for inadvertent comedy or soap opera and that it was possible to work creatively within the confines of the genre. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 December 2014","score":"","review":" The title is taken from the Roman poet Catullus-A woman's sayings to her ardent lover Should be written on the wind and in running water.

In other words, it's a romantic thriller and even a borderline slasher film. I enjoyed this movie very much. I heard about the famous scenes, including one with a rabbit, which is what led me to the movie. The buildup is fantastic which leads to an effective ending, though somewhat unbelievable and unoriginal. The film works as a romance film as well as a thriller and at times it can be quite creepy.Adrian Lyne's film is about a lawyer named Dan Gallagher who is happily married to his loving wife, Beth. When Beth leaves town for the weekend, Dan strikes up an affair with an editor named Alex Forrest. However, Alex refuses to let the affair end and she preys on Dan and his loved ones until he comes to her terms.The acting is very good. Glenn Close delivers a terrific performance as the malicious Alex Forrest who uses unnecessary means to get her way. Her performance is haunting and the final ten minutes proves that statement. Michael Douglas does a good job, although this is one of his cliché roles. Anne Archer does a great job looking pretty for Dan, and I cannot see why there would be an affair in the first place! Overall, Fatal Attraction is an excellent thriller that morphs into a slasher film for the final fifteen minutes or so. Not like that is a bad thing. The film is really creepy and it's a wonder how they can get away with these kind of things, especially in the 1980's. The bunny scene is a very influential scene and one that no doubt created similar scenes in other movies. A very creepy, well-done romantic thriller. I rate this film 9\/10.

In other words, it's a romantic thriller and even a borderline slasher film. I enjoyed this movie very much. I heard about the famous scenes, including one with a rabbit, which is what led me to the movie. The buildup is fantastic which leads to an effective ending, though somewhat unbelievable and unoriginal. The film works as a romance film as well as a thriller and at times it can be quite creepy.Adrian Lyne's film is about a lawyer named Dan Gallagher who is happily married to his loving wife, Beth.

The hate this movie attracts is beyond me. It has 6.6 here and nonsense like Interstellar get 8.9? Now that's just wrong. The Phantom Menace is not a perfect film, but there was no way George Lucas could please all people by going all the way back and re-inventing the whole story. Out of 6 films made up to this date, I rate this one the 3rd best. Why? Because it simply feels that way after watching all of them so many times. It is a very good start to the story, centered around a young boy who is given great talent and an opportunity to make his mark in the galaxy. This is essentially what the whole series is about - rise, fall and redemption of its main character. And his rise must begin through a child prodigy subplot. The pod racing part remains for me one of the most powerful in the whole series. The whole film is a bit cheeky and childish, but which episode of it isn't? These isn't serious drama making and it never was. It's a space opera with good guys fighting the bad guys, with shiny space background, wonderful worlds and delicate music. I do admit episodes 2 and 3 had certain problems in storytelling, but this first trilogy nicely connects with the original one and they both together make a wonderful epic.The only thing leaving a negative impression is the CGI. In some way The Phantom Menace pawed the way for all-CGI spectacles which dominate cinema today and (for me) this was never a positive revolution.

The mid-late 60's saw a barrage of flop musicals on Broadway, and in the book Not Since Carrie, the reasons are obvious. Too much confidence in the golden age of the Broadway musical had created many egos, star producers like David Merrick and tons of missed opportunities. There were also some major fiascoes, which this spoofs to the max. Only an ego the size of a Max Bielestock (Zero Mostel) could dare to present a musical based upon the life of Adolph Hitler, and the musical sequence, Springtime For Hitler, has obviously influenced later Mel Brooks films (just look at The Inquisition from History of the World Part I) and other film producers. (Songbird!, a musical spoof of Sweet Bird of Youth and Elephant!, a scathing look at the RSC in The Tall Guy, spoofing The Elephant Man, are just a few examples.) Here, Max and exhausted bookkeeper Leo Bloom (an excellent Gene Wilder) aren't out to make a buck. They are out to loose it, that is for the other investors, so they finance their show with way more than 100% of what they need. Their intentions are to Grab That Dough! and sneak off to Brazil on the opening night closing. As fate would have it, the show is a big hit, and eventually, the accountants close in. So what do you do? Put on a musical in prison, of course, with the intention of transferring it to Broadway upon your release.It's ironic that Brooks chooses Hitler to spoof here, especially since he looked so much like David Merrick, the abominable showman, whose fascinating life behind the scenes of Broadway's golden age could be a mini-series in itself. As Mel explained, What better way to get vengeance on a master criminal like Hitler than to make him look like a fool? A dangerous fool, to be certain, but by making him look at a buffoon, he's reminding future villains of history that they too are ripe for spoofing. Just look at Saturday Night Live and its scathing images of recent world villains. Mel Brooks knew exactly what he was talking about, and his initial failure has brought him the last laugh thanks to a Broadway musical that revitalized the Broadway musical when it really needed it, and has definitely influenced the next wave of movie comedy men. Without The Producers, many of the great spoofers of cinema (Woody Allen, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon among them) might have had a tougher time expressing their distaste towards the world through comedy, showing that not only is laughter the best medicine, but perhaps the true way to educate the world to its foibles and follies.So the next time you refer to something as bad taste, take a look at the non-P.C. genius of these men who teach that the world which can laugh at itself is the type of the world which will truly survive. Horny old ladies anxious to pass over the checkie, sexy Swedes who believe When you got it, flaunt it, nerdy accountants who don't think they can ever break out of the florescent lights of a miserable and boring career, and Broadway producers who are determined to become immortally infamous will keep you in stitches.

Thankfully, there is no pandering to try and imitate such a film, there are no musical numbers, not much action of any kind, and characters that aren't the nicest of people.The story starts in the rain, as a group of people huddle around under an abandoned building to avoid it. From there, the common man is told by a woodcutter about a rape and murder in the woods, as well as a depressed monk who is losing his faith in the human species. From there, we are told multiple differing stories from multiple perspectives about what happened, and all of them vehemently contradict each-other. All of them cast a mystery that gives the viewer nothing to go on but their words.What makes it work is that all of the stories, though self-pitying, all feel like they could have happened. There is no favouritism between the three parties, and all are giving 100% believable performance when they retell their stories, including minor pieces of exposition which lend credence to their tales yet further.We are consistently cutting back to the commoner who's actually pretty funny and worldly, who offers a simple, unpretentious counter to the more philosophical world-view that Kurosawa is trying to explore.

Mirror is a divisive film and one that not everybody is going to like or fully understand on first viewing, but it does come over as one of those films that should be seen more than once. Regarding myself, it was instant love on first viewing. Mirror looks amazing, which is not surprising as Tarkovsky's films are some of the most visually beautiful I've seen, the cinematography was so dream-like that it's enough to leave one in a trance of wonder. The scenery is striking as well and the whole film is atmospherically lit. Mirror also has a good amount of symbolism(which were relatively straightforward), but once again they were ones that bewitched rather than bewildered, the burning barn and the final scene were very telling scenes.

I must be one of the few Rocky Horror fans that hate the whole audience participation deal. If you have to throw toilet paper and hotdogs and shout obscenities to make a movie fun then you obviously aren't fulfilled by the movie itself.This musical parodies those cheesy B-movies where the typical wholesome all-American couple gets a flat tire and goes to a spooky house for a phone...though in this case it's the house of a transvestite doctor. This going to be FUN! Reprising their roles from the 1973 Original London Cast of The Rocky Horror Show are Tim Curry, Richard O'Brien (also the creator), Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, as well as Jonathan Adams (though in the role of Dr. Scott instead of the Narrator). Meatloaf also reprises his role as Eddie from the 1974 Los Angeles production. I appreciate how instead of getting all big-names and a big fat budget they opted for lower budget with a cast formed of previous RHS actors. How would you parody a low-budget B-movie with a high budget anyway? Susan Sarandon makes a great Janet, though Barry Bostwick is slightly lacking (his version of Once In A While was so slow; I could see why they DID cut it out from the movie).Three things I rather hate about the movie is the song pacing, Charles Gray, and the elimination of Rocky's dialogue. Every song in the movie is performed much slower than they were in the original productions, which in turn slows the action of the movie down; the only songs that worked at a slower pace were I'm Going Home and Superheroes. Charles Gray talks at the pace of a dying mule and puts nowhere near as much energy as Jonathan Adams or Graham Jarvis did (nor as much ominousness as Arthur Dignam). In the play Rocky actually talks; he never actually talks in this movie. This makes sense going the Frankenstein route, because the monster couldn't speak fluent sentences until he went to the man at the cottage. What DOESN'T make sense is that he can still SING. This thwarts that logic, huh? One thing I like that the movie adds is the awkward dinner scene.....that's always a hoot to watch.I suppose I should wrap things up. WATCH IT! Clever, catchy songwriting. Great cast of actors (closest thing you'll get to seeing the original 1973 London cast.....unless a bootleg of THAT shows up). And just an overall good time.

This is gavin.thelordofthefuture and this would be a review of a film that I've seen twenty years ago when I was a kid. The story about an 11 year old boy with statistics named Richard Tyler who stumbles upon a library during a thunderstorm and enters it. After meeting an old librarian, he goes to the fiction section and sees a mural with four pictures, but little did he realized that he gets transported to a world where every fiction story comes to life and sees a wise old sorcerer called the Pagemaster. Then, his adventure begins and meets three fiction books named Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror and together, they must encounter haunted houses, pirates, and monsters in order to help get Richard back home.Why am I reviewing this in the middle of a Christmas break? Well, let's just say that I've been watching this since I was a child and seeing how it has been 20 years, that's why I made that risky decision. Now, is there anything that I don't like about The Pagemaster? Well, let's just say that the only nitpick I do have is the animation. Don't get me wrong. It's beautiful and is very creative in it's making of the world of literary including Dr. Jekyll\/Mr. Hyde, the pirates led by Captain Long John Silver, and the Dragon in the climax of the film, but as time went by, it became a little dated to me.Anyway, everything else still holds up. The story is very engaging with very clever writing and the morals about facing your fears and using your imagination doesn't preach on you as it is done perfectly. Also, it has some very good characters and they still hold up to this day. Macaulay Culkin is likable as Richard Tyler, Christopher Lloyd relishes his role as the librarian Mr. Dewey and The Pagemaster, and the three talking books, Adventure, a swashbuckling pirate book with Patrick Stewart's solid pirate accent, Fantasy, a sassy, but caring fairy tale book who pulls off some nice humorous moments while being wise thanks to Whoopi Goldberg, and Horror, a fearful Hunchbook and also has some funny bits with the famous Frank Welker, known for voicing animal creatures in other animated films. The other characters are also good with cameos from Leonard Nimoy as Dr. Jekyll\/Mr. Hyde, Phil Hartman as one of the pirate crew members Tom Morgan and Jim Cummings as Long John Silver.The pacing is very brisk and doesn't come to the point where it would bore me to death, but the best part about The Pagemaster is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. To some, it does copy music elements from his other scores from Star Trek II and others, but to me, it has a nostalgic value to it. Why, you may ask? Well, the reason why I brought this up is because it does a solid job interpreting the theme song Whatever You Imagine that plays throughout the movie and has been stuck with me since my childhood ended. That piece of music alone is what made me watch this film over and over again.Overall, The Pagemaster became one of my childhood films and today, it still holds up. It has an engaging story, some likable characters, some clever writing, and some really beautiful music. As those aspects stayed with me in my memory, this deserves a gold trophy of recommendation as a film that is worth watching to some who hasn't seen it yet. Check it out and relive your imagination!

It's California, 1959 and bad boy Danny Zuko and Australian good girl Sandy Olsson are in love. They spend time at the beach, but when they go back to school, what either of them don't know is that they both now attend Rydell High. Danny's the leader of the T-Birds, a group of black-jacket greasers while Sandy hangs out with Frenchie and the Pink Ladies, a group of pink-wearing girls led by Rizzo. Who has had a thing ancient history with Danny in the past. When they first meet up, it isn't exactly like it was over the summer due to social pressures. Can love find away?? When I was a kid I had a massive crush on Olivia Newton John as virgin Sandy and not that keen on her leather clad appearance at the end. Not much has changed. I also still have a crush on Dinah Manoff who played The Pink Lady Marty!! So my taste in women had not changed since I was a kid. Grease is a movie I will always watch. I'm in a good mood I can watch grease, I'm feeling poorly I can watch Grease (doing that reminds me of being poorly with measles, as a kid over Xmas, and I laid and watched Grease. It's a movie I always watched with my late sister as a kid.

The elements are intense, but well-used.Does it compare to Red? Based on what everyone seems to think, it does not. But everyone should make up their own minds -- watch all three.
