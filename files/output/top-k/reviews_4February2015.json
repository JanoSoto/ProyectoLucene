[{"date":"4 February 2015","score":"","review":" Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is an odd friendless teen at a private school with lots of useless extracurricular activities. He get put on academic probation, and falls obsessively in love with elementary teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). He befriends an equally odd wealthy Herman Blume (Bill Murray), the owner of a pipe company. She dates Dr. Peter Flynn (Luke Wilson) which raises the ire of Max. Then Herman becomes infatuated with the lovely teacher and Max gets kicked out of private school.These are truly uncompromisingly odd characters. They are a quirky unconventional group. They are not immediately hilarious but funny in how wacky Schwartzman gets. The dialog is sharp with a lot of unusual Wes Anderson takes. Bill Murray extends his range starting an acting relationship with Wes. It's a wonderful move forward for Wes and friends.

Telly Savalas (with hair) appears as the private detective that Bowden hires.While I prefer the 1991 version because it's more modern and compelling, not to mention in color, this version is worthwhile if you like the stars and can handle the style of old black & white movies. Peck is stalwart as the protagonist, as always.Mitchum plays Max Cady subtler than De Niro and he's just not as fascinating. De Niro's Cady steals the show and could've even been the protagonist if Scorsese had the gonads to take the movie in a completely different direction whereas Mitchum's Cady is mainly just annoying, until the last act, that is. As written and performed, De Niro's Cady has more dimension and mystique. In the first act he's almost the hero and you find yourself sorta rooting for him, at least until he turns decidedly diabolic. This isn't to say that Mitchum's Cady isn't effective; he's just outshined by De Niro's version.Barrie Chase plays a party girl that Cady (Mitchum) picks up at a bar. She's obviously infected by the bad boy syndrome in light of her statement to Cady (paraphrased) I like you&#x85; (because) you're an animal &#x96; coarse, lustful and barbaric. Isn't that just so true to life? One highlight of the film is petite Lori Martin as Bowden's adorable daughter, Nancy. She was 14 during filming and wholly precious. Her last film was the trashy 1968 biker flick The Angry Breed wherein she was 20. After that, she only did a few more TV gigs before bowing out of acting altogether.Whereas the 1991 film is drama\/thriller that morphs into almost slasher horror, this version is decidedly a drama with thriller elements. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as &#x96; like me &#x96; you like dramas and are prepped for such a picture. Unfortunately, the film seems padded as many scenes are unnecessarily long and could've been cut in half, not to mention the black & white photography limits its appeal.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in Savannah, Georgia, and Ladd's Marina (near Stockton), CA.GRADE B ","genre":null},{"date":"4 February 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The original 1962 version of Cape Fear is the same basic story as Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake with slight changes Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) gets out of prison after over 8 years and proceeds to harass Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) and his family (Polly Bergen and Lori Martin) because Bowden was instrumental in Cady's conviction.
