But this little known horror flick is a cut above the average of the genre and has moments of inventiveness. Not that this is totally without some of the silliness and cheap exploitation that mars so much British cinema of the period, and a certain pervertiness inflicts the females (the men remain sensible throughout); one becomes a vamp and the other had a bizarre sexual encounter with a ghost. The plot concerns four people who enter what is described as 'the everest of haunted houses'. They do so, having been offered a cash prize by a mysterious benefactor who wishes to know the truth about the afterlife. This gives them a reason to stay, in spite of the strange and dangerous happenings that occur. The house was owned by a certain mister Belasco, a sadistic pervert in life, and equally so in death. The fame of the haunted house had brought a gathering of psychics there in the 50's, where they had all but one died or been driven insane. The one survivor was Roddy Mcdowell. He returns to Hellhouse with Gayle Hunnicut, who is another psychic, and the skeptical professor and his wife. The usual kinds of unusual things occur ('god moves in mysterious ways' says the professor. 'so does this house' replies MacDowell) but the delightful miss Hunnicut seems to be the haunter's focus, and I got a distinct notion early on that there would be an erotic connection between them. This proves true. At Breakfast, Gayle argues with the professor and the ghost attacks him. She believes it is Belasco's son, Daniel, and this is apparently confirmed when they find the gruesome remains of aman in the crypt. Even after burial, however, the ghost of Daniel keeps tormenting her. She is led down to the chapel for a grisly scene. Meanwhile the professor's wife succumbs to a spirit of carnality and comes on to Roddy McDowell. He spurns he as her husband watches. The professor is then eager to conclude his investigation of the building and turns on a device that electrically sweeps the place and eradicates spirits. After this the house is apparently clear, but the professor had reckoned without the ingenuity of Belasco. The ending is more original than most, but is not entirely convincing. It is also rather too subdued.

Although even his fiercest fans will admit he is now well past his best. *Spoiler Starts*This script is clearly under worked and runs out long before the credits come up.

The smart, feisty, efficient women of today that the Average Joe would still be able to date.

However nothing I had seen would convince me that Gibson could lose it, and break down, as an actor.POSSIBLE SPOILERS)So when the film concludes with Gibson putting the cloth back on, I was not so much surprised, as I was bewildered his character, at least, as played by Gibson, seemed to be a very unlikely candidate for priesthood!As to Joaquin Phoenix I could not believe this was a man capable of launching a baseball 507 feet! I found it difficult to swallow watching Phoenix in GLADIATOR going up against a far beefier Russell Crowe (who at least looked the part).The final sequence in which Merrill has to swing a baseball bat seemed to a token attempt to appease the audience who had seen no combat at all... despite the son's warning that most of the action would be hand to hand, so that nuclear weapons would be avoided.All in all, I thought the level of invention and execution was on par for what I would expect of a made for TV film (and many would be far more entertaining than SIGNS). Some lame moralizing and philosophising instead of good old fashioned suspense, mystery, thrills and chills!

On the surface, it's a love story with a mystery, bright and shiny, maybe his most sumptuous feast of the senses. But it has a cold heart.James Stewart is the key to the film. I think a lot of people misjudge the film by misjudging his character, police detective John Scotty Ferguson. They see him and see the guy who played amiable dipso Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey or noble Mr. Smith or George Bailey. The secret of Scotty is he's no nice guy, though. He's more than a bit of a heel, a hard and greedy man eminently deserving of the roasting he gets in Henry Jones' postmortem. Watch Stewart in Hitchcock's Rope or the unjustly overlooked Carbine Williams, and you see the hardness Hitchcock was after, and got, from his lead here.Scotty does a lot of mean things in Vertigo, actions that feed his illness and lead to his doom. The character of Midge, subtly portrayed by Barbara Bel Geddes, is a key for understanding this. His casual stoking early on of Midge's flames of unreturned desire, especially when viewed in retrospect, burns through their happy banter and demonstrates how miserable a man he is, nowhere more brilliantly or ruthlessly than when he cuts her off from his life over a silly gag. Watch Vertigo more than once, and you may find yourself hating the guy as much as I do. But you still follow his path of doom with total sympathy; because of the elegant, enveloping way Hitchcock draws you into this world of passion, cut off from all bounds of propriety, even space and time.If Scotty was played by anyone other than Stewart, it's hard to imagine Vertigo packing the punch it does. You wouldn't have enough tolerance for the character to stick with his story. In its own day, Vertigo was a bit of a misfire, probably because audiences felt alienation from the Stewart image they were accustomed to. Yet now viewed from a decent remove, you get more of what Hitchcock was after, and respond to it better.Still, it's easy to understand people not liking Vertigo the first time they see it. At least that's true with me. I didn't like Vertigo the first time I saw it. Here's what helps you find the right handle. Fall in love with the wrong person. Become bitterly disappointed. See the one that you loved in the face of passersby, in odd places, and in your dreams. Then you begin to get it. Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes, as Billy Joel once sang, and trying to hold on too long is a recipe for self-inflicted pain.Talking too much about Vertigo is not a good idea. There's too many obvious spoilers in recounting the plot of the film, in explaining why Kim Novak is so flat-out stupendous in her performance, and how you are left feeling by film's end. Vertigo is a uniquely personal film, not only for Hitchcock, but for a broad array of viewers who like me have latched onto its tragic story.That's not to say it's perfect. There's a murder mystery wrapped up in Vertigo, and all the pieces don't exactly fit when you think about them later. Hitchcock called it icebox talk, something to leave the viewer pondering after the film was over, but maybe he left a few more loose ends than he should have this time around.Still, what Vertigo is after is not making sense but magic, and it succeeds wonderfully, nowhere more so then when it bends the laws of reality. Take the moment when the bookstore owner tells the sad tale of Carlotta Valdez while the lights of the room around him dim in eerie, unnatural sympathy.

This doesn't happen in the book - although I did hear somewhere on here that Richard Chamberlain expressed a lack of interest in this film, possibly after Roy Kinnear was killed.

And they didn't quite cover everything - (spoiler ahead) when Rochefort tells Justine the names of the Musketeers, he starts with Aramis, and she acts like she recognises the name.

I must say that I was sorely disappointed by The Eagle Has Landed SPOILERS ALERT.First, the title. I know it must be based on a book but after 1969 virtually anyone who knows history would associate The Eagle Has Landed with the Apollo 11 moon landing. Why have this as a title for a WWII movie?Second, any movie which focuses on the Germans in WWII for its story is going to have a hard time getting the audience to pull and root for the main characters. Who wants the Nazis to succeed? No one, of course, so why should we interested in watching a story told from the German side?Third, no one seems to keep his accent in this movie. Robert Duvall is a German officer but his German accent is barely noticeable. This is a movie that Duvall made after both of the The Godfather movies; I can't believe he decided to take a secondary role in this movie. Michael Caine doesn't even seem to try and affect a German accent. In fact his character, Col. Steiner, is said to have studied in England so I guess that was a way for his character to avoid trying to sound like a German. Of course Steiner goes to England posing as a Polish paratrooper (no jokes, please) and he doesn't attempt any Polish accent, either. Although a couple of his fellow commandos do it easily and seem to be able to speak Polish fluently. Lastly on accents, Donald Sutherland is trying to do an Irish accent and he at least is able to keep his brogue throughout the movie.Fourth, why is Sutherland trying to help the Germans anyway? He is Devlin, an Irish nationalist who is so hell bent on a unified Ireland that he's thrown in with the Nazis. But by the time he's recruited for the mission (to kidnap Churchill) even Duvall's character has conceded that the war has been lost, and it is only 1943! If the Irish really wanted to assassinate Churchill they'd hardly need German help since Irishmen are all over England.Fifth, the first part of the movie is entirely too long. It is used to try and establish I guess that Caine (Steiner) and his commandos are supposed to be the best soldiers in Germany but that they also aren't sympathetic to the Nazi cause. For that they're jailed. Then in a sort of German version of The Dirty Dozen Steiner and his men are offered a chance at freedom and reinstatement in the German Army if they will try and pull off this fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants mission to kidnap Churchill. Sixth, Sutherland (Devlin) is dropped in a couple of days before the Germans in order to be a pathfinder I guess. He's supposed to be a marsh warden which I guess is something of a park ranger and everyone in the town seems to accept him in that role even though he's only been there a day or so. No suspicion on their part of an Irishman just showing up.Seventh, Jenny Agutter, the ingenue for the movie, almost immediately falls in love with Devlin and even says she's in love with him, but having barely known him for more than 48 hrs. She's so much in love with him she murders his romantic rival after the rival discovers that Devlin is a Nazi agent of some sort. Even when Devlin confirms that he's working for the Nazis, Agutter still is loyal to him!Eighth, some woman in the town is a Fifth Columnist for the Nazis but why she is working for them, who knows?Ninth, very quickly the Germans' cover as Polish paratroopers is blown and they take the town hostage and are in a stand-off with a bunch of US Army Rangers led by a blow-hard National Guard colonel, Larry Hagman. You'd think you'd be waiting for a big battle sequence but no, the battle consists of an ambush by the Germans and then the Americans massacring the Germans who decide to die with their boots on, providing cover for Steiner and Devlin as they escape and try to continue on with the mission. You'd think that, knowing the war is lost anyway, they would've taken the chance to just surrender and sit the war out in a comfortable Allied POW camp.Tenth, although the Americans seemingly have surrounded the town, Steiner and Devlin escape through an amazing, ancient tunnel that is in the church and which almost takes them out of town! Boy, was that a lucky break! Eleventh, realizing that Steiner hasn't given up trying to kill Churchill, the Americans and British take Churchill to a place that is secure (why not get him the hell into his limo and take him back to London?). Steiner of course easily infiltrates the place and kills Churchill only to be gunned down the the Americans. Steiner dies believing he's killed Churchill but, wait a minute, it is Churchill's double! (an aside, the actor really does look like Churchill). The real Churchill is at the famous Tehran conference being held with FDR and Stalin. Now you would've thought that German military intelligence would've known about the Tehran Conference and realized that the real Churchill would be going to that meeting, not going to a vacation at some British coastal town.

I must say that I was sorely disappointed by The Eagle Has Landed SPOILERS ALERT.First, the title. I know it must be based on a book but after 1969 virtually anyone who knows history would associate The Eagle Has Landed with the Apollo 11 moon landing. Why have this as a title for a WWII movie?Second, any movie which focuses on the Germans in WWII for its story is going to have a hard time getting the audience to pull and root for the main characters. Who wants the Nazis to succeed? No one, of course, so why should we interested in watching a story told from the German side?Third, no one seems to keep his accent in this movie. Robert Duvall is a German officer but his German accent is barely noticeable. This is a movie that Duvall made after both of the The Godfather movies; I can't believe he decided to take a secondary role in this movie. Michael Caine doesn't even seem to try and affect a German accent. In fact his character, Col. Steiner, is said to have studied in England so I guess that was a way for his character to avoid trying to sound like a German. Of course Steiner goes to England posing as a Polish paratrooper (no jokes, please) and he doesn't attempt any Polish accent, either. Although a couple of his fellow commandos do it easily and seem to be able to speak Polish fluently. Lastly on accents, Donald Sutherland is trying to do an Irish accent and he at least is able to keep his brogue throughout the movie.Fourth, why is Sutherland trying to help the Germans anyway? He is Devlin, an Irish nationalist who is so hell bent on a unified Ireland that he's thrown in with the Nazis.

He is a broken man, covering up for the past, trying to please his family, but unable to open up and absolve himself of the dysfunction of his past life. He travels to New York to try to help his sister by uncovering what he has been hiding, with the help of a psychiatrist (Barbra Streisand).

I learn more about him every time I view this movie. He is a versatile actor and is truly underrated. He DEFINITELY deserved the Oscar for best actor for this difficult role.

Sometimes brooding and harsh, sometimes beautiful, The Thin Red Line looks at war from more points of view than any war film I have ever seen.It may be that these many points of view hurt the film's cohesion for some in the audience, but for me the combined effect of each character's thoughts and experience is what gives the film its great humanity.This is not a flag-waving war picture, nor is it an action-adventure film, and yet the battle scenes have a mad, intense terror that faithfully capture James Jones' depiction of close combat.

There is going to be a change in management and the chief psychiatrist is to be replaced by a new one, one Dr. Edwardes (Peck).

He is not Dr. Edwardes but a man with amnesia with no recollection of who he is (maybe he is someone with initials J B) or why he is posting himself as the known psychiatrist. But Constance doesn't discover this until after she has fallen in love with the man. She is convinced she can cure and save him, but he himself (and others) are convinced he has murdered the real Edwardes and taken his place. So he flees, and she goes after. Hunted by the police, they themselves must solve the labyrinth in J B's mind to find out if he killed Edwardes or not.A interesting movie, above all for the interesting shots representing psychoanalytic themes. Not to mention the dream-scene designed by artist Salvador Dalí. But there is also the murder mystery. Both are well done and interesting and brought together they create a pretty unique movie theme. One can tell that Hitchcock is behind the steering wheel, with nice cinematic tricks (and a cameo). The cast is good with Bergman and Peck in the leads but I liked Chekov as Peterson's old friend\/teacher(?) most. A most entertaining, cunning and sympathetic character. As the movie is a mystery\/thriller there is no loss that it is filmed in black and white, but fully enjoyable as it is.

At the time, Ishtar was considered so bad as to be unwatchable. It was skewered and vilified so strongly that the critics rapidly drove it out of the theaters. Few--including me--ever had the nerve to rent the movie.It wasn't until roughly 10 years after its release that my in-laws introduced me to the comedic greatness that is Ishtar. To this day when I tell friends and family that I love Ishtar, it is somewhat like saying, enthusiastically, Hey, I just contracted leprosy! Such is the stigma that still lingers with this film.To the credit of critics, this is by no means a work of pure comedic genius.The movie has essentially one theme that works--the effortless cluelessness of Lyle and Chuck as the world's worst songwriters--and this is exhausted almost completely within the first 30 minutes. Still, it is a totally knee-slapping hilarious 30 minutes. The meandering remaining plot that takes them to Morocco for a singing gig and leads them to become CIA agents is what cemented the bad taste in the mouth of critics for time immemorial. This theme by the end of the movie is rather re-treaded and worn-out. We kind of want Warren and Dustin to just shut up by then.This second act suffers from a kind of Hope-Crosby wannabee syndrome, and the writing isn't up to the slapstick pedigree the movie had begun revealing quite hilariously in the first act. Considering this film came from the pen of Elaine May--of Nichols and May comedy duet fame--I would have expected more, but perhaps this movie spiraled out of her hands because of the oft-misunderstood first act. I could easily see studio test audiences handily rejecting it and thus twisting the movie's priorities out of whack.Still, Ishtar shouldn't be brushed aside as a mere footnote in movie history. It is worth watching for its true hilarity and the performances of both Hoffman and Beatty.
