Schizophrenic love story of sorts &#150; a hybrid of romantic drama and supernatural underpinnings &#150; with photogenic couple Crudup and Connelly, respectively, a budding young congressman and a social activist, who are suddenly separated when she is killed in a car bombing with political ramifications (or is she?) The story suffers from its relentless ping-ponging from 1973 to 1983 with its skewed perspective in flashback\/flashforward that one never gets a real grasp of what is reality; then again that is perhaps the point(?) The two talented leads make an effort in balancing the schism of reality and ethereality especially Crudup eschewing his leading man looks for some real emoting, particularly his brink of insanity when he envisions his beloved everywhere. Based on the novel by Scott Spencer ('Endless Love') and produced by Jodie Foster.
