I bought this movie through Amazon.com along with 'Mon Homme' and 'The Roman Spring Of Mrs. Stone.'Anyway, this movie was very different from the very famous 'Titanic' movie made in 1997, as well. The story begins as Horty (Martinez) wins some kind of contest from his boss and he gets a free ticket to South Hampton to watch the Titanic set sail. When he arrives in South Hampton, he goes to the hotel he is staying at and is shown to his room. Suddenly, this chambermaid from the Titanic comes to his door and tells him that she has no where to stay and asks if she could sleep in his room for just the one night. Horty reluctantly, if I remember correctly that is, offers his room and his bed to the chambermaid while he tries to sleep in the chair. After they both settle down, she invites him into the bed just to sleep. He has this romantic dream about her, but when he wakes up she is already gone. He goes outside to watch the Titanic set sail, and sees that a photographer is taking her picture. After she walks away, he goes up to this photographer and asks to have her picture. When he comes home, his friends want to know what happened while he was there. He tells them that the chambermaid, named Marie, stayed in his room for the night. Obviously they were intrigued, and wouldn't believe that nothing happened between them. So, Horty gives in and starts to tell this elaborate story, making it up as he goes along. His wife overhears his stories, and believes that he cheated on her. He tells her that everything is made up and nothing happened. He eventually finds out that that Titanic sank, and figures Marie must have died. Somehow, this acting troupe comes along and wants Horty to make it into a play because he stories about the chambermaid named Marie are so popular in the town he lives in. He and his wife decide to go along and do it, because they need the money. One night as he's about to tell the story, he realizes that this person, Marie, is in the audience! I'll have to stop here, so I won't spoil it for you...This movie is a very good movie, and worth watching! It's not really even about the Titanic, the ship is in the details, but really its about Horty's fantasies about what could have happened the night he spent with a chambermaid named Marie.

Jacob was on the run as a fugitive from justice for the a week until he was found and arrested at a friends house. Last seen with Martha as he picked her up where she worked at Jacey's Ice Cream Parlor in town Jacob was the prime suspect in her death. Now after being apprehended and let out on bail he had to get what happened to Martha off his chest and the story wasn't a pretty one, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been either. Jacob did indeed kill Martha but it was a tragic accident. Gripping story about a father and mothers love for their troubled son and how they went about to save him from being put behind bars for killing his girlfriend and how it destroyed their lives as well as, of course, the lives of the parents of the girl who was killed. Jacob's mother Carolyn Ryan, Meryl Streep, wanted only the truth about her son actions in regard to Martha's death to come out in court and felt that it would exonerate him. His father Ben Ryan, Liam Neeson, on he other hand wanted to do everything possible and even went as far as destroying evidence in order to protect him. Jacob in the end sided with his mother and wrote out a full confession which his father could not bring himself to sign. Jacob was 16 years old and needed his parents signature to make the confession legal, and in effect threw himself on the mercy of the court. Jacob didn't bother to defend his actions which his father and lawyer Penos Demeris, Alfred Molina, begged him to do. Before and After is a story that has no happy ending no matter how you look at it, for both the victim and the accused. Its realism makes the film more effective and believable then most movies about courtroom dramas which usually have cop-out and feel-good or surprise endings. The story is told in retrospect from Jacob's little sisters Judith's, Julia Weldon, point of view. You already see from the start of the movie that things were never the same for Julia and her family when the film started. Meryl Streep as the mother is both protective and at the same time confident of the court and jury that her son Jacob was to face in his trial. Liam Neeson as the father was just the opposite not trusting the jury to acquit his son no matter how strong the evidence was in Jacob's favor that Martha's death was an accident. Jacob went with his mothers feeling in telling the truth and leaving it up to the judge instead of going to trail. In the end Jacob and his family were left to see if he was right or wrong in that decision. Strong performances all around with a really powerful scene in the movie towards the end when Carolyn is confronted by Martha's mother Terry, Ann Magnuson, at the hospital where Carolyn works as a doctor. No matter how much Carolyn tries to tell Terry how sorry she is about what happened to her daughter Terry is totally unmoved to the point where Carolyn is overcome with tears. You couldn't blame Terry for feeling like she did, her daughter was dead and Carolyn's son, no matter what the outcome of the court will be, is alive. Those in the movie acted as if they really believed in what the story was trying to tell us That a parent burying their child is the worse kind of tragedy imaginable, no matter what the circumstances of their child's death was. The film also brought out that those who have a son or daughter who was responsible for that death will have to, as well as their son or daughter, carry that guilt with them for the rest of their lives as well.

I think there are Lester Burnhams out there all over the country waiting to explode. Kevin Spacey gives a truly astounding performance as Lester Burnham. He's a middle-aged man who hates his very existence. His job sucks, his family takes him for granted, and the only thing he has to look forward to each day is masturbating in the shower, or occasionally in the bathroom at work. Lester is truly having a mid-life crisis. But rather than break down in despair or visit a shrink, he just rolls with it. He quits his job, blackmails his company for another year's salary, trades in his little Toyota for a vintage Firebird, starts smoking dope, and begins to lust after his daughter's best friend. All of this to the horror of his wife who then begins to cheat on him. Watching Kevin Spacey play Lester is truly amazing. Even though this behavior in real life could really have a destructive effect on his family, you can't help but root for the guy.The other actors in this film are great too, but make no mistake, Kevin Spacey is what makes this film great. Annette Bening is a little over-the-top in her portrayal of Lester's career-obsessed wife. She comes off completely fake and impersonal, as intended. The scene where she slaps herself for crying after failing to sell a house was perhaps a bit too much. But make no mistake about it; there are plenty of people like this in the world and they make me want to strangle them. The three teenage characters are each made memorable by the terrific young performers playing them. This film is not afraid to take chances with these young people and that's a major reason this film works so well.A major blemish this film suffers from is Chris Cooper's Marine Col. character. I don't know where to begin as far a criticizing this paper scarecrow they invented here. This Col. Fitts is a conglomerate of practically every stereotype you could think of. He's an abusive father, a bad husband, a Nazi memorabilia collector, a homophobe, and he's GAY all at once! And Hollywood takes its obligatory shot at the US military by making him a Marine on top of everything else. Cooper is a fine actor, and he does what he can with his character. I think the film would have been better served if they'd have taken Col. Fitts back to the drawing board and dropped some of his baggage, however. How about just making him an abusive father who hates gays? Wouldn't that have been enough? Overall, this film works so well because it is unflinchingly honest. The drug use, the plastic career-minded saps, the teenage angst, the sexual frustration. These things are rampant out there. But at the same time the world is such a very beautiful place and we hardly even seem to notice it. This film should be required viewing for all middle-aged married types, unhappy teens, suburban folks... just about all of us.The film isn't perfect, but how many are? This isn't a film that you will likely forget about the moment you've dropped it off back at your rental place of choice. You might in fact feel compelled to own a copy of it.To all the potential Lesters of the world Wake up! Life is passing you by!I'll give it 9 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.

The filming was great and above all very original, the film doesn't have any weaknesses, people who don't like it don't like real movies. spoiler here!, what happens to donnie is purely an act of god and in scenes with his science professor, donnie and him have great conversations about time travel, and those scenes alone help you understand the movie better. all i can say is that i love this movie, and its quite the journey and quite the experience you should get when you watch a movie.

It just so happened that it was on the movie network later that night. So, I watched it. Now, normally, I don't like the series much, if at all, but the movie really surprised me. The movie's story is about a digimon that in and of itself is a computer virus, which begins to replicate, and while doing so, hacking into a military base's computer system, and launching missiles, setting a 10 minute countdown to impact. Now, by hacking into the military base, and spreading through the internet, he's disabled all missile interceptors. One of the missiles is aimed at the neighborhood of one of the Digidestined, who is frantically trying to stop this virus. When they succeed, the missiles are disabled, and don't explode. A few years down the road, a new Digidestined is being constantly pursued by a monster digimon, which we later find out was of his creation. The digimon wants him to go back to the beginning, and with the help of some friends, figures out that the digimon was infected by a virus during his creation, and needs his help to rid himself of it. He and his friends use their digimons' combined power to help it, and ultimately succeed. This movie boasts smooth animation, and great visuals which make the movie all the more fun to watch.

This time we have a new partner, Samuel L. Jackson, who works so well with Bruce, they have such a great chemistry as partners in the film. Die Hard With a Vengeance is a worthy sequel of the original Die Hard. It has great action, a terrific story, and in some ways it's just a fun comedy. I loved how John just wouldn't stop complaining about the aspirin since he has a hang over from the night before. Especially his line when he finally gets aspirin from the main villain, it was just priceless. I think you'll definitely love this Die Hard if you are a fan.John is no longer at base one in life, he's actually farther behind I think, he's pretty much lost everything since his nasty drinking problem. He's suffering from a bad hang over this one morning and things get worse when he is threatened by an unknown villain to stand in the middle of the worst ghetto city wearing an offensive poster, right as he's about to get his butt killed, Zeus, a shop owner helps him out, but ends up getting involved. It turns out that the villain is Hans Gruber's brother, Simon Gruber, who is about to do everything his brother supposedly did wrong and will get the money. But John is going to make sure that he puts the Gruber name to shame.Die Hard With a Vengeance is an excellent action movie, it was a lot of fun and I couldn't believe how well it was made. Sam and Bruce are just perfect together. Jeremy Irons could not be more perfect for the role of Simon, he and Alan are so much alike where they have the most awesome voices for super bad villains.

Saw it when it first came out at a small theatre in St. Augustine, prompted by a local radio DJ I knew who was doing a promo from a coffin in the theatre. I was about 14 at the time, and somehow this film just caught me at the perfect time, making me into a DePalma fan for years. I won't go into too great detail on the plot or story summary, as that has been well covered elsewhere by others, but I will comment on the cast. Paul Williams is indeed creepy as Swan, and when I view the film now at age 44 there is something jarring about his performance. The man is not an actor, that's for sure, yet I can't imagine anyone else playing the role better. William Finley is also an odd casting choice, a bit long in the tooth yeah, metal teeth...I know to be a young composer, but in other ways an interesting choice because he is not the pretty boy Hollywood would put in the role if this film were made today. The man is actually an interesting actor who DePalma used a few times the doctor in Sisters and the detective in The Fury. I've often wondered why he didn't become a staple in character roles. Jessica Harper actually doesn't have much to do in this film, but the one thing she does outstanding is sing, and yes, that is her voice on Old Souls. A note about the Paul Williams score...it's brilliant, and that song stands alone as the cream of this crop. Finally, Gerrit Graham is a comic genius, and if you don't believe me, rent Used Cars and watch his Marshall Lucky commercial. You get the impression that this guy's career has just sort of happened to him, like he hangs out at Hollywood parties, and somebody sees him and remembers how damn funny he really is, and puts him in a film and he just sort of says, What the hell and does it. He is the Roy Hobbs of comic character actors. In later years I moved away from DePalma, but at the time this film meant something to me as an adolescent boy. The scene of the Phantom watching Phoenix and Swan through the skylight, and despite the rain you see tears in Finley's eyes...this hammered me on an emotional level that is still faintly echoed when I review the film today, and the final scene when the dying Phantom crawls towards his great lost love, as the world dances blindly around him in an orgy of hedonism that fades into a lone piano, moves me still. That first time I treated it as many of you treated Star Wars, seeing it a half dozen times in a one week run, buying the soundtrack, eagerly awaiting DePalma's next film, Obsession, which became an even greater favourite.

But how could it be? Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE is the CITIZEN KANE of horror movies; you don't top that. What this movie does, though, is it takes its crazy ideas and wacks you over the head with them; it goes all the way, and then some. That's the Hooper hallmark. Playing the movie for obvious laughs works to make it even more disturbing. The jokes play against the gruesome carrying on; this is a world gone mad because nothing, and I mean nothing makes sense. We're beyond surreal; we're through the looking glass; which, I think, is Hooper's intention. Stretch falls down the hole - it's not a rabbit hole, and she doesn't meet the mad hatter.

Jim Siedow weaves back and forth between rationality and the exact opposite with little or no warning. In truth, he looks like he's on the verge of breaking up throughout the entire movie. The scene where Stretch finds herself tied to a chair at the head of this wildly long table is one of Hooper's finest moments. The entire scene is one long take with the camera tracking into Stretch and then back out over the table, then back in to her, then, yet again, we track back out beyond the table, with Siedow raving on like a mad Baptist minister. The tracking, swooping camera, constantly changing our perspective, creates an almost lyrical sense of grandeur in this mad, mad world; Hooper has let us in on the joke, but he surprises us with such effects because we feel, with the Sawyer clan, the power and drive of their subterranean mania.Hooper is an extraordinary director.

So when I had heard about the live action version I wasn't too interested, this movie came out when I was 11 years old for goodness's sake, but I just didn't want to see what was already a perfect movie being made into a live action one, but my grandparents had bought it and we watched it together. I remember seeing it and really didn't like it, but as I grew up, it was on TV one day so I figured since I'm a little more grown up to give this another chance and still I'm not too thrilled with this new take on the tail, lol, get it? Eh, my lame jokes, gotta love them.Roger Dearly is an American computer game designer, who shares his home in London with his pet dalmatian, Pongo. One day Roger takes Pongo for a walk, and the dog sets his eyes on a beautiful female Dalmatian named Perdy. After a frantic chase through the streets of London, Roger and Pongo discover Perdy likes Pongo; and Perdy's owner, fashion designer Anita Campbell-Green, is taken with Roger when they meet in St. James Park. Romance blossoms between both human and canine couples and Roger and Anita walk down the aisle. Anita works for Cruella DeVil, a sexy fashion maven with a great love for cigarettes and fur. Anita becomes inspired by her dogs and designs a fur coat made with spotted fur, causing Cruella to leap on the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians. When Cruella learns that Perdy has given birth to fifteen Dalmatian puppies she offers the couple a decent price for the newborn puppies, but the couple refuses. Flying into a maniacal rage, she fires Anita and vows to get even. She has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, steal the puppies and deliver them to her ancient estate, but the puppies escape and now must find their way home.So I absolutely adore Glenn Close, she's one of my favorite actresses of all time and always delivers very on the key performances, now she was a great choice for Cruella, but I think it was just the whole idea of the movie that dragged her down, the whole cast as a matter of a fact is too good for this movie. It's just not as fun as the original animated classic, I think the reason the animated movie is so much better is because it was just more special and personal as it was hand drawn and a classic for so many kids who grew up with it. Maybe I am being stubborn where I'm just more for the original, but honestly this movie is just kind of pointless and not really for the kids nore the adults. I'd say it's not like it's the most horrible movie in the world, but it's just not worth it to go out of your way to watch it.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 August 2004","score":"13 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" 101 Dalmatians, the ultimate Disney animated classic about none other than PUPPIES!

After a frantic chase through the streets of London, Roger and Pongo discover Perdy likes Pongo; and Perdy's owner, fashion designer Anita Campbell-Green, is taken with Roger when they meet in St. James Park. Romance blossoms between both human and canine couples and Roger and Anita walk down the aisle. Anita works for Cruella DeVil, a sexy fashion maven with a great love for cigarettes and fur. Anita becomes inspired by her dogs and designs a fur coat made with spotted fur, causing Cruella to leap on the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians. When Cruella learns that Perdy has given birth to fifteen Dalmatian puppies she offers the couple a decent price for the newborn puppies, but the couple refuses. Flying into a maniacal rage, she fires Anita and vows to get even. She has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, steal the puppies and deliver them to her ancient estate, but the puppies escape and now must find their way home.So I absolutely adore Glenn Close, she's one of my favorite actresses of all time and always delivers very on the key performances, now she was a great choice for Cruella, but I think it was just the whole idea of the movie that dragged her down, the whole cast as a matter of a fact is too good for this movie. It's just not as fun as the original animated classic, I think the reason the animated movie is so much better is because it was just more special and personal as it was hand drawn and a classic for so many kids who grew up with it. Maybe I am being stubborn where I'm just more for the original, but honestly this movie is just kind of pointless and not really for the kids nore the adults. I'd say it's not like it's the most horrible movie in the world, but it's just not worth it to go out of your way to watch it.4\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"8 August 2004","score":"13 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":" 101 Dalmatians, the ultimate Disney animated classic about none other than PUPPIES! It was clever, sharp, witty and just a wonderful movie and created one of Disney's most memorable and classic villains Cruella DeVil. So when I had heard about the live action version I wasn't too interested, this movie came out when I was 11 years old for goodness's sake, but I just didn't want to see what was already a perfect movie being made into a live action one, but my grandparents had bought it and we watched it together. I remember seeing it and really didn't like it, but as I grew up, it was on TV one day so I figured since I'm a little more grown up to give this another chance and still I'm not too thrilled with this new take on the tail, lol, get it?

It is moving each and every time I watch it. It takes this true and tragic story of the Titanic, and adds an amazing love story to it. It is beyond a mere romantic movie, it sets a standard. Winning eleven Academy Awards it is most definitely a masterpiece, and shows the brilliance of the art of filmmaking.James Cameron, the director of the Terminator movies, really shows a soft and compassionate side in this movie. The direction and production of this movie is incredible, it is very craft fully done. The synchronicity and very smooth transition from scene to scene makes every moment of this movie worth while. This movie is over three hours long, but it is the most easily spent three hours. Not at a single moment did I consider this movie to be dragged on or any other such nonsense. The acting in this movie was off the charts, this is the movie that sent Leo's career sky rocketing, it really shows his talent as an actor. The on screen chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is superb, extremely believable. I honestly can not see anyone else filling the shoes of these two, anyone in the movie in fact. What really makes this movie is the story, it is taken from the true story of the Titanic, but there is a fictitious love story the movie is focused around. It adds a Romeo and Juliet scenario, where the rich and poor are separated and can not be together. It is a very romantic and captivating tale. Throughout much of the movie I would be sitting there with a grin on my face in owe of how much chemistry these two have, also the humor, which is not found much in the film, is very classy and elegantly handled.The most memorable factor of this movie is the soundtrack. At any moment in time if the music from the picture were to come on anyone can easily distinguish that it belongs to this movie.

But his talent is really an on-screen thing for me, although of course his writing is so creative and lucid. With that being said, this movie had all the opportunity to be hilarious, but failed because Woody was missing. There is nothing to read into this movie; everything is laid out right there for the audience and it is therefore pure entertainment. This is what Woody wanted, as I understand it, and he achieves just that. The script, the story line, the lines themselves, the colour, the characters, the bad play feel were all there. But the one connecting character, the writer, just couldn't make it really work. John Cusak was the disappointment. But can you blame him really?  These were Woody lines, Woody gestures, Woody self-discussions. John just isn't Woody, and the part just wasn't John. The characters complained repeatedly that they were not comfortable in their lines - that's exactly how John Cusak came across to me. And how could he be? There is only one Woody.  Maybe Woody needed to write the part away from the type of character he is so someone else can fill the role because his type is so pervasive and reliant on his particular delivery. I felt sorry for Cusak, and I was sorry it wasn't Woody. I spent the whole movie imagining it was Woody in that role, and it became really funny only then.  I think we all hate bad, overacted plays, and this movie played like a camera is mounted and we are watching a bad play with bad actors being rehearsed. Lots of intentional yelling, grandiose gestures, overdone acting, but with Woody in the writer's role, it would have been particularly hilarious because he would provide the one sane side (which is saying alot) to the whole thing.

The whole situation with gangsters, falling in love with a grande dame and taking writing tips from a killer seemed almost acceptable with John Cusak in the role, yet would be absolutely and completely preposterous with a very Jewish and nebbish Woody.

They want me to think they are intellectuals, or different in some way or another. However, they are far from it, like pi.

Should I call a movie good simply because it is different? Absolutely not. That is not what makes a film good. David Lynch is my favorite director. He is able to inspire some sort of fantastic feeling in all of his films. He understands the film medium and knows how to create a world that is so distant yet so familiar by looking below the surface of about every environment imaginable. He has proven the fact that, as Stan Brakhage puts it, the eye is an extension of the brain.Now, why is pi a failure? Because it is trying to create by distorting things the wrong way, to the point where it becomes ridiculous. The most obvious example being the grainy, black and white cinematography. Does the movie really need to be excessively grainy? No. Of course not. And one may think of it as expressionistic or meaningful, but I don't.
