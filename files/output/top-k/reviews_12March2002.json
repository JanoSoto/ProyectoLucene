As he tries to take control of it, he causes more trouble and fun for the viewing audience.We also get a fascinating look into the Prehistoric Age billions of years ago when Dinosaurs roamed the earth. You're kids will find this part exciting because Disney presents many Dinosaurs such as a Brontosaurus, Pterodactyls and even a Tyrannosaurus Rex. All the movements of the dinosaurs are wonderfully animated by Disney. The artists really capture their presence.Disney would use their beauty animating Dinosaurs `In The Land Before Time' movie series.Another great scene is where the conductor introduces In the soundtrack of the picture and produces to indulge in the many instruments and their sounds such as a harp, trumpet, violin and many other instruments.I would explain more of the scenes but that would take away from the anticipation of those people who haven't watched this film in years.There is a new version of Fantasia called `Fantasia 2000'Which includes new scenes and a computer restored version of the film.Whichever version you watch, it will be a viewing pleasure you won't forget.A must buy for Adults and Kids.This movie brought back great memories of when I was a kid, and now looking back at this movie, I can appreciate what Walt Disney did in creating this timeless movie.

Theres no depth. Butt i wasn't anticipating any. I went to go see the cool pseudo-time lapse sequences and the fictional future, 800,000 years from now. And hey, it was pretty nifty when the moon got torn. Inevitably the movie suffers from some easily identifiable flaws. 1.)Its predictable nature.2.) The early dialogue sounds like something out of a bad off-broadway play. I know its supposed to be the turn of the century, butt come on! Folks back then weren't THAT hokey. Or were they? Perhaps well never know without our very own time machines.3.)The grunt-morlocks just plain sucked. And gosh were they ugly. I fail too see how 800,000 years of evolution can somehow mean de-evolution. They try to explain that they are the result of careful breeding, butt I refuse to believe that any amount of careful breeding can result in dog-faced men. All the energy that went into character creation was apparently diverted towards the uber-morlock. Uber is right.4.) Finally, the score isn't all that great. I could do without the chantings of native people whome you don't see chant and the typical Thumpedy, dumpedy-dump at key action moments. This is just a minor quibble, as 99% of movie scores are par or sub-par. Still, I'd recommend that you go see The Time Machine on the great, big, wide screen. Despite its shortcomings, its worth seeing for the time lapse-photography, Uber-morlock, and because it clocks in waaaayyyyyy under 3 hours. ;) Just make sure you know what your getting into.6\/10 ","genre":"Sci-Fi, Adventure, Action"},{"date":"12 March 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  If you examine commercial previews for The Time Machine, You'll find pretty much the whole movie compressed into short, 60 second ads.
