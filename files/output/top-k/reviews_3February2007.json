So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10\/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end.

Stallone did come up with a creative idea to take the Rocky series in a different direction but I guess he failed to deliver everything right. Although I must make it very clear in the beginning itself that I do not rate this movie as bad as many others have.First of all, let me relax myself by taking out my frustration on the music. Music is one of the most important factors that characterizes the Rocky movies. Right from the first film to the fourth Rocky movies are known to give stunningly energetic music. This was totally missing in Rocky V. All music in Rocky V was rap. I mean no insult to rap music or rap musicians but the music just did not fit. It was a shocker for me when I heard the Rocky V tracks at a friend's place.Some people have expressed their disagreement with the very idea of Rocky losing all his money, house and all and coming back to the old neighborhood. I felt that was okay but how it was eventually handled was not so effective. It always could have been done in a better way. Scripting was not so effective, I must admit. As I said, more effort was needed in handling subtleties. When you have decided that a world famous boxer was going from riches back to rags you ought to think hard about every word and every scene.Stallone did a remarkable job by ripping the financial power of Rocky for this created room for large number of ways in which the movie could be taken forward. But where the movie scored low was Stallone not being able to capitalize on the room that was created. I felt that if this movie would have been longer I would not have a problem but my gut feeling says that there was a scope for handling things in a much better way.Stallone creates a challenging character for himself in Rocky V. But he does not deliver the best performance in comparison to his performance in other movies. He does a decent job though with regards to the parts dealing with Rocky's strained relationship with his son. This was, to me, the best part of the movie - the whole portrayal of the father-son relationship, of course ignoring the direction glitch of the sudden aging of Rocky Jr. Sage Stallone did a decent job with his acting considering it was a debut film.Rocky V had its other positives apart from the father-son relationship. One of them being the words of Micky Goldmill recalled by Rocky. Get up, you son of a bitch! Cause Micky loves ya! was amazing to me.

So when I heard of Rocky 3 I seriously did not know what precisely to expect. What would be the story line? What aspect of Rocky's life was to be explored now? Rocky 3 portrays a possible problem a boxer might face after his career reaches the peak. As Micky puts it, the boxer gets civlized. Rocky has achieved all fame and name and not to mention a lot of money. He has changed his lifestyle completely much to the disapproval and dismay of his wife and trainer cum friend Micky. His training becomes less intense and over-confidence takes over him after a streak of wins. He does remain the kind hearted and humble man that we have seen him as. This change in Rocky's life and perspective is a possible reference to Apollo's life as well. Apollo too was shown to be over-confident and over-relaxed in the first part of Rocky series.In the meantime, we see emerging, another vicious, brutal boxer Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang clearly has one advantage on his side. His training is mean and vicious. And he is rising up...fast! So when Clubber Lang and Rocky are scheduled to meet in the ring we see the difference in the training styles of both boxers. One can clearly feel the tinge that Rocky is going to lose and he does. With Micky suffering a heart stroke, Rocky under-prepared and over-confident gets a beating from Lang and loses in the second round by KO. With Micky dead and Rocky's confidence and pride totally shattered, Apollo now offers to help Rocky train once again for a rematch. Apollo however teaches Rocky to be faster and more agile. Now make a careful comparison between Stallone's fighting method as Rocky in the first two movies. He did not move fast but gave intense punches and almost had a street brawl. This is of course the reason why the decision goes in favor of Apollo in the first part for Apollo had been able to land way more punches and jabs on Rocky. And now see the way he fights in the third installment against Lang. He moves faster, has a very good footwork, excellent dodging capability and has more stamina. I have to appreciate Stallone for having trained hard to show this new ability of Rocky's. The movie does get a little off the track when we see the fight between Hogan (as Thunderlips) and Rocky. The training scenes are very good but still there is something absent that was present in the first two movies. It is difficult to describe what exactly seems to be missing. The movie tries to tell that one should not let success get into their heads. It also shows an emerging friendship based on mutual admiration and respect between Apollo and Rocky.And I believe that a write-up on Rocky 3 is incomplete without Rocky 3's soundtrack Eye of the Tiger by Survivor. Was possibly a song with the best lyrics to suit a boxing movie. The soundtrack covers up a lot for the very slightly reduced luster of the Rocky saga.In the end, I'll say it is a well done movie and not bad at all! It is a highly entertaining, warm and an encouraging movie.

This movie is packed with much more action, emotion and a much brutal final match. Rocky 4 is about a Russian boxer Ivan Drago who ends up killing Apollo Creed in an exhibition match. Rocky, in a flurry of emotions, challenges Ivan himself. As per the conditions of the match, he is to fight the match in Russia. He even trains in Russia considering the distractions he could face back home.We knew in Rocky 3 that in the end Rocky was going to end up on top and I am sure many of us also had the feeling that Rocky IV would also show him on top. The story is fairly simple. Just like unique training sequence, music and a different fighting method were major factors in helping Rocky 3 strike a chord with the fans of the franchise, similar was the case with Rocky IV. With not so deep a story to tell, Rocky IV needed something unique and powerful to carve a niche.And that is precisely what Rocky IV was able to find. Rocky IV found Dolph Lundgren to play the Russian boxer Ivan Drago. And it showed a beautifully intense training sequence, a shocking first match and an inspiring second match. The scene of Apollo receiving the last punch of his life from Ivan Drago was one powerful scene that created a deep impact. The fear in the mind of Rocky as portrayed in his visions while driving back home was well done too. (There's no easy Way out playing in the background.) Vince DiCola does a real good job with the music. The music he composed for the training sequence was really good. The training sequence itself was very good. The training shows Rocky use natural elements around him instead of sophisticated equipment (he is denied that anyway). The best part of the training scene is the huge difference between Drago's training and Rocky's training shown in parallel. It was a well done sequence.The match was really well choreographed. Intense, bloody, brutal and nail-biting. And since the movie came out at a much later stage (it had to, after all it is the fourth movie) Stallone had these well-developed abs and chest and that helped in making the match and the training look much better. The match and the training did it again for this Rocky movie. Pretty sure if they had screwed up in these parts, the movie would never have become the box office success that it has become.A must watch for all Rocky fans!

I actually think the death of Creed fit into the storyline well, and he always seemed more of a bloated pretty boy showman than a bloody and bruised brawler like Rocky. The training montages are pretty sweet, and for some reason, I really liked the scene where Rocky drives around in his car and recalls his past fights.The one thing that really bugs me is ironically arguably the best part of the movie, the final fight with Drago. I'm not gonna get pissy with a movie because its fighting scenes aren't very realistic, but this was just... too fake.

I don't care how determined he was, I think it would have been better if Ivan somehow got dq'd so it'd at least be plausible. But that said, it's 2 bloody guys pounding each other, so it's still entertainment. A good movie.

Rocky II is the continuation of the journey into the life of the boxer Rocky Balboa. It explores the impact of the fight with Apollo on the life of Rocky Balboa. Though Rocky has lost the match as per judges' decision, he still has won the hearts of thousands of boxing fans. Rocky's courage and valor have struck a chord with all boxing fans who now believe that Apollo has won the match by luck. This hurts Apollo's ego and pride and he sets out to offer one more chance to the Rock.The whole cast remains essentially the same. Bill Conti still delivers fine music he managed to deliver in the first part. The training sequence and the fight are even more intense and inspiring than the first part. The story I shall still say has been scripted very well to be consistent with the characters and story of Rocky I.However one gets to see a bit more technical side of the boxing world in this part of the Rocky series. On one hand we have Apollo who trains intensely without underestimating Rocky this time. Micky knows that Apollo was taken by surprise by the south-paw jinx (atypical boxing method that Rocky uses wherein he uses a left handed approach) but this time he will be prepared and Rocky would stand no chance. Hence Micky delivers a whole new package of training to Rocky to change his orientation and approach altogether.When Rocky's wife (Adrian) slips into a coma all training is suspended and Micky is in a dilemma. He knows Rocky needs training and at the same time realizes that Rocky cannot concentrate with his wife in coma. Here the story gets trainer-centric. So apart from acting as a window to the deeper aspect of Rocky's life this movie gives out more about the training involved and sets the story from a somewhat trainer's perspective as well.I find it very difficult to make any comparison of Rocky 2 with Rocky 1. Rocky 2 is a fulfillment of Rocky 1. One has to admit that Rocky I as a single movie would be quite abrupt.I can't find the heart to take any stars away from the movie! Enjoy!
