The plot is believable; the acting, from the minor characters right up to and including the leads, is excellent; the dialogue is natural and realistic (and intelligible); and the special effects have aged well and are quite good, as good as today's CGI stuff. But unlike today's sf movies, it's not the f\/x that play the central role here but rather plot, character, and acting.I can understand some of the comments about some of the movie's science, particularly in the way earth gravity suddenly appears inside buildings and the way people's cranial cavities literally expand like balloons when exposed to near zero pressure, but none of that is central. I'm pleased when I see real science in movies (maybe surprised would be a better term), but if I want science I can read a textbook. Anyway, this shortfall is more than made up for by having a doctor in the movie named Lazarus - over scientific accuracy I'll take a little humor. Or good dialogue, such as when O'Neil, having just chased a perp through half the installation, finally corners him in a kitchen, gets the drop on him, and leveling his shotgun at his desperate kitchen knife-wielding opponent says to him, 'Think it over'.Comparisons have been made to other movies like High Noon and sf classics like Alien and 2001. I'll leave 2001 go at least until I can figure out how that giant fetus got out there in outer space, but as to Alien, well, in my view Outland compares quite well despite Alien's iconic status. Alien conveys all the niceness of a vat of sulfuric acid. What a bunch of dismal characters inhabited that movie. Outland has a different feel to it and portrays more than a few positive human characteristics (the interaction between O'Neil and his wife is quite affecting although, or maybe because, it takes place via a video screen). And as to this being a 'remake' of High Noon set in outer space, well, it really isn't. In fact there's only one aspect of the plot that is similar (the first half of Outland is a whodunit), though the device of periodically showing a clock to countdown when the bad guys will arrive is of course an obvious imitation. Someone else said that this movie is actually a 'western', and that's true if you mean a movie with a real hero who stands virtually alone despite the odds on the side of right vs. wrong (though he does get a little help especially from one particular rather brave woman). Basically though, this is just a very good movie that makes good use of and occasionally even exceeds the limits of its genre. It's got plenty of action and suspense and not a single dead spot. It's worth seeing. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2006","score":"15 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" What an entertaining movie this is.

And although i've seen it so many times, i never grow tired of it. It's really a very charming film with an excellent script and direction by Guiseppe Tornatore. The acting is really great too. Monica Bellucci is not only the most beautiful woman in the world, but also a great actress. She's so beautiful in this film that you never ask yourself why the little Renato is so in love with her. And Guiseppe Sulfaro, who plays him, is really great too. I even recommended this film to a friend of mine, who is a kind of guy whose favorite film is The Fast and the Furious, but he liked it so much that we even had a long discussion about it and he's not into that kind of things too. We came up with the phrase the Malena syndrome.What does that mean? It's about one really annoying women's quality, it exist in man too, but i think not in such proportion. I'm talking about woman's envy, often in regards to a more beautiful woman. We can feel the hatred and envy towards Malena thorough the film. Her only fault is her beauty and that's what destroys her and leads her to the shocking and brutal climax of the film. I've seen several cases of the Malena syndrome and it's really so pathetic but i don't mean to insult anybody. Man also take advantage and talk behind Malena's back and only Renato, and the viewers through his eyes, can see that she's so pure and innocent of all the crimes they assume she's guilty of. We can do nothing but feel sorry for her.All in all it's a great movie. I've always been into that kind of coming-of-age films and this is one of my favorite ones.

I held off on seeing the movie for a long time as I'd heard it wasn't all that good and I think that a lot of King's work is not, for some reason, as good when their turned into movies. But after seeing it, I have mixed feelings. On the plus side, the basic story is the same. On the minus side, it was not anywhere near as good as the book. I thought the book was an 8 or 9 on a 10 scale but the movie was about average. Just my opinion.Here are some things I noticed. Number one is that, at times, the movie seemed almost campy. The fatsuit that Billy wore looked totally fake. And it also seemed that some of the dialog, which was so powerful in the book took on an almost campy tone in the movie. The movie version had nowhere near the intensity of the book and many of the characters did not have the multi dimension aspect they did in the book. It wasn't awful, I mean the movie sure did keep one's attention but it wasn't great either.In the book, one gets to know the turmoil that Billy Halleck experiences as a lot of the book focuses on his thinking. In the movie we don't get that. Honestly it seemed at times, like the character of Billy was channeling Jack Nicholson's character in The Shining. The building of tension was not nearly so compelling and though I'm aware that this movie could have been a lot worse(And honestly I thought it would be) I still wish it had been better.And then there's the ending. THAT was not done well at all. First of all in the book we do not see what the results of Heidi's eating the pie are., That was one thing that made the book ending so chilling. One really did not know WHAT happened and that was eerie and rather creepy. But in the movie it takes on a horror movie aspect, as the movie shows us what happened to Heidi which I didn't think it should have done. I was really surprised at that.And then there's Billy's motivations himself. In the 'book version Ginelli is killed by Gina and THAT'S what sends Billy over the edge. You clearly are made to understand by the writings of the book what happens and when. In the movie it is all about a possible affair between Heidi and the doctor which wasn't done that well and lacked believability. Another disappointment.And then there's the CAMPY aspect again. I mean the last line at the end was something like white doctor from town. It didn't sound serious, it sounded almost absurd. I was really disappointed by the end especially considering the power it had in the book.Ginelli was played very well by Montegna but also lacked the complexity he had in the book. In the book version, the scenes between Hallack and Ginelli were very interesting and in the movie they really did not have that compelling aspect. Not the performers fault but still a letdown.Now the things I liked. The photography was excellent. I love the fact that King's books take place in New England and they picked up the small town New England feel wonderfully. I also like that the gist of the original story was kept pretty much the same. And the same characters were still in the movie. The story itself was still compelling enough to hold my interest for the length of the movie. And it is thought provoking. So I'd still give it an average rating.And if someone watches this who isn't familiar with the book they might like this better because it IS better then a lot of other movies that are made from King's books. The last King movie I saw was the Secret Window which I absolutely hated.

The movie version had nowhere near the intensity of the book and many of the characters did not have the multi dimension aspect they did in the book. It wasn't awful, I mean the movie sure did keep one's attention but it wasn't great either.In the book, one gets to know the turmoil that Billy Halleck experiences as a lot of the book focuses on his thinking. In the movie we don't get that. Honestly it seemed at times, like the character of Billy was channeling Jack Nicholson's character in The Shining. The building of tension was not nearly so compelling and though I'm aware that this movie could have been a lot worse(And honestly I thought it would be) I still wish it had been better.And then there's the ending. THAT was not done well at all. First of all in the book we do not see what the results of Heidi's eating the pie are., That was one thing that made the book ending so chilling. One really did not know WHAT happened and that was eerie and rather creepy. But in the movie it takes on a horror movie aspect, as the movie shows us what happened to Heidi which I didn't think it should have done. I was really surprised at that.And then there's Billy's motivations himself. In the 'book version Ginelli is killed by Gina and THAT'S what sends Billy over the edge. You clearly are made to understand by the writings of the book what happens and when. In the movie it is all about a possible affair between Heidi and the doctor which wasn't done that well and lacked believability. Another disappointment.And then there's the CAMPY aspect again. I mean the last line at the end was something like white doctor from town. It didn't sound serious, it sounded almost absurd. I was really disappointed by the end especially considering the power it had in the book.Ginelli was played very well by Montegna but also lacked the complexity he had in the book. In the book version, the scenes between Hallack and Ginelli were very interesting and in the movie they really did not have that compelling aspect. Not the performers fault but still a letdown.Now the things I liked. The photography was excellent. I love the fact that King's books take place in New England and they picked up the small town New England feel wonderfully. I also like that the gist of the original story was kept pretty much the same. And the same characters were still in the movie. The story itself was still compelling enough to hold my interest for the length of the movie. And it is thought provoking. So I'd still give it an average rating.And if someone watches this who isn't familiar with the book they might like this better because it IS better then a lot of other movies that are made from King's books. The last King movie I saw was the Secret Window which I absolutely hated. This was much MUCH better then that to be sure and I might even watch it again sometime but it was still disappointing overall. My vote is 5.

When, however, the situation changed in 1989, I remember that I saw THE MISSION for the first time on Polish TV in 1995 as a part of cinema's 100th anniversary celebration. The movie moved me so much that I have come back to it several times since then. Each time I see it, I find something new in the film. Therefore, I consider THE MISSION one of the very best films ever made, a film where history meets single individuals, where sadness is conquered by joy and disbelief and skepticism by profound thoughts on humanity.The content of the film, though historical, applies perfectly to modern times. The universal struggle of two spirits, the one of might and the one of Love, has always been noticeable wherever and whenever people live. Let us look briefly at the gist of the content the Jesuits build a mission in the core of a jungle in South America, they understand the heart of the Gospels Love without looking for reward. Yet, the politics of the conquerors (Spaniards and the Portuguese) steps in and destroys the mission... However, not everything dies even though goodness seems to be conquered... This story, presented here in a condensed way but developed in the film is so powerful that it leads to reflections what, in fact, reigns in our lives; why good people have to suffer, why we are forced to do what we hate, it is so effortless to destroy while to build requires so much strength, why the world turns our good deeds into evil, etc. This aspect is the pearl of the film and the feast for the soul even though such thoughts require some courage from an individual. I reflected on the fact if I am willing to support the weak or if I rather choose might which is my master I attempt at in my actions? It's strange but we will never get to know our personalities completely... And that is what the film also shows. Altamiro (Ray Mc Anally), for instance, is a person of different psychological states hard to evaluate.The performances are exceptionally powerful which makes THE MISSION a very nice piece of film art. Jeremy Irons gives a very powerful performance as Father Gabriel expressing all values a good Christian should own goodness, gentleness, patience, courage, and purity. He has this blink in his eyes that makes his portrayal particularly memorable. Robert De Niro... I would say frankly that this is his very best acting. People concentrate on different films when they hear of De Niro's performances, particularly in Michael Cimino's THE DEER HUNTER (1978) or in Martin Scorsese's CAPE FEAR (1991). Some of them skip THE MISSION. Yet his portrayal of Rodrigo Mendoza is a masterpiece in its own. This role is difficult to portray since Mendoza is a man of two contradictory spirits from a slave trader to the devoted Jesuit. Nevertheless, De Niro does a marvelous job. One moment caught my attention from the first view of the film Mendoza's death and this nostalgic look at Jesus in the Eucharist (even while writing about this moment a tear appears unintentionally in the eye). Ray McAnnally portrays Altamiro, a bishop who is forced to do what he actually does not intend to. He seems to be touched by the mission and in spite of that, he finally allows for slaughters. In the final shot, he expresses one thing powerfully a face of a man whose conscience will forever suffer. Thus we have made the world...thus have I made it, which are his words said at the end by him clearly show what kind of person he was.Another powerful aspect of the film is music. Ennio Morricone is famous for having written music to many films but here, in THE MISSION, he did something absolutely sublime. I bought a CD listening to music alone and it was an unforgettable experience for me. People who heard it and did not see the film asked me where I got such wonderful tunes. Indian rhythms combined with Christian spirituality and ecclesiastic chorus - UNFORGETTABLE! I promise you that having seen this film, you will never forget, among other things, these lovely tunes.The filming locations, which obviously constitute an additional aspect in any film, add a thrill and authenticity to everything. It is hard to imagine other places in THE MISSION. The movie is shot mostly in the places where the historical events took place. We see the mighty Iguazu waterfalls, the jungle where Guarani Indians live, the city of Cartagena in Colombia as well as the hills of the Brazil-Argentinian border.What more is there to say? I think that most readers will agree with me that THE MISSION is a masterpiece, a film that opens people to new horizons of understanding the profound thoughts that are there in our lives if we are willing to reflect on them or not. Speaking religiously, Christ has once died on the Cross but then all was conquered by Love.The final scene gives an answer to Father Gabriel's thought that I entailed at the beginning. A silent sunny day in the jungle... we see a small group of Indian children who have survived the destruction. A little girl picks up a violin that she finds in the river and they begin to row a small boat towards the future... Father Gabriel, you are right.

It makes quite a strong political commentary, with a religious fanatic in the White House (this time, frighteningly, appointed to a lifetime term), whose own daughter, curiously named Utopia, says things like Now is the time to rise up against the president's corrupt theocracy of lies and terror!! Mr. President has decided to move the nation's capital from Washington D.C. to his hometown, Lynchburg, Virginia.

He runs around talking like a real bad guy and acting like a real bad guy, all the while trying to retrieve an antidote from the real bad guys (the government) who have infected him with a virus which will give him 10 hours to retrieve a stolen black box containing the codes to control the world's energy transmission satellites.

If I wanted to get scared, I'd go ride my bike on the wrong side of the busy freeway. I'm in for a good story, or whatever you can absorb from a movie. And that, the movie had a lot to offer. I can't tell whether it's because we're not in 1980 anymore, or if it's about Kubrick's style, but I didn't get scared at all. But let's see right from the beginning, you can tell what's going to happen. Every frame of the movie reveals there's evil stuff on the way. And when we reach the hotel, there's scary music being played *loudly* practically all the time. It's cool having dissonant classical movie being played on a horror movie, but it gets to the point of okay, I GOT it already eventually. And Jack Nicholson is freaky right from the beginning, anyway. There isn't exactly a crescendo of things going wrong; it's a crescendo of wrong things that have been wrong right from the start. And if I have to talk about a scary movie that isn't scary, I think I'd pick The Exorcist instead, and mention how that one *does* effectively create the growing sense of impending doom, that something that NEVER should happen will happen eventually.The Shining, on the other hand, is too obvious all the time. The camera following the characters around huge halls and long corridors, as if something was about to jump out at them, followed by the aforementioned loud dissonant music, gives the impression of evil that just isn't there. It ends up feeling like Kubrick is pulling our leg, *pretending* the movie is scary when it isn't. But then again, it's supposed to be atmosphere, and it works when things start getting tense. The story, in essence, is very simple, but there are those strange, complicated twists along the way. I'm not going to tell the whole plot, since you can find it in almost every review here. Jack Torrance, suddenly, is transported to a 1921 party (as we can see by all the dancers on an *empty* hotel), drinks bourbon without being charged, and talks to a waiter that once was the caretaker of the hotel and killed his family before committing suicide. He is, clearly, being possessed by some kind of evil force that we can never discern, while his psychic son calls for help from Mr. Hallorann, who also has that power. Eventually, Jack chases his family with an axe, providing some exquisitely over-the-top performances, and all those ghosts and dead people start appearing. And after his wife and son manage to escape and he freezes to death, we learn that he *was* there before, in 1921. I don't find all that particularly confusing, since it's rather open to interpretation (I don't know whether that was the intention, but then again, I never read the novel). If *you* don't see sense on the story, you can find explanations out there.To me, it isn't really about the story (I just don't like Stephen King), but the way it's treated. It's very masterfully shot and well executed. As the story progressed, I found myself captured by it, and that's what I want from a movie, really. The climax of the movie, while a bit disappointing considering all the build-up, was well made, with the chase in the hedge maze and Wendy seeing all those ghosts (including the guy in the costume with some fella who looked like George Bush). In particular, the moment when the blood pours out of the lifts was extremely well made, and the final result is very, very impressive - seeing that on wide screen, on the trailers, would have been utterly shocking. The performances, well, I can't praise them too much. I'm not sure whether I liked Jack Nicholson or not, but it certainly was a unique performance, and I don't doubt it inspired the hilariously awesome performance of Stefán Karl on the children's TV show LazyTown, even if only a little bit (I'm a Robbie Rotten fan). Shelley Duvall's constant whimpering and shrieking got on my nerves a bit, but it did look believable at times, and *thankfully* her character didn't fall on the famous stupid victim trap at any point. And Danny Lloyd was effective as young Danny (especially when you consider he DIDN'T KNOW he was making a horror movie, thanks to Kubrick's protectiveness). He didn't impress me - neither did Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, so maybe I'm not very interested in child actors, though I'm a stark raving fan of Jonah Bobo (Around The Bend, anyone?). So, who knows. I think this movie deserves to go down as a classic, since it's very unique, interesting and hard-hitting. It's BOUND to. And like every classic, it polarises opinions, and gets all sorts of passionate reactions. I won't add it to my list of favourite movies ever, but I wasn't disappointed by it, I don't regret watching it, and I'll definitely see it again if I can.

If I wanted to get scared, I'd go ride my bike on the wrong side of the busy freeway. I'm in for a good story, or whatever you can absorb from a movie. And that, the movie had a lot to offer. I can't tell whether it's because we're not in 1980 anymore, or if it's about Kubrick's style, but I didn't get scared at all. But let's see right from the beginning, you can tell what's going to happen. Every frame of the movie reveals there's evil stuff on the way. And when we reach the hotel, there's scary music being played *loudly* practically all the time. It's cool having dissonant classical movie being played on a horror movie, but it gets to the point of okay, I GOT it already eventually. And Jack Nicholson is freaky right from the beginning, anyway. There isn't exactly a crescendo of things going wrong; it's a crescendo of wrong things that have been wrong right from the start. And if I have to talk about a scary movie that isn't scary, I think I'd pick The Exorcist instead, and mention how that one *does* effectively create the growing sense of impending doom, that something that NEVER should happen will happen eventually.The Shining, on the other hand, is too obvious all the time. The camera following the characters around huge halls and long corridors, as if something was about to jump out at them, followed by the aforementioned loud dissonant music, gives the impression of evil that just isn't there. It ends up feeling like Kubrick is pulling our leg, *pretending* the movie is scary when it isn't. But then again, it's supposed to be atmosphere, and it works when things start getting tense. The story, in essence, is very simple, but there are those strange, complicated twists along the way. I'm not going to tell the whole plot, since you can find it in almost every review here. Jack Torrance, suddenly, is transported to a 1921 party (as we can see by all the dancers on an *empty* hotel), drinks bourbon without being charged, and talks to a waiter that once was the caretaker of the hotel and killed his family before committing suicide. He is, clearly, being possessed by some kind of evil force that we can never discern, while his psychic son calls for help from Mr. Hallorann, who also has that power. Eventually, Jack chases his family with an axe, providing some exquisitely over-the-top performances, and all those ghosts and dead people start appearing. And after his wife and son manage to escape and he freezes to death, we learn that he *was* there before, in 1921. I don't find all that particularly confusing, since it's rather open to interpretation (I don't know whether that was the intention, but then again, I never read the novel). If *you* don't see sense on the story, you can find explanations out there.To me, it isn't really about the story (I just don't like Stephen King), but the way it's treated. It's very masterfully shot and well executed. As the story progressed, I found myself captured by it, and that's what I want from a movie, really. The climax of the movie, while a bit disappointing considering all the build-up, was well made, with the chase in the hedge maze and Wendy seeing all those ghosts (including the guy in the costume with some fella who looked like George Bush). In particular, the moment when the blood pours out of the lifts was extremely well made, and the final result is very, very impressive - seeing that on wide screen, on the trailers, would have been utterly shocking. The performances, well, I can't praise them too much. I'm not sure whether I liked Jack Nicholson or not, but it certainly was a unique performance, and I don't doubt it inspired the hilariously awesome performance of Stefán Karl on the children's TV show LazyTown, even if only a little bit (I'm a Robbie Rotten fan). Shelley Duvall's constant whimpering and shrieking got on my nerves a bit, but it did look believable at times, and *thankfully* her character didn't fall on the famous stupid victim trap at any point. And Danny Lloyd was effective as young Danny (especially when you consider he DIDN'T KNOW he was making a horror movie, thanks to Kubrick's protectiveness). He didn't impress me - neither did Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense, so maybe I'm not very interested in child actors, though I'm a stark raving fan of Jonah Bobo (Around The Bend, anyone?). So, who knows. I think this movie deserves to go down as a classic, since it's very unique, interesting and hard-hitting. It's BOUND to. And like every classic, it polarises opinions, and gets all sorts of passionate reactions. I won't add it to my list of favourite movies ever, but I wasn't disappointed by it, I don't regret watching it, and I'll definitely see it again if I can.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"9 July 2006","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the moving tale of Scotland's legendary hero, Rob Roy, and his battles with the feudal landowners. Like Braveheart to which it is frequently compared, it is not very historical. Despite their primarily fictional nature, I rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two. The 13 Century William Wallace is, as others have noted, a larger than life national figure, while the early 18th Century Rob Roy comes across as an honourable but ordinary Scotsman.The story revolves around a clan chieftain, Robert Roy McGregor, who lives in a Scottish highland cottage with his wife Mary and their two young sons. As the movie begins, he and his fellow clansmen are hunting down some thieves who have stolen the local lord's cattle. Rob Roy then wishes to improve the living conditions of his people so arranges to borrow one thousand Scottish pounds from a local noble, the Marquis of Montrose, in order to buy cattle to herd to market. He temporarily entrusts this money to his friend, Alan McDonald. When both McDonald and the money turn up missing, Rob Roy finds himself in conflict with Montrose as well as his despicable protégé, Archibald Cunningham, and his sleazy factor, Killearn. Rob Roy's honour is also tested when Montrose seeks to involve him in false testimony against his rival, the Duke of Argyle, whom he wishes to accuse of being a Jacobite.The charismatic Liam Leeson is brilliant as the kilted highlander Rob Roy, an intelligent, virile, and noble hero and a man whose sense of honour is pivotal to this tale. Personally, I feel that this is Neeson's best performance, his brogue (albeit Irish) adding authenticity for the average viewer. Rob Roy is a stubborn, proud, courageous, and honest man whose word can be trusted. He is a loving husband & father, and also touchingly loyal to his friend, McDonald, who is accused of robbing him. Tim Roth masterfully portrays his major adversary and surely one of the most heinous and sadistic cinematic villains, Archibald Cunningham, an egotistical, ruthless strutting peacock. He is very effeminate for someone who makes it his major business to ravish the local women, whether willing or otherwise. The pathetic Cunningham himself constantly refers to the fact that he is a bastard unaware of his own father's identity, though this hardly justifies his horrendous misdeeds of murder, rape, and thievery. Also, he mercilessly casts aside the young servant girl, Betty, after she becomes pregnant with his child, resulting in her suicide. John Hurt plays the arrogant and foppish Montrose, who is eventually implied to be Cunningham's father.The movie is essentially the very believable love story between an ordinary man and his wife, beautifully depicting the passionate relationship between Rob Roy and Mary. Those who question the presence of passion within marriage should watch this husband and wife! I think the phrase used by this pair, 'How fine you are to me...' is surely one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. The most compelling performance is possibly by Jessica Lange as Rob's wife, Mary McGregor. Lacking make up, she has the pretty but natural look of a sturdy peasant wife and mother. The actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is brutally raped by the despicable Cunningham, while the disgusting Killearn looks on. Her dialogue is plain spoken but filled with pride and grace. I give Hollywood its due that for once they showed just enough in the rape scene to reveal its cruelty as well as Mary's pain and humiliation, but nothing intended to sensationalize. Their kinsman, Alastair McGregor, shows emotional anguish when he learns of Mary's rape, and further torment when she swears him to secrecy never to reveal to her husband her violation by Cunningham. Of course this film features the beautiful scenery of the Scottish highlands, also lavish period costumes and appropriate musical scoring. There are no grand battle scenes as in Braveheart, but continuous engaging action and a particularly gripping sword fight in the final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham. This is a captivating movie featuring both tense action and a beautiful love tale.

But I was a little concerned with Emilio as Billy the Kid, he just seems too nice to play him. But over all I'd say that he was convincing. So for those who enjoy westerns or just want a fun action flick, please pull up the popcorn and enjoy! 7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 July 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie has everything.

Many of the reviewers here have pointed out that the underlying theme of THE KARATE KID is that if you persevere, in the face of overwhelming odds, then you're sure to succeed. I heard this philosophy again when I saw Mary J Blige perform in London in June 2006. Mary enjoyed pointing out to the audience between songs that they mustn't listen to people who tell them they can't achieve whatever they want through believing in themselves.I believe this is an ill-considered and inappropriate assertion to make and quite probably the cause of so much of the anger and frustration we see today, especially in urban youths.Look, I can't carry a tune in a bucket. So no amount of perseverance and tenacity will ever turn me into a world-class opera singer. It's fine for Mary to say, in her experience, believing in herself helped make her a big star - but Mary, love, your fabulous soul voice played a small part in that.Equally with Daniel LaRusso - yes, his stick-to-it character was able to improve his karate to the point where he was able to defeat the bad guys, but that was Daniel's path. Another character may not have benefited so much from the teachings of Mr Miyagi.So the message should be, we can achieve highly if we have the strength of character to carry on when it seems all is against us, PROVIDED we have some degree of talent in our chosen field.To tell youngsters otherwise is foolish and harmful and I wish to blazes our role models would think it through before they offer us life advice ...

Nor do I have a problem with the acting, special effects, or anything like that. It's a good movie on purely technical terms, but what I hate about this movie is how it completely ignores the meaning of the first movie.The first movie just had such a mind blowing effect. Sure there were some corny ape costumes and funny dialog, but when you saw the end and realized that the planet of the apes WAS EARTH, everything came into perspective. It meant something, and you were changed after you saw it. It made you think.In the remake though, there is no indication that the planet of the apes is Earth. And whats more, more humans can talk. At the end there is no surprising twist. Its all quite predictable. Listen, I know it would have been hard for the makers of this movie to use the same ending. It loses all of it's surprise now that everyone knows how the movie ends. But for god sakes, if you cant make an awe inspiring twist, then just don't do the movie.So if you like battle scenes and pretty colors, go watch this movie. If you want to have your mind blown away, watch the old one. It's more artistic, and its better.
