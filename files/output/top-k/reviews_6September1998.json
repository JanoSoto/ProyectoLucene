It wasnt gross even, it was boring. The action scenes were pretty exciting  (especially the first one at rave) but they were all very similar and the stupid vampires disintegrated into ash avoiding any kind of body piling.

The whole involved and interesting business about disguising its components, has been reduced to showing us (repeatedly, like this is a difficult point to follow?) that the joystick for his absurdly high-tech remote-control system has been in his pocket as a pen.  Item the conspirators and motive.Without resorting to dry lecture, the original still manages to give us a good understanding of the historical situation of the pieds-noirs  blackfeet, the French-Algerian irredentists who could not accept that the century was moving away from colonialism, and formed the view that De Gaulle had betrayed them.  This gives the whole plot some historical weight. The remake seems to leave it as a gangland-shootout revenge story, minimally spicing it up by making them Russian gangsters.  Note please that I'm not opposed to updating they could have done this intelligently and come up with something more current but non-trivial.

Drew Barrymore is surprisingly sweet in her role as the love interest, Julia. 'The Wedding Singer' is a soundtrack maker's dream come true, as many songs are played or referenced to in its course. The film is also delightful in its references to 80's culture, which make it a very enjoyable movie for everyone, whether they can remember the era or not.
