I should also mention that the film is also forever associated with the Duelling Banjos scene with just about every generation.

It's not their territory, but their leader Lewis Medlock (Burt Reynolds, looking like Steven Seagal's long-lost twin brother) arrogantly assumes that he can deal with any challenge that comes his way. His friends Ed, Bobby and Drew (Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox) reluctantly follow him, despite having their own doubts.The first day of the trip goes fine, but on the second morning Ed and Bobby stop to rest by a small stream.

Well acted, and despite what people have said, well directed. It's quite refreshing to see a detective in a film actually do any detecting, as opposed to the standard Hollywood convention of having our hero get a lead through a snitch or a coincidence. You genuinely feel in this film that the detcetive has earned his trade, and deservedly works his way up through a chain of people until he meets the person responsible for the snuff film. The film is dark, and our imagination is left to run riot, and this can be disturbing.

It's no trick to figure out that the leads will wind up together at the end. The fun is in the journey.  And this one is about as surprising as making planned stops at McDonalds on a drive down the interstate.  The girl's family are a cast of caricatures that only Anthony Quinn seems able to rise above.  I had a hard time believing they even cared about their daughter.  Reeve's casting as the male lead, Paul, isn't good, and he is betrayed by sophomoric dialogue which he attacks with such earnestness you almost want to cringe.  You can't hate him, he's a nice guy, but as a character I was more interested in seeing him try to sell chocolates (his character is a travelling chocolate salesman) than win the girl, since at least I couldn't be sure of his success selling the chocolates and there might have been some suspense.  There was absolutely no suspense in terms of winning the girl.   Western Union delivered that message in an envelope during the first ten minutes of the movie.The plot is pretty mundane.  Reeves meets the girl (Sanchez-Gijon) on a train and she vomits on him (morning sickness we discover later).  They wind up on a leafy road walking to her parent's estate after he gets thrown off a bus for defending her from some unwanted attention.  She blurts out her whole story (seduced, impregnated and dumped by her professor) and how her proud father will kill her for disgracing the family.  Reeves agrees to play her husband for one night at the house, then dump her and look like a heel. She can claim a broken heart, the child won't be a bastard, family honor salvaged.  Yeah, this would work well in real life. Like what if the vengeful father sent some strongmen out to break your legs, Keanu?  At this point the average joe would say, honeylamb, get a frickin' abortion, never tell your father, and don't drag me into this.  But any half-intelligent viewer of the film will already know by then that Keanu can't say these things because a) he's already in love with her and she with him, although all she has done is vomit on him, and b)the plot requires that he do this.Of course once there Reeves doesn't have the courage to be a heel and keeps getting sucked back into the family, even though everyone seems to know he's supposed to leave.  In the meantime, Reeves and Sanchez-Gijon fall in love. Actually, they played the falling in love scene when she vomited on him, then get to play it again for the next two hours, repeatedly.  But in terms of actual written dialogue they fall in love later.The family, incidentally, lives on the most gorgeous stretch of real estate - the hills are literally bedecked, and I use the word 'bedecked' with all sincerity, with grape vines (the family runs a vineyard).  All the roads wind through forests, and the family home is replete with courtyards, fountains, winding staircases, just like real Mexican-American families lived in in 1945.  Oh alright, so they're well off.Some of the scenes are absolutely ludicrous, especially the one where the frost almost damages the grapes and the family is forced to light burners in the vineyard to warm the grapes enough to protect them from frost.  Now, this is true - farmers of citrus crops like oranges and I suppose vineyards do use smudge pots to warm the air if there is a chance their crop will freeze, but I have never seen said farmers don ridiculous diaphanous butterfly wings and run through their fields beating their arms to make certain the heat circulates.The cinematogrophy is nice, but after two hours I wanted Reeves to give up on this family and this girl and go back to selling chocolates and his sexy, dim wife played by Betty Sutton.  At least that would have been a surprise. A dire, paint-by-the-numbers romance.  Oh, incidentally, the name of the family's farm is 'The Clouds', so don't expect anything even remotely spiritual as promised by the film's title.
