It's a movie of a genre which doesn't ask much from the actors. It has more of a technical inclination. Keanu Reeves was perfect as the soft-spoken messiah. Carrie-Anne Moss was mesmerizing as the beautiful love-interest of Neo. Laurence Fishburne demanded respect as the inspiring leader. Hugo Weaving was brilliant as the elegant Agent Smith.

Yuen Wo Ping is the undisputed champion of action choreography and he proves it once again with his work in 'The Matrix'. Bill Pope's perfect cinematography is a good lesson for any upcoming cinematographer. The SFX team of the movie is one to look up to considering their usage of bullet-time technology. The editing, music and set design are highly praiseworthy.To end it, I'd say that if there is one movie in your life which you would not want to miss, it is 'The Matrix'.

However after watching this version I can say that it stands out on its own as a movie although did they have to call it the same name. This time it is Hollywood hard man Sly Stallone filling the boots of Micheal Caine and in a few ways he does succeed but ultimately he just seems more accustomed to playing stereotypical Hollywood hard men rather than a tough, brooding gangster. The film wastes no time getting into the action straight away and does not really waste time going into character development as we introduced to who need to know along the way as it is a typical black ans white , good vs bad story. The music is also funky and the action is great and Sly Stallone does seem to wear a suit very well. On the other hand Get Carter fails because it is an American Hollywood spin on British classic which will not go down well with the fans, also the story is based on one of redemption and the cheesy clichéd dialogue and awkward 'bonding' moments just don't work over on this one as the characters just seem rather flat. To conclude this version of Get Carter is not a complete waste of time, just take it for what it is and don't compare to the original.

It's more the second-long ha! kind of comedy.That simply means Kevin Smith's writing is clever enough to the point where you will be pleasantly shocked by some of the conversations and events of the film and think it all rather amusing and humorous. It's not hilarious, it's just clever and a bit funny.The premise is rather interesting and surprisingly from a more fantasy-esquire genre than Smith traditionally dabbles with. Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) are more or less fallen angels that have found a way back into heaven. They must be stopped or the world will come to a screeching halt, so a seemingly random protagonist named Bethany gets charged by God to stop them. Simple, but the slick, nonchalant approach to religion keeps the satire rampant.The film does spend a lot of its time explaining itself, which isn't too bad considering Smith keeps the explanations to-the-point and allows the characters to stay interesting in the process. Chris Rock, who plays an apostle, and Alan Rickman, who plays God's messenger\/ voice are two of these characters that are both good in the film and Smith has allowed to maintain their character's edge despite lines upon lines of explanation.Getting from point A to point B and so on is not the film's strength. The physical events that take place are ultimately boring and unexciting. It's the moments along the way, the conversations and the philosophy that come about, that make it successful. Affleck's character raises a lot of interesting religious questions about humanity and his conversation with the protagonist on the train is rather insightful. In general, Smith has used Bethany as a way to keep the viewers skepticism of the plot active in the film. She keeps it from getting preposterous. In general, the whole cast is very talented and their characters well written, which keeps the film interesting.It's not the funniest or most interesting comedy in terms of plot and the sequence of events, but Dogma is a smart concept that ultimately results in a sharp satire and some great thoughts that scrutinize religion in a way that never seems too out of line.

It wound up being a slow piece about unappealing people. Can you say disjointed? Is it any wonder this film was another dud at the box office, despite the cast?SOME GOOD POINTS - It was refreshing to see Jack Nicholson playing against-type with the role of a introverted radio monologist. He didn't play too many introverts for a long time! Bruce Dern is interesting as always and if you want to see a new face, check out actress Julie Ann Robinson as Jessica. This was her only role.

It's a totally other movie than most contemporary horror films, but I have heard that the same director (Argento) has many other similar movies.What I didn't like was the dubbing. Argento let's every cast member speak their native tongue and they dubbed it over in English later. This makes for some comical situations in intense moments. The main cast members (protagonists and antagonists) did all speak English as native language, but for some reason they had to dub their own dialogue later anyway. The lip sync on the main character is quite okay, the rest is not.Now about the movie itself. The story is quite stupid (though optimists may label it 'minimalistic' p) and the end is horrible. Horrormovies shouldn't have anticlimaxes, the tension build up was good but then it just disappoints.Suspiria relies on tension and mood for 99% of it's entertainment worth. The plot is pretty irrelevant. And the acting was luckily not important since it wasn't very good at all.Argento really uses VERY theatrical music (which I didn't like but it does create a certain appropriate effect) and he drenches the screen in vibrant primary colors, with scenes dominated by great pools of reds, blues, yellows and greens. This provides for a very special effect and I really dug it. It's an inspired fever dream of a horror movie,surreal and very stylish.I'll end with the best Suspiria has the best opening scenes of any horror film I've ever seen. It's beautiful, thrilling, haunting, intense, disgusting...all in a couple of minutes scenes. Of course I'm not talking about the first scene, but the scenes when the main character arrives at the academy.Furthermore, there are three additional scenes that are simply superb the scene with the blind man on the empty square (BRILLIANT!), the scene with the roommate (where the lights go out -)) and the scene with the red lights in the sleeping quarters.In conclusion I have a love-hate relationship with horror films and I do too with this film. I love the intensity and the cinematography, but hate the theatricality, bad acting and the overdose of gore (the bloody heart makes me cringe).9\/10 for half the movie (the night scenes LOL) , 4\/10 for the other half (the day scenes dancing lessons and witchcraft plot *yuck*).

Yet, as a moron he would not be able to fight Williams and his Paradise with such inventiveness and skill. We also never find out why it takes Finley the whole movie to finally hurt someone who ruined his life, as opposed to killing off various people in the theater who had nothing to do with the whole affair. That, of course, is another proof that Finley's character is a cretin.Some people might say that I am nit-picking, but even fantasies, comedies and horror films have to be based on some logic; otherwise the story makes no sense hence cannot be interesting or involving. Still, what was to be expected from someone like De Palma? His thrillers are the dumbest in the history of cinema, every single one of them being utterly illogical, far-fetched and just plain stupid.I also fail to understand why De Palma liked Finley that much; he cast him not only here but in his idiotic thriller, Sisters, made around that time. Finley is an uncharismatic, uninteresting actor, who looks more like an overgrown young accountant than a leading man - even for a wacky film like this.Oh, yeah and the film is totally unfunny. The music is alternately mediocre and awful. Paul Williams was not only allowed to spoil the movie with his garbage songs, but was even allowed to play a main role, and very unconvincingly at that. That's what is known as stretching one's talents a bit thin.Nevertheless, I can see the positive at least de Palma didn't make any other musicals after this. If only he had not made any thrillers after his first attempts...

I sometimes consider hailing him as the greatest performer of this generation, particularly whenever I re-watch his leap-to-fame performance in American Psycho. On its release it erroneously received mixed acclaim; nevertheless, Bale was nearly always commended for performing in the remarkably charismatic role of Patrick Bateman. The character ranks among contemporary literature's greatest creations, and back in 2000 a young Bale somehow managed to embody the yuppie maniac. The character's slickly menacing demeanour, attentive idiosyncrasies, and always brewing revulsion is intuitively mastered in this offbeat satire. Patrick Bateman is both the definitive New York yuppie and the ultimate sociopath. He is masked by the Wall Street businessman persona, and his pastime activities are unnoticed by his self-obsessed associates- like himself. He thrives off a colossal maze of jealously, established on distaste for any minor, physical and social hiccup. Little do such men know that they are dehumanising any merit they once had.Bret Easton Ellis' original novel contains possibly the most graphic depictions of sex and violence in any novel I have ever read. Appropriately, director Mary Harron places much of the novel's explicit content off-screen, similar to how the book simply lets the reader imagine the vivid nature of the content. For this reason, American Psycho is faithful to its source, and for a novel which includes such terminal violence there is still a huge amount of wit and charm. This owes to the book's satirical disposition, with its brazen accuracy and jagged humour. It is in many respects an absurdist's take on an already surreal culture; this lends the questionable theme of subjective reality to the protagonist's actions and experiences. Mary Harron utilises the satirical facets of the novel, and essentially uses satire as a device of ridiculing yuppie culture. Nevertheless, the component which is best suited is that this image of an alpha-male dominated society, which is directed from a female standpoint, but not an overtly feminist one. More than anything, American Psycho is a critique of ignorance, materialism and self-infatuation.The cast play it cool throughout the feature, concurrently sinking their teeth into the bitter irony of cultural stereotypes. For those of you who might be put off by the sardonic title; don't be. This is a twisted and intelligent take on cultural archetypes, with much prominence being placed on whether the viewer deems Patrick Bateman's sociopath alter-ego a manifestation of sub-conscious monotony or that he is genuinely committing the murderous, masochistic acts shown on screen. Whichever way you look at it, there is no definitive answer, but one thing is for sure, that this cinematic assertion is a strong sentiment of yuppie narcissism. As dark as it may seem, there is no denying the indisputable entertainment quality of a film crammed with meaningful malevolence. This is a film which unsympathetically attacks the business world, implying that dumb people from wealthy backgrounds are groomed for slacker success. These white collar machines are not savvy, nor do they even so much as turn a blind-eye to anyone other than their materialistic statements of self-worth. In a way, this is their only means of clinging onto reality, for they hide behind their denial, with a reputable image of self-worth.
