However, this film leaves you with a feeling inside, it actually makes you imagine what it must have been like during the era it portrayed. You feel as though you know the main characters, and in addition to knowing them, you kind of fall in love with them in a sense and wish you knew them.Throughout the years, Frank Sinatra has been under rated as an actor. However as in Manchurian Candidate, Sinatra shines when given the chance to play a dramatic role. His portrayal of Maggio was both heart felt, yet clever and witty when the time was right. The role of Maggio was made for him, he was born to play it.Additionally, I loved Burt Lancaster in the role of 1st Sergeant Milton Warden. Perhaps the best part about the character Sergeant Warden is that while is has a rather rough exterior, he also had empathy for people without being the slightest bit pathetic.Donna Reed's performance as the beautiful Lorene just gets better and better throughout the film.When reviewing movie classics, a large part of whether or not I enjoyed the film has to do with whether or not the picture has aged well throughout the years. I am 29 years old and a classic movie buff. My husband is the same age as me and watched From Here to Eternity with me for the first time last night. He was not looking forward to it, but a half hour into the movie he was hooked, and he actually enjoyed it. This movie has definitely aged well, and it's an absolute must see for anyone who enjoys a true classic.

The Majestic tried too hard to keep the audience's attention. The Majestic tried to hard to give us a fictional town where realism was taken from the same page as Pleasantville. The Majestic attempted to give Jim Carrey the opportunity to win an Oscar, but as we learn from Jack Nicholson, one sometimes cannot just calm the face to fully embrace a dramatic role. My point is that The Majestic tried too hard, thus forcing the film to transform from a sentimental piece of nostalgia, to just sheer rubbish. While Darabont tried to capture the spirit of 1950s Hollywood in this film, what in fact occurred was simple one dimensional characters that we cared nothing for, events that took place that seemed misplaced from reality, and emotions that escaped honesty forcing us to sit through two plus hours of pure, 100% uncut, Darabont drivel.As I write this review, I find myself looking at what I thought this film was going to center around to suddenly realizing what Darabont actually gave me. To be utterly frank, this is not a film about a theater. Sure, one would assume from both the poster as well as the trailer that it may be about a man suffering from amnesia goes to a small town to rejuvenate an independent theater. As a man who dreams of similar ideas (sans the amnesia), I was ready to enjoy this feature. I was even willing to give Carrey a chance because he had proved to me over time that he could handle a meatier roll. Alas, when the final credits finally did run for this film, I did not see The Majestic as the film that was promised to me. I was expecting an American version of Cinema Paradiso, but instead found myself with more recycled Hollywood mumbo-jumbo that I could wave a stick at. The story was profoundly old, with Carrey doing nothing to re-establish his character. As I look back at his performance, he didn't grab anything by the horns, he didn't push his character to the limit, what he attempted to do was gain audience support by being less comic\/zany and more human, but for me you could see right though his performance. In a year worth of decent performers making their mark in Hollywood, Carrey's performance of Peter Appleton was about as transparent as a ghost and will not remain relevant through the test of time.As I sit here and nitpick this film, I realize that The Majestic was not the best that Darabont has to offer. I would argue that The Shawshank Redemption was a pure moment of cinematic intelligence, and that perhaps when Darabont joins forces with Stephen King, the work is pure film magic, but when it comes to creating other work, it just seems to fall into the pan of lest resistance. My major issue with this film was the surfacing of smaller issues like Carrey's nonchalant performance, the ridiculous nature of the town of Lawson (and the clich√© characters that seemed to inhabit the streets), and the over-played ending speech which seemed like a cut-and-paste of nearly ever other courtroom drama ever produced. It just felt uncreative from beginning to end. There were hardly any surprises or moments that had you gripping your seat with anticipation. Darabont played it safe, but the final result ended up being a jumbled mess of already used clich√©s. I wish I could list them all for you, but as a man who has seen his fair share of movies, I could count the beats with my eyes closed in this film. I knew when he was going to crash, I knew there was going to be a love interest, I knew Carrey would be faced with emotion, and I knew that eventually he would have to defend himself to everyone that we found our eyes surrounding. I knew these events were going to happen, and I am sure that anyone that has seen more than two films in their lifetime would see the same. Creativity, imagination, and energy are three core elements needed to make a film go from average to cult-remembering &#133; but The Majestic had none of these traits, so it falls into the wayside of being found in a dollar bin within the year.As I read my lines for this review, a name seems to resonate deeply within these words that utterly describe why this feature failed. The acting was laughable and the story was as generic as Grade-A cheese, and while others may blame Carrey or the writer for such errors, this critic blames Frank Darabont. I see that he was trying to redefine an era of cinema, but why, as a man who loves movies from the 1940s, is this film so terrible to view? I do not believe that Darabont was able to capture the raw nature of the period. I don't believe that Mayberry is on every corner and that every film made in the 50s represented this fake life. He over dramatized the smaller events while completely missing his mark on the bigger moments. This film could have benefited from a small war scene, or possibly from a visitation from Luke himself near the end. I just needed something to spark my interest more than what was presented here. I felt cheated from this film because it gave up midway through and did not push the limits of film-making. Mediocrity is what paid the Darabont bill in this feature.Overall, I wasn't impressed with this film in any way.Grade ** out of ***** ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"18 October 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" While most will argue that The Majestic was an opportunity for famed director Frank Darabont to pay homage to the infamous films of Frank Capra, this critic felt it was more an opportunity for Darabont to successfully clich√© every recycled element in Hollywood cinema with the sole purpose of making us feel sympathetic to an unimaginative character.

Anyway, the script by Brent V. Friedman & Bryce Zabel takes just about all the character's up-to Mortal Kombat III which what the video game series was at when this came out & sticks them in one long fight sequence, to be perfectly honest there isn't a story really & any semblance of plot that is buried in here merely sets up the next fight or is there to introduce another character from the game. Sometimes you can just sit back & enjoy a film for what it is & that's what I did with Mortal Kombat Annihilation, for me it brought back good memories of years gone by, it moves like an absolute rocket & you never have time to catch a breath before the next fight\/monster\/explosion\/favourite character or just some good looking lady in a tight fitting costume kicking ass, what more do you want? On the negative side the Mortal Kombat games caused controversy because of the on screen violence & bloodshed like Sub-Zero's fatality where he would rip his opponents head off & the spine would still be attached, unfortunately the filmmakers obviously had a teenage audience in mind & I just thought it was far too tame & the fights had no satisfying pay-offs, also Mortal Kombat Annihilation is probably the most far removed from reality film I've ever seen & it's just incredibly silly so anyone looking for something meaningful would probably be wise to skip this.Director Leonetti does a good job, the sets are cool with some nice colour schemes, the action is shot nicely by which I mean the camera doesn't jump cut every millisecond like a lot of films these days, this has the added bonus of us, the viewer that is, actually being able to see whats going on & keeping track of where everyone is & what their doing. The fights are very well choreographed & a lot of special moves from the games are here although I must again bring to your attention the general lack of ferocity & violence, it's just so tame & I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood during the entire film. Some of the CGI is absolutely terrible, some of the monsters are embarrassing to look at. The costumes are neat although I think the women could have worn a bit more leather if you know what I mean.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 it's well made, bad CGI apart, & you get plenty of fights & action for your money. Surprised to learn a fair amount of it was shot in England as well as Wales, Jordan & Thailand. The less said about the acting the better.

Leonetti Mortal Kombat Annihilation is the sequel to the decent Mortal Kombat (1995) & both were based on the popular video game series of the same name which I can vividly remember playing with my mate on my Super Nintendo during the mid 90's, it was one of those games that you could have great fun with & one which we always went back to. Anyway, the script by Brent V. Friedman & Bryce Zabel takes just about all the character's up-to Mortal Kombat III which what the video game series was at when this came out & sticks them in one long fight sequence, to be perfectly honest there isn't a story really & any semblance of plot that is buried in here merely sets up the next fight or is there to introduce another character from the game. Sometimes you can just sit back & enjoy a film for what it is & that's what I did with Mortal Kombat Annihilation, for me it brought back good memories of years gone by, it moves like an absolute rocket & you never have time to catch a breath before the next fight\/monster\/explosion\/favourite character or just some good looking lady in a tight fitting costume kicking ass, what more do you want? On the negative side the Mortal Kombat games caused controversy because of the on screen violence & bloodshed like Sub-Zero's fatality where he would rip his opponents head off & the spine would still be attached, unfortunately the filmmakers obviously had a teenage audience in mind & I just thought it was far too tame & the fights had no satisfying pay-offs, also Mortal Kombat Annihilation is probably the most far removed from reality film I've ever seen & it's just incredibly silly so anyone looking for something meaningful would probably be wise to skip this.Director Leonetti does a good job, the sets are cool with some nice colour schemes, the action is shot nicely by which I mean the camera doesn't jump cut every millisecond like a lot of films these days, this has the added bonus of us, the viewer that is, actually being able to see whats going on & keeping track of where everyone is & what their doing. The fights are very well choreographed & a lot of special moves from the games are here although I must again bring to your attention the general lack of ferocity & violence, it's just so tame & I don't remember seeing a single drop of blood during the entire film. Some of the CGI is absolutely terrible, some of the monsters are embarrassing to look at. The costumes are neat although I think the women could have worn a bit more leather if you know what I mean.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 it's well made, bad CGI apart, & you get plenty of fights & action for your money. Surprised to learn a fair amount of it was shot in England as well as Wales, Jordan & Thailand. The less said about the acting the better. There are some nice looking ladies here & a special mention goes to Talisa Soto whom is very easy on the eyes.Mortal Kombat Annihilation is one of those films that I liked a lot but I'm positive that many will hate, I don't really care though as films are all about personal opinion & I liked Mortal Kombat Annihilation, it ain't going to win any awards but for non-stop action, fights & mindless fun I doubt there's much better out there. I just wish the filmmakers had some balls & made it more violent & stick some gory fatalities in there. Oh well, nothings perfect I suppose... I liked it but I'm sure many won't, the choice is yours. Followed by the TV series Mortal Kombat Conquest (1998 - 1999) & a third film titled Mortal Kombat Devastation (2007) is listed on the IMDb as being 'Announced'.

One baseless criticism which pops up again and again dwells on..... Julie Christie's sixties bangs!! To me they were cinematic shorthand for schoolgirl, which her character was at the outset of the plot. For those hung up on hair, the really noticeable sixties styles in this film can be seen elsewhere Early in the film, as Zhivago is conferring with his professor at medical school, we see a group of female medical students in the background with teased bouffants. Later, at a Christmas party many of the female extras are adorned with the same anachronistic coiffure (this is supposed to be 1912 Moscow!). As to bangs, one can find, for instance, photos of the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova from around the same period with very obvious sixties bangs. Bangs have been around to one degree or another, whether in vogue or not, since there has been hair. Case closed.Another worthless criticism It's too slow, too long. Phooey. Some movies have to be slow and long to tell a big, detailed story.If one is going to criticize this film, I suggest the following 1. Screenwriter Robert Bolt's kneading of the characters' lives into the progression of the Russian revolution is sometimes at odds with actual chronology, so that anyone familiar with this period cringes from time to time. In one scene, in order to identify for the viewer the historical point that has been reached, a character blurts out (I paraphrase, but only very slightly) Lenin is in Moscow! Civil war has started! Neither could have been true at that moment in the narrative. Bolt could have polished his distillation of the novel, but who, apart from direct participants, can ever know why such gaffes occur in high-pressure multi-million-dollar productions? 2. This is yet another movie about a writer, in this case a beloved but politically controversial poet, not a word of whose poetry is revealed to the audience (except for the title of one poem, Lara, after the woman he loves). Other major movies, including Julia (1977) and Wonder Boys (2000) also commit this offense. Ironically, one exception is the campy and rather dreary Isn't She Great (2000), about trash novelist Jacqueline Susann, which actually explores the act of writing! 3. The physical reproduction of the era is uneven. Some moments are too clean. One example When Zhivago slides open the door of the ostensibly foul-smelling box car in which he and his family have been traveling for weeks packed alongside filthy, probably lice-ridden passengers, he looks too healthy, scrubbed and well rested. This and other moments stand out because they occur in the context of innumerable convincing depictions such as mud-filled wartime trenches, a looted and vandalized city mansion, or a half-frozen refugee tramping stiffly over the ice of a frozen lake. 4. It is said that Russian viewers laugh at the onion-domed house where the lovers hide from the Bolsheviks. Russian churches have onion domes, they say, but not houses. Granted. But I'd like to think that the person who built this particular house was an eccentric and got away with the concept because the house was in an isolated rural area away from the prying eyes of the architecture police. In any case, the emotional truths underlying the occasional inadequate or wrongheaded representations register powerfully. The grand-scale perspective gives a sense of the tumult of the times; vivid and memorable casting choices keep us fascinated with the characters and concentrated upon them; you feel the terrible losses people suffered when history so rudely pulled the rug out from under them; you are reminded of the pitiless cruelty of war and the depths to which people in its grip can descend; and how despite the tragedies of our history, we go on no matter what. David Lean had a great gift for injecting bold images at just the right moment. And he had the same gift for the perfectly timed sound effect, often occurring at an edit point. At Zhivago's end one feels a tremendous sense of sadness and loss but hope for the future. Considering the international political climate of the time of its release, it treats the Russian Revolution with enough detachment to illuminate both sides of the political divide. In other words, it doesn't propagandize for either side.This was the first major Hollywood treatment of the Russian Revolution, was still running in theatres around the world two and three years after its initial release, despite dismissals from most of the major film critics of the time. Its popularity came from word of mouth, i.e., from the public's genuine love of the story and its striking, technically expert presentation. Interestingly, Zhivago as a box office blockbuster was second only to The Sound of Music, released the same year. Both films told the story of individuals faced with historically recent Old World political upheavals (communism\/fascism). Furthermore, the soundtrack album of each film took on a life of its own, selling millions of copies. And why not also add that central to the success of each film was an English actress named Julie (Christie as Lara\/Andrews as Maria). How many times have you heard of or personally known a woman under 40 with the previously uncommon name of Lara? Guess why that name became popular in the 60's and afterward?

But then the film insists repeatedly that there is a logic to it, dream logic. This, however, could even be circumspect. It's really a unique blend of philosophical monologue &\/or soliloquy &\/or dialogs, a mix of 'isms' (asburdism, surrealism chiefly, even magical realism in tiny spots), and if there were any film of the past ten years that I might offer up as a recommendation to Godard, it might be this. Richard Linklater also serves up his kind of sequel to his first film, Slacker, which was about as free-form and experimental and questioning and thinking about the ways of life as any given group of college kids (the bright ones I mean) might have on a bright day. It's ironic though after seeing the film to think that this is even considered a 'stoner movie'. The color scheme, developed by Bob Sabiston (who would also head A Scanner Darkly, another Linklater film), is about as wild and perfunctory for the kind of mood that Linklater could get. Wily Wiggins, after getting hit by a car, drifts in and out of dreams- constantly dreaming one could only possibly think to guess- as people come forward in Austin Texas to put forward views on life. But will this state of constant dreaming (sometimes 'lucid' sometimes not) continue? This is the thread that hangs all of the film together like a true-blue stream-of-consciousness clothesline that would appeal to stoners, I think, and at one point I did even consider being high for the duration of the picture. I was more glad to be sober for it all though, because as I write this I wonder if I could even grasp everything- or maybe need to again- on a 2nd full viewing. So much still sparks off in my head of things I connected with by what the characters talked about to Wiley (chiefly things regarding existentialism and Sartre, free-will, how dreams can affect how we perceive things in the 'real' life, and the ideas concerning cinema itself and Bazin). While once or twice it came close to becoming almost TOO much of a eye-grabbing and mind-churning thing that once or twice it's more of a random 'essay' than really a good scene. But like with Slacker, there's also the occasional jab of fine humor from Linklater, like the ape working the projector reading off paper, or the guy who reappears as a convenience store clerk. Towards the end, as Linklater himself appears on camera and has maybe the longest talk of all, Waking Life becomes all the more clear and revelatory.This is really, when it comes down to it, an independent production with a real independent thought process to it. Linklater, with Sabiston as something like his best kind of collaborator, guides us through all of this to see what's so wonderful, strange, horrifying, incendiary, crude, and worthwhile about what it is to try and live one's life, but also in seeing it through the perspective of the un-reality of a reality of some kind of other dream state. Or something of that nature. At any rate, it wont be everyone's cup of tea, and if you do decide to make it as such a stoner movie be ready to take in everything that's being said along with the crazy animation. While I might take Linklater's Scanner Darkly just slightly over this one (due to the animation for that being better in its control and working much better with a much more sustained subject matter), Waking Life still holds its own as one of his most ambitious projects that ends up going one step further than Slacker. He's working at full-speed with the faculties of experience, intelligence, questioning (and maybe not always, appropriately, with answers), and ultimately creativity. And that musical accompaniment is one of the finest in years.

It's ironic though after seeing the film to think that this is even considered a 'stoner movie'. The color scheme, developed by Bob Sabiston (who would also head A Scanner Darkly, another Linklater film), is about as wild and perfunctory for the kind of mood that Linklater could get. Wily Wiggins, after getting hit by a car, drifts in and out of dreams- constantly dreaming one could only possibly think to guess- as people come forward in Austin Texas to put forward views on life. But will this state of constant dreaming (sometimes 'lucid' sometimes not) continue? This is the thread that hangs all of the film together like a true-blue stream-of-consciousness clothesline that would appeal to stoners, I think, and at one point I did even consider being high for the duration of the picture. I was more glad to be sober for it all though, because as I write this I wonder if I could even grasp everything- or maybe need to again- on a 2nd full viewing. So much still sparks off in my head of things I connected with by what the characters talked about to Wiley (chiefly things regarding existentialism and Sartre, free-will, how dreams can affect how we perceive things in the 'real' life, and the ideas concerning cinema itself and Bazin). While once or twice it came close to becoming almost TOO much of a eye-grabbing and mind-churning thing that once or twice it's more of a random 'essay' than really a good scene. But like with Slacker, there's also the occasional jab of fine humor from Linklater, like the ape working the projector reading off paper, or the guy who reappears as a convenience store clerk. Towards the end, as Linklater himself appears on camera and has maybe the longest talk of all, Waking Life becomes all the more clear and revelatory.This is really, when it comes down to it, an independent production with a real independent thought process to it. Linklater, with Sabiston as something like his best kind of collaborator, guides us through all of this to see what's so wonderful, strange, horrifying, incendiary, crude, and worthwhile about what it is to try and live one's life, but also in seeing it through the perspective of the un-reality of a reality of some kind of other dream state. Or something of that nature. At any rate, it wont be everyone's cup of tea, and if you do decide to make it as such a stoner movie be ready to take in everything that's being said along with the crazy animation. While I might take Linklater's Scanner Darkly just slightly over this one (due to the animation for that being better in its control and working much better with a much more sustained subject matter), Waking Life still holds its own as one of his most ambitious projects that ends up going one step further than Slacker.

There are some jewels here but far too much coal. Ultimately, the film never flows or hooks you into its narrative. While Jack Clayton is a fine director he was truly the wrong person for this film. His anti-literal horror sensibility does not mesh with a period piece of Halloween Americana that begs for visceral scares, just like in the novel.However, Clayton excels in a few quiet scenes such as the sad distant attempt by Jason Robards to connect with his son on the steps. Filmed in a long master take, it's an almost Antonioni moment of filial separation. Shawn Carson is quite good here too, his cherubic face perfectly expressing his disinterest in his father's attempt at communication. Altho some here say Robards is only adequate, he's much more, filling his character with the longing of youth and regret.Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark is the film's highlight, altho he should have been even more malevolent. Him and Robards both shine together in their only two scenes and when Robards stands up to Dark while his son hides beneath the sewer below, Clayton's direction is truly fine and harrowing.As others have noted, the library confrontation is the film's dramatic high point as Dark tears away the pages of time, mocking Robards with angry flare.

","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"18 October 2006","score":"","review":" One of my favorite episodes of the Twilight Zone focuses on a gangster who has just died and been greeted by an angel. The angel guides the man into an eden paradise of booze, women, and constant winnings at a casino. After some time, he becomes bored of winning all the time. The women are too easy to get and the thrill of gambling is gone. It's no fun when he can't lose. When he tells the angel he can't take it anymore and he is ready for the other place, the angel replies, What do you mean? This is the other place!Apart from Downey's stellar performance, a reason Less Than Zero is good is because it is based on wonderful material. It is all about Bret Easton Ellis' portrayal of the suburban hell. Too many kids who are too rich and spend too much time and money on booze, parties, and cocaine. With all their good fortune of being brought up in a society where they can choose to do anything, they do nothing.Where setting has both faithfully and successfully been adapted from Ellis' original material, two key elements have been changed which hold the movie back. Though McCarthy plays his role very well, the trouble is in the writing. Clay's subdued yet conscious driven character is written for the screen as a vehicle to guide us through this weird world of endless excess. He is there so we can have someone to sympathize with while we try to absorb everything around us.This is a grave miscalculation.Rarely do I critique movies on how they were changed from their original work, but the screenwriters have done the novel an injustice. Clay, as he was written in the novel, should be just as disaffected as his friends. He is no better or worse, he is just alive enough to notice what is going on around him after coming home from three months abroad. He also has a terrible cocaine problem of his own. The brilliance in the novel is, just like Nick in the Great Gatsby, Clay is an unreliable narrator. He is able to live as a real character, have good and bad things happen to him, and still have no control of the outcome in the story. He is powerless because he is completely indifferent. Things only change in his perceptions of how they actually happen. This is almost vital to the story in that it opens with the premise that things can't possibly get worse, yet by the end, they don't get any better. Sure, a reliable storytelling method works for the movie. It is an easy way out though, and Ellis' critically objective think for yourself method turns into a preachy sympathy play where morals are instructed rather than figured out with attention to style and detail.The second change, one that must have stirred up much controversy, is the rampant moral righteousness, even in material as seemingly morally depraved as this. Again, these are not simple, I wish they had done this gripes, they are critiques on events that truly deter from the message of the original material. As for the latent amount of sexual ambiguity that is missing from the movie, I believe it was viewed as too delicate of a subject. A reason the novel is so shocking is because it was published in a time when drugs and homosexuality were not discussed in terms of adolescents who could do it and get away with it. However, It is important to note that the characters should not be viewed as bisexual, but rather sexually indifferent. The children were never taught the difference between right and wrong. They have no sense of moral decency and no concept of sensitivity or the meaning of love.They do whatever gives them instant pleasure.We realize early on that Clay cannot save Julian. However, it is all the more powerful and dreadful for Julian to be left alive in his human hell hole with Clay indifferent as he is in the end of the novel than to have Julian die in the car with Clay hugging Blair. At the time, these subjects must have been of some concern to the producers. They obviously wanted viewers to take the film seriously and not as satirical as the book is presented. Still, while Julian's death is a sad scene, nothing can be worse than being stuck in this moral wasteland.While the film focuses on having everything and losing it all, the brilliance of the novel is being unable to lose any of it. That's real hell.

The angel guides the man into an eden paradise of booze, women, and constant winnings at a casino. After some time, he becomes bored of winning all the time. The women are too easy to get and the thrill of gambling is gone. It's no fun when he can't lose. When he tells the angel he can't take it anymore and he is ready for the other place, the angel replies, What do you mean? This is the other place!Apart from Downey's stellar performance, a reason Less Than Zero is good is because it is based on wonderful material. It is all about Bret Easton Ellis' portrayal of the suburban hell. Too many kids who are too rich and spend too much time and money on booze, parties, and cocaine. With all their good fortune of being brought up in a society where they can choose to do anything, they do nothing.Where setting has both faithfully and successfully been adapted from Ellis' original material, two key elements have been changed which hold the movie back. Though McCarthy plays his role very well, the trouble is in the writing. Clay's subdued yet conscious driven character is written for the screen as a vehicle to guide us through this weird world of endless excess. He is there so we can have someone to sympathize with while we try to absorb everything around us.This is a grave miscalculation.Rarely do I critique movies on how they were changed from their original work, but the screenwriters have done the novel an injustice. Clay, as he was written in the novel, should be just as disaffected as his friends. He is no better or worse, he is just alive enough to notice what is going on around him after coming home from three months abroad. He also has a terrible cocaine problem of his own. The brilliance in the novel is, just like Nick in the Great Gatsby, Clay is an unreliable narrator. He is able to live as a real character, have good and bad things happen to him, and still have no control of the outcome in the story. He is powerless because he is completely indifferent. Things only change in his perceptions of how they actually happen. This is almost vital to the story in that it opens with the premise that things can't possibly get worse, yet by the end, they don't get any better. Sure, a reliable storytelling method works for the movie. It is an easy way out though, and Ellis' critically objective think for yourself method turns into a preachy sympathy play where morals are instructed rather than figured out with attention to style and detail.The second change, one that must have stirred up much controversy, is the rampant moral righteousness, even in material as seemingly morally depraved as this. Again, these are not simple, I wish they had done this gripes, they are critiques on events that truly deter from the message of the original material. As for the latent amount of sexual ambiguity that is missing from the movie, I believe it was viewed as too delicate of a subject. A reason the novel is so shocking is because it was published in a time when drugs and homosexuality were not discussed in terms of adolescents who could do it and get away with it. However, It is important to note that the characters should not be viewed as bisexual, but rather sexually indifferent. The children were never taught the difference between right and wrong. They have no sense of moral decency and no concept of sensitivity or the meaning of love.They do whatever gives them instant pleasure.We realize early on that Clay cannot save Julian. However, it is all the more powerful and dreadful for Julian to be left alive in his human hell hole with Clay indifferent as he is in the end of the novel than to have Julian die in the car with Clay hugging Blair. At the time, these subjects must have been of some concern to the producers. They obviously wanted viewers to take the film seriously and not as satirical as the book is presented. Still, while Julian's death is a sad scene, nothing can be worse than being stuck in this moral wasteland.While the film focuses on having everything and losing it all, the brilliance of the novel is being unable to lose any of it.

It scared me when I first saw it, what, 20 years ago, and it continues to scare me to this day.Aside from borrowing a sketchy outline from the book's central premise, Kubrick's film does not much resemble Stephen King's novel. Kubrick vastly improves on the original story, and makes it far more horrifying -- and memorable -- than King did. King was not so much interested in the domestic drama elements of his story, and so the novel focuses overtly on the supernatural -- there's no doubt in the book that the demons plaguing Jack, and driving him to insanity, are quite real. Kubrick, on the other hand, creates a dysfunctional family horror film. Rather than explain away Jack's behavior as the work of a menacing dark spirit -- though Kubrick does allude ambiguously to that -- the film spends most of its time exploring the dynamics of this small nuclear family, one that is trying hard to ignore some ominous signs of serious domestic trouble. It's much scarier to think that a dad and husband might just go crazy from isolation, responsibility and a male inferiority complex than from demonic possession.In Jack Nicholson, Kubrick found an actor who could both make you laugh and scare the pants off of you at the same time. He takes Jack so over the top that he sails right past hammy and circles back around to truly effective. Shelley Duvall is a wonderful actress when she can find a role to fit her unique physical characteristics, and she's perfect as Wendy, the suffering wife, who isn't quite as much of a doormat as you think she's going to be. And Scatman Crothers is great as well, as the head chef of the Overlook Hotel who knows a little something about its secrets.Kubrick is an expert at knowing how to use images to frighten us. He creates isolated images in this film that I've never been able to forget the twin girls hacked up to pieces in a hotel corridor; the vacant stare on Jack Nicholson's face as he slowly cracks up inside while his wife and son play in the snow outside; and creepiest of all, the sight of a man in a bear costume fellating a butler in one of the hotel's rooms, an image that has psychologically scarred me for life.Add to all of this Kubrick's chilly, stately tracking shots that prowl through the hotel like something alive and that distorted, eerie musical score and you have one of the scariest movies ever made.Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"18 October 2006","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Shining, Stanley Kubrick's funhouse ride through hell, terrifies me.

A place that both Humans and Robots lived and adapted to the everyday life. An investigator named,Shunsaku Ban and his nephew Kenichi have came all the way from Japan to find a criminal named Dr. Laughton. Since they don't know the city well they hired a Detective robot nicknamed Pero to guide them around.As they find the whereabouts of Dr. Laughton they soon find themselves getting mixed up with conspiracies and politicians. Dr. Laughton was working with the upper class head of the politics, Duke Red. Who is very wealthy and has a lot of power on the city of Metropolis. He hired Dr. Laughton to create a Super Human Robot that resembles the daughter he lost. When Kenichi got separated with his uncle, he meets a girl who doesn't remember who she is or her past. Kenichi finds himself a new friend, but doesn't realize that his friend is the key to the power of Metropolis.I enjoyed every aspect of this film. One of the cool things about it is the original story was thought up by THE Osamu Tezuka(one of the founding fathers of Japanese comic\/anime and creator of Astroboy). Directed by Rintaro(a close friend of Tezuka). And the screenplay was written by Otomo(the dude who made Memories and Steamboy possible).This movie wouldn't of been made if Tezuka were still alive as he disapproved in making a movie on one of his beloved works. But you gotta admit that Otomo and Rintaro did a great job in reviving a classic comic.I haven't read the original series yet, but the movie does have a retro quality to it, with the characters and music are 40s-ish. The special effects and combination of 2-D and CGI animation makes this movie worth watching for an hour and 47 minutes. I recommend it to those who like Astroboy or those who like anime with old school\/new school look.I recommend it for mature kids or older than 11.

In summery, Edward Scissorhands is a good mix between a fairy tail and a thriller, but some things I didn't like. That's why I'm giving it a 6.

Waterworld is one such item. Could Lost in space be another? No. It's a disaster. Man, it was worse than I expected it to be. Here's why 1. Incredibly bad script with holes so big you could lead a 30-feet Ed Wood robot through it. Especially the last 20 minutes were an unbelievable mess. I can't recall seeing such an abundance of logical errors, contradicting developments, and inexplicable behavior by the main characters since Plan 9 2. Terrible casting. The choices are either too obvious (Gary Oldman, the annoying brat from Party of 5), misguided (William Hurt, Matt Leblanc) or bizarre (Mimi Rogers). Heather Graham might have worked, but spends the movie like on a Valium OD. The only thing that worked was the little kid.3. Terrible acting. You get a feeling after only 5 minutes that this is one of those movies where the director hasn't decided if it's supposed to be ironic or serious. The actors automatically throw in the towel and walk around in a sleepwalking daze... William Hurt and Heather Graham in particular. Mimi Rogers is just embarrassing, as is Joey from Friends who tries HARD in his first (last?) major movie part, and contorts his face into various cool\/annoyed\/dedicated\/sly\/horny\/etc disguises, hoping one of them will be appropriate for the scene. I felt sorry for the guy.4. The annoying brat from Party of 5 is given a Generation Y (or Z) part which is supposed to close the generation gap between little girls who'll want to see this movie, and their parents who remember the LIS TV series and think it might be fun. Clever, yes? No. It stinks. After she pops up for the 8th time to rattle off some cool as-if phrases into the camera you just want to scream. Not to mention that the little Gen Z girls may not exactly enjoy seeing a Spider God being eaten by its own baby spiders.5. Here are a few questions to the director and the people who approved the script - The older Will in the cave has built a time machine through which he can go back and put an end to the Jupiter 2 mission before it starts. Fair enough. But instead, he puts his father in the machine, and sends him onto the ship in terrible peril, thus negating the premise of his whole work. Why? Why? WHY? - Dr Smith has apparently turned into a spider god at the end. His goal is to jump into the time\/space machine and take over Earth. The older Will kills him off by... throwing him into the time\/space machine. Why? Why? WHY? - As the Robinsons make it back to the ship from the bubble they make sure to take the super-evil Dr Smith with them, rescuing him from a certain death. Aargh! Why? Why? WHY? 6. 15 years from now, when all the actors and the hype and backlash are forgotten, this movie will be viewed as a major turkey classic. People will scratch their heads and ask HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? Beats me. It was sort of entertaining to watch, and some effects were neat.
