This so called comedy made me angry. Bill Murray plays an extremely mean and cold hearted TV exec who plans on spending Christmas Eve by putting on a live broadcast of Scrooge but soon he's visited by three ghosts who will try and teach him the true meaning of the holiday. Okay, I know this movie was a critical failure when it was released but in the past several years it has gained a large cult following. That's fine but I'm not one of them. I really can't remember the last comedy I watched that really made my blood boil and get me this angry. I thought the film started off fairly bad and just grew worse with each passing second. I don't mind that this was a complete rape of the Dickens story as even the cutest or nicest story can have an adult twist to it. I also don't mind the rather profane sections of this film. I really didn't mind anything going on here except for the fact that none of it was funny. I really couldn't believe how unfunny this movie was but I think a lot of the blame has to go towards director Donner as it seems each scene in the movie is just grasping for laughs. The entire film is so uneven that each scene just seems out of control with it trying to get laughs. The entire screenplay is over the top yet it never really seems to know if it wants to go all out or just stay low key. To me the film really came off as some weird mixture of adult humor that tries not to go too far where it would earn an R-rating. Perhaps this film would have been better had it gone all out but I'm not sure if Donner could have handled that either. As far as Murray goes, there's two ways too look at it. I guess you could say he gives a brilliant performance as the evil exec, which is good for him but it hurts the movie because you hate this guy so much that you really don't want to spend any time looking at him. The thing with the Dickens story is that we could see some good at the bottom of Scrooge's meanness but I never felt that with this guy. Karen Allen, John Forsythe, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, Michael J. Pollard, Alfre Woodard and Robert Mitchum are all wasted in supporting roles. Every cult movie is going to have people that love it and people that hate it. This is one that I ended up hating.

Or maybe it was just a good story, too. The writer is always the most important piece of the puzzle for my money. Paxton also stars as a widower mechanic trying to raise two young boys in 1979. Most of the family's story is told through flashbacks by Matthew McConaughy who plays one of the boys as an adult. One rainy night McConaughy turns up in the office of an FBI agent (Boothe) who is investigating the God's Hand serial killer currently terrorizing Texas. The edgy young man claims to know who the killer is. And of course if he just came right out with the name and where the bodies were stashed, then we wouldn't have our movie would we? We are taken back in time to witness the boys' father turn from an unassuming mechanic into an apparently fanatical serial killer. So much does he believe he is doing God's work by destroying demons that he forces the two boys to take part. The younger of the two enthusiastically wishes to help out, even providing a list of names of people he feels need to be offed. The older of the two is skeptical from the first moment he hears his father's plan and sees it as nothing more than murder whenever he brings home another writhing victim to be chopped up by a two-sided ax. The boy attempts to get his father to stop, eventually summoning the courage to tell the local sheriff about the killings. This, and any other resistance the boy gives has dreadful results. Eventually the boy's father informs the lad that the angels have implicated him as being a demon. Rather than kill his own son, the fanatical father attempts to purify the boy through various methods of torture and isolation. Finally, the boy claims to have seen God....The final act in this film I will leave you to experience for yourselves. Though it is a let-down, the film overall is still very much worth seeing. Wonderfully acted, the film drags you into the middle of what the reluctant son must be going through. And you really feel terrible for him as his childhood is seemingly ruined by his fanatical father. But of course, there is more going on than apparently meets the eye. And after a while it appears that God may have actually been telling people to commit acts which look like evil. The film does not preach against sinners or rail against Christians, but it may make you think a lot longer and harder about nut cases you read about in the news that claim God told them to do whatever they've done. In the end, there was just too much they tried to make us swallow in terms of twists and revelations. But getting there is quite an experience. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Please completely avoid reading this, or ANY review, until you see it. But to sum up my own review YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. Okay, then read my review. At least, I didn't say you MUST READ MY REVIEW. That part's optional.) The Game was very close to receiving the rare 5\/5 star rating. What held it back to 4½ stars was the very ending, meaning the last 1½ minutes that were slightly off and the repeat-viewing dilemma. I'll explain The entire movie is one surprise after another leading up to a shocking finale and after one viewing, the entire suspense is, well, gone. And I'm not talking about just finding out Luke is Darth's son or the ending to Planet of the Apes. Heck, Fight Club also enjoyed its twist ending, but regardless of that revelation, you can watch that over and over. In this case, we're talking the entire movie.Whew, the negative I hate to start on, is over. The Game is a great, suspenseful, fun, ingenious, crafty and original film. It's also funny, namely in the beginning. And to top it off, it's got excellent performances from both Unger and Douglas &#x96; who rarely lets me down. In fact, this is one of the top five best movies he's done. In a role that could've been easily played by someone confused on what was going on, Douglas added so much depth. You think you know him as a ruthless, soulless Wall Street tycoon, who's used to bullying people to his own needs, but as he breaks down in this movie, you really see the onion being peeled. In fact, I think the most underrated aspect of this movie, as good as the whole was, was Douglas's masterful performance as a lost soul who needs it back.Douglas plays Nicholas, someone so rich (through both inheritance and his own determination later in life as a huge multibillion-dollar money-pusher) that even Bruce Wayne would ask him for a loan.

While I felt this was a very dark film and I did not laugh very much with the exception of a few scenes I did find it to be an enjoyable crime solving type of a movie. In other words there is a ransom involved and trying to figure out whether or not Bette Midler would be rescued from kidnappers Judge Reinhold and Helen Slater(Reinhold is actually very funny here). I was expecting De Vito's performance in this film to be absolutely hysterical but he did it with such a dark tone that I thought he had more of a serious rather than comedic performance. He was enjoyable as always though. The music score including opening song by Mick Jagger I think may be the best part about the film along with the scene when the people who are angry at De Vito supposedly film De Vito and Midler having sex. That as well as Jagger's song and the main opening titles are terrific to say the least. Screenwriter Dale Launer wrote a better script with the Joe Pesci vehicle My Cousin Vinny six years after Ruthless People was made, but he is a very good writer and his characters in this film are written very well as they also were in My Cousin Vinny. He obviously knows how to write a good movie and RP and MCV are very good examples. The ending with Midler pushing De Vito into the bay and leaving him after she finds out about the kidnapping plot I felt was far too abrupt and I wanted the movie to go on for about 10-15 more minutes. However Rutless People is a good movie. Just do not rent and expect anything like the Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker team's Airplane! and Naked Gun series and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed by this movie at all.

Thus there's little vulgarity, a simple story line any new house-holder can relate to and some genuinely comedic situations to raise a smile. While it may rely a little too much on knockabout farce, hey, it was good enough for Buster Keaton decades ago and the stunts involved are inventive and amusing.Of course the dilapidated house palmed on to young twenty-somethings Hanks and Long is pretty much a character in itself as bit by bit it falls apart on our young charges in ever more improbable ways and steadfastly resists all their plucky attempts at renovation.While the movie focuses on the action in the house it works just fine. Hanks and Long mesh well enough although the latter does seem a little too old for her toy boy lover. Away from the house the exposition is unnecessarily contrived, what with Hanks' job as an accountant for the rock industry and Long's as violinist for a symphony orchestra. Throw in Long's over-the-top hunk of a not-over-her ex-husband who's a stereotypically charismatic (= temperamental) orchestra conductor, Hanks' main petulant child-star client and just too many eccentric tradesmen for whom two weeks is a lifetime so that the pudding seemed over-egged to me.Nevertheless Hanks sells it for all he's worth, he taking most of the pratfalls as the house collapses around him.

In the book Jack represented the darkness that exists within us all and our hidden desire to pretend to be what we aren't while in this movie he's just an arrogant jerk.In the book the pigs head represented the pure evil of Satan (lord of the flies is a translation from a Hebrew word that literally means the devil)while in this version of the movie it's really just set dressing that does not convey the horror that it's supposed to.In the book Roger starts out as a minor character but slowly builds into being a sadistic psychopath who represents the pure evil that we all possess but control, in this movie he is portrayed as being sick and twisted monster who revels in the pain of others almost right from the start and in the novel he's first described very subtly as being dark (meaning evil not African American)but in this version of the movie he's written as the stereotypical violent black kid. The whole scene of Simon's death was presented in the book in a subtle way as a semi-satanic right (the whole setting was indicative of an ancient pagan right of animal\/human sacrifice)while being described as accidental it's left up to the imagination of the reader as to what happened, in this movie it comes off as being a frenzied accident.In the book Piggy's intellect is the glue that holds Ralph's civilization together, in this movie he 's written to be a whiny simpering sort of buffoon.But the biggest changes that actually hurt the movie the most were a combination of two things first changing the time setting and second making the boys American,The thing that made the novel so shocking was the idea that prim and proper English school boys in the late forties or early fifties could become uncivilized savages capable of horrific acts of brutality and violence committed against each other.Updating the time setting and making the boys American really took away from the shock value of the novel because by the late eighties and early nineties it wasn't so uncommon to hear stories on the evening news about preteen gang bangers shooting people or middle school kids violently attacking each other on the school yard, these factors really desensitized the audience to the violence that the boys are doing to each other in the story and make it much less impactful to the viewer.The acting is alright, it's nothing terribly special but watchable it's obvious that the director wasn't going to pull Oscar winning performances out of the kids but the leads manage to put in convincing performances and bring some life to their characters despite being saddled with a relatively flat script that omits much of the character development from the novel.The direction and photography are good, although the bright lush colors sort of take away from the darkness of the story and make it seem like a tourism Hawaii commercial at times.The negatives slightly outweigh the positives but it's a decent movie and is at least watchable which is more than I can say for some movies today.

This story has been filmed countless times over the years but this silent version hasn't lost an ounce of its power in terms of the great acting, the greatness of the story and the all around production, which ranks as one of the very best for the studio. There's not a single second in the film where you don't feel as if you're actually living during the time that this thing is set. Everything from the sets to the costumes to the actual atmosphere just puts her right in place with the characters. You can feel their thoughts, their pain and their ignorance in what happens to the Gish character. There are countless great scenes in this film but the highlight has to be where the Gish and Hanson characters start to question love as they sit in a field. To me this entire sequence is one of the most passionate ever filmed as the two actors do a masterful job at showing their love for one another yet they don't even touch. The amount of passion in this scene will set the screen on fire. As much passion as there is, there's also equal amounts of pain. Gish's beautiful, sad eyes so perfectly fits the pain of the character that you can't help but fall in love with her and feel sorry for everything that happens. I can't think of an actress out there who could get so much out of this character as Gish does and this here clearly ranks as one of her greatest performances. Hanson is also extremely good in his scenes, although there are a few times where he goes a bit too over the top. I think he does do a great job at displaying his anguish of the Gish character being punished while he gets away with the same crime. Henry B. Walthall rounds out the cast as the bitter husband. He too turns in marvelous work as he can make you fear him yet at the same time you can't blame him for his anger. All three actors do terrific work together and really take the material and do wonders with it. A lot of the credit must go to director Sjostrom who keeps everything moving at a brisk pace and milks every inch out of the story. His visual style is on full display through the wonderful cinematography and this is brought further to life by the terrific music score played with the film. The first time I watched this movie was via a very dark and badly worn print but the latest, cleaned up print on TCM was a real revelation even though it still showed some damage. Seeing the cleaner print certainly made me appreciate this classic even more than ever.

His life degenerates into travelling as a paid stooge for a big company, weighing whether paying people for what money can't make up in losses works for his bosses. He doesn't just hit rock bottom, he orders Furni (read, IKEA!) products from there! How much can a person have left of their soul when they are drawn to 12 step meetings for conditions nobody in their right mind wants to cope with?So when the tag team from new friend hell emerge, Marla and Tyler, Jack is drawn to both of their live for today spirits. He's such a function of the clock, going out into the world without a watch and an itinerary is his ultimate rebellion. The question is, how long can the narrator keep up with the dastardly duo who shock and invigorate him?There's a wonderful collection of essays on the film, some long and complex, others short and to the point. Not many movies can warrant a book about what started as a book. Fight Club remains as a phoenix rising out of show biz's late 90s ashes. Will offend as many, if not more, than it delights.

Of course you have the iconic scenes, but watching this movie as an adult is even better than watching it as a kid, because every scene stands out at you. I actually felt more emotional and sympathetic towards the characters than I ever did as a child, and it really makes a difference.The movie was made in 1988, and was graced with an array of twelve horribly voiced, animated, and executed musical sequels that sometimes cover up the light of the original film (too much of a good thing isn't always good.) The first movie is a masterpiece, one of the few animated films ever made that provoke serious emotions and understanding of the need for companionship.The story focuses around five young dinosaurs in a time where the world was a mostly barren place. After all of them are separated from their families, they find each other one-by-one and stay together, trying to find the one place on earth they have a chance of surviving in. What makes this plot so unique are these five characters, because they're not perfect friends and individuals, they have problems, ghosts, and don't always see eye to eye, making them a realistic and believable group of friends. However, by the end of the movie they've gone through so much together that they can't help but love one another. Now, of course, the sequels lack the chemistry shown in the first movie, so they aren't even in the ballpark of how fantastic this film is.On the technical side of things, the animation is great, a true example of classic cartooning. Everything is so smooth and attractive, and at the same time, the darkness of the story gives it a gritty look that doesn't seem out of place at all with the cute little dinosaurs. As for the music, well let's just say that The Land Before Time would be a very mediocre film if it weren't for the score. This is by far the only score that's been able to instantly bring me to tears upon hearing it, because after seeing it set to such a happy ending after such a dark and depressing movie, it leaves a serious impression.So, all-in-all, if you haven't seen this movie, see it. It's a classic that shouldn't be passed up, and it only gets better with age.

It's the sort of concept that should turn the movie in a decent thriller to watch. For its first halve or so it also is a quite watchable movie but then some of the twists and turns start to kick in. The movie could had gone into many different ways with its story but yet it picks the least likely ones and for some odd reason the movie toward the end becomes more of an action flick than a thriller really. The characters were being all still quite credible in the first halve but in the second halve we see them all doing things that completely ruins some of the credibility they had build up in the first halve.Further more it's pretty much a movie by the number, without any real surprises in it, despite of the twists and turns the movie is taking. It's one of those '90's thrillers that try to look more clever than they in fact really are. On top of that '90's movies all tend to have the same visual look and feeling to it, which just isn't the most compelling thing. In terms of style the '90's was one of the worst, if not the worst, decade for movies.

Escape from New York is possibly John Carpenter's most well know film, along side Halloween. It was a popular hit at the time, and helped make Kurt Russell into a star. Escape from New York has now become a cult hit for younger generations and film fans (especially fans of B-Movies).In 1997 America ends up having a problem with raising levels of crime, and in the middle of a war with the Soviet Union and China. To solve the crime problem New York has become the largest prison in the world, where no one can get in or out. New York itself becomes a lawless city where anything goes. Whilst flying to Hartford, Air Force One is hijacked by a left-wing terrorist, and crashes it in the middle of the prison city. The President (Donald Pleasence) manages to escape, but ends up getting captured by some of the prisoners. There threaten to kill the president if there is any military attempt to free him. The Government need to free him in 24 hours to keep the prospect of peace alive. The warden of the prison (Lee Van Cleef) comes up with one opinion, to send in special-forces veteran\/convicted criminal 'Snake' Plissken (Kurt Russell). He describes himself as 'not giving a sh*t', but gets talked in the mission. It becomes a race against time for Snake to save the President from very hostile forces led by the Duke of New York (Issac Hayes) (a possibly subtle reference to the novel A Clockwork Orange?).The plot is pretty thin, but with a film like this, plot isn't the most important think. This is a film about the set pieces, and there some good action based ones. It is also about the characters, John Carpenter setting out to make memorable ones. Snake Plissken is a cool character, with Kurt Russell obviously bases his performance on Clint Eastwood's characters The Man With No Name and Harry Callahan. His so-called uncaring attitude is what makes him an appealing character. We also have another master of cool, Issac Hayes to help with blaxploitation type character always fun to see. To add balance to the film is Donald Pleasence, the man famous for being the best Blofied and staring in The Great Escape. He is a talented actor, gave the film a bit of galvanise. However the big question is why did the president of the United State have an English accent? I liked the aspect seeing how New York would have delayed, with many people turning against each other, falling into anarchy. There are hints The Warriors and A Clockwork Orange in this film.There are some logically questions to the film's own internal reality, but you have to pull them aside to enjoy the film. The obvious would be why didn't the military just go into the city straight, or why was New York turned into a prison, and where did the citizens go?
