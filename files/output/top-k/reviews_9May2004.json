If anything it was too sanitised for my taste. So, I never saw more than five minutes at a time of it. I heard that if I wanted to learn to appreciate Star Trek, I could best start with The wrath of Khan. The other day, for the first time, I sat through a complete Star Trek movie. Alas, without a positive result.The story is not much and the characters and sets are made out of cardboard. The villain could have really shone in this setting of holier than the pope dogoodies but unfortunately he was nothing more than a middle-aged He-man or Conan with a son who is a combination of He-man and Donny Osmond. Things were hilarious when they were not supposed to be. On top of that it had me asking questions like Why could the delegation that was beamed to a planet not be beamed back when they were in danger of being captured by bad guys?, Why did the good guys not move the genesis device a little bit when Khan was planning to beam the device up but only knew its co-ordinates?, Why did the good guys not look out of the window when an enemy vessel was not visible on their screens because of some interference from a nebula?. The camera viewpoint showed clearly that the enemy vessel was all too obvious to see with the naked eye and what ever happened to radar, anyway. It just made me feel silly watching it. The only positive point I can think of was that for the first time in my life I actually thought Kirstie Alley was quite hot which was a revelation.There was graffiti and vandalism in Roman times, it is here today and it will be there in the future but not in Star Trek. There is no boredom, unemployment or money. I don't know if anyone ever noticed this but Star Trek is communists in space. And, though, communism is one of greatest political systems ever devised on paper it does not work because, for example, people have ambitions of their own. In Star Trek I just saw drones. This movie was made in 1982, a time when movies like Star wars, Blade runner and Alien were already made. Star Trek and its ideology belong firmly in the fifties. McCarthy would have burned them at the stake, though.Independent of any Star Trek knowledge this is supposed to be good science-fiction. Not so, in my opinion, this movie is cheesy and not up to par. If you think you are not a Trekkie based on five minutes of footage then don't bother watching any more. Liking Star Trek is not an acquired taste but a talent.

You can pretty much expect this kind of movie to be dumb, but sometimes I think it goes a bit too far (toilet exploding scene...was that really necessary??) Although dumb CAN actually be good at times (remember Dumb & Dumber?) in this case, it's not.The sad part is the concept of the movie is good and it had great potential to be funny.  Instead, the script is awful and the acting is even worse. I think that if the movie attempted to make spoofs of, say, 5-10 movies instead of like 42, it would be a bit more bearable.  There was just too much going on to enjoy it (if that's possible).There were two scenes in the movie that I thought were actually funny. One of them is a spoof of She's All That when the jocks are looking for a geeky girl as a project for the lead character to make over into a prom queen.  After passing up an old Albino woman, Siamese twins, etc. the guys finally pick the pretty ugly girl. And of course the lead jock tells them no way, she's got glasses and, and...A PONYTAIL!!! The second scene is a spoof of 10 Things I Hate About You when the jock serenades the pretty ugly girl (named Janie) by singing Janie's Got a Gun. I actually laughed out loud during this scene.So basically I think they should cut out these two scenes and make a new movie with them in it.  The rest? trash...Maybe if the writers spend more than a weekend on writing the script it will turn out decent.

Well let me start by crediting the film producers and directors for hiring the two most perfect looking actors for the main parts.Mandy Moore, well what can i say Mandy, not known as one of the most great actresses or singers but she is my favourite celebrity, she pulled off the part of Jamie Sullivan like no other would be able to, many people slag off her voice and her acting skills but what is actually wrong with any of her skills?. Mandy Moore has a sweet singing voice which suits Jamie's character, would a voice like Anastasia's, Britney Spear's or Christina Aguilera's really be suitable as the role of the caring, sweet, church girl?. Mandy's acting also was very good, you actually admired this girl, and even though she dies at such a young age is this film you can't help having a slight wish that you were her.Shane West, not some of the best films i have to say, get over it, liberty heights and a 20 second part in Dracula 2000, but still this film was what really showed off what was inside of him, his acting as the typical bad boy turns good was enjoyable to watch, i genuinly believed that without Jamie's help he would of never been able to turn good, but still you could see the good inside of him.The songs of the film were absolutely fantastic, including of course Mandy Moore, The New Radicals, Switchfoot, and Top Loader just to name a few. I have read endless bad reviews on this film but when i watched it i didn't see it as predictable like many people thought you have your typical teen movies Pretty In Pink, She's all that, and 10 things i hate about you, all good films but all good long winded ways of the guy getting the girl, but a walk to remember i found different, you saw their love grow but not only that you witnessed their lives together and believed that they genuinly were happy, and while i was left in floods of tears as Jamie left with her unfailing faith there was still part of me smiling.I agree none of this would ever happen, but most films are the same... and if they are realistic not many people want to watch them. I have rated this film a 10, i think it is great and was not comercialised enough, if you have seen this and enjoyed it....)... if you have seen it and disliked it then watch it again and if you haven't seen it.... yup watch it...!

The movie is definitely not for the youngest children; there are very disturbing scenes that scared me as a child.  However, now that I have read the original book by Roald Dahl, I can't bare to watch the movie.Why did Roald Dahl agree to pen the screenplay for the Hollywoodized classic book?  Maybe to support his snozberry habit.  We will never know.First of all, the movie has the cheapest of the cheap production quality. There are so many little mistakes in the movie that are so obvious.  The movie could be remade shot-for-shot now for about $10 and a home video camera.  That is not a joke.  The film cost $3 million to make in 1972.  I think the producers were pocketing the cash.  My favorite example of the cheapo production is at the very end when the Wonkavator crashes through the roof.  It's so laughable.  This isn't the only example though.  Every scene is flawed in some terrible way.Second of all, THIS MOVIE BUTCHERS THE ORIGINAL STORY.  Very, very little about this movie is similar to the original.  Willy Wonka himself is nothing like the original character, right down to the missing goatee.  Gene Wilder did a great job of portraying a character that has nothing to do with how Willy Wonka was intended.  Willy Wonka is supposed to be a very short man who is very mysterious, yet very quirky.  I don't believe he was supposed to be a sarcastic sadist.Why did they decide to change the character of Charlie?  Charlie is a boy who is completely pure of heart and who sacrifices everything for his family, very unlike how he was played in the movie.  First of all, he's a whiny little brat in the film and partakes of the Fizzy Lifting Drink. This totally ruins the character who I loved in the book.They made unnecessary cuts and unnecessary additions everywhere.  WHY DID THEY MAKE THIS FILM A MUSICAL?  That's one of the burning questions I want answered.  And why such a half-baked effort at that?  There are several songs in the beginning, then nothing for a long time except the Oompa Loompas.  I don't get it.  Which brings me to another point  the Oompa Loompas.  Why are they orange with green hair and from Loompaland?  The original Oompas were black pygmies from Africa!Many of the changes were made because the director didn't know how to do anything that looked halfway decent inexpensively.  2001  A Space Odyssey was made several years before this film and the special effects of that movie still look great today.  The same can't be said for Wizard of Oz-reminiscent special effects of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This movie was made in the 70s, not the 30s!!!Why did the fine gentlemen involved believe it necessary to make the children viewing the film feel like they were on an ACID TRIP?  The inclusion of a snake running across a person's mouth during the chocolate riverboat scene was not needed, in my honest opinion.It is beyond my comprehension why they had to make such asinine changes to a story that was perfectly good to begin with.  They changed everything right down to the title.  They took the wonderful absurd fantastical story and tried to make it into a logical tale.The only reason I like this movie in any way is that it is sort of charming in itself.  I enjoy the humor in the film when there is any.  However, I think this movie is a total failure and I honestly have no idea why anyone would like this pile of garbage!  Seeing this movie just gives me a much greater hope that the new adaptation directed by Tim Burton will be much more true to the original.But the sad fact is, people do love this movie because they grew up with it and have never been exposed to the book or the fantastical story contained within it.  Read the book and see if you feel the same way about the movie.

Willy Wonka is supposed to be a very short man who is very mysterious, yet very quirky.  I don't believe he was supposed to be a sarcastic sadist.Why did they decide to change the character of Charlie?  Charlie is a boy who is completely pure of heart and who sacrifices everything for his family, very unlike how he was played in the movie.  First of all, he's a whiny little brat in the film and partakes of the Fizzy Lifting Drink. This totally ruins the character who I loved in the book.They made unnecessary cuts and unnecessary additions everywhere.  WHY DID THEY MAKE THIS FILM A MUSICAL?  That's one of the burning questions I want answered.  And why such a half-baked effort at that?  There are several songs in the beginning, then nothing for a long time except the Oompa Loompas.  I don't get it.  Which brings me to another point  the Oompa Loompas.  Why are they orange with green hair and from Loompaland?  The original Oompas were black pygmies from Africa!Many of the changes were made because the director didn't know how to do anything that looked halfway decent inexpensively.  2001  A Space Odyssey was made several years before this film and the special effects of that movie still look great today.  The same can't be said for Wizard of Oz-reminiscent special effects of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. This movie was made in the 70s, not the 30s!!!Why did the fine gentlemen involved believe it necessary to make the children viewing the film feel like they were on an ACID TRIP?  The inclusion of a snake running across a person's mouth during the chocolate riverboat scene was not needed, in my honest opinion.It is beyond my comprehension why they had to make such asinine changes to a story that was perfectly good to begin with.  They changed everything right down to the title.  They took the wonderful absurd fantastical story and tried to make it into a logical tale.The only reason I like this movie in any way is that it is sort of charming in itself.  I enjoy the humor in the film when there is any.  However, I think this movie is a total failure and I honestly have no idea why anyone would like this pile of garbage!  Seeing this movie just gives me a much greater hope that the new adaptation directed by Tim Burton will be much more true to the original.But the sad fact is, people do love this movie because they grew up with it and have never been exposed to the book or the fantastical story contained within it.

The movie is definitely not for the youngest children; there are very disturbing scenes that scared me as a child.  However, now that I have read the original book by Roald Dahl, I can't bare to watch the movie.Why did Roald Dahl agree to pen the screenplay for the Hollywoodized classic book?  Maybe to support his snozberry habit.  We will never know.First of all, the movie has the cheapest of the cheap production quality. There are so many little mistakes in the movie that are so obvious.  The movie could be remade shot-for-shot now for about $10 and a home video camera.  That is not a joke.  The film cost $3 million to make in 1972.  I think the producers were pocketing the cash.  My favorite example of the cheapo production is at the very end when the Wonkavator crashes through the roof.  It's so laughable.  This isn't the only example though.  Every scene is flawed in some terrible way.Second of all, THIS MOVIE BUTCHERS THE ORIGINAL STORY.  Very, very little about this movie is similar to the original.  Willy Wonka himself is nothing like the original character, right down to the missing goatee.  Gene Wilder did a great job of portraying a character that has nothing to do with how Willy Wonka was intended.

For me what really sets the style we have come to experience from the Coen's in such films as this and others like The Man Who Wasn't There.  In these movies we as the viewer are much more in on the story then any of the characters in the movie.  We see everything that happens while the characters only see bits and pieces.  The characters are reacting in what appears to be foolish or perhaps stupefied fashion to the situation but taken from what they see the choices are logical.  Take the boyfriend in Blood Simple, he finds his girlfriends husband dead and her gun on the floor.  Knowing she wanted her husband out of her life, putting 2 and 2 together any one in that situation would conclude that she did in fact kill her husband, logical conclusion.  The boyfriend reacts accordingly.  There are many many situation just like this in Blood Simple where you actually can get irritated and angry at the characters for making very stupid mistakes and assumption, one has to remind themselves of what each character sees and realize that based on the little information the character has at that particular given moment that their reactions are not really stupid.  This style in itself allows the viewer of the movie to be much more a part of the movie itself then the characters viewed on the screen.

This movie is nothing more than a sorry excuse for product placement, a concept which Spielberg started, of course.  There really is not another point to this movie, other than to persuade you to shop at The Gap or drink Aquifina.  Somewhere in this movie I think Spielberg was trying to produce a Science Fiction movie but it went horribly wrong in the process.The first mistake Spielberg made was working with Tom Cruise.  The two at least in theory are two very different film personalities.  Spielberg often makes the rustic adventure or family films that have certain fantastical elements to them while Tom Cruise is somewhat of a matinee idol personality.  The two should not be working together their styles really clash.  You see this because I believe Spielberg thought Cruise would be such a big draw to watch this movie that he would have to focus on other aspects of the film, like writing and directing, because so many other of Tom Cruises films have horrible writing and directing as well. \t The movie takes place in the future, where Washington DC has instituted a system of justice where no crime is committed because there is a system of justice where the police can  identify crimes before they can take place.  The leader of this project is john Anderton, a drug addict depressant. (I guess the two don't go too much hand in hand) He is leading the charge for this project to become a national standard instead of a local standard. Watching this movie is a little strange, and Tom Cruise is required to actually act in this film.  It is kind of hard for me to take Tom Cruise actually trying to act seriously.  Tom Cruise as an actor has the emotional depth of Foghorn Leghorn.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean that to be an insult, to Foghorn Leghorn.  I just couldn't help finding this hilarious in some aspects, I could not believe Tom Cruise actually tried to act. Another really strange aspect to this movie is how Spielberg tries to make this movie.  Spielberg tries to give this an almost whimsical element, something like Indiana Jones.  But at the same time this is a bloody and violent movie with a lot of gore, and I don't think the two really go together, unless this movie tries to be a dark satire, which it really isn't, at least not to me. Overall this was a waste of time.  I did not enjoy this movie at all.  The only redeemable element of this film was Max von Sydow, who plays the Chief of Police for Washington DC.  His excellent acting ability could not save this movie from being a total bust. The whole thing about pre-cognition and the religious elements involved with the thinking of some characters just was not conducive to this kind of movie.I was not engrossed in this movie, I really couldn't even laugh at it.  It was just there and it did nothing for me, I actually felt like this movie was an absolute waste of my time.

It is a small, but key part of the story. Their improvised scheme involves drugging him, taking him to a semi-public place, stripping him of his clothes and writing obscenities all over his body. Sexual humiliation, with the intent of leaving him shamed and degraded. A symbolic rape, as it were. But, they only strip him to his underwear. Why? Since the point of their actions is revenge and humiliation, then why not strip him naked? And why leave his clothes behind? As is, the poor guy wakes up, cleans up, dresses and apparently goes on like nothing happened. Instead of being a violation of his psyche as much as his body, the incident proves to be little more than a fraternity prank of no real consequence. The film wants to show the women doing a bad thing, but not bad enough to lose viewer sympathy.That is the problem with this artsy, but feather-weight film It never goes far enough. This man, who, up until he is taken advantage of, appears to be a cordial and sympathetic businessman, is cruelly victimized for no real reason, yet he doesn't seem to suffer anything more than a little bit of confusion. One of the women involved in the stunt is a newly chosen CEO of a major corporation and she seems a bit embarrassed at finding out she has been duped into risking her entire career for nothing, but that's all. The other woman, who devised this pseudo-sexual assault as a way of humiliating the first woman, doesn't even seem to get any great pleasure out of her petty manipulations. We see an act of kidnapping and sexual assault -- felonies -- but it seems to be meaningless, even though it becomes the focal point of the film.Stockard Channing is Julie, the executive. Julia Stiles is Paula, a corporate underling who has displeased Julie and was subsequently fired. Forced to stay at a generic airport hotel while on an out-of-town business trip, the two get to know each other. Part of this emotional, semi-feminist, pseudo-lesbian bonding includes targeting Nick (Frederick Weller), a corporate head hunter and a business acquaintance of Julie's. Being a male, Nick presumably represents a common opponent for the women, which is amplified to the level of enemy when Paula maliciously labels him as a rapist as well.The film embraces a feminist mindset, then debunks it. Three quarters of the film seems to suggest that Julie and Paula have a bond simply because they are both women -- even though they have little else in common -- and this culminates in their assault on Nick. The film also plays on the expectations of the audience, which has been conditioned to assume that women have a special bond and are justified at any act of rage against men (the Thelma & Louise syndrome). But, as we see, the abuse of Nick is not justified and is based on a myth that the mere suggestion of rape unites all women. In fact, this supposed gender bond allows Julie to trust Paula, who she has known for less than 24 hours -- and has already revealed herself to be exploitive and dishonest -- over Nick, a long-time associate who shows Julie nothing but friendliness and support. The film's twist reveals that the two women really don't have any unique sisterhood at all, and Paula was exploiting a feminist myth. Indeed, Julie seems to have done quite well in the man's world of business and really has more in common with Nick than with Paula.But, having the nerve to take on an anti-feminist position, the film backs away from it timidly. Nick is victimized, but not too much. Julie betrays Nick, but not to the point where it costs her anything; indeed, even though she treats Nick despicably, the film tries to makes us more sorry for Julie. Though the film falls short of showing Paula to be evil or psychotic, it sidesteps her obvious hatred of men in favor of her sexual and social jealousy and resentment of Julie. Gender politics propels the story, but remains only an understated theme in the narrative.As a character study, the film is not so bad. Channing is, as always, the picture of natural acting grace and subtlety. As Julie, she is always prepared for the worse to happen and is emotionally unprepared for enjoying life when it doesn't. Stiles is properly uncomfortable to watch as the perpetually duplicitous Paula, but her character never makes much sense. It is not believable that someone so irresponsible would end up assisting a high-powered executive. Maybe she is meant to be Julie's alter ego; a representation of Julie as a younger woman, or symbolic of Julie's pent up rage and resentment against men. Either way, she is less a person than a plot contrivance. Weller has the thankless job of being just an ordinary guy whose actions are open to interpretation. If he is innocent, he has our sympathy; if he is guilty the women have our empathy. The film lacks the courage to play the character either way, and Weller himself is left walking a tightrope for the benefit of the plot, making Nick seem oddly untrustworthy, even though he is given nothing to do or say that would support this.THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS looks good and has solid performances. But like the shiny glass and chrome world it portrays, it is all superficial veneer. The action goes too far to make it merely a character study, but not far enough to make it a psychological thriller. It is a film that seems to be greatly angry about something, but is too unsure of itself to fully vent its rage.

In fact, I fall in love with it. I suppose it is one of the best family movie and best animal movie so far. For some reasons Simon Wincer, who directed the first movie didn't return for making this sequel, though we can see again all major characters from Free Willy. Our main hero, Jesse is now fourteen years old and he finds out that his mother passed away and he has a stepbrother named Elvis. Elvis hasn't got any relatives except Jesse and he arrives to Greenwood's home. The whole family goes to the holiday trip in a camping near an ocean's cove where Jesse again meets his friend Randolph and Willy. Willy found his family and all seems perfect for the friends but suddenly another danger threatens their friendship. But now it's even more serious. The movie was released in 1995, eight years before notorious tanker Prestege shipwrecked near Spanish coast and ruined hundred of miles of coastline, not to mention that millions living creatures got killed in the result. It was a real message and it passed absolutely unnoticed because for many people these movies are just cheesy movies for kids only. And in the real life the main reasons of the monstrous disaster was absolutely same &#150; money. The other problem point of the movie is rather difficult and complicated relation between Jesse and his much younger stepbrother, Elvis (played by Francis Capra). Elvis, who has lost his mother, also feel himself very uneasy about the situation and now both boys have to decide how to deal with this difficult situation. The story is basically good written and leaves some place for action and excellent scenes in the cove, including underwater shots. This time we can see whales in their natural habitat, not in the small pool. Whole movie is well shot and locations for shootings are very suitable and good selected. Jason James Richter is as good as in original movie and Francis Capra also did a very good job as rather annoying Jesse's half-brother. The soundtrack (again written by Basil Poleydoris) is worth mentioning alone because of its rather good musical themes and songs. A very good movie for whole family and not a brainless laughable family entertainment that very often bring to us Hollywood studios.

Willy found his family and all seems perfect for the friends but suddenly another danger threatens their friendship. But now it's even more serious. The movie was released in 1995, eight years before notorious tanker Prestege shipwrecked near Spanish coast and ruined hundred of miles of coastline, not to mention that millions living creatures got killed in the result. It was a real message and it passed absolutely unnoticed because for many people these movies are just cheesy movies for kids only. And in the real life the main reasons of the monstrous disaster was absolutely same &#150; money. The other problem point of the movie is rather difficult and complicated relation between Jesse and his much younger stepbrother, Elvis (played by Francis Capra). Elvis, who has lost his mother, also feel himself very uneasy about the situation and now both boys have to decide how to deal with this difficult situation. The story is basically good written and leaves some place for action and excellent scenes in the cove, including underwater shots. This time we can see whales in their natural habitat, not in the small pool. Whole movie is well shot and locations for shootings are very suitable and good selected. Jason James Richter is as good as in original movie and Francis Capra also did a very good job as rather annoying Jesse's half-brother. The soundtrack (again written by Basil Poleydoris) is worth mentioning alone because of its rather good musical themes and songs. A very good movie for whole family and not a brainless laughable family entertainment that very often bring to us Hollywood studios. A nice message for young audience that you must always think about defending the wild nature and what in real life there are more important things than money.My vote 8,2 out of 10 or between B+ and A-.

Now i see Twelve Monkeys, and i must admit, this movie was very challenging, original and extremely unpredictable, it can be analyzed in many different directions, which is what i think is the strength of a true masterpiece, a movie that can have different meanings depending on how your mind is built. A movie can have a different effect on you depending on when in your life you see it, and the state of your mind at the time Something like that is said in this movie, and it defines the movie pretty well.What makes this movie so damn great is the constant twists, you will find yourself guessing all the time, at times i felt very confused, at other times i thought i had everything in place, then a twist and you're lost again, this makes the movie a constant original and unpredictable experience, and the end, which can be interpretated in a large amount of different ways, is very powerfull and mind bending, which is really fantastic, this is a movie that will be looked back at in many years as an even greater masterpiece.The directin is very firm, Terry Gilliam has his own style, which obviously includes many alternative camera angles, which gives the whole movie a feeling of being unreal and portraying a fantasy world, and i feel confident that if we asked him why he used this, there would be a deeper symbolizing meaning with them, i think they describe certain parts of the movie. This movie is a work of a true genius.This movie would not have worked without Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis, each are they giving one of their great performances of their life. Especially Brad Pitt i admite for his role as a crazy lunatic in this movie, the way he portrays this semi psychopath is just so realistic and fantastic. Bruce Willis is the counterpart, also giving a performance as a rather mentally disturbed person (That is the way i felt he got portrayed), he does an amazing and convincing job, together these are bringing the movie the energy and soul it needs.To sum it all up. They say you can talk about a true masterpiece forever, there will always be new things to discuss, there will never be anyone with a opinion and interpretation of the movie that is 100% identical, well i feel that this is one of those movies that can always be talked about, i would love to analyze this, as especially the ending is very powerfull and unique. But also the entire movie itself, there are many things that a lot will feel differently and understand differerently.

Rather the film is about people of the theatre (that's thee-A-tah) to whom life is drama. The film is full of little dramatic moments grand entrances, dramatic exits, fiery confrontations and lines of clever dialogue drenched in wit or sarcasm or acid. There are precious few casual or ordinary moments; the characters all know the power of words and the greater power of delivering those words with style. My favorite moment is a great example. During a heated quarrel with her beau, Bette Davis, as Broadway star Margo Channing, has an equally dramatic confrontation with a candy dish. As the two squabble over matters both petty and poignant, superficial and sincere, Margo divides her attention between the man in her life (played by the man in Davis' life, Gary Merrill) and the contents of the candy dish. As she swaps snide one-liners, Margo debates whether or not to surrender to the temptation of a diet-busting sweet. She picks up the lid of the candy bowl and picks out a chocolate; she sets it down and picks it up and puts it back. The simple act of eating a piece of candy becomes high drama. Then, at precisely the right moment, she pops it into her mouth and chews ferociously, conquering the chocolate, even as the chocolate conquers her. She loses the battle, but on her own terms.The title is misleading. It is only partly about Eve; it is equally about Margo. Margo Channing is a great star, a true star, so we are told. Into her life comes Eve Harrington, a dangerously ambitious young actress, more interested in a short cut to stardom than in paying her thespian dues. Little by little, Eve worms her way into Margo's life and bit by bit she tries to steal Margo's place as the first lady of the theatre. Eve ultimately wins, sorta; but even as Margo loses the battle, she loses on her own terms. ALL ABOUT EVE is a great movie, one of the all time best. But the film has no clear-cut arc or structure. Rather, it is meant as a character study, a collection of wonderful little scenes that allow a remarkable cast to shine. A film about actors for actors. As such, most of the performances are just a tad over the top; not hammy, but theatrical. Yet, pitch perfect; we never doubt for a minute that any of the characters would act just like this in real life. Davis is at the peak of her skills and gives the performance of her career petty, flamboyant, bitchy, sincere and maudlin and full of self-pity. The rest of the cast is made of pros Merrill, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe in a small but telling early role. Especially fine is George Sanders as Addison DeWitt (I am a critic and commentator. I am essential to the theatre - as ants to a picnic, as the boll weevil to a cotton field.). His character is both the film's villain and moral conscience; seeing through the other characters' artifice, keeping them honest, a trait he avoids in himself. Coming to the role with an established screen persona of an arrogant cad, Sanders is perfect as a man who has made an art out of being demanding and judgmental. It is one of the great screen performances. The one truly odd performance is that of Anne Baxter. Her performance as Eve is obvious, arch and almost amateurish. In another film, it would be awful. Here it is just right. The audience sees through Eve's manipulations and lies -- and so should the other characters. But in a world where everything is a performance, sincerity is whatever is the most flattering. We take it on face value that Eve is a great actress on the stage, where she may indeed be real; but off stage we are meant to see the difference between her false theatrics and the other characters sincere theatrics. Baxter's performance is bad for all the right reasons. I remember seeing this film with a college audience in the 1980s. The audience laughed when Davis gave her famous monologue about the sacrifices she made for a career (Funny business, a woman's career, the things you drop on the way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman.). I wonder how many of the proto-feminists in that audience would laugh at it now.
