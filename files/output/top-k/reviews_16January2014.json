The film is based on an old comic book character and that's exactly how it feels, in the best possible way. It simply just reeks that old American nostalgia where men were men and woman had enough sass and spunk to power whole steamboats.For me it's the characters that make this film. Timothy Dalton plays the perfect guile villain, Neville Sinclair, the most charismatically slimy Hollywood lead actor of all time. Every time he flashed that billion dollar toothpaste smile of his, you just want to punch the guy, while hiding your girlfriend and shaking his hand. In a sense, a villain you love to hate and hate to love. Wonderful role performance, easily the best in the whole film.I was also pleasantly surprised by the side characters. Alan Arkin's Peevy Peabody is what I would imagine a poor and more down to earth Tony Stark to be like. A genius engineer, yet his presence fills the screen and when he starts talking, you stop and listen. The same with Jennifer Connelly's Jenny Blake, but in a whole different way. I can see why Neville falls for the girl instantly, and not just because she has some information that he wants. I mean that face and that smile... Good heavens.Unfortunately pretty much the only character that did very little to me is the main character, The Rocketeer himself, played by Billy Campbell. He has this whole nice neighborhood guy thing going for him, but it's a bit too nice, if you follow. The man leaves very small impression and isn't quite identifiable or unique enough to stand apart from other adventure stock characters just like him.But luckily the rest of the cast and the rest of the movie as a whole are more than capable to keep your interests raised and to provide you with a charming adventure with surprisingly decent special effects for their time, some great action sequences and that whole early 20th century charisma. If you like pulp settings, great adventure films and charismatic actors, this is definitely a film worth checking out.

It works because the way he handles it there is a sense or reality to it because the characters do what any couple normally does interact and decide for themselves on how they feel for the other which makes them feel human. This is another one of the romance stories I actually like because it's done the right way.Yeah the plot line is kinda a stretch, but in a way it also gives the film an almost modern fairytale aspect. And really this is a film that is more concerned about it's characters not so much plot.I really like the chemistry between both of them, they both almost seem like a couple that might not happen due to how slightly flawed both are since both are just a bit on the shallow side. Yet, both of them actually click as they both interact more which makes them warm up to each other and both become even better characters than before which to me is part of what makes a good romance, bring out the best in the other.I really like Clark Gable's character Peter, whom is a down on his luck reporter that is looking to make a comeback. One thing I really like and can emphasize with him is the fact that he's not all concerned about image. The guy doesn't always dress professionally, nor does he really care what anyone thinks of him or even Ellie, he's simply a person that just wants to do his own thing, go his own way.Even like Ellie whom is pretty much a typical modern day princess, that wants personal freedom from her upper class life, let alone running away from a forced marriage to someone she doesn't love. I can also emphasize with her on that aspect of freedom, I love having personal freedom. To me that is just human nature, every person no matter what upbringing must be free to make his or her own choices on what they want their life to be or where to go.Both really have somethings in common, both as I said at first are a bit flawed and that's part of the reason why they haven't got what they truly desired. For Peter he became lazy, when he was famous for his time and had high success as he stated somewhere along the line, he let it get to his head and blew it. Ellie she's was just spoiled though not totally by choice, she could have anything she wanted but never really grew up because she never learned the lessons of selflessness, that nothing is for free, and life doesn't always go your way. However both are somewhat aware of them and aren't when both meet their about to learn their unlearned lessons the hard way.In a way both are sort of pieces of a puzzle that fit because they help fill in that missing portion of their persona. Their back and forth is really funny and touching at the same time. From some typical arguments to how both handle a situation or two along the road. One of my favorite moments is of course when both put on an act as a trashy couple and when Ellie puts on a crying act, Peter says one of my favorite lines in the film Stop Ballin! I just can't help but crack up to that because of the way he delivered it.The other thing both have in common is both are looking for something which I feel are genuine ambitions. As I said for Ellie it's personal freedom, for Peter it's redemption in both his career and soul. Both at first see each other as means to their ends. But of course as they spend more time together and go further they begin to really warm up to one another and you can see sparks are just starting to fly, because both are giving each other not so much what they want but what they truly needed but also opening up which is something both have never really done. There is one other favorite scene when both kiss passionately, yeah I know typical love scene but it was really the way both looked at one another, they way they looked at each other was beautiful because they were seeing each other differently than before almost a spiritual awakening in a sense. They begin the realize that what their both looking for and going to was really each other.I feel that this sort of a universal truth with most couples, sometimes the people we go out with, some of them could be so beautiful looking, only to realize after a while they can't give you what you need. But then there is that one person, usually someone really close like a best friend or someone you work with and as you get closer with them you start to see them differently and you find a beauty, one you want to get close to and touch.A lot can truly happen in one night.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2014","score":"","review":" We never truly know who the one is, it could be the next person you talk to, someone we work with, pass by most to everyday, a best friend, but all the same the one we truly love is closer than we think.This is my fourth favorite film from Frank Capra, one of the best things about most of Frank's movies have always been the romance aspect.

It's based on our subconscious fear that they place that we feel safest can be turned into the most dangerous. This is one of my favorite sci-fi film let alone my favorite film from director Howard Hawks. Personally I'm a fan of Carpenter version that story and on a side note is one of my favorite films in general. But this version I really liked because it's good in it's own way, let alone different.I really like the music it really works well for the film, at times it sounds really eerie and unsettling. However it's the theme song I really like the most which I think is memorable and one of my favorite themes because it's one about menace and the unknown.The suspense I think is great, there is a sense of being unsafe. At the scenes when the Thing isn't around, you just know in the back of your mind the Thing will come anywhere at any time, but the revolving questions throughout the film are when and where. One of my favorite suspenseful sequences are of course the giger counter, when a character indicates how high the needle is steadily going up while the blinker is going faster and faster. That blinker you could say represents the pounding of my heart and literally put me on the edge of my seat, because it was an indicator that trouble was coming. This of course was an inspiration for the radar scenes in Alien and Aliens you can say it further shows how timeless the film is.I even like the design of the base and the use of light and shadow which really give the film a claustrophobic and dangerous atmosphere. You really feel that on the next turn, shadow or the next hallway the Thing could be hiding, waiting to close in for the kill. And the fact that this base is located in the middle of the Attic also leaves the element of isolation, which means they can't get sufficient help when they need it the most let alone there is no where to go in the cold enviorment, and the base is even worse because there are limited spaces to run and hide from the creature. Which unfortunately leaves them with the classic dilemma of being in a rock and a hard place.The characters are solid, there not exactly deep characters but you do get to know some of them enough to like the protagonists and care; their dialog is solid and memorable, it feels like the kind of things you'd talk and say in the real world (well sort of). It's true there are a lot of protagonists which is usual a bad idea but it actually works hear because most to all of them have something to do and it's something I don't see enough in the horror genre usually it's reduced down to a small sum of three to one, depending on who survives. I really like the character Captain Patrick Henry he's a take charge kind of guy that cares about the people of the base.Nikki despite not having a whole lot to do, I think is a solid female protagonist, I like that she's not some stereotypical screamer, is solid under pressure, is smart and has the persona to boot. I like the fact that both the characters Pat and Nikki have some sort of love relationship going on, their back and forth I think is genuine.Scotty is a fun character, I like that he's not a stereotypical egocentric reporter. Yeah he does desire fame and is restless with the ambition for the great story, but he doesn't let that get to his head. And he helps everyone out with their current situation so he not useless. And of course the guy says my favorite quote in the end which has been famous through time.Dr. Arthur Covington is a solid subordinate villain, he's sort of like a religious fanatic as we see he's fallen into that classic psychological trap of discovery becoming obsession. He does what he can to sabatosh the protagonists efforts in survival. When he says a line that it's the group duty to die in the name of science, I know he's gone to the circus, because that's the same attitude a cultist would have toward a false religion and profit. In a way it gets at the one theme in the film about the corrupt side of science; science can be used to benefit mankind but when used irresponsibly or for selfish or corrupt purpose it can lead to mankind's extinction.The Thing monster played well by James Arness doesn't disappoint. I like the makeup design which is memorable, he's an intimidating brute, I remember when I first seen him once the door was opened, I though Oh s... and jumped. It's true that he's not in the film that much and we see him in brief periods of time, but that works to it's benefit because the fact it's hidden most of the time makes it a force to be reckoned with because it operates in the shadows. It's characteristics are just as menacing because the creature has no heart literally, which means he has no conscious so you can't reason or bargain with it if you talk with him face to face. Plus it's got some super strength and is hard to kill, which really raises the stakes for the protagonists.Beware and watch the skies, you never know what's flying in.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"16 January 2014","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the popular elements of suspense thrillers has been on the unknown intruder invading a santurary.

It's true there are a lot of protagonists which is usual a bad idea but it actually works hear because most to all of them have something to do and it's something I don't see enough in the horror genre usually it's reduced down to a small sum of three to one, depending on who survives. I really like the character Captain Patrick Henry he's a take charge kind of guy that cares about the people of the base.Nikki despite not having a whole lot to do, I think is a solid female protagonist, I like that she's not some stereotypical screamer, is solid under pressure, is smart and has the persona to boot. I like the fact that both the characters Pat and Nikki have some sort of love relationship going on, their back and forth I think is genuine.Scotty is a fun character, I like that he's not a stereotypical egocentric reporter. Yeah he does desire fame and is restless with the ambition for the great story, but he doesn't let that get to his head. And he helps everyone out with their current situation so he not useless. And of course the guy says my favorite quote in the end which has been famous through time.Dr. Arthur Covington is a solid subordinate villain, he's sort of like a religious fanatic as we see he's fallen into that classic psychological trap of discovery becoming obsession. He does what he can to sabatosh the protagonists efforts in survival. When he says a line that it's the group duty to die in the name of science, I know he's gone to the circus, because that's the same attitude a cultist would have toward a false religion and profit. In a way it gets at the one theme in the film about the corrupt side of science; science can be used to benefit mankind but when used irresponsibly or for selfish or corrupt purpose it can lead to mankind's extinction.The Thing monster played well by James Arness doesn't disappoint. I like the makeup design which is memorable, he's an intimidating brute, I remember when I first seen him once the door was opened, I though Oh s... and jumped. It's true that he's not in the film that much and we see him in brief periods of time, but that works to it's benefit because the fact it's hidden most of the time makes it a force to be reckoned with because it operates in the shadows. It's characteristics are just as menacing because the creature has no heart literally, which means he has no conscious so you can't reason or bargain with it if you talk with him face to face. Plus it's got some super strength and is hard to kill, which really raises the stakes for the protagonists.Beware and watch the skies, you never know what's flying in.Rating 4 stars ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 January 2014","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the popular elements of suspense thrillers has been on the unknown intruder invading a santurary. It's based on our subconscious fear that they place that we feel safest can be turned into the most dangerous. This is one of my favorite sci-fi film let alone my favorite film from director Howard Hawks. Personally I'm a fan of Carpenter version that story and on a side note is one of my favorite films in general. But this version I really liked because it's good in it's own way, let alone different.I really like the music it really works well for the film, at times it sounds really eerie and unsettling. However it's the theme song I really like the most which I think is memorable and one of my favorite themes because it's one about menace and the unknown.The suspense I think is great, there is a sense of being unsafe. At the scenes when the Thing isn't around, you just know in the back of your mind the Thing will come anywhere at any time, but the revolving questions throughout the film are when and where. One of my favorite suspenseful sequences are of course the giger counter, when a character indicates how high the needle is steadily going up while the blinker is going faster and faster. That blinker you could say represents the pounding of my heart and literally put me on the edge of my seat, because it was an indicator that trouble was coming. This of course was an inspiration for the radar scenes in Alien and Aliens you can say it further shows how timeless the film is.I even like the design of the base and the use of light and shadow which really give the film a claustrophobic and dangerous atmosphere. You really feel that on the next turn, shadow or the next hallway the Thing could be hiding, waiting to close in for the kill. And the fact that this base is located in the middle of the Attic also leaves the element of isolation, which means they can't get sufficient help when they need it the most let alone there is no where to go in the cold enviorment, and the base is even worse because there are limited spaces to run and hide from the creature.

Well Red Heat has a ton of the key ingredients of making this an 80's staple. First of all...Arnold Schwarzenegger? Check. Sarcastic, comedic, sidekick...storyline featuring crack cocaine\/drug smuggling, police partners from different worlds, shootouts, one liners....Red Heat has all that. Look at Lethal Weapon and then look at Red Heat. It shares a lot in common. The thing that Red Heat is missing is just that magic, maybe its chemistry or a little something in the story but it just doesn't blow you away. Still for big fans of Schwarzenegger (like me) and fans of quintessential 80's movies (like me) its a must see. Ironically one of the things that I think hurt the film in another way is also one of the best things about it...that is the performance from Arnold Schwarzenegger (more on that in a moment.) The story is a smart, fast paced mystery thriller that comes together very well and is sort of ahead of its time considering its all about a Russian cop and an American cop working together. There is plenty of action and a good story on top of that. Everything works...it just works mediocre like.This is really an interesting role for action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is stoic and subtle and quiet and violent. Its really unlike anything he's ever done. Some would call the performance campy but I think he does a terrific job. He is believable and being Russian actually works quite well for him. This is worth seeing just to watch him doing this performance. The problem is the character is a little too subtle. He isn't loud and over the top and its not what you would expect from him so some might be turned off by it and yet I enjoyed seeing him do something different. James Belushi plays loud mouthed, sarcastic Chicago cop Ridzik. The character is very stereotypical for what you'd expect from this role. He is very loud and obnoxious and overplays it just a little (something far too easy to do in a role like that) and he is almost too much to handle. He is almost unlikable making it hard to enjoy his performance because Belushi is normally charismatic and likable. The chemistry between them is good...not great and that is a reason this could never be Lethal Weapon status. Ed O'Ross plays our villain Viktor. He is good in the role but I feel like the script doesn't give him the opportunity to be truly great. He is still a decent villain but could have been better. There are a few familiar faces on the supporting cast including Peter Boyle and Laurence Fishburne but they are mostly left without a lot of development.I feel like director Walter Hill has always struggled to be more than just good. He has done some iconic, cult classic films (48 Hours, Last Man Standing-one of my favourites and Bullet To The Head.) He has had a lot of ups and downs but never seems to do anything truly amazing. Despite having years of experience he doesn't seem to have a firm handle on what makes an epic action flick. Still I enjoyed Red Heat a lot and Schwarzenegger fans will appreciate it for what it is.

Many of the franchise's later films, which of necessity became broader and less technically and conceptually ambitious, stand alone much better as light sci-fi entertainment. But if you're the kind of Trekkie who follows the TV shows and believes that science fiction is, at its best, a platform for the consideration of philosophy and ethics, there's a chance that The Motion Picture will win a special place in your heart in spite of its shortcomings as a movie. I'm that kind of Trekkie, and I can argue on The Motion Picture's behalf, but I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone less enamored of the franchise&#x97;or less forgiving of it&#x97; than myself. The loving shots of the Enterprise at the beginning of the movie, set to a beautiful orchestration of the tune that would later become the theme song of The Next Generation, are derided by some as too long. And that they are, unless you happen to have developed over the course of the TV show the same feelings as Captain Kirk about what the ship represents progress, exploration, optimism. The main characters are all cleverly reintroduced here in ways that play on and expand upon what was established during the show's run Spock's planet of Vulcan is shown in greater detail than ever before, and his experience there puts his compelling fish-out-of-water nature front and center. Significantly, more time is spent at Starfleet Headquarters and among non-Enterprise personnel than at any time during the original series; this paved the way for the much-needed filling out of the Trek universe to be achieved in later series. These positive elements, though, are the kind that only a true fan can recognize and appreciate. In the final calculation, it must be admitted that The Motion Picture's script is too weak to justify the more than two-hour runtime. The tone and some of the visuals, and even the theme of birth, are distantly reminiscent of Kubrick's 2001, but that movie had much better special effects and was much more eloquent in its ruminations on humanity and technology. The only real idea considered in The Motion Picture is that imagination is a hard thing to program into a machine, and it expresses that thought with as much rote simplicity as I did just now. There are at least a dozen episodes of the Star Trek TV shows that consider the topic with infinitely more insight, so it is perhaps no great loss that after this the film series basically stopped going for profound.

The hype that I got from this film may be a reason for me that this underwhelmed me but it isn't the only factor.The film is written by screenwriters, Terry Gilliam, Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown. Brazil's screenplay is where my problems are found as it doesn't seem to have the ability to grasp me in Sam Lowry's emotional journey. I can't seem to understand the fascination for this girl, and this is due to the film not really exploring the qualities of Jill Layton. If the film was able to show more shades of this character then I may be sold in the protagonist's adventure. My other issue is much less of a frustration, as it's more of a nitpick, and it is the film's attempt to be humorous. I felt that it doesn't work sometimes and it feels too shoehorned, not to say that the film shouldn't have it as it shapes the tone and feel of the film, and I like the way it feels. What did appeal to me about this film, is the great concept of this world that controls the society's culture to maintain 'discipline'. This hates anarchy, and there is even a conspiracy in there that the government uses it as a justification to find these so-called 'anarchist' themselves. The dream sequences that are sprinkled throughout the film is a great idea of visually showing us the themes and at the same time project an exaggeration of the situation our protagonist is in. The climax in the film was great for me, as it was bombastic and ridiculous, with a pay off that made it all worth it. Though the ending may not suit well with everyone as it may feel a bit of a left turn but I think it was well done.Brazil would be the first film that I have seen from Terry Gilliam's filmography and expectations were high. Though I was a little disappointed in it's script, I thought the way he handled it was great. Gilliam was able to show the many shades that this world has, and never to a point where it shows off and tries to be noticed. Gilliam visioned for this film to be in science-fiction territory sprinkled with fantasy, comedy and drama. Brazil doesn't can be taken seriously and if you remove the comedic sequences of the film, then Brazil would be a haunting and frightening film but the comedy in this film allows it to become accessible and easy to digest. The dream sequences are definitely a visual delight and feeling so magical that you can't help but be charmed by it. The film does feel a bit slow during the middle but it could have been improved with an improved script to keep me hooked. Gilliam could have trimmed a little of the middle sequences to help the film move along. The film in a way does get better with viewing but at a snail's pace.Roger Pratt's cinematography is decent here being able to show us the best and worst of the city, shifting from depressing to beautiful back and forth. Pratt was also able to convey the weirdness that Gilliam wanted for this film, which was important in developing the environment's personality. There are moments in Brazil where the image looks a bit odd, maybe due to a manipulation of the lens or using a specific type in order to create that surrealistic look. The colors in the film's photography pops, when it wants to but there are also many moments where the film looks lifeless and dull. I think the dream sequences are the most visually stunning moments in the film. I think this film may have been the reason why Tim Burton uses Pratt to be the DP for Batman.Michael Kamen has worked on a few notable films to do write the film score, and Brazil was one of his earlier works. Kamen's score here was a delight on most moments, with musical sequences that sounds magical and tracks, like the one used for the title and end, are catchy and sticks with you when the film's over. The film's score does rely on the orchestra approach, which I don't really mind but I felt it could have been more ambitious. There are a few moments that felt melodramatic and doesn't really do the scene justice.Brazil features one of the best performances from Jonathan Pryce as a regular guy who has ambitions and would do anything to get\/protect it. I think if someone else took on Pryce's role then the protagonist wouldn't feel as convincing. The film also features one of the most surprising roles that Robert De Niro has ever played. De Niro doesn't get a lot of screen time but when he does come in, it does bring a grin on my face because of his ability to make us laugh and be so ridiculous without doing a whole lot. Taking a look at Kim Greist's filmography, that she hasn't done a lot of notable films. I thought she did her role here pretty well, even if there wasn't much to her character as I hoped. The rest of the cast like Ian Holm and Katherine Helmond did their parts well and was able to give off great comedic timing.Brazil felt like a movie that needed more but it's ambition and vision can't stop me from giving it a try again in the future. It has a great cast and a painting of the world that feels so frightening to be in without it trying to actually scare you. Maybe the next film I watch from Gilliam will show me why the director is appreciated by the general public.

There are moments in Brazil where the image looks a bit odd, maybe due to a manipulation of the lens or using a specific type in order to create that surrealistic look. The colors in the film's photography pops, when it wants to but there are also many moments where the film looks lifeless and dull. I think the dream sequences are the most visually stunning moments in the film. I think this film may have been the reason why Tim Burton uses Pratt to be the DP for Batman.Michael Kamen has worked on a few notable films to do write the film score, and Brazil was one of his earlier works. Kamen's score here was a delight on most moments, with musical sequences that sounds magical and tracks, like the one used for the title and end, are catchy and sticks with you when the film's over. The film's score does rely on the orchestra approach, which I don't really mind but I felt it could have been more ambitious. There are a few moments that felt melodramatic and doesn't really do the scene justice.Brazil features one of the best performances from Jonathan Pryce as a regular guy who has ambitions and would do anything to get\/protect it. I think if someone else took on Pryce's role then the protagonist wouldn't feel as convincing. The film also features one of the most surprising roles that Robert De Niro has ever played. De Niro doesn't get a lot of screen time but when he does come in, it does bring a grin on my face because of his ability to make us laugh and be so ridiculous without doing a whole lot. Taking a look at Kim Greist's filmography, that she hasn't done a lot of notable films. I thought she did her role here pretty well, even if there wasn't much to her character as I hoped. The rest of the cast like Ian Holm and Katherine Helmond did their parts well and was able to give off great comedic timing.Brazil felt like a movie that needed more but it's ambition and vision can't stop me from giving it a try again in the future. It has a great cast and a painting of the world that feels so frightening to be in without it trying to actually scare you.

The hype that I got from this film may be a reason for me that this underwhelmed me but it isn't the only factor.The film is written by screenwriters, Terry Gilliam, Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown. Brazil's screenplay is where my problems are found as it doesn't seem to have the ability to grasp me in Sam Lowry's emotional journey. I can't seem to understand the fascination for this girl, and this is due to the film not really exploring the qualities of Jill Layton. If the film was able to show more shades of this character then I may be sold in the protagonist's adventure. My other issue is much less of a frustration, as it's more of a nitpick, and it is the film's attempt to be humorous. I felt that it doesn't work sometimes and it feels too shoehorned, not to say that the film shouldn't have it as it shapes the tone and feel of the film, and I like the way it feels. What did appeal to me about this film, is the great concept of this world that controls the society's culture to maintain 'discipline'. This hates anarchy, and there is even a conspiracy in there that the government uses it as a justification to find these so-called 'anarchist' themselves. The dream sequences that are sprinkled throughout the film is a great idea of visually showing us the themes and at the same time project an exaggeration of the situation our protagonist is in. The climax in the film was great for me, as it was bombastic and ridiculous, with a pay off that made it all worth it. Though the ending may not suit well with everyone as it may feel a bit of a left turn but I think it was well done.Brazil would be the first film that I have seen from Terry Gilliam's filmography and expectations were high. Though I was a little disappointed in it's script, I thought the way he handled it was great. Gilliam was able to show the many shades that this world has, and never to a point where it shows off and tries to be noticed. Gilliam visioned for this film to be in science-fiction territory sprinkled with fantasy, comedy and drama. Brazil doesn't can be taken seriously and if you remove the comedic sequences of the film, then Brazil would be a haunting and frightening film but the comedy in this film allows it to become accessible and easy to digest. The dream sequences are definitely a visual delight and feeling so magical that you can't help but be charmed by it. The film does feel a bit slow during the middle but it could have been improved with an improved script to keep me hooked. Gilliam could have trimmed a little of the middle sequences to help the film move along. The film in a way does get better with viewing but at a snail's pace.Roger Pratt's cinematography is decent here being able to show us the best and worst of the city, shifting from depressing to beautiful back and forth.

It has sold millions of thematic toys and other related merchandising. It has spawned a multi-million following that slowly turns into an organized religion of its own. It has also inspired over 1300 reviews on IMDb. The reason I'm here, writing another one, is because I recently took another look at it, in its Blue-ray Cinemascope splendor, keeping in mind one thing at the time it was made, this film was all there was meant to ever be of Star Wars. No saga, no nine-part soap-opera. Just this.That's right. Once upon a time it wasn't called Episode IV. Once upon a time its sequel was Holiday special on CBS and CTV. It was at first thought the film would sink at the box office. It has had a proper closure at the end, with that drawn out military ceremony. It only had a feel of an episode of anything because Lucas, by his own admission, conceived it as an homage to early sci-fi television series format (all the way from scene transitions and goofy sound effects down to having a secondary villain escape at the end). The only other idea for a film Lucas did have at the time was about an archaeologist with a whip and a fedora hat. Nowadays fans believe his story of having the whole series written down from the outset, but he really only worked it out as he went along. That's one of the reasons why all the apocryphal stories, called sequels and prequels, tie only very badly to this film, baffling fans with their inconsistencies to this day - and for centuries to come.The impact Star Wars had on the future of filmmaking is incontrovertible. Not even the biggest detractors can deny it. The mass frenzy it caused and success it had are well documented. The influence, not only in the genre of science fiction, but in entire business of making films and marketing them, is such that it can indeed be said that it changed the film industry forever. One can find numerous reasons why was that so, but the last of all would be the quality of this film - as a film.Put together its pluses and minuses - Star Wars is a mediocre film. A couple of things are really, really good and were responsible for having it hold water. The overall idea of a young nobody becoming a somebody in a war taking place in space.

Good for a long rainy day or if you need a good nap. Since I need to make my review longer, here goes Jeff Goldblum, Robert Loggia, and Eddie Murphy are wonderfully talented actors who are wasted in this movie. They must have had some down time between gigs. Eddie is kind of like Axel Foley on downers, I don't think he laughed once. He was charming, but the camera was never on him long enough to be entertained for long. I'm not in the business, but even I got dizzy with all the cutting away from shots. As far as the religious aspects, not sure what they were going for.

However, despite the extremely cold reception the film received upon release, the film has had somewhat of a cult following from people who either love it, or consider it to be a guilty pleasure. Is this film the disgrace fans of the games and critics pointed it out to be, or is it truly an underrated film worthy of the cult favorite status it holds? My answer is...it's sort of stuck in between those two honors, I'll explain...The biggest challenge filmmakers faced was trying to create a coherent plot and visual style that successfully emulates the video game into live-action, and as you can tell, they didn't really succeed in doing so. It does contain the basic premise of two plumbers attempting to rescue a princess from a lizard king, but the setting of the film was changed from the colorful, happy Mushroom Kingdom (as seen in the video games) to a dark, futuristic world which many viewers consider similar to Blade Runner, this was one of the primary reasons why Mario fans dismissed the film. In all fairness, the video game itself seems like a tough contender to adapt into live-action film, while they are linear in substance, the visual style, tone and elements of the games are rather strange for live-action, and seem better suited for an animated film, which is what they should have gone with in the first place. The visual design, while not really something that feels looks nor feels like Super Mario Bros., is actually rather impressive, you can tell they spent the $48 million on the screen, however, this is more of a mixed result when it comes to the special FX. The puppetry and makeup (including the Goombas and Yoshi) look pretty good, but some of the blue-screen and computer FX aren't the most impressive, despite being cleverly used in certain areas.Apparently, the original script was more in line of what you'd expect from a film based on Super Mario Bros., but once husband-wife directing team Rocky Morton and Annabel Jenkel (whom created the Max Headroom series) were hired to direct, the film was changed to a more darker film. The production faced many problems since day 1, including this directing team treating crew members like garbage, they then were booted off the set, and replaced by an uncredited Roland Joffe. Another major issue with the film is that it tries to please both kids and adults, yet, it fails to captivate both target demographics.The script is absolutely weak, despite the concept of humans evolving from dinosaurs actually being interesting. The one thing I do like about this film, besides the impressive production values, is the camaraderie between Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi. While it's rather odd to see them as brothers (especially since John Leguizamo is too young to be convincing as Bob Hoskins' brother, though this is rectified since Mario is supposed to be the older one, and the father figure of the two), there scenes together are admittedly fun to watch. The saddest part about this is that since the set was chaotic, both Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo had to get severely drunk in order to make it through the filming process, Bob Hoskins would later go on record by saying that starring in Super Mario Bros. was the worst thing he had ever done, and that the making of the film was a nightmare. During the 20th anniversary of the film, John Leguizamo recorded a video on YouTube expressing that he enjoyed making the movie, despite claiming in his autobiography that he didn't like it.Apart from Hoskins and Leguizamo, most of the cast is more-so a mixed bag. Dennis Hopper (RIP) gives an extremely hammy performance as Koopa, and doesn't resemble the original character (known as Bowser in the American versions of the games) the least bit. Not many of the cast stand out due to the weak script and characterizations.Super Mario Bros. may not be a good film or adaptation by any means, but I can at least give the film credit for trying to make a video game movie work, though this wasn't accomplished until the release of Mortal Kombat (which I still consider to be one of the better video game to film conversions).

The sets are complicated and look suitably post-apocalyptic. Though if I'm being completely honest, I could have dealt with less grime. Mad Max 2, for example, had this dusty desert look that still managed to look cool and western-like, whereas this one is more about slime and mold, which manages to look... unappetizing. It's realistic, I suppose, but not exactly fetching.Aside from that, I'd say that the reason why people seem to hate this film is the fact that it's rather bland. Costner as the protagonist Mariner is blandness incarnate, Dennis Hopper as the villain isn't much better - though at least he's overacting, which is better than being bland - and the rest are just meh. No one is bad, per se, not even the annoying little girl (Tina Majorino), the MacGuffin of this particular ordeal, though she's the closest to being genuinely bad.What I like most are the mechanics of the ships and ports.

They are so cool.Anyway, supposedly based upon a true story.It's a relatively well done foray into film noir, with one major flaw that draws the film down half way through.If there are two strong guys and another guy with a gun and the guy with the gun tells you he's going to kill you no matter what, but not telling you when, then you really have nothing left to lose.So at some point don't you try to jump him? They have numerous opportunities. And related to this -- why does the bad guy even want the two of them around? Pleasant conversation?

When the story begins, a lone Jesuit priest, Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), treks through the jungle in South America to try to establish a mission where one had previously failed. However, he is very successful and soon the place is filled with eager native Christians. Additionally, Father Gabriel recruits a vicious slave trader, Mendoza (Robert De Niro) to join him at the mission--and soon Mendoza is converted and becomes a member of the order. All seems great...until a treaty is suggested which will move this mission from Spanish to Portuguese territory--and the Portuguese plan of dismantling the Missions. What's next? See this film.The film is extremely beautiful and was filmed in the jungles of South America using Colombian indigenous peoples. The music, though sometimes a bit repetitive, is also quite beautiful. The only complaint I had with this very compelling film was the ending. It made it appear as if the priests stayed behind and died with the Indians when they ultimately attacked, though they didn't. They were pretty much abandoned to their fate. Very sad, very thought-provoking and well worth seeing. Just be aware that the film (especially near the beginning) is very slow and if you are looking for a nice, happy ending then you should keep looking!

David Fincher is a fantastic director and the directing in this movie is pretty fantastic. The editing and other elements are also of highest order, as Fincher's films usually are. My problems with the film lie within the script, which seems to get totally lost in itself. Fight Club's themes of consumerism and materialism and existentialism are obvious, since they are in the foreground, not tying to hide in the background for interpretation. If you think you're a movie buff for understanding this, you're not. It's simple to understand but is at the same time thought provoking, since the movie is about big ideas. Free yourself from society. Accept that your life is meaningless. Destroy yourself to find out who you really are. You are capable of more than you think. Fight Club states these ideas as blatantly as I just did. It shows the main characters being freed and we root for them, but really, do we see a whole lot of benefit to this lifestyle? The film seems to suggest that there is an extent to which this lifestyle becomes dangerous and is unhealthy, yet the film still glorifies it, suggesting no middle ground as to how far we should carry out its philosophies, other than going insane and causing an apocalypse. Another problem I felt was that the space monkeys in the film are all freeing themselves from being slaves to their possessions and society, yet they act like drones when embracing Tyler's philosophies. They become just as much victims to fight club and project mayhem as they were to their societies rules.Is the point of the movie to lose yourself in these ideas? To become a slave to new philosophies in exchange for being a slave to society? The last few minutes seems to suggest that Norton's character regrets his actions and that he has gone too far, but where, does the film suggest, is the middle ground? Despite all this, Fight Club is electrifying and hyper throughout in a way that few movies are and for that it is worth seeing. The ideas are good, but lose track of themselves. Only fanboys think this is one of the best films of all time. It's not, you only like it cause it's cool and you think you're a member of a cult.
