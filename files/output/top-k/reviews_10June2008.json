It was considered a movie for hikers, backpackers, and people that enjoyed the wilderness. I paid to see the wilderness scenes and instead, I fell in love with a great storyline. Looking back, it may have reflected some sentiment against the Vietnam War; leaving the army and the senseless killing, and striking out for solitude and peace of nature. Who knows?I never considered this great flick a western. I find it strange it was called a western' because it has none of the flimsy, reckless elements of the genre. But the Johnson film breaks new ground; a chilling almost haunting depiction of a pioneer's life. The movie doesn't seem to care if you are entertained or not. Jeremiah Johnson appears as a a documentary and doesn't take sides. The Crows had their rules and Jeremiah had his journey to run. The movie's slow pace and story development is a joy to watch in contrast to more recent films that pack action into every scene. Like many great films, it's a movie that either makes you think or you can simply watch, picking up small details each time viewed. I'm surprised how the movie continues to wear well on audiences more than 35 years later. Redford and supporting cast of little known actors was outstanding. Will Geer played a crucial role in the film to support Redford. The worrisome entanglement of Jeremiah's life from simple desire to hunt and fish to becoming a killer grows with every turn. Jeremiah had this super-human spiritual sense of feeling something without seeing. How long can a man survive when he is constantly hunted down? How many fights can he win? I didn't care for the ending. I wish it could have been more defined. But the ending simply adds to the mystery of the story; a great movie. I'm reminded that the film has no swearing, and no excessive gore. Yet overall, this gem of a movie will surprise you in simplicity and in depth.

I remembered seeing this movie years ago, when it was first released to video, and I liked it. Now, upon re-watching it for the first time since that fateful day ten years ago, I see why. Because I was a pervert. Clearly, I didn't enjoy this movie for its sweet message or its fine actors. Ugh.Let me gripe from the beginning.Alright, so first we're introduced to actors that are far too old to be playing their characters. That's fine, though -- I grew up watching Saved by the Bell -- I can deal with that. Then, as we get to know the characters a little better, we realize that, well, we really haven't gotten to know the characters at all. Other than Doug drawing breasts on a picture in school (that's how we find out that he's a rebel) and Pam saying that each sister is the good, the bad, or the one who gets away with everything, we get nothing. There is literally NO character development. At times, it seems like the director might have tried...then no, by the end, you just find yourself angry because you invested two and a half (or whatever) hours into a movie about people, and you do not care in the slightest about any of the people.But what about their acting you say? Well, that was just as terrible as the trite and obvious dialogue they were forced to spew. It's amazing when you see brilliant actors in earlier roles when they are give almost nothing to work with. Joaquin Phoenix is perhaps the most surprisingly horrid. Liv Tyler is cute -- when isn't she -- but she has nothing to work with, and to be honest, her acting was far from perfected (has it ever been, though?) She plays this innocent rich girl to a tee, but she still doesn't give us much of a reason to like her. And why does she like Phoenix's character Doug? Because of that rebellious drawing? Geesh. Give us some credit here.Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly were good, I can't complain about their acting. But, Jennifer Connelly disappears after the first twenty minutes, in a ridiculous scene, with a ridiculous reason.I could go on for hours. The secret behind the Abbotts and the death of the boys' father is pathetic. The attempt at sympathy for Lloyd Abbott falls flat. Maybe it wasn't intentional.

I hated Westerns and thought it was boring...thank goodness our tastes change. In the last few years I became a HUGE Clint Eastwood fan which led to me finally seeing the Sergio Leone\/Clint Eastwood trilogy and a love for the Western but it took me a long time to come back around and see what many consider to be his quintessential Western. This really is his best piece of work when it comes to Westerns and I think it's really terrific that it got the critical and public praise that it deserved and as big of a fan that I am of Eastwood and his westerns he could not have gone out on a higher note. Unforgiven is gritty and brilliant, beautifully shot, and definitely not your typical western. The lines of good and bad are very blurred, there isn't a clear cut hero or villain. I even think that Unforgiven pokes fun at Eastwood's persona a little bit in a darkly comedic kind of way. Eastwood is a long retired killer\/gunslinger and stumbles in trying to get on his horse or shoot a weapon and it has an heir of spoof to it without ruining the dark tone to the film. Regardless you can feel the film building to the climatic gun fight at the end. The characters are well created, wonderfully written and fit the story perfectly.Clint Eastwood directs and stars...the two things he is amazing at. As the star Eastwood gives one of his most powerful performances. His usual gruff and rough character makes way for a very emotionally powerful, deep character with a lot history and back story that he tells with his performance. It is brilliant. Morgan Freeman plays Eastwood's best friend and former partner in crime Ned Logan. Freeman and Eastwood are amazing together and they feel like they have a history together. Freeman's character definitely is one who blurs the line between hero and villain. While not evil his character blurs morality a lot in the film. Gene Hackman gives his award worthy performance as Little Bill Daggett, in my opinion the best performance he has ever given. Daggett is a justice minded sheriff that is brutal in his delivery of justice. Hackman is the one to see in this film, he delivers an absolutely amazing performance. Jaimz Woolvett plays opposite Eastwood and Freeman as The Schofield Kid, a fast talking, conceited, young kid that wants to prove his manhood by killing two men. Woolvett's performance is not as powerful as some of the other performances but he does have a lot to live up to. His character is naive and impressionable and he does a good job of showing both. Richard Harris, Saul Rubinek, and Frances Fisher are some of the stronger supporting members of the cast.Few westerns go to any great lengths to tell a really deep story instead giving up that for guys with bad accents, bar fights, swinging doors and gun fights...something Unforgiven has BUT also tells this incredible sweeping story with this back story that unfolds without ever being shown. The story can be a little slow and doesn't have a lot of action from beginning to end but it's a very deep and careful character study and the characters make it worthwhile. Eastwood may have found himself the perfecting ending to an amazing genre career although I hope he has a lot more in other genres ahead of him.

Last week, after watching the first film for the second time (though it was the first time in many years), I watched this one for the first time. Like Dr. No, seeing this follow-up was far from being my greatest movie-watching experience, but fortunately, both films left me reasonably impressed, enough for both of them to get a 7\/10 in my book.James Bond, Agent 007, is sent to Istanbul, Turkey to search for Lektor, a Russian decoding machine, for the British Secret Service to gain access to Russian codes. However, this is actually a set-up from S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), who intend to avenge their Dr. No by using this machine as a plot to lure Bond into a trap and kill him! So, during the British secret agent's mission, he faces more than one enemy, including Red Grant, as well as Rosa Klebb, a former KGB agent who now works for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and can cleverly kill unsuspecting people with the poisoned tip of her shoe! Basically, watching this second Bond movie was a lot like watching the first. Although, it does have a more intense opening, with a man out in the dark we THINK is Bond at first. When I saw this, it made me think that maybe From Russia with Love would be somewhat superior to its predecessor, with more consistent suspense. Eventually, however, I was proved wrong, it turned out to be pretty much like Dr. No for me, not all consistent, with some forgettable moments, but with some good and memorable action scenes as well, including certain scenes on the train, as well as the boat chase. Of course, we can always expect attractive female characters in these movies, which many of us guys can see a highlight, and in this particular one, there is Tatiana Romanova, played by Daniela Bianchi.Unsurprisingly, this film has some dated elements, including the very noticeable back projection at the end. However, while From Russia with Love may not hold up as well today as certain other movies from the era, or before, I'm sure it has held up better than many other movies from decades ago. These early James Bond flicks certainly haven't been forgotten. I pointed out in my comment on Dr. No that it's not for people who need non-stop action in order to be entertained, but is probably worth watching for those who can enjoy slower spy thrillers with a reasonable amount of action. Well, if you ask me, that's the same case with this follow-up.

However, this is actually a set-up from S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), who intend to avenge their Dr. No by using this machine as a plot to lure Bond into a trap and kill him! So, during the British secret agent's mission, he faces more than one enemy, including Red Grant, as well as Rosa Klebb, a former KGB agent who now works for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and can cleverly kill unsuspecting people with the poisoned tip of her shoe! Basically, watching this second Bond movie was a lot like watching the first. Although, it does have a more intense opening, with a man out in the dark we THINK is Bond at first. When I saw this, it made me think that maybe From Russia with Love would be somewhat superior to its predecessor, with more consistent suspense. Eventually, however, I was proved wrong, it turned out to be pretty much like Dr. No for me, not all consistent, with some forgettable moments, but with some good and memorable action scenes as well, including certain scenes on the train, as well as the boat chase. Of course, we can always expect attractive female characters in these movies, which many of us guys can see a highlight, and in this particular one, there is Tatiana Romanova, played by Daniela Bianchi.Unsurprisingly, this film has some dated elements, including the very noticeable back projection at the end. However, while From Russia with Love may not hold up as well today as certain other movies from the era, or before, I'm sure it has held up better than many other movies from decades ago. These early James Bond flicks certainly haven't been forgotten. I pointed out in my comment on Dr. No that it's not for people who need non-stop action in order to be entertained, but is probably worth watching for those who can enjoy slower spy thrillers with a reasonable amount of action. Well, if you ask me, that's the same case with this follow-up. I'm sure both films would easily bore more viewers today than they did back when they were first released in the early '60s, but fortunately, they can still entertain many people as well.

He has difficulty talking to people in person but has no problem talking to people on his illegal radio station where he can hide behind the anonymity of a voice disguiser and become Happy Harry Hardon. His broadcasts are popular with all the pupils at his school and soon tapes of them are being traded and played at there much to the chagrin of the school authorities.Much of his broadcast is taken up pointing out the many faults of his school in particular the actions of the principal and the guidance councillor, he also reads letters from his listeners and attempting to give some advice. Unfortunately he can't always help and after a student he spoke to on air carries out his threat to commit suicide the school uses it as excuse to clamp down on anybody who might know who he is.Also trying to identify him is classmate Nora, played by Samantha Mathis, she however has more luck than the authorities. When he has doubts about carrying on his broadcasts she is the one who talks him into continuing.The acting in the film is fairly solid especially from Slater and Mathis and the story is both interesting and amusing. Like most good films it isn't without its weak points; the students seem rather too uniformly fans of the broadcasts and the authorities attempts to catch him seem highly amateur although I guess if he'd been arrested five minutes into the film it wouldn't have been as interesting.Even though it was made almost twenty years ago it still feels relevant today as it did back then the only things that really dates it is the fact that there is no internet and none of the children have mobile phones like they would today.

I always tell the story about the time I went with some friends to the cinema and convinced everyone to watch this film and once inside the theater everyone wanted to go because they didn't like what they were watching but I wanted to stay because I liked it very much. And because I think there's a time for movies and that they arrive when they arrive, I have just found David Mamet's State and Main and, luckily, I've liked it very much. Of course, it's a special movie, but not in the sense that it's not for everyone. It's an easy-going movie, with a clear and simple plot line, nice sceneries and a cinematography that doesn't take any risks; but I could merely recommend, with enthusiasm, that everyone who watches assume a commitment. What do I mean by this? Well, that if you pay more attention than usual you should really enjoy it. The thing is that State and Main is a movie about a movie, and it's written by David Mamet, fact that naturally makes it not 'any' movie about a movie. I'll take a risk and say that this is based on one of Mamet's plays (I don't know that for a fact), because it looks very theatrical, but with the exceptional cast (by genius Avy Kaufman) and Theodore Shapiro's shifting score, we quickly forget about it. We don't forget, however, what may originally have come from a play; and that's Mamet's use of language. From scene one, where a doctor encounters a patient on the street and Walt (William H. Macy) argues with his team about the place they've ended up in, the writer\/director establishes a style in his screenplay that we feel throughout the whole ride and contains certain characteristics sharp, witty, direct, humorous and, at surprising times, reflexive and profound. Walt is a director who comes to shoot a film to Waterford, Vermont; the place they've ended up in the middle of nowhere. The fact that Waterford is a little town where everyone has a big smile on their faces and don't seem to have problems (Julia Stiles' perfect working teenager; Rebecca Pidgeon's kind and loving Annie; Charles Durning's mayor), helps to establish a contrast with the neurotic director and his Hollywood crew the manipulative and unstoppable producer Marty (a wonderful David Paymer); the popular star with a 'thing' for minors Bob (the role Alec Baldwin knows by heart); the pretty and stupid popular actress (Sarah Jessica Parker, in the role that suits her quite well); and the character with which you should implement my recommendation of paying attention the creative, insecure writer of the film, Joe, played by the Great Philip Seymour Hoffman. Stereotypes? Why not some of them? But Manet is so gifted that, instead of assuming a character is stereotyped, he gives them lines for us to recognize, through their personality, the stereotype they represent. This sound simple, but it's not. It's the same I try to say about State and Main it looks simple, and it can be; but it doesn't have to be if you want it to. If you want, you can put yourselves in Joe the writer's position and try to figure out the truth, whatever it may be. If you want, you can enter as an outsider to the world of making a film and what it has to offer; to the political aspirations and perspectives of a little town; to the tradition and the stories and the sense of home of a little town. Mamet knows all of these things, and here sometimes he takes a stand; he sometimes mocks, other times he praises, most of the time he makes no sense at all, but all the time he's showing these things to us, in any form you may want to take them. And what's what cinema essentially does?

I always tell the story about the time I went with some friends to the cinema and convinced everyone to watch this film and once inside the theater everyone wanted to go because they didn't like what they were watching but I wanted to stay because I liked it very much. And because I think there's a time for movies and that they arrive when they arrive, I have just found David Mamet's State and Main and, luckily, I've liked it very much. Of course, it's a special movie, but not in the sense that it's not for everyone. It's an easy-going movie, with a clear and simple plot line, nice sceneries and a cinematography that doesn't take any risks; but I could merely recommend, with enthusiasm, that everyone who watches assume a commitment. What do I mean by this? Well, that if you pay more attention than usual you should really enjoy it. The thing is that State and Main is a movie about a movie, and it's written by David Mamet, fact that naturally makes it not 'any' movie about a movie. I'll take a risk and say that this is based on one of Mamet's plays (I don't know that for a fact), because it looks very theatrical, but with the exceptional cast (by genius Avy Kaufman) and Theodore Shapiro's shifting score, we quickly forget about it. We don't forget, however, what may originally have come from a play; and that's Mamet's use of language. From scene one, where a doctor encounters a patient on the street and Walt (William H. Macy) argues with his team about the place they've ended up in, the writer\/director establishes a style in his screenplay that we feel throughout the whole ride and contains certain characteristics sharp, witty, direct, humorous and, at surprising times, reflexive and profound. Walt is a director who comes to shoot a film to Waterford, Vermont; the place they've ended up in the middle of nowhere. The fact that Waterford is a little town where everyone has a big smile on their faces and don't seem to have problems (Julia Stiles' perfect working teenager; Rebecca Pidgeon's kind and loving Annie; Charles Durning's mayor), helps to establish a contrast with the neurotic director and his Hollywood crew the manipulative and unstoppable producer Marty (a wonderful David Paymer); the popular star with a 'thing' for minors Bob (the role Alec Baldwin knows by heart); the pretty and stupid popular actress (Sarah Jessica Parker, in the role that suits her quite well); and the character with which you should implement my recommendation of paying attention the creative, insecure writer of the film, Joe, played by the Great Philip Seymour Hoffman. Stereotypes? Why not some of them? But Manet is so gifted that, instead of assuming a character is stereotyped, he gives them lines for us to recognize, through their personality, the stereotype they represent. This sound simple, but it's not. It's the same I try to say about State and Main it looks simple, and it can be; but it doesn't have to be if you want it to. If you want, you can put yourselves in Joe the writer's position and try to figure out the truth, whatever it may be. If you want, you can enter as an outsider to the world of making a film and what it has to offer; to the political aspirations and perspectives of a little town; to the tradition and the stories and the sense of home of a little town. Mamet knows all of these things, and here sometimes he takes a stand; he sometimes mocks, other times he praises, most of the time he makes no sense at all, but all the time he's showing these things to us, in any form you may want to take them.

I find his talent is overlooked by his radicalism. But if you ever study Do the Right Thing, you can see that any man who can act, write and direct such a powerful, provoking, and funny film is genius. I have since then made it a goal to see as many Spike Lee Joints as possible.Jungle Fever is the story of Flipper, a black middle-aged man from Harlem with a large constellation of friends and family. He is frustrated with his job, since he cannot seem to get a raise. At his job he meets Angie, a young Italian intern with a boyfriend and a family of 4 older men she has to take care of. When they meet, it's Jungle Fever. It seems scores of famous actors portray members of either side's family and friends.Jungle Fever is clearly a similar subject to Do the Right Thing, or any of Lee's films. All his films tackle race and one other thing. With He Got Game it's race and sports, with Malcolm X it's race and history, and so on. Jungle Fever is set up to tackle race and sexuality. Obviously this is what Spike enjoys and what he does best.While I was watching this movie, I had hopes that it would become one of my favorites. For a while, it seemed it could. However, the film takes a sudden change when Flipper's brother, Gator (played by a very young Samuel L. Jackson), comes into the picture. Gator is a crack-head who mooches off of his parents (Ossie and Ruby) and is obsessive over getting some dope.From that point on, the film becomes very little about the premise. It seems that from then on the movie is about the dangers of crack. This includes a long scene where Flipper is looking for his brother among a warehouse full of crack-heads, and many more scenes with this, all leading up to a horrible ending.I think what happened was Spike Lee tried to cover sex, drugs, and race into one movie, and though attempts were good, it was not a success. I respect the movie, the music is great, the beginning is excellent, but eventually it drops off. I guess the moral is it should have been two movies.

It's unmistakably the same war again with the same allies against the same old enemies.Compared to the rest there were Bondy points being missed in here  the thrilling pre-titles sequence, the gold old (Desmond Llewelyn) as Q , the wicked sexual innuendo in dialogue or intensively at names as you'll wait to next movies to hear Pussy Galore, Plenty O'Toole, Xenia Onatopp, .., or even the sexual boldness (Bond won't slap a girl's butt until From Russia With Love, and Goldfinger).Actually a lot of viewers nowadays forget how this is one of the rare Bond movies that got a real reasonable plot. Yes, you'd never find a police searching like the one which filled up the first half at any of the following movies, because it'll rely more on crazy Action, too many cliffhangers, over-budget sets, international backgrounds. So it's an exceptional time to see a novelistic building before the turning into cartoon.Moreover this is maybe the only time to witness Bond feeling scared (he tells Honey about his hand's sweat), after that he's nothing but a cold killing machine.Look at the shot when the girl pulls the group of books to discover that it was just a cover-up for hidden radio. It's the beginning of another era where reading is not the main activity, and books will fade away in front of Movies, TV, then computers, internet, etc.I loved the jazzy theme all the time, the exquisite locations, the wonderful well-dressed girls all over it even in trivial parts (Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench with nice sexy scene, and great kiss by the way), even the girl with the telegram at the first scene, or the hotel receptionist who looks at Bond and fantasizes !, remember the way of filming Zena Marshall from low angle to look huge while she's walking in skimpy clothes. It's a world of pure enjoyment.Personally the best thing was Ursula Andress's body, and being in that outrageously glaring bikini too. When Ursula emerged from that sea, it's officially the end of Marlin Monroe's curvy voluptuous physique kind of vogue.

I loved more the way of dealing with her  being in THAT historical bikini for most of the time, presenting her as violent woman, putting her in pants just to take it off at the ending sequence with no logical reason but to amuse us with her naked long legs !, even the debate around her being nude in the shower scene, or not? It's some commercial smartness which you wouldn't find it again at the series since the 1980s, where I don't understand why the big fuss about having sex dolls in movies manufactured originally as an ice cream, not a declaration about the feminine rights ?!, what about the miserable male viewers's rights for god's sake ?!!Surely the first Bond movies had true sense of celebratory in them. The 1960s was electrifying with all the scientific revolution, the sexual liberty, and the materialistic philosophies. It was the human vanity and pride at their highest peaks. And the elements of Bond flicks just a well example to express all of that yet brainlessly ! To live the dream of one sharp playboy who saves the world.The secret about this franchise's continuous success and immortality is simple. Bond is abbreviating the basic formula for an Action  one hero, good girl, one villain, bad girl, some Bang Bang, with some of the other kind of Bang Bang !, then a big climax at an underground, underwater, or above both lair.

Yes many of you have already witnessed how special this piece of cinema is. I'm not one for producers and other knowledges about the making of a film and feel a little ashamed about this lack of whatever it is that I should grasp. However I can relate to what this film did for me. As some described it, it was and has been again a very unique experience. I had my struggling with many topics addressed here and could really feel for what is portrayed in this film. I still retain much of that simple naivety that want this world to be good and so vouch much for Beth. Although I have work enough years in mental health, I never felt the need for Beth to be locked up - (yes perhaps I'm the one with this need!) But all along riding my emotion with her calvary I felt I understood and agree with her choices even if they would not have been mine. So often one, feel guilty about not following one's instinct. I do forget that she is the product of those extraordinary puppeteers, but it was good enough for me to dwell on her character. I've read quite a few commentaries and was surprised not to hear any about how Beth felt responsible for Jan's accident, as she virtually asked for it. Indeed, how Emilly Watson managed such acting, as if she had been transfixed by some supernatural forces. Even with previous experience she would have been as remarkable as she was, but perhaps this lack of acting experience produced this genuine transformation.

This screenplay about a Maori family was adapted by Alan Dodd from a novel by Rivia Brown. It's a very tough film to watch as it shows domestic violence realistically without holding anything back. All of the character flaws in this film essentially stem from violence. Whenever there is any kind of problem (which is practically all the time), this family resorts to violence in a desperate and illogical reach for a solution. Temuera Morrison plays Jake the Muss who is a terrifying, vicious man that doesn't hesitate for a second to brutally beat his wife Beth if she does so much as look at him the wrong way. What's the wrong way? Who knows. There isn't much of a method to his mayhem. There is no telling when he will explode. Beth reaches a point where she will no longer take it any more as she tells her husband that she won't come out of her room and join the party. She will no longer associate with the people involved in her husband's lifestyle. Interestingly, as much of a tyrant Jake is, he never once cheats on his wife. His ability to remain faithful to her adds a fascinating dynamic to his character which makes him more three-dimensional. As a result of this extreme domestic violence, their children Nig, Boogie and Grace are quite disconnected from the traditional family unit. They struggle to find a place for themselves, an identity, and a chance to belong and feel accepted. The oldest son, Nig, joins a street gang where they tattoo their entire bodies to the point where they resemble an alien species. The younger son, Boogie, begins a life of crime very early on in his development. The court sends him to an institution where his teacher helps him get back in touch with his cultural roots. Although, Beth plans on visiting her son Boogie, Jake ruins those plans. The heart of this tragic story lies in the actions of their daughter Grace. After being raped by her uncle, she is so devastated that she sees no point in living any longer. As an interesting shot involving men lifting weights and using a punching bag in a dark alley shows, Grace would have been fine living on the streets. However, her home life is very unsafe. Therefore, she commits suicide by hanging herself from the backyard tree. Her suicide is seen as a self-sacrifice for the betterment of the essence of her community. She is something of a martyr for the Maori people. All of the performance in this film are fantastic, particularly those of Beth and Jake played by Rena Owen and Temuera Morrison respectively. I was surprised to learn that Morrison plays a lovable George Clooney from E.R.-esquire doctor on the popular New Zealand television series Shortland Street. This shows the range of his ability as an actor. Unfortunately, director Lee Tamahori's track record has been less than stellar. Instead of following up Once Were Warriors with equally terrific films, he proceeded to make the James Bond film Die Another Day, the significantly disappointing sequel to the already disappointing action flick XXX, and the abysmal Nicholas Cage film last year called Next. Hopefully, he'll return to his roots someday because, although it can be very tough to watch, Once Were Warriors is an incredible film.

I found it thoroughly enjoyable. I certainly don't dispute the fact that there were some gaping plot holes, but the tension, the psychological baiting, and the stellar acting quality from some of my favourites were more than enough to make up for any shortcomings. Knowing what we know about Bill Clinton's philandering (or Kennedy's, come to that) the idea of such a death and its monstrously hypocritical concealment doesn't seem so far-fetched. In fact, conspiracy theorists have been hot on the Kennedy trail for years. Perhaps they were the inspiration for the original David Baldacci novel upon which this movie was rather loosely based. I myself have not read it through, so cannot judge. Eastwood acts, and directs himself, in a role that carries far more depth and conviction than I have seen him play in any movie except perhaps 'Bridges Of Madison County'. Here, he gets to play an ageing and unscrupulous thief, an estranged but doting father, and at last an avenging agent-provocateur. Simplistic, shoot-'em-up Dirty Harry is long gone. Ed Harris plays the investigating police officer, who gradually realises that there's more going on than meets the eye. There's a sly little thing begins developing between him and Eastwood's daughter. He offers a nice pitch between candour and suspicion.Gene Hackman plays the president, using his 'obnoxious' method style to full advantage. There is excellent support all round. Scott Glenn is very good as the conscientious lieutenant torn between conflicting loyalties. And I particularly like E G Marshall, as the president's favourite, who is similarly trapped between grief, anger and shame. This guy seems to have been playing thoughtful old men in movies for as long as I've been going to the cinema. The script is fair rather than clever, but the quality of the players make the often mediocre lines seem perfectly normal and genuine. There are some fine moments of tension, especially during the assassination attempts. The pacing, camera-work and lighting are competent if not imaginative. And the incidental music and sound effects are all that a good thriller should possess. The ending is a little weak. The fate of the president seems implausible to say the least. Yet for the most part you get a good run for your money up to that point. It is considerably better than the re-makes of 'Get Carter and 'The Italian Job'. I bought the DVD. Admittedly, I only paid £3.00 at the supermarket, but I'm perfectly happy to have it in my collection. If you like Eastwood in his more thoughtful old-age, give it a whizz.

This film may have had a standing ovation when it was premiered, but when you're standing in a room with a television for three or four hours, you have to wonder, where exactly did those three hours go? ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"10 June 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Many viewers have likened Another Woman (1988) to the work of Ingmar Bergman, no doubt as a result of certain similarities to the themes of Wild Strawberries (1957). Although these elements are apparent, I find certain parts of the film just as reminiscent of Tarkovsky; with the idea of memory and regret informing a personal story that has subtle shades of deeper interpretation, all pertaining to the spaces between fact and fiction, happiness and despair. Although I don't think it's one of Allen's greatest films, it does work; and the sense of emotion and the ideas expressed become more successful as the film progresses towards its somewhat more hopeful, and indeed, reflective final act. However, the lead up to this particular revelation, still pregnant with uncertainly and quiet anticipation, is a long and winding one; focusing on the issues of guilt, failure and a crisis of identity as the characters maintain a polite air of dignity and outward civility whilst crumbling from within.Like many of Allen's films that don't feature his typical on screen persona as the principal focus of attention, Another Woman looks at a protagonist that is difficult to appreciate from an audience's perspective; in this instance, a cold, arrogant and condescending upper-middle class intellectual facing a crossroad in her existence as she approaches her 50th birthday. Like the characters in the similarly structured Interiors (1978) and September (1987), the choice of character and her personal portrayal is vital to the film but difficult for the audience to get a hold of. Her initial characteristics, combined with the self-assured narration, make it harder for us to interact with her on a personal level, while her interactions with other characters and attempts to learn more about them ultimately cast a further, negative light on her own failings and insecurities. Through this particular devise, Allen is able to more closely examine the themes behind the film, ultimately creating something of an epiphany that will affect every character within in the story, but only as an extension of Marion herself.Like many of Allen's characters, Marion suffers from the typical trait of complaining about problems that she herself has created through arrogance and a lack of sympathy. The fact that she herself cannot appreciate this fact for the bulk of the film makes her even harder to sympathise with as she continues to look down on people and place them under the microscope as if insects there to be studied. However, for once, these qualities - no matter how seemingly repellent in the early parts of the film - do eventually lead the plot to somewhere greater. It still isn't handled with the finesse or imagination of films like Manhattan (1979), Stardust Memories (1980), Crimes and Misdemeanours (1989), Husbands and Wives (1992), etc, but you can see Allen's intent and confidence in approaching this character and the complicated themes that the film presents.Regardless of the flaws of the character and the flawed nature of some of the performances (particularly those in the minor and supporting roles) the film has a fascinating quality that leaves it open to a variety of deeper and more personal interpretations. For example, the implication behind the title - which is an important factor in truly understanding the various personal strands littered throughout the film - is never fully explained, though it is hinted at in such a way so as to suggest elements of further, meta-textual interpretation. Firstly, we can see it as an extension of Marion's guilt in regards to her various relationships in life; for example, she meets her second husband while he's still living with his previous wife, making her literally the other woman; the seductress, the home wrecker, etc. Later in the film we find out that that her husband is now having another affair, this time with a family friend. Again, she has become the other woman. She is also in the constant shadow of her mother; an enigmatic character in love with nature and the arts, and yet stifled by her cold, intellectual husband and the responsibilities of raising a family.Finally, the intention of the title is most obviously presented by Marion's interest and eventual relationship with the tragic and mysterious Hope; a young, pregnant woman plagued by various psychological problems and suicidal thoughts. Marion literally finds Hope when she rents an apartment that shares an adjoining wall with a psychiatrist's office, where a flaw in the ventilation systems makes it possible to eavesdrop on the various conversations. In discovering Hope, Marion is able to contextualise her own life and failures in comparison to this tragic young woman alive with desires for art and creative fulfilment, but shackled by the oppression of everyday living. It is almost as if Hope is an extension of Marion's personality; a vision of what could have been had she allowed her life to take a different direction, or a cipher that allows her to finally realise how meaningless and empty her own life truly is.In creating the character of Hope, Allen is intelligent enough to leave the broader qualities a complete mystery. As a result, the very nature of Hope, from her brief appearances in the film to the way that Allen frames her within the drama, suggest an almost imaginary figure; an expansion of Marion's own personality and a way for her to analyse herself, psychologically, in a way that reduces the chance for her own ego to rationalise her mistakes and complications. By creating this other woman, Marion is able to view herself objectively, finally finding hope in the literal sense and being able to change her personality and direction in life for the better. The ultimate revelation of this makes the film far more interesting and rewarding than it initially seems, with Allen looking at a number of weighty psychological themes and uncomfortable personal questions in a way that, regardless of its flaws, eventually makes for an intelligent and captivating drama.
