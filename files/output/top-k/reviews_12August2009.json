The man can even end a film with this looming microphone swinging in the distance, and it seems more like art than what is released today. My favorite director\/actor, Welles proved once and again that what lurks in the shadows are men, and their spirits are more sinister than anything a horror film could produce. Being an avid fan of Citizen Kane, I wanted to experience more - and that is where The Magnificent Ambersons comes into play. Surprisingly, I didn't even know anything about the drama behind this film. I wasn't privy to the knowledge that the studio burned most of Welles' 113 minute long cut, and instead kept with this 88-minute version ... which ... in my eyes ... is still a powerful film. I didn't know he didn't have much say over the final results, and instead, was left with a choppy, studio- driven version that left a soured note in his eye. Oh, the drama. Yet, here it is - found on VHS for now, this was a powerful film about the turn of the century, the introduction to modern technology, and the depression of the status quo. Oddly, created in 1942, this film seems more relevant today - with the current economic distress - and making the overall experience a powerful Welles outing.I would first like to say that any film that focuses on a central character getting his come-uppances, is already going to receive high marks. Secondly, narration by Welles himself - guess I asked for a second scoop of cinematic pleasure. The only downside was that Welles should have played the role of George. I completely understand that he didn't want another Kane looming in the distance, but he obviously pulled a Woody Allen trick, where he wasn't the lead role, but had the actor take his mannerisms. Ergo, he was in the film. With that small element aside, the narration did add a rather strong voice to this film. Giving us an everyman's town, a place not unlike where we all live now, with the wealthy experiencing the same issues many of us see daily. That is what pulled my strings the most with The Magnificent Ambersons was Welles' ability to pull such an ordinary event into the view of this wealthy family. We see these things happen all the time with average couples in film, so it was a distinction to see it happen to the wealthy Ambersons. This story is simple, and I am eager to read Booth Tarkington's version as well, just to see what Welles left out.

The man can even end a film with this looming microphone swinging in the distance, and it seems more like art than what is released today. My favorite director\/actor, Welles proved once and again that what lurks in the shadows are men, and their spirits are more sinister than anything a horror film could produce. Being an avid fan of Citizen Kane, I wanted to experience more - and that is where The Magnificent Ambersons comes into play. Surprisingly, I didn't even know anything about the drama behind this film. I wasn't privy to the knowledge that the studio burned most of Welles' 113 minute long cut, and instead kept with this 88-minute version ... which ... in my eyes ... is still a powerful film. I didn't know he didn't have much say over the final results, and instead, was left with a choppy, studio- driven version that left a soured note in his eye. Oh, the drama. Yet, here it is - found on VHS for now, this was a powerful film about the turn of the century, the introduction to modern technology, and the depression of the status quo. Oddly, created in 1942, this film seems more relevant today - with the current economic distress - and making the overall experience a powerful Welles outing.I would first like to say that any film that focuses on a central character getting his come-uppances, is already going to receive high marks. Secondly, narration by Welles himself - guess I asked for a second scoop of cinematic pleasure. The only downside was that Welles should have played the role of George. I completely understand that he didn't want another Kane looming in the distance, but he obviously pulled a Woody Allen trick, where he wasn't the lead role, but had the actor take his mannerisms. Ergo, he was in the film. With that small element aside, the narration did add a rather strong voice to this film. Giving us an everyman's town, a place not unlike where we all live now, with the wealthy experiencing the same issues many of us see daily. That is what pulled my strings the most with The Magnificent Ambersons was Welles' ability to pull such an ordinary event into the view of this wealthy family. We see these things happen all the time with average couples in film, so it was a distinction to see it happen to the wealthy Ambersons. This story is simple, and I am eager to read Booth Tarkington's version as well, just to see what Welles left out.

But now that I'm older, it's easy to see that this movie is a complete mess. Rather then picking up where we left off with The Dream Child, everything is avoided for this disaster. After no build up, we're shown Freddy again within the first couple minutes, flying on a broom like the wicked witch from Wizard of Oz, oohhhhhh scary...then we see him driving a tour bus No screaming while the bus is in motion. Yup, easy to tell, this is going to be a long ugly ride.So this takes place 10 years in to the future, from 1991, so I guess it's suppose to take place in 2001, and all the Springwood children have been killed...by Freddy of course. Not exactly how we remember things from the last entry. There is one remaining Elm Street child who is forced in to a halfway house\/shelter by Freddy (lol). And this last survivor seems to have amnesia after hitting his head on a rock, so he can't remember anything about his past or where he came from, all he knows is if he falls asleep, he ain't waking up. Of course there are other kids at the shelter, and they become wrapped up in to things shortly after.There is also a twist added for this one, as the story just isn't strong enough without it. This twist being that Freddy has a daughter, and she works at the same shelter where this John Doe is now staying! To help him remember his past, Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane as Freddy's Daughter) brings him back to Springwood, which is basically a ghost town now since all the children were murdered and families moved away. While on the way there, we find that 3 kids from the shelter were hiding in the back of the van, so it looks like they're a part of the team now.This movie really pushes the limits on the gimmicks as there are tons of cameos from Roseanne, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper. The only one I didn't mind seeing was Johnny Depp, as he was one of Freddy's original victims, back when Freddy was a monster and not a comedian. Speaking of Freddy as a comedian, there's really no other way to describe him in this. He lost everything that made him scary, and does nothing but bust jokes, unfunny ones at that. This is Freddy at Rock bottom.There's only one good death scene, and that being Carlos' (Ricky Dean Logan) who happens to be deaf. Freddy gives him a custom hearing aid, that is ultra sensitive to noise, and Freddy makes as much ruckus as possible until Carlos' head completely blows up. Then there's the video game death of Spencer (Breckin Meyer), where he's sucked in to the television and Freddy controls him through his power glove (oh jeez). I don't know what I was on as a kid, but I use to consider that as one of my favorite deaths, now it's almost unbearable to watch. And the sound effects when his body is bouncing around the house is just pathetic. One death, that I was surprised about, was the death of our John Doe. At least, the makers had some balls by doing this as he was one of the leads throughout the first half of the movie.This movie also acts as bit of a prequel, showing some of Freddy's home life before he was burned alive. We shown this as Freddy lets the viewers know It's Traveling time! Thanks for the update Freddy! At least it's good to see Robert Englund without the make-up for a bit, since the plastic he wears throughout is just horrible.Oh, I almost forgot about the 3D gimmick. It's just terrible, as we see Maggie wear the cardboard glasses and we're shown ridiculous special effects like the dream sperm demons who gave the Freddy the power who control Nightmares. I never really liked this idea, as I feel it makes the series seem cheap. Should have brought in the Dream Police or whatever else they had planned because this simply didn't work.So Maggie must bring Freddy in to the real world to defeat him. Not a bad idea, but it worked much better in the original and FVJ. His death in this one just didn't work for me, a few ninja stars (ya, ninja stars) and a bomb to the chest finishes him off, really running out of ideas now arn't we. I did like the flashback of Freddy throughout the series once he is blown up, a nice touch. Kinda sad how one of the things I like about this movie is when they show flashbacks of the other movies though.In conclusion, this is the low point in the series, and ended things weakly. Thank God, we were given New Nightmare, as this was the wrong way to go out and should have never been made. It's a Freddy movie for kids...er...for when I was a kid, I doubt the kids of today would even appreciate this. This movie does take me back, but with that said, it should be left there.

I still only consider it to be about average, but that's a lot better then what I use to call it. Well, Freddy is back, and he wants revenge! Robert Englund does a phenomenal job once again as our favorite Christmas sweatered maniac. The rest of the cast, not so much. This time around we focus on Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton), a young lad who has moved in to a new home with his family, and guess who's former home it use to be, dun dun dun...So inevitably, Freddy starts terrorizing the fresh meat. Stalking him through his dreams, while slowly taking control over his body You've got the body...I've got the brain. The first nightmare we see, I must say is fairly well done. In this nightmare, we see Jesse on the school bus heading home with Robert Englund appearing in his normal form as the bus driver (nice!). They go on a little off road field trip, as our innocent bus driver becomes Freddy, and gives our hero a lil' scare. Luckily Jesse wakes up, covered in sweat, screaming (...like a girl) just before Freddy can rip him to shreds. They definitely took this film in a different direction having a male lead in a slasher. Sometimes it's good to be different, but not in this case...As many already know, this movie has a heavy homo-erotic undertone, and in my opinion it does affect the movie in a not so positive way. Whether it's Jesse's all-star dance moves while cleaning his room, his high pitch screams, the gym teacher in the gay bar, the shower scene or the weird buddy buddy relationship between Jesse and high school friend Grady (Robert Rusler), it's pretty hard to deny that it's there. Over the years, I've somewhat learned to look past this and would suggest others to do the same to make it more enjoyable.This movie definitely breaks some of the rules created in the first film, such as things happening outside of dreams like the family budgie going haywire and exploding in mid-air (WTF!) and toasters catching fire, basically pure randomness. Well now that I think about it, the whole plot is breaking the rules, but this sequel was clearly rushed out quick-time but what can you do.One thing that I love about this movie is that Freddy is still scary, he has a few really great scenes in this, unfortunately they're too far in between. The scene where Freddy takes off his hat, pulls back his skin to reveal his brain is great, reminiscent of Freddy cutting off his fingers in the original. Then towards the end of the film, we're treated with a couple others like Freddy finally taking full control of Jesse and coming out from within, shedding the Jesse layer of skin before giving Grady a much deserved shanking. Then there's the pool party massacre with Freddy in the real world and not giving a damn, quite entertaining, although unrealistic to the rest of the series, as Freddy still seems to have some supernatural powers he's known for in nightmares.One major complaint I have with this film, is the conclusion, it's extremely anti-climatic. With Freddy having full control of things in the real world through Jesse, it's up to high-school crush\/girlfriend Lisa Webber(Kim Myers) to save him. She goes searching for Jesse\/Freddy at the old Powerplant, hence the boiler rooms always appearing in dreams (I guess Freddy must have really liked that job as that's the first place he goes while being in the real world). While making her way inside she must walk by guard dogs with human faces (hmm...The Unborn, not so original now are we). Once finding and confronting Freddy, they have the shortest chase ever, and right when he's about to kill her...he can't! Wanna know why? Because she loves Jesse too much and wants him back, so she kisses Freddy\/Jesse as her deathblow to the dream demon...er...reality demon...and that melts him...what an exhilarating finish, quite epic *rolls eyes*. It's pretty clear this film has it's faults, but at the same time, it does have some great Freddy moments thrown in there. At the end of the day, it's a really sub par sequel to an incredible original. A forgettable entry that is pretty much ignored through the rest of the series.

After reading through countless explanations and discussions on the topic, this is the simplest way I can make sense of it all***SPOILERS!***Due to some clerical error (caused by God, time-traveling aliens, who knows?) a jet engine was sent 28 days back in time, falling onto the Darko house with no explanation. This was not supposed to happen. The engine didn't belong in the past.What this did was create an unstable universe. In 28 days, when the jet made its flight, the universe would have two identical jet engines existing simultaneously. This would upset the time-space continuum and cause the universe to collapse upon itself.Donnie Darko was enlisted to save the universe. He had to make sure the jet engine in 28 days was sent back in time, thus resolving the time-space error.(Think about this in the life-cycle of the jet engine, it was built, it flew around a few times, on Oct. 30 it broke off and landed on Oct. 2, where it was retrieved. If Donnie hadn't sent it back in time, the engine would've stayed in Oct. 30 and Oct. 31, while the same engine also existed from crashing on Oct. 2. The one engine would become two duplicate engines for no reason. To keep one engine in the life cycle, the Oct. 30 engine had to be sent back in time to become the Oct. 2 engine. Confusing, I know...)Once the jet engine is sent back in time, the universe re-sets from the night the engine crashes. Everything that happened in the 28 days in the unstable universe is wiped away. The universe is stable now because the jet engine has a reason for appearing out of nowhere. That reason is because someone (Donnie) sent it from an alternate timeline. (Before it was just a sloppy goof by some 4th dimensional power, manipulating time-space.)Donnie didn't have to die to save the world, but saving the world likely meant that he would die. (Since the engine crashed into his bedroom.) Donnie was willing to make that sacrifice in order to save the world and to save Gretchen.Frank the bunny is kind of a time-traveling ghost. He's killed by Donnie on Oct. 29, but his ghost goes into the past to guide Donnie on his way.Why was Donnie chosen? Perhaps because he would've been killed in the accident, so he was easy to convince that the universe needed saving. If Donnie had died, maybe they'd have to find someone else to send the jet engine back in time. Or maybe there was something special about Donnie, and he needed to be saved in order for him to right the universe.But in the end, the engine crashes into Donnie's room on Oct. 2. Donnie is killed. Everything from the 28-day alternate timeline seems like déjà-vu. And an unexplainable jet engine is retrieved for further analysis. (Nobody knows what to make of it, but we know it came from another reality.)***END OF SPOILERS***It's still complicated. The Director's Cut supposedly dives much deeper (too deep?) into the sci-fi mythology behind everything. But I think I like the artistry of the original version better. The viewer isn't sure what's going on, even at the end. Is it real? Is he just crazy? What will happen in 28 days? It leaves some things open to interpretation.But I think DONNIE DARKO, in its original form, is a film with almost no answers. The ONLY way for anyone to know what director Richard Kelly was going for is to do research and read interviews, listen to commentaries, dive into the website, watch the Director's Cut, etc. I don't think you can make sense of the movie without an explanation from the filmmakers.The Director's Cut spells everything out, but the film becomes more of a crazy sci-fi flick than a dark mystery. Personally I prefer the original.Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager. He starts getting warnings about the end of the world and believes that he alone has the ability to prevent it. Influenced by an imaginary friend, Donnie's actions become destructive. Meanwhile he meets a girl, goes to therapy, and tries to unlock the mysteries of time travel.The movie is very complicated, and is clearly designed to be so. It's full of layers, from the psychological angle to the Christ-like symbolism. It's one of those movies with dozens of interpretations. A movie that allows people to see what they want to see. Often over-analyzed and possibly over-rated.I think it's a very interesting film, capturing a sense of mystery with storytelling artistry. The film might not make sense, but you can tell that it was crafted that way deliberately. The acting is very good and the movie sticks with you days later. I wouldn't call DONNIE DARKO the greatest movie ever, like some people, but it certainly is an interesting film.

After reading through countless explanations and discussions on the topic, this is the simplest way I can make sense of it all***SPOILERS!***Due to some clerical error (caused by God, time-traveling aliens, who knows?) a jet engine was sent 28 days back in time, falling onto the Darko house with no explanation. This was not supposed to happen. The engine didn't belong in the past.What this did was create an unstable universe. In 28 days, when the jet made its flight, the universe would have two identical jet engines existing simultaneously. This would upset the time-space continuum and cause the universe to collapse upon itself.Donnie Darko was enlisted to save the universe. He had to make sure the jet engine in 28 days was sent back in time, thus resolving the time-space error.(Think about this in the life-cycle of the jet engine, it was built, it flew around a few times, on Oct. 30 it broke off and landed on Oct. 2, where it was retrieved. If Donnie hadn't sent it back in time, the engine would've stayed in Oct. 30 and Oct. 31, while the same engine also existed from crashing on Oct. 2. The one engine would become two duplicate engines for no reason. To keep one engine in the life cycle, the Oct. 30 engine had to be sent back in time to become the Oct. 2 engine. Confusing, I know...)Once the jet engine is sent back in time, the universe re-sets from the night the engine crashes. Everything that happened in the 28 days in the unstable universe is wiped away. The universe is stable now because the jet engine has a reason for appearing out of nowhere. That reason is because someone (Donnie) sent it from an alternate timeline. (Before it was just a sloppy goof by some 4th dimensional power, manipulating time-space.)Donnie didn't have to die to save the world, but saving the world likely meant that he would die. (Since the engine crashed into his bedroom.) Donnie was willing to make that sacrifice in order to save the world and to save Gretchen.Frank the bunny is kind of a time-traveling ghost. He's killed by Donnie on Oct. 29, but his ghost goes into the past to guide Donnie on his way.Why was Donnie chosen? Perhaps because he would've been killed in the accident, so he was easy to convince that the universe needed saving. If Donnie had died, maybe they'd have to find someone else to send the jet engine back in time. Or maybe there was something special about Donnie, and he needed to be saved in order for him to right the universe.But in the end, the engine crashes into Donnie's room on Oct. 2. Donnie is killed. Everything from the 28-day alternate timeline seems like déjà-vu. And an unexplainable jet engine is retrieved for further analysis. (Nobody knows what to make of it, but we know it came from another reality.)***END OF SPOILERS***It's still complicated. The Director's Cut supposedly dives much deeper (too deep?) into the sci-fi mythology behind everything. But I think I like the artistry of the original version better. The viewer isn't sure what's going on, even at the end. Is it real? Is he just crazy? What will happen in 28 days? It leaves some things open to interpretation.But I think DONNIE DARKO, in its original form, is a film with almost no answers. The ONLY way for anyone to know what director Richard Kelly was going for is to do research and read interviews, listen to commentaries, dive into the website, watch the Director's Cut, etc. I don't think you can make sense of the movie without an explanation from the filmmakers.The Director's Cut spells everything out, but the film becomes more of a crazy sci-fi flick than a dark mystery. Personally I prefer the original.Donnie Darko is a troubled teenager. He starts getting warnings about the end of the world and believes that he alone has the ability to prevent it. Influenced by an imaginary friend, Donnie's actions become destructive. Meanwhile he meets a girl, goes to therapy, and tries to unlock the mysteries of time travel.The movie is very complicated, and is clearly designed to be so. It's full of layers, from the psychological angle to the Christ-like symbolism. It's one of those movies with dozens of interpretations. A movie that allows people to see what they want to see. Often over-analyzed and possibly over-rated.I think it's a very interesting film, capturing a sense of mystery with storytelling artistry. The film might not make sense, but you can tell that it was crafted that way deliberately. The acting is very good and the movie sticks with you days later. I wouldn't call DONNIE DARKO the greatest movie ever, like some people, but it certainly is an interesting film.
