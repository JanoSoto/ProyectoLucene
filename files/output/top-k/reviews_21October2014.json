Those movies that gather a lot of egotistical people together who are experts at a particular profession or activity and have them talk to one another as if they have been performing this profession\/activity from the time they could crawl. They talk in a lot of jargon, they usually insult one another in fun, there is usually one argument that almost comes to blows and most of the time there is a legendary crazy old coot famous for being, well -- a legendary crazy old coot. These movies usually supply a large company of stock characters including the seasoned expert, the good looking hero (who has usually lost a legendary relative, most often dear old Dad), the beer-guzzling party animal, the beautiful sidekick\/love interest, somebody's brother (99% of the time he doesn't make it) and of course the usual no-name actor just thrown in so that he can die in a display of spectacular stunt work.I have seen this formula applied to firefighters ('Backdraft'), air traffic controllers ('Pushing Tin'), navy pilots ('Top Gun'), stock car racers ('Days of Thunder'), surfers ('Point Break'), yacht racing champs ('Wind'), storm chasers ('Twister'), Alpine skiers ('Aspen Extreme') etc., etc., etc. They aren't exactly people that you would want to be around as an amateur because as these movies usually go your death could be foretold even before you met them (If they are such experts then why do three-fourths of their crew die?).'Vertical Limit' supplies all of the stock characters and hurls them into a chaotic series of predictable tragedies each one seemingly designed to wipe out the supporting characters in the order of the actor's place on the Hollywood celebrity food chain. In other words, if most of the people in the audience know who the actor is then the longer that character's death will be delayed in the film's running time. If they have top billing, they make it out alive.The movie begins when Peter (Chris O'Donnell), his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and their father (Stuart Wilson) are rock climbing when an accident leaves them hanging from a rock with a clamp that is about to come loose and send all plunging to their deaths. Dad (at the bottom end of the rope) informs his son to cut him loose to lighten the load, which he does after some heated shouting.Three years later in the Himalayas a group of mountain climbers have gathered to see off a team who are about to go on an expedition despite warnings that a harsh storm could shift it's direction at a moment's notice. The two kids meet up just as Annie is about to head out with a famous gusto millionaire (Bill Paxton) and his cautious guide (Nicholas Lea). After the usual banter about turning back the three press on and barely miss getting swallowed up by an avalanche only to end up trapped in an ice cave. This provides the time-honored tradition of having people trapped together so that they can argue about the need to conserve supplies despite the fact that one of them is standing at death's door (for this person's identity, see which of these three actors you haven't heard of).Peter gathers a rescue team made up mostly of the aforementioned no-name actors so that we can watch them die according to the aforementioned Celebrity Death Meter. The expedition is lead by The Crazy Old Coot (Scott Glen) a long-haired mountain man with no toes whose wife's death leads to one of the most effectively bone chilling sights that I have seen in a movie in a long while. He leads Peter and crew up the mountain because he knows the mountain better than anyone. To make matters worse, the clock starts ticking for Annie as she contracts pulmonary edema.No time for plot development because the movie is too busy hurtling its characters from one crisis to another. The movie also adds a stupid plot device involving O'Donnell deciding to carry nitroglycerin so that he can blast open the area where his sister is trapped. The movie isn't kind enough to explain why they think that such an unstable, unpredictable chemical can be used to open the ice cave without causing an avalanche.The movie has the usual stuntwork with characters hanging by pick axes over precarious drops, having them swallowed up by avalanches and having them slide back down the mountain and trying to get hold with their axes. It does provide one fascinating piece of stunt work as the climbers have to climb out onto the leg of the helicopter, slide to the end and drop onto a ledge. I'm starting to count on one hand the number of movies that don't provide the chopper pilot the opportunity to shout 'I can't hold it!' 'Vertical Limit' reminded me of 'The Perfect Storm' a much better movie about people who put themselves in harm's way to save their own skins. The movie wasn't perfect but as least I felt like the sailors on that boat seemed to belong there and had individual personalities that carried them even when they made the wrong decision. They were played by actors that I knew but the way they played their characters made me believe that they actually lived life on the sea. The actors in 'Vertical Limit' just look like actors in front of a blue screen supplied for the movie's overblown stunt show. These characters may come on screen talking a lot of jargon about mountain climbing but it seems to me that most of their success comes from dumb luck.

Infused with a great deal of meta-writing to the point of intrigue, crafty ideas about the effects horror films have on those who make them, and darker, more terrifying portrayals of the film's beloved dream-haunter, New Nightmare revives the franchise that, according to Craven, was beginning to get too off-task with its practices.By this point, Craven had already expressed frustration over the fact that the character of Freddy Krueger had become far too comical, and the later films were written with far too much silliness, masking the true horror and fright he originally conceived for the series. Freddy had become cartoonish and lost his original abilities to frighten audiences as much as taunt them with silly phrases and ubiquity in pop culture. As a result, Craven created New Nightmare to give that life back to the franchise, and he did so in a way that explored a fascination with the concept of metafilm, or a movie that is referencing beyond the film into the real lives of the actors or to some other, unrelated film universe, as if the characters are wiser beyond their own definitive world.This fascination with metafilm Craven began to toy with would only get further explored in his critically\/financially-successful Scream franchise, which was brewed two years after New Nightmare. For now, however, Nightmare concerns itself with Heather Langenkamp, the actress who portrayed Nancy Thompson in the original Nightmare film, as she lives with her husband, who works in special effects, and young son in Los Angeles. Heather has gone onto receive a great deal of recognition for her as Nancy, and learns that Wes Craven is contemplating using her again for his forthcoming Nightmare project, which will further which will, of course, have Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy Kruger.In the mix of this, Heather begins experiencing lucid nightmares of her or her family being attacked and assaulted by Freddy and taken as his children, completely losing sense of reality. This is only furthered by the abundance of earthquakes Los Angeles is experiencing, as well as the constant stress she's under with managing her child and her other projects.Craven decorates New Nightmare much differently than the previous installments, most notably through the abundance of different costumes Freddy boasts, with one of the most stylish and menacing being a black and blue cloak. In addition, Englund is much less concerned with sloganeering and finding just the right punchline for his character Freddy than returning to the haunting and demonic presence Freddy can truly be. The idea of a figure haunting our dreams and finding ways of sneaking into our reality, distorting it, and leaving it at his mercy is a wickedly frightening idea, and Craven returns to the elements of exploring that idea rather than turning it into black comedy.New Nightmare can be quite eerie at times, but it also has a pleasantly subtle sense of sass to it, especially when Craven comes on-screen, or when one of Heather's costars tries to but in and help her out. This is where the Scream foundation ostensibly came into play, with Craven experimenting with self-referential humor in such a way that makes the film more interesting and not entirely consumed in its own cheeky ways. Combining these elements, especially in a way meant to evoke humor and make fans of a franchise recall moments from films past, could easily destruct in a big way, but Craven is so smooth with the incorporation of the aforementioned elements that we get the idea he had this idea festering in his mind long before he put the pen to the paper.Because evident care and thought went into Wes Craven's New Nightmare is likely why it plays like a unique horror film, quietly proposing ideas about those who work in the film industry, specifically making horror films, and what effect such work has on their psyche and their own personal lives. The tone is much more frightening, and given the seriousness and ambition Craven has for the material, the film feels much more sincere in ways the abundance of Nightmare sequels lacked, leaving this to be one of the most unlikely contenders for one of the strongest sequels to a horror film, especially trying something new this late in the game.Starring Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, and Miko Hughes.

Infused with a great deal of meta-writing to the point of intrigue, crafty ideas about the effects horror films have on those who make them, and darker, more terrifying portrayals of the film's beloved dream-haunter, New Nightmare revives the franchise that, according to Craven, was beginning to get too off-task with its practices.By this point, Craven had already expressed frustration over the fact that the character of Freddy Krueger had become far too comical, and the later films were written with far too much silliness, masking the true horror and fright he originally conceived for the series. Freddy had become cartoonish and lost his original abilities to frighten audiences as much as taunt them with silly phrases and ubiquity in pop culture. As a result, Craven created New Nightmare to give that life back to the franchise, and he did so in a way that explored a fascination with the concept of metafilm, or a movie that is referencing beyond the film into the real lives of the actors or to some other, unrelated film universe, as if the characters are wiser beyond their own definitive world.This fascination with metafilm Craven began to toy with would only get further explored in his critically\/financially-successful Scream franchise, which was brewed two years after New Nightmare. For now, however, Nightmare concerns itself with Heather Langenkamp, the actress who portrayed Nancy Thompson in the original Nightmare film, as she lives with her husband, who works in special effects, and young son in Los Angeles. Heather has gone onto receive a great deal of recognition for her as Nancy, and learns that Wes Craven is contemplating using her again for his forthcoming Nightmare project, which will further which will, of course, have Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy Kruger.In the mix of this, Heather begins experiencing lucid nightmares of her or her family being attacked and assaulted by Freddy and taken as his children, completely losing sense of reality. This is only furthered by the abundance of earthquakes Los Angeles is experiencing, as well as the constant stress she's under with managing her child and her other projects.Craven decorates New Nightmare much differently than the previous installments, most notably through the abundance of different costumes Freddy boasts, with one of the most stylish and menacing being a black and blue cloak. In addition, Englund is much less concerned with sloganeering and finding just the right punchline for his character Freddy than returning to the haunting and demonic presence Freddy can truly be. The idea of a figure haunting our dreams and finding ways of sneaking into our reality, distorting it, and leaving it at his mercy is a wickedly frightening idea, and Craven returns to the elements of exploring that idea rather than turning it into black comedy.New Nightmare can be quite eerie at times, but it also has a pleasantly subtle sense of sass to it, especially when Craven comes on-screen, or when one of Heather's costars tries to but in and help her out. This is where the Scream foundation ostensibly came into play, with Craven experimenting with self-referential humor in such a way that makes the film more interesting and not entirely consumed in its own cheeky ways. Combining these elements, especially in a way meant to evoke humor and make fans of a franchise recall moments from films past, could easily destruct in a big way, but Craven is so smooth with the incorporation of the aforementioned elements that we get the idea he had this idea festering in his mind long before he put the pen to the paper.Because evident care and thought went into Wes Craven's New Nightmare is likely why it plays like a unique horror film, quietly proposing ideas about those who work in the film industry, specifically making horror films, and what effect such work has on their psyche and their own personal lives. The tone is much more frightening, and given the seriousness and ambition Craven has for the material, the film feels much more sincere in ways the abundance of Nightmare sequels lacked, leaving this to be one of the most unlikely contenders for one of the strongest sequels to a horror film, especially trying something new this late in the game.Starring Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, and Miko Hughes.

I know it's a really unpopular opinion here but I really have been disappointed- since I like most Disney films.Now, shall I elaborate? Well, first of all, before I watched the movie I had really high expectations- it is being called a masterpiece, and I have heard more than once people saying it's one of Disney's best films- so perhaps because I had so high expectations- when they didn't even come near my expectations I was completely underwhelmed.So, let's begin with the good things. I like the animation. And though despite I prefer the one in Pinocchio and Snow White- it still was beautifully animated so I give it credit for that.I also like the winter and hunter parts, I really like the depiction of famine and the depiction of a loss was also really well made. Now, if only it was addressed and given more time- if only we would have seen the consequences and Bambi's struggle with how he should live with his loss- it could have been a great movie. And it is only 70 minutes long- obviously time wasn't a problem- it's a really short film!But, despite the great potential, what do we get in the rest of those 70 minutes? A bunch of cute creatures that I don't care about doing cute things I don't care about and then fall in love in a very forceful manner with female-cute-creatures I didn't care about.How can I connect with those characters? With the exception of the bunny, which is still not THAT developed but has something in him, non of them have actual personalities, especially Bambi, which, despite being the main character has no personality, nothing, just stereotype of a very romanticized kid, then teenager.This was a really wrong thing to do, instead of giving time to just cute creatures doing cute things and forceful love story, and instead Disney would have focused on Bambi's relation with his mother, especially in the famine, and then how he has to do without her- it could have been a very strong story.I would say that in this manner, it's a bit like if the Lion King wasn't well made... A prince creature, and his circle of life. But when in the Lion King, there was a lot of time for character development, and the plot centered mostly on the stronger elements and actually gave the characters personality, in here, there was no proper character development, the plot didn't ran smoothly and was very unbalanced, and with characters that lack independent personality and character development.Now, maybe kids can enjoy that- but I didn't. Maybe many others enjoy the movie because it has nostalgic value to them- but not for me as that is the first and probably only time I watched and will watch this film so I see it as it is.Now again, it's my very personal opinion- and though I sound very critical it's not that I hate the film or anything- and for little kids it can be a good thing to show. It's just that, I, personally felt it was one of Disney's weaker films and despite the film being only 70 minutes long, I looked at my watch several times.

It was also the first movie since Ben-Hur in 1959 to win 11 Oscars, which is the most. Since then, Titanic has become one of the most polar-opposing movies, as well as the second biggest as of now. (Avatar in 2009 is to thank.) The lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site. Even so, I still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site. Higher than Pulp Fiction or Vertigo? Maybe not, but you get my point. There are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect. Number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace. Old Rose (who tells the story) still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels that's where it belongs. Why not give it to a museum? Or feed a country? Then there is Jack and Rose's names being mentioned countless times. Some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue. But considering how many upsides this movie has, these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film, because all the positives erase the negatives.The story of Titanic is pretty much Romeo and Juliet on a ship. Jack is a poor, charming artist. Rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by Jack in every way. Romeo and Juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love, then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other. Yes Jack and Rose fall in love quickly, but there are no dumb suicides, so Jack and Rose are smarter there. People also criticize Rose's character as being a rich, spoiled girl who gets anything she wants. I for one, can relate to Rose's character. She struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money. Nobody understands her. She feels trapped. I can relate to Rose's feelings by her becoming what she does not want. Then Jack comes along who finally understands her. He gives her the courage to be what she wants. Jack is sensitive, patient, and fun. Sounds gay? Leo DiCaprio is such a good actor that he makes Jack seem real and cool. This is one of Leo's biggest powerhouse performances that still shines. Maybe Jack and Rose fell in love quickly, but if the ship did not sink, would they have gotten married right away? No. Just date for a few months then break up. If Jack would have lived, would they have gotten married? Maybe. Jack risked his life for Rose, and they did all they could to survive. Since they were part of such a huge impact on each other's lives, maybe they would marry. Maybe not. Not just Jack and Rose, but everybody is developed so well, you feel like you grew up with them. Very few movies feature character development this deep. Then the ship hits the iceberg. Titanic movies have been made that have all turned out well, but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion. The danger is high, sets are great, sympathy is drawn, etc. Then there is the score, which is so beautiful and so sad. It adds so much to the littlest things.People, mainly men, that don't like this think that they're too cool for it. Anybody that doesn't like this just fails at trying to be cool. Too close-minded to see into and beyond a love-story and too close-minded to see how good the song and score were. Maybe this is a fake story, don't try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink. The acting is extremely strong, characters are developed so well, the disaster scenes are played out excellently, the music is so haunting. Haters should continue watching NASCAR and Delta Force 2. 10\/10.

It was also the first movie since Ben-Hur in 1959 to win 11 Oscars, which is the most. Since then, Titanic has become one of the most polar-opposing movies, as well as the second biggest as of now. (Avatar in 2009 is to thank.) The lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site. Even so, I still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site. Higher than Pulp Fiction or Vertigo? Maybe not, but you get my point. There are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect. Number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace. Old Rose (who tells the story) still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels that's where it belongs. Why not give it to a museum? Or feed a country? Then there is Jack and Rose's names being mentioned countless times. Some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue. But considering how many upsides this movie has, these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film, because all the positives erase the negatives.The story of Titanic is pretty much Romeo and Juliet on a ship. Jack is a poor, charming artist. Rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by Jack in every way. Romeo and Juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love, then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other. Yes Jack and Rose fall in love quickly, but there are no dumb suicides, so Jack and Rose are smarter there. People also criticize Rose's character as being a rich, spoiled girl who gets anything she wants. I for one, can relate to Rose's character. She struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money. Nobody understands her. She feels trapped. I can relate to Rose's feelings by her becoming what she does not want. Then Jack comes along who finally understands her. He gives her the courage to be what she wants. Jack is sensitive, patient, and fun. Sounds gay? Leo DiCaprio is such a good actor that he makes Jack seem real and cool. This is one of Leo's biggest powerhouse performances that still shines. Maybe Jack and Rose fell in love quickly, but if the ship did not sink, would they have gotten married right away? No. Just date for a few months then break up. If Jack would have lived, would they have gotten married? Maybe. Jack risked his life for Rose, and they did all they could to survive. Since they were part of such a huge impact on each other's lives, maybe they would marry. Maybe not. Not just Jack and Rose, but everybody is developed so well, you feel like you grew up with them. Very few movies feature character development this deep. Then the ship hits the iceberg. Titanic movies have been made that have all turned out well, but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion. The danger is high, sets are great, sympathy is drawn, etc. Then there is the score, which is so beautiful and so sad. It adds so much to the littlest things.People, mainly men, that don't like this think that they're too cool for it. Anybody that doesn't like this just fails at trying to be cool. Too close-minded to see into and beyond a love-story and too close-minded to see how good the song and score were. Maybe this is a fake story, don't try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink. The acting is extremely strong, characters are developed so well, the disaster scenes are played out excellently, the music is so haunting.

It's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup. And yet - incredibly - Forrest Gump truly works. It is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century America. And while one would be quick to point to director Robert Zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps Eric Roth's screenplay, or even Winston Groom's book upon which the film is based, I think the reason this film works, is because of Tom Hank's legendary performance as the title character.Forrest Gump is a slow-witted Alabama native. But indeed, he has extraordinary talent, and an intriguing life story to tell to whoever will sit next to him at the bus-stop. Despite being embraced by - seemingly - everyone, Forrest Gump actually fared less well than critics. It holds a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a good score, but not a great one. This is largely because Forrest Gump will not appeal to the cynical. And Lord knows that film critics get enough hate as it is, but there's simply no two ways about it Film critics, generally speaking, are more cynical than the average movie-goer. Those willing to accept the occasionally preposterous nature of the film and the sometimes cloying sentimental tone will find a lot to enjoy. But if you've never quite cottoned to the sappier efforts of Steven Spielberg or renaissance Disney, you may find Forrest Gump to be an eternal 142 minutes.One of the problems with Forrest Gump is that the film goes to exceedingly great lengths to make Forrest as endearing and likable as possible. And honestly, it wasn't necessary; he's already a likable character. Additionally, Forrest Gump just seems to be an expert at everything. When we learn he's an incredibly fast runner, we buy that. But after we learn he's incredible at putting guns together, playing ping-pong, etc., things get a little stale.On top of that, Forrest Gump also has a running gag in which Forrest turns out to be the originator of several pop culture staples, from one of Elvis Presley's dance moves, to the creator of the smiley face, etc. Forrest Gump spends so much time winking at the audience, one begins to ponder the likelihood of contracting an eye-lid blister.In spite of the film's many problems, however, Forrest Gump is a good film, largely thanks to Tom Hanks. His performance adds an element of genuineness and sincerity to the picture, thus balancing the syrupy sap. On paper, the Forrest Gump character comes off as cloying, but when you see Tom Hanks portray this character, it not only works, it comes to life. This is not a case of a great performance making a decent film worth seeing. This is a great performance that elevates everything surrounding it. It gives the movie a classy nature that makes the sentiment feel earned.There are genuine moments of beauty and grace. In fact, some sequences are almost stunningly beautiful. When the film eases back a little on the sweetness, it has an old-fashioned appeal to it, and an unmistakable charm in the aesthetics of the picture.The visual effects are superb. Forrest Gump seamlessly blends with the archival footage in an effect that still holds up today. Even more impressive - to my eyes, anyway - is the effect used for a character who has lost his legs in the war, and must function without them.I've already praised Hanks' performance, but the rest of the cast is worth noting too. Robin Wright plays Forrest's love interest, Jenny, in a more serious role. She captures the depth of the character, and is never as annoying as she might have been in less capable hands. Gary Sinise as Dan Taylor delivers a performance that's absolutely marvelous, and even giving Hanks a bit of a run for his money. Sinise's performance is powerful and gripping. Sally Fields portrays the most charming of the cast, Forrest's mother, in a sweet but memorable supporting role. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna R. Hall portray young Forrest and young Jenny respectively in excellent child performances.Alan Silvestri's score is very pretty, but it receives an absurdly little amount of screen time. It gets two major appearances (other than the credits), and that is the very beginning, and the very end. You hardly hear it at all the rest of the film, which is largely populated with obnoxious, time-period- accurate, pop and rock songs. While they are interesting from a stylistic point of view, they are simply atrocious from a musical one. They end up stealing a lot of screen time that would have been better served by Silvestri's much more palatable musical score.Forrest Gump is heavily flawed, but it has some wonderful moments. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life, and despite too much sweetness at times, the film is a real charmer. The acting is great, the screenplay is great, the score is great, and the characters are great. The over- sentimentality brings the film down a bit at times, but it's hard to imagine that too many people would leave Forrest Gump without feeling at least a little better about life.

This was the film that made Hitchcock.The streets of London are wild with fear as a crazed killer who calls himself The Avenger waylays young blondes. But all is well at the Bunting household, with pretty blonde daughter Daisy lining up a marriage with a police detective and a new free-spending lodger taking their spare room. But the lodger's habit of going out on the nights when The Avenger strikes, coupled with his apparent interest in Daisy, makes for an uncomfortable journey into fear.The things with Hitchcock that made him great are on display here, his ability to keep you guessing, create twisted rooting interest, and find humor in suspense. June Tripp (billed just as June in the credits, as it was her stage name) plays Daisy with that playful capriciousness Hitch loved from his leading ladies.But The Lodger is more than a calling card for cinematic greatness to come. It's a fine piece of film in its own right, stylistically unique from its opening shot of a woman's face in close-up as she registers the shock of her imminent murder. Rather than allow us to see the killer, the film then moves us into a sequence showing the media taking hold of the story, a scene reminiscent of David Fincher's Zodiac for the way the tumult and not the crime becomes our focus.Always happens Tuesdays, that's my lucky day, a busy paper-seller comments cheerfully about the crime.Ivor Novello as the Lodger is a wonderfully beguiling figure, beauty etched with despair. He always seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown, yet somehow resilient as photographed by Gaetano di Ventimiglia as a kind of saintly Nosferatu. Look at him one way and you think How could he be... Look at him another and you think How could he be anyone else?Hitchcock and screenwriter Eliot Stannard play with this aspect of the story, and with Novello as such an appealing man of mystery, work up an interesting duality around him, which is best personified by the supporting role of the detective, played with deceptive subtlety by Malcolm Keen.The detective, Joe, is a bully and a lout, and not much of a cop. He suspects the lodger early, but it's not clear whether this is from instinct or jealousy when he sees how Daisy has taken to the new guest. When Joe rounds on the lodger, our thoughts, like Daisy's, are likely to favor the lodger as the injured party. But if he's the Avenger, shouldn't we root for Joe?That's another Hitch calling card, of course, the police, almost always ineffectual or hostile. Here it rises above a trope in a riveting conclusion that helps make The Lodger unforgettable.I do agree with some of the criticism of the film being slow; it did seem that way especially the first time I saw it. But with every subsequent viewing, I found myself being more pulled in by every scene, despite now knowing how it turns out. That's another Hitch trademark, the good film that gets better when you see it again and again. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2014","score":"","review":" Alfred Hitchcock made many great films.

Rather than allow us to see the killer, the film then moves us into a sequence showing the media taking hold of the story, a scene reminiscent of David Fincher's Zodiac for the way the tumult and not the crime becomes our focus.Always happens Tuesdays, that's my lucky day, a busy paper-seller comments cheerfully about the crime.Ivor Novello as the Lodger is a wonderfully beguiling figure, beauty etched with despair. He always seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown, yet somehow resilient as photographed by Gaetano di Ventimiglia as a kind of saintly Nosferatu. Look at him one way and you think How could he be... Look at him another and you think How could he be anyone else?Hitchcock and screenwriter Eliot Stannard play with this aspect of the story, and with Novello as such an appealing man of mystery, work up an interesting duality around him, which is best personified by the supporting role of the detective, played with deceptive subtlety by Malcolm Keen.The detective, Joe, is a bully and a lout, and not much of a cop. He suspects the lodger early, but it's not clear whether this is from instinct or jealousy when he sees how Daisy has taken to the new guest. When Joe rounds on the lodger, our thoughts, like Daisy's, are likely to favor the lodger as the injured party. But if he's the Avenger, shouldn't we root for Joe?That's another Hitch calling card, of course, the police, almost always ineffectual or hostile. Here it rises above a trope in a riveting conclusion that helps make The Lodger unforgettable.I do agree with some of the criticism of the film being slow; it did seem that way especially the first time I saw it. But with every subsequent viewing, I found myself being more pulled in by every scene, despite now knowing how it turns out. That's another Hitch trademark, the good film that gets better when you see it again and again.

This was the film that made Hitchcock.The streets of London are wild with fear as a crazed killer who calls himself The Avenger waylays young blondes. But all is well at the Bunting household, with pretty blonde daughter Daisy lining up a marriage with a police detective and a new free-spending lodger taking their spare room. But the lodger's habit of going out on the nights when The Avenger strikes, coupled with his apparent interest in Daisy, makes for an uncomfortable journey into fear.The things with Hitchcock that made him great are on display here, his ability to keep you guessing, create twisted rooting interest, and find humor in suspense.

Batman, Karate Kid Part III, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbuster 2, Honey I Shrunk the Kids, License to Kill, Back to the Future Part II, Christmas Vacation, The Wizard, there were many movies that year I really anticipated. My friends and I spent hours on our Nintendo, Sega and even that ditzy early Gameboy system.Say Anything..., was not one of the movies I looked forward to or even remember hearing about. I don't even remember any of my friends talking about this flick. Now granted I was a young kid, but not a little kid, I was in 8th grade and 13 through most of the year, turned 14 in December. I started high school in the fall of 1989 and I don't even remember *anyone* ahead of me talking about this movie. Not. One. Single. Person. What happened? Why did I miss this supposedly great teen movie? Flash forward to the 2000s when 80s nostalgia is rampant, suddenly this film is on the top of everyone's lists as some sort of life altering game changer. Huh? Why didn't this pop up on my radar? I remember Weird Science, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Lost Boys, License to Drive, but Say Anything...,just wasn't one of them. I even remember adult romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally, but again not Say Anything...Is there anyone else close to my age that never saw this movie? I've spent years avoiding this supposedly great film from the last year of the 80s b\/c I've always felt like some super weirdo for being old enough and being in the right demographic to know about Say Anything...but never watching it or never EVEN HEARING ABOUT IT till the early 2000s when 80s nostalgia documentaries would air on VH1 or something.OK I finally picked this up on Blu-ray and I'm going to finally get around watching this long admired film that slipped past my radar in a popcorn movie obsessed year of 1989. Just by the clips I've seen over the years and the cover art, there was no way in hell this film could have competed with any of the other flicks I mentioned for the person I was at that time. Go to the arcades and play the Ninja Turtle game or watch a movie about people in college in a sappy chick flick? And yes I did venture out of my usual circle of friends occasionally back then too, in the fall of 1989 and the spring of 1990 I took some classes with people older then me and did a summer camp in both 1989 and 1990 with people even 4 or 5 years older then me. NOBODY back then talked about this film. Not even the girls. It almost feels like around the early 2000s everybody decided to retcon what they watched and voted Say Anything... as THE movie that changed their lives in 1989.Plus look at how dead this message board is. If this was truly a beloved 80s movie, it would be as jumping as Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, or Karate Kid. So if you're currently a kid of the 2010s reading this, just remember this movie is way over-hyped, not everyone watched this or even heard about this little chick flick.

After all, there has never been an example in motion picture history which has affected the viewers as strongly as this film did for many fainted, threw up or went hysteric in a manner unlike anything witnessed before or after it.Looking back now, countless imitations & parodies over the years might have diminished its scare factor by a great deal but there's no denying that even today The Exorcist remains in a league of its own & is yet to find an equal. Succeeding not just as a genre-defining tale of demonic possession but also as a remarkable piece of superb storytelling with great character build-up & groundbreaking special effects, The Exorcist is very possibly the gold standard of horror filmmaking.Based on the novel of the same name, the story of The Exorcist takes place in the Georgetown area of Washington D.C. & concerns the 12-year old daughter of a famous actress, who begins manifesting some strangely disturbing behavioural changes in her personality. When science fails to offer any rational explanation, her mother turns to superstition in a desperate attempt to save her daughter's life & enlists the help of a troubled priest, who is struggling with his own faith.Directed by William Friedkin, the film opens with one of the most powerful, sinister & perfectly crafted prologues which apart from serving as a warning for things to come also sets up an extremely eerie mood for the rest of the film. Friedkin's work here is perhaps the finest of his career as the extent to which the director went in order to bring out the best from his cast & crew is well documented plus he left no stone unturned to make the experience as emotionally shattering as possible.The screenplay is penned down by William Peter Blatty, the author of the novel, and it is expertly balanced in all storytelling aspects. Cinematography makes brilliant use of slow zooms, panning, close-ups & sharp focus to immerse viewers into its demonic tale, use of music is effectively carried out, make-up & special effects end up adding a whole new chapter to filmmaking manuals and as far as editing goes, it paces the film ingeniously but is also marred by heavy amount of continuity errors.Coming to the performances, The Exorcist features a talented cast in Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow & Lee J. Cobb. One amazing thing here is that the characters are wonderfully fleshed out in the script & the actors simply build their act on an already solid platform, delivering some high quality performances. Each character is properly introduced, their arc is elegantly handled & unlike most horror films of today, we do grow to care for these fictional lives on the screen.What continues to separate The Exorcist from most examples of its genre is that despite its extensive gore effects & disturbing premise, the main emphasis remains on telling a story rather than revel in its extremity, which ultimately makes the final showdown all the more bone- chilling & unforgettable. The horror it unleashes is absolutely brutal, difficult to watch & too heavy in content yet the extent to which this film pushed the boundary of horror cinema by exploring subjects no one before ever dared to venture in is no mere feat in itself.On an overall scale, The Exorcist is one of the most influential, unnerving & faith-shattering films ever made which opened the doors to our deepest fears back when it was released and is still capable of surprising the newcomers with its discomforting ambiance & themes, if not the now dated visceral horror. Immortal for its contribution to cinema & pop culture, memorable for the mass hysteria it caused, and admirable for its uncompromising & undeniably effective take on demonic possession, the scariest film of all time comes strongly recommended.

When experienced screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz collaborated with Welles on a screenplay originally called The American, it was going to be based on the life of Willaim Randolph Hearst. Hearst in his time had put together an empire of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news services. To top it all off over his achievements and successes, he then built to himself the flamboyant mansion of San Simeon; a castle that only came to be furnished by rummaging through the remains of numerous countries. What more can be said about this milestone in cinematic history that has not been said to death? I, in turn, will continue to do so thus. Let's take a look.In retrospect of this phenomenal film full of depth and physical manifestation, Orson Welles' tour de force 1941 masterpiece 'Citizen Kane' indeed earns the rights to be regarded as the greatest movie ever made due to its magnificent themes, metaphors and camera angles. Here, we meet William Randolph Hearst (a twenty-five year old Welles), a newspaper tycoon who eventually metamorphoses into an aging, lonely old man with hardly a spark left for a soul. Hearst was the Ted Turner, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet of his day, encompassed and ensnared in an egocentric oasis. The aftermath of Hearst had effects on both the movie and Orson Welles' career by engaging the viewer into a world where power and greed can eventually lead into emptiness and depravity. Hearst and the character of Charles Foster Kane diminish slowly together on a long, sorrowing note, ending their lives with a somewhat similar void that could never be gained back. His dying word Rosebud (an extreme close-up of his giant rubbery lips before releasing a snow globe that crashes to the floor) encapsulates and summarizes his very existence as a man of power has every aspect and viewpoint snatched from his once-iron clutches. A news reel obituary News On The March tells the life story of Kane, as one of the viewers, a reporter named Jerry Thompson (William Alland, a thankless role in which we never see his face) is tasked to discover the meaning behind that last puzzling word uttered Rosebud via interviewing friends and associates of the now-deceased magnate. We then sojourn through memories and hauting shadows of the past of a once wealthy man with a hollow existence, echoing that from promising beginnings with newspapers to that of the abandoned Xanadu. Through vivid memory and recollections, we go back to when, as a boy, we see he was taken east to a boarding school, losing security, hope and innocence all too soon by his parent's forbidding choice for a promising future (his mother played by Agnes Moorehead). This role would be played throughout he spectrum of his whole life, leaving him completely drained of something he lost and could never gain again. An example being when tries to make his mistress and second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) an opera star, only as the camera pans up to a stagehand above holding his nose. Kane had spoken and entertained millions, but as his life came to a close, he died alone in his enormous and luxurious palatial estate in Xanadu that had died along with him, surrounded by priceless artifacts from around the globe that he could never take to the grave excepting a single untouchable source his own inner turmoil. A vast palace of great and powerful splendor was now an empty shell, along with its now deceased and powerless owner. Kane may have died in the picture nonetheless, but Orson Welles' unforgettable portrayal of him and his directorial debut boosted his career even higher to continue on to making more wonderful films.The metaphors in this film are very clear for someone with a keen and observant eye. It is these bravura moments that truly capture the essence of the picture itself. For example, when Kane is sitting with his first wife at the dinner table, the camera shows a newspaper headline and then goes back to them. As this goes on, we see them separating more and more from each other as a new headline appears. It is showing the viewer on where their relationship is going and how it is going to end estranged with nothing but a large gap between them. Another moment is when Kane is alone in his darkened, barren office talking with an inebriated Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten). Here the camera angle is show looking up at them from the ground, implying a defeated Kane feeling as hollow as the newspaper room in which he works. A third example is when we see the many Kane reflected through the parallel mirrors, each one the same shape and persona.

When experienced screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz collaborated with Welles on a screenplay originally called The American, it was going to be based on the life of Willaim Randolph Hearst. Hearst in his time had put together an empire of newspapers, radio stations, magazines and news services.

What more can be said about this milestone in cinematic history that has not been said to death? I, in turn, will continue to do so thus. Let's take a look.In retrospect of this phenomenal film full of depth and physical manifestation, Orson Welles' tour de force 1941 masterpiece 'Citizen Kane' indeed earns the rights to be regarded as the greatest movie ever made due to its magnificent themes, metaphors and camera angles. Here, we meet William Randolph Hearst (a twenty-five year old Welles), a newspaper tycoon who eventually metamorphoses into an aging, lonely old man with hardly a spark left for a soul. Hearst was the Ted Turner, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet of his day, encompassed and ensnared in an egocentric oasis. The aftermath of Hearst had effects on both the movie and Orson Welles' career by engaging the viewer into a world where power and greed can eventually lead into emptiness and depravity. Hearst and the character of Charles Foster Kane diminish slowly together on a long, sorrowing note, ending their lives with a somewhat similar void that could never be gained back. His dying word Rosebud (an extreme close-up of his giant rubbery lips before releasing a snow globe that crashes to the floor) encapsulates and summarizes his very existence as a man of power has every aspect and viewpoint snatched from his once-iron clutches. A news reel obituary News On The March tells the life story of Kane, as one of the viewers, a reporter named Jerry Thompson (William Alland, a thankless role in which we never see his face) is tasked to discover the meaning behind that last puzzling word uttered Rosebud via interviewing friends and associates of the now-deceased magnate. We then sojourn through memories and hauting shadows of the past of a once wealthy man with a hollow existence, echoing that from promising beginnings with newspapers to that of the abandoned Xanadu. Through vivid memory and recollections, we go back to when, as a boy, we see he was taken east to a boarding school, losing security, hope and innocence all too soon by his parent's forbidding choice for a promising future (his mother played by Agnes Moorehead). This role would be played throughout he spectrum of his whole life, leaving him completely drained of something he lost and could never gain again. An example being when tries to make his mistress and second wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore) an opera star, only as the camera pans up to a stagehand above holding his nose. Kane had spoken and entertained millions, but as his life came to a close, he died alone in his enormous and luxurious palatial estate in Xanadu that had died along with him, surrounded by priceless artifacts from around the globe that he could never take to the grave excepting a single untouchable source his own inner turmoil. A vast palace of great and powerful splendor was now an empty shell, along with its now deceased and powerless owner. Kane may have died in the picture nonetheless, but Orson Welles' unforgettable portrayal of him and his directorial debut boosted his career even higher to continue on to making more wonderful films.The metaphors in this film are very clear for someone with a keen and observant eye. It is these bravura moments that truly capture the essence of the picture itself. For example, when Kane is sitting with his first wife at the dinner table, the camera shows a newspaper headline and then goes back to them. As this goes on, we see them separating more and more from each other as a new headline appears. It is showing the viewer on where their relationship is going and how it is going to end estranged with nothing but a large gap between them. Another moment is when Kane is alone in his darkened, barren office talking with an inebriated Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten). Here the camera angle is show looking up at them from the ground, implying a defeated Kane feeling as hollow as the newspaper room in which he works. A third example is when we see the many Kane reflected through the parallel mirrors, each one the same shape and persona. It is here that Kane is who he is, which will always be his enigma for the people he knew as for himself.This spectacular masterpiece should not be missed by anyone.

Through the eyes of one film producer. In a way I think that Hollywood has never really talked much about the 'whats and the wherefores' of that particular war, in any of its films-even in the iconic 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Which is the best of the bunch of Vietnam War movies. In Platoon you get a fairly predictable depiction of soldiers who would rather be partying, struggling through hip deep swamps and cutting their way through dense packed jungle-hunted at all times and none too happy about it. None of the films about Vietnam mentions the ongoing US space program that just happened to happen at the exact same time as the Vietnam War. I wouldn't be impressed with the space program if I was lying down in mud, in the rain, in clothes that haven't been washed for a month, in order to avoid getting my head blown off by a bunch of people I'd never laid eyes on before, in a country I never had any interest in. I think the feelings of patriotism that followed the initial US decision to enter into a ground war in Vietnam in 1965 faded rapidly when the bodies stated coming home. By the thousands. This movie is a slice of life during the Vietnam War but its conspicuous avoidance of mentioning the ongoing US space program-which would have been on peoples minds-is 'selective memory' on the part of the scriptwriting. It wasn't that bad-it was 'very much worse', in my humble opinion. Few haven't seen this film by now.
