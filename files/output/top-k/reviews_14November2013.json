The problem is a robot has been invented and has taken her form and is stirring up trouble to cause death to all the workers.The film is completely out there. I didn't know what to expect from this film. The movie was made in 1927. It is a silent movie... one of the classics that you can see the characters talking and then a card comes up with the dialogue on. I thought I would hate this as I have not seen many films like this, but it was actually a good movie.This is an original sci-fi film. Unfortunately the movie is not complete. There are frames and scenes that have been either lost or destroyed over the years. The film has been patched together really well and you wouldn't notice too much.It is unbelievable how good the effects are for the age. They are not brilliant, but if I watched it back in 1927 I would think that the effects were out of this world. The film is so well made. Fritz Lang had such an amazing vision for this film and made it with passion. Even to this day, some of the camera angles and some of the shots that were used in this film is amazing. It is a very good looking movie and a lot of fun to watch.The acting is terrible... but as I said before, this is a silent movie so the actors are playing visually. If they didn't act over the top, it would not be anywhere near as good as it is. The best actress in the movie for me was Brigitte Helm. She had multiple roles in this movie, and she was really scary in some of them. She was by far the best cast member of this movie. Other cast members were Alfred Abel, Gustav Frohlich, Rudolph Klein- Rogge & Fritz Rasp. The make up the male actors had to wear was awful. The pasty white faces and the lipstick was so over the top, but this is how it was back then.The story is really good, but in places it is very slow. This film is very visual and so in places you are just looking at the scenery and the futuristic setting that the film is set in. That is not a bad thing, but I thought that it had slightly too much scenery as you could tell that a lot of it was reused over and over again.The music score was very good. The orchestra that played for that movie did a fantastic job. The music was perfect for the story and in places very powerful.This film is a massive breakthrough in film history and I am glad that I have seen it!I will give this film 8 out of 10.Come!

It was a film that had enough impact on my very young mind to make Spider-Man my second favorite superhero, right behind the Caped Crusader himself. I loved this film as a kid, almost as much as Jack Nicholson's outing as the Joker in the original 1989 Batman film, and watching Spider-Man again and again as I grew older has only made me appreciate it's spectacle even more. For one thing, the special effects were top notch for the early 2000s and, for the most part, hold up very well today. That is, aside from the very early 2000s video game-esque crawling spider and spinning DNA strand intro animations, which I can't give them too much trash for because they are certainly not an integral part of the film, and I think they were going for a stylized, comic book appearance anyways. Aside from that though the special effects are still fantastic looking today with epic swooping camera angles and fantastically choreographed fight scenes. The overall cinematography of the film is grade-A with a perfect combination of practical and special effects for the majority of the film, aside from the occasional, dated, 90s- esque close-up shots of Spidey yelling to show how much fun he's having, but this is a movie about the web-slinger, and the web-slinging looks great. The score of the film is fantastic as well with a powerful, trumpeting orchestra, presenting the perfect tone for both the action and emotionally-oriented parts of the film. It is yet another winner for Danny Elfman in my book and is the type of score that I would take any day over many of the heavily electronic scores of recent years even while these symphonic pieces seem to be fading away in favor of soundtracks that can be made by two guys with a computer and a $100 software program. As for the acting, the majority of the cast is very strong and supported by an excellent script comprised of a multitude of Stan Lee's memorable as ever characters, making for some very compelling performances. Starting with the amazing wall-crawler himself, Spider-Man, a.k.a. Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, while there are certainly those who would object, mainly due to the train-wreck of a final installment which was Spider-Man 3, which was mainly a directorial disaster, in my opinion, I felt Tobey did a fantastic job as Spidey. Before what I imagine was director Sam Raimi's evil alter ego forcing Maguire to die his hair and dance around like a total numbskull, Tobey Maguire was delivering Spidey performances like this, bringing in all of the awkward nerdiness, emotion, charisma, humor, compassion, and complexity of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Maguire is not at all a bad pick for a leading role and he carries the film marvelously. Next we have the great Willem Dafoe whose role as the Green Goblin\/Norman Osborne is easily in my top 10, if not top 5 supervillain performances of all time. Dafoe brings all of his Academy Award nominated, and in my opinion deserving, acting chops to the role bringing the menacing insanity of the character along with his emotional conflict as a father, friend, and businessman. When you're watching an actor like Willem Dafoe, you know your in for a classic performance, I only wish he had a more revealing mask, because with the diversity of this man's facial expressions, he could have brought a whole new level of terror to the Green Goblin if he did. To follow Willem would be Kristen Dunst as Marry Jane Watson, Parker\/Spidey's love interest and, while I can't say I'm consistently her biggest fan, she delivers on the emotional aspects and a likable performance, so you can't ask for much more than that. After Ms. Dunst would be who I see as the only short link in the film if only because he isn't used enough, or allowed to develop his character enough in the film, Mr. James Franco, I never thought I'd say it because I am planted firmly in Franco's corner as of recent years but his character simply does not get enough screen time for you to care a whole lot about the misfortunate Harry Osborne. The last actor of note other than those characters would be J. K. Simmons as a simply spot on, bar none, perfect J. Jonah Jameson, after his performance there is just no one else I can think of for the role.Overall, Spider-Man was a groundbreaking superhero film both visually and emotionally. It is spear-headed by an all-star cast and supported by a phenomenal original score. Though the film may have a few short comings, and can even feel a bit dated at times it is still, what I believe will be, and already is for me a superhero classic. The third film may have fallen off in it's own respect but this first film was a monumental step in the right direction for superhero films and for that, it's a 5 out of 5. For Spidey's Burning Building Baby Help Line, this is The Truth You Can't Handle, signing off.

The presidents plane has crashed inside the compound and he has been held hostage. The government has promised a convict a clean slate if he gets the president out in 22 hours. Snake must make his way around New York, find the president and escape without getting the president killed or getting killed himself.This film was made in the 80's&#x85; and you can really tell. It has that amazing 80's feel to it. The sound effects are so bad, but great at the same time. When Snake is fighting people it is funny. When he hits someone, the sound that the punch makes it classic 80's. The effects are not great, but again&#x85; that just adds to the atmosphere to the movie. Great soundtrack too.The movie stars Kurt Russell as Snake. He plays this part with such attitude, and it doesn't really suit him. Especially with his deep gravelly voice that he puts on. But after watching him for over 30 minutes in this character you get used to it. Other cast members were Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence & Isaac Hayes. The casting was brilliant. I like all of these actors, especially the legendary Ernest Borgnine. I had the pleasure of meeting Ernest before he passed away, and he was such a nice friendly man. The acting throughout was not brilliant, but then back in the 80's, especially for action films, the acting was never important. It was all about the cheese. I love cheesy action films and this was definitely that.There was quite a lot of violence in it and some gory scenes, but nothing too bad. I was a little bit surprised to see a head on a stick in one scene, but it was awesome. There are some great, creepy characters too.The story is great. I love the idea of the president being kidnapped and a criminal having to save the day. Snake is not really a likable character which is what makes this film different. The hero is not really a hero. He is only doing it for selfish reasons and that is a good spin on the story.I have not seen Escape from L.A., but after watching this I will be looking out for it. I am looking forward to seeing it.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Snake?

I like all of these actors, especially the legendary Ernest Borgnine. I had the pleasure of meeting Ernest before he passed away, and he was such a nice friendly man. The acting throughout was not brilliant, but then back in the 80's, especially for action films, the acting was never important. It was all about the cheese. I love cheesy action films and this was definitely that.There was quite a lot of violence in it and some gory scenes, but nothing too bad. I was a little bit surprised to see a head on a stick in one scene, but it was awesome. There are some great, creepy characters too.The story is great. I love the idea of the president being kidnapped and a criminal having to save the day. Snake is not really a likable character which is what makes this film different. The hero is not really a hero. He is only doing it for selfish reasons and that is a good spin on the story.I have not seen Escape from L.A., but after watching this I will be looking out for it. I am looking forward to seeing it.I will give this film 7 out of 10.Snake?

The presidents plane has crashed inside the compound and he has been held hostage. The government has promised a convict a clean slate if he gets the president out in 22 hours. Snake must make his way around New York, find the president and escape without getting the president killed or getting killed himself.This film was made in the 80's&#x85; and you can really tell. It has that amazing 80's feel to it. The sound effects are so bad, but great at the same time. When Snake is fighting people it is funny. When he hits someone, the sound that the punch makes it classic 80's. The effects are not great, but again&#x85; that just adds to the atmosphere to the movie.

That's right, a Christian watched American Pie. Okay, so to you this may not seem like much of a big deal, but trust me, to 99 percent of Christians, it is. See, I grew up being told that these films were stupid, raunchy, cheesy, sex comedies. I put in the disc for AP expected to be greatly offended and find it to be all of those things. I only watched it at first because I am a very big Alyson Hannigan fan and I wanted to see her trademark role. I'll be the first to admit that there is a lot of inappropriate content in the movie, and yes, he has sex with a pie, but I think people overestimate the way that these things are shown. The movie isn't a porn flick. It shows his butt for a few second while he is over the pie. Yes there i frontal nudity on a girl, and yes, it is in a prolonged scene, however, this is probably the most justifiable nudity of any movie in the 1990's. In the 1990's teen films had become so squeaky clean, and afraid of offending anyone that they had become incredibly unrealistic. AP was a throw back to 80's films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High, The Breakfast Club, and Sixteen Candles. Granted AP is worse than all of these. There is no way to justify the content, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't a good movie. It is a well-written, well-acted, funny, somewhat original comedy with a lot of heart. It brought back the bro- mance. The fact is that if you are easily offended, you will HATE AP, but if you're not, grab some popcorn, a large coke---and maybe some apple pie-- - and enjoy this truly one of a kind, hilarious movie that(in-case you're one those people who thinks it is) is not a sex comedy but truly a bromantic comedy.

I popped in my DVD, and gave it another whirl. I was both correct and wrong with my original feelings on the movie. I was correct with my initial thoughts, being that this movie isn't very good. It's rather murky and kind of dull as well, but it wasn't the disaster as I initially felt either. It has elaborate production values, and the futuristic setting is especially well done. My problem with this movie is that it's so serious I ended up becoming rather bored. The average action scenes don't exactly help. I honestly can't think of one action scene that stood out in this film. This movie was troubled right from the outset. Sly Stallone & Danny Cannon clashed over the movie, and egos ended up prevailing. Why on earth was Rob Schneider in this movie? For some reason during Stallone's comeback in the mid 90's, he was somewhat of a fixture in Stallone movies, including Demolition Man. I'm a die hard fan of Stallone's. I collect everything he's in, whether it's good or bad, so naturally I picked this up on DVD. It pains me to do this, but Stallone shouldn't have been cast as Judge Dredd.It's not that he's bad, he just felt so out of place, and unsure on how to portray the role. He has moments of greatness, but he plays it too straight faced, and lacks the lovable Stallone humor that I am accustomed too. He has cheesy lines, such as I am the law! I knew you'd say that but he's a bit of a stickler overall, and I had trouble warming up to him. I realize he's supposed to be void of emotion as Dredd, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. This isn't one of his best performances. His subtle romance with Diane Lane felt pretty contrived as well. Speaking of Diane Lane&#x85; She is hotter than donut grease, but I didn't buy her performance. She felt very awkward as an action type, but she was amazing to look at, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Armand Assante is very OTT as the villain, and the shoddy brother storyline with Stallone did me no favors. I really didn't get what made him tick. He's fun to watch at times, don't get me wrong, but he's clearly hamming it up. Max Von Sydow is barely in the movie, and serves as a mentor for Stallone.

It has been maybe 20 years since the last time I watched it. The first time I rented it, the second time I caught it on telly. What I remember the best is the rage I felt because of lack of comedy in it and even more because of underlining politically correct family messages and wishful thinking.The reason I expected comedy back then was Robin Williams. My expectations were based on hype about that guy. At the time he was praised as the comedic genius. Only now I realize that I never liked neither him nor any of the films he starred in. He might in fact be the main reason why Hook turned out such a lousy effort.Other things in it didn't click all that well, too. I've been going through the reviews and the critics mostly got it right. The script is pretty bad. Dustin Hoffman looks tired. Julia Roberts is wasted. Bob Hoskins is irritating. The direction is more concentrated on special effects than on coherent storytelling. The effects themselves often scream second unit and are way too obvious to serve the story.What critics were wrong about is the premise. Having Peter Pan grow up is not sacrilege. Granted, it's a high concept, and as such can easily backfire and make for a boring movie, but I see nothing bad with the idea itself. It is in fact what attracted me to give it a try, since I like cynical takes on common lore.It's just that it required a much smarter development to work. And most of all, in case of this high concept, it required a convincing actor in the starring role. To make us believe Peter Pan can really grow up, the actor has to have something of a devilish boyish charm to him. The producers obviously knew it and had Kevin Kline attached to the project. Unfortunately he had to drop out, and it's a damn shame because, judging by his then looks and body of work, it seems to me he was perfect for the role.Robin Williams, the replacement, has a different type of charm. He's a retarded goofball. That's his thing. You can see it in his other movies and you can see it here. He's just playing Robin Williams doing his thing. When you look closely you'll notice that he hasn't got the knack for physical comedy. He seems too slow and sloppy for that. He also makes much of his detestable gum-faced, smirky-eyed grimaces. That might have worked in Popeye but it's horrible in Hook.With someone else on board, other bad things in the film might have been more tolerable. Or not. Hammy moralizing towards the end would have been less hammy but it would still require a much better script to not appear forced. The main point in this movie, the point that occupies Steven Spielberg in his other movies as well, is the family. Or a broken family. The turning point for the story is when the protagonist realizes that his children are his happy thought and the source of his magic. That would have been far more convincing had those children of his had any significant script time by that point.

The turning point for the story is when the protagonist realizes that his children are his happy thought and the source of his magic. That would have been far more convincing had those children of his had any significant script time by that point. Since they were nothing more than props, while Lost Boys took the spotlight, one has to ask Why?. It was well established that Peter Pan hardly ever notices his own flesh and blood. Why are they so important all of the sudden, without proper build-up?And why is the film titled Hook?

Money, charisma, looks, power, and the ability to sleep with any woman he desires. One night in a freak accident the chauvinistic Nick Marshall wakes up to learn he has the ability to know what every woman is thinking. Nick uses this gift for his own advantage. A woman named Darcy (Helen Hunt) works for the company, and Nick misses out on his promotion. Nick goes for revenge with his newfound abilities, but winds up falling for Darcy. Romantic comedies are considered to be chick flicks to many. I'm a guy, and I actually enjoy the romance genre. They tend to get a bit derivative and uncreative at times, but I still watch them as they come out. This movie is the epitome of a romantic comedy done right. Let's face it. If you're a guy, you've more than likely been confused with how a woman does things. Not only does this movie ingeniously explore that, but it does it such a smart way. I can't remember the last time I've laughed that hard in a movie. People can say what they want about Mel Gibson these days, but he was perfect for this part! He oozes charisma, and he is an absolute blast to watch. It was a lot of fun to watch him go from a cocky business man who womanizes to a person slowly, but surely becoming a regular human being with this newfound power. Mel Gibson dancing around in women's clothing, putting on makeup is unforgettable and had me howling with laughter. Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt make a great pair, and there chemistry was top notch. Helen Hunt is terrific herself, in a more subtle way. She's an ideal chick for any guy with a solid head on his shoulders, so guys should love her. Alan Alda doesn't have much to do, but Marisa Tomei is very funny in a supporting role, whilst Judy Greer steals every scene she's in as the girl nobody wants to hang around. The ending actually had me well up with tears a little bit. Laugh all you want, but its true! It was just so heartwarming I couldn't help but love it. Gibson's monologue in the ending is a knockout. Is it clichéd? Of course! It's a romantic comedy, what do you expect? Do people really have to be this fickle? Don't be such a cynic! Sit back, relax, and turn your brain off. You'll be so glad you did. It's one of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen, and a perfect film to watch if you have a date at home!9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Nick Marshal has it all.

They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth. So Moses' requirement that faith must be backed up by tangible results needs a bit of refining. What seems to be the important component of faith is some revelation received by a person. So the people mentioned in Hebrews 11 all had divine revelations.Ray Kinsella (played with great dignity and authority by Kevin Costner) hears voices emanating from the corn field and stakes his very existence on their veracity, even though he has no idea what they are on about. He has to continue his crazy quest, seeking to gain the acceptance of disapproving people of his crazy utterances&#x85;People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.  If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.  Instead, they were longing for a better country&#x97;a heavenly one.Peter Castaldi's disapproval notwithstanding, this idea stands up to scrutiny given the sanctimonious hypocrisy of respectable folks back the sixties,(and seventies) and the evil they perpetrated in the name of conventional morality. Anyone standing up for true righteousness was going to be a foreigner and stranger on earthKinsella When it came time to go to college, I picked the farthest one away from home I could find. That drove my father right up the wall, but I guess that was the point. At Berkeley, officially my major was English, but really it was the sixties. I marched (in protests), smoked some grass and tried to like sitar music&#x85;then I met Annie, who became my wife&#x85; But until I heard the voice, I never did a crazy thing in my whole life.The sixties that period during which the intellectual, emotional and moral bankruptcy of the respectable citizenry was laid bare for all to see, in all its horrible godlessness.I remember an amusing reference in Rolling Stone to the downfall of the Nixon administration. All his advisers were respectable, short haired, god-fearing people who didn't take illegal drugs,. Maybe its time some long haired,atheist, drug taking hippies were brought in to government.Kinsella is scared to death of turning into his father, who may have heard voices but sure didn't listen to themOK A whole self help industry has been built on the feelings of alienation baby boomer sons had from their fathers. Maybe it is the affluence experienced by the baby boomers that gave them the security to contemplate revelation - faith - alienation from their fellows.But then a lot of baby boomers voted for Nixon to be president not once, but twice. A lot of baby boomers supported the Vietnam War. And a lot of baby boomers sit around, drinking in taverns, speaking ill of pot smokers.Kinsella was lucky enough to have a wife who was prepared to stand by her man. Alden Robinson might well have restrained Amy Madigan's kinetic performance, but she does make the point that the alternative was probably becoming one with the local wanna be book burners.It is also refreshing to see Ray Liotta cast in a role of someone other than a villain, assuming you do not judge Shoeless Joe Jackson too harshly. Watch John Sayles' Eight Men Out to refresh your memory on that matter.Perhaps if America had more people of faith, as it is described in the bible, then the corruption of people such as Shoeless Joe Jackson and the White Sox might be expunged from so many American institutions. But then they have always been a scarce commodity. As Ray Kinsella is told, faith is the province of the chosen few, to whom 'what is out there is revealed. Everyone else can exercise hope. For those who meekly exercise hope, hungering and thirsting after righteousness, showing mercy and dreaming of purity of heart, its not such a bad deal. It's one of the three eternal values.

I thought I would give it a try. It's from 1974, but it could be interesting. I am really proud of my decision now. If nothing else, this movie should be used as teaching material for young cinematographers. It is a layered film that affects you on multiple levels.The movie starts with a conversation between two people in a park, while Gene Hackman's team is diligently recording everything they say. You can see that it is a difficult thing to do because it is lunch hour and the two people move around all the time in the middle of a loud crowd. And yet they can record things perfectly.But then the story changes perspective, as you see Hackman's character in his personal life, ironically a very private person who feels invaded when the landlord looks at his mail and learns it is his birthday and then decides to enter in the apartment without permission to leave a present. The girlfriend wants to know more about him, friends ask questions. Suddenly it is all very suffocating.And then there is the actual recorded conversation. It first seems to be about something, then it (slowly) becomes more, then it twists again. The consequences of the actions of the characters are also explored. The ending is surprising and thought provoking. If this film doesn't make you feel all paranoid and helpless, I don't know what will )Great movie, albeit a little slow, but that slowness gives it incredible depth and effect if you make the effort. I highly recommend watching it. Gene Hackman is perfect for the role, while Harrison Ford plays a secondary (and creepy) role.

This story has been done many many times back until the early silent days of cinema, but Burton's take probably took over from the animated short film version from 1949 as the most common adaptation of this horror tale. If you didn't know it was by Tim Burton or about his affection with the supernatural, you could still think early on, this was not a mystery tale, but a crime story. The protagonist hears about a couple of beheading in another town and travels there believing some mass murderer was on the run. When he is played a prank on by some of the locals who dress up as the headless horseman, this tendency stays alive. However, when Ichabod Crane runs for the first time into the real monster, it becomes clear that something supernatural is taking its course.While I was admittedly never too interested in the story, it still made for a good watch. Especially Christopher Walken is a perfect casting choice for his part and Christina Ricci looks like a gloomy version of a mysterious modern Disney princess here. Michael Gambon I occasionally mistook for Geoffrey Rush and that's of course really a compliment. I'm more of a fan of invisible danger and horror à la Blair Witch Project than of Burton's mostly very graphic style, so I wasn't really scared, but I was entertained for the most part. The finale got a bit messy admittedly, but that shouldn't take the focus from how solid everything before that is, especially the visual side, but that's almost a given with Burton. The effects, the bleak landscape and the whole setting are certainly the highlight of the film. Lovers of mystery films will probably have a much better time watching this one as I did, but even if I'm not too eager on watching it in the near future again, I'd also recommend it to everybody else who's not completely opposed to the genre and even then you could still enjoy it from the period piece angle.
