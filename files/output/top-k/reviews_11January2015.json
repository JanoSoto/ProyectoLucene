It had already garner the reputation as America's best western before hand. The keyword in that list is American. If it was greatest westerns in general, it would be beaten out by Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns. Although this list is just American westerns, I still don't think it deserves number 1. My favourite western is Unforgiven for a number of reasons. The Searchers is right behind it.This has got to be John Wayne's best performance. If not True Grit, then this. Wayne plays former Civil War soldier, Ethan Edwards, who returns to his brothers ranch seeking peace. When a group of Natives destroy their home and kidnap his niece, Ethan and his nephew, Martin (Hunter), embark on a five-year-mission to find her. Ethan hates Indians more than anything and even has some resentment toward Martin, who is part Indian. When Ethan and Martin finally find her as a teenager (Wood), they see that she has turned into one of them.John Ford is one of the most influential directors ever. By watching The Searchers, ties can be made to later movies that have drawn influence upon this. The biggest influence I found was on Lawrence of Arabia. One of the things that makes Lawrence of Arabia so good is its filming and shots in the desert. This greatly resembles Lawrence of Arabia's shots and filming. But that's not the only one. Dances With Wolves, The English Patient and The Last Samurai are other examples of movies that had inspiration drawn from this. The Searchers is not just a nice movie to look at. The general premise of cowboys and Indians has been done and searching for somebody who has been kidnapped has been down to death. It deals with racism and how hatred consumes one's life. Ethan Edwards is almost a villain, who Wayne does a mighty fine job in playing. He hates natives and will stop at nothing to find his niece and destroy her kidnappers. That's because he is a drifter without a purpose in life. Racism through ignorance is common, but adding an empty life ontop of that makes for a cold-hearted individual. By end, Ethan is fully redeemed as he learns respect and forgiveness among another race. The characterization this movie has to deliver is flawless.

Because, quite simply, I haven't caught up with it for such a long time until last night whilst working my way through the recorded movies from the recent festive period. Looking at it with adult eyes for the first time, it's perhaps easy to underestimate just how great a movie it is and probably remains to this day Disney's pinnacle. It's colourful, noisy, fun and everything a good family film should be but it's also a technical marvel, providing the sort of magic you rarely see in movies these days.Chirpy Cockney Bert (Dick Van Dyke) welcomes us to 17 Cherry Tree Lane in London, home to the somewhat dysfunctional Banks family. George Banks (David Tomlinson) works at a bank in the city and is neglectful of his two children Jane (Karen Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber), believing that order and discipline are his house's watchwords. His wife Winifred (Glynis Johns) is also busy as a Suffragette and she relies too heavily on the house staff (Reta Shaw and Hermione Baddeley) and the children's nanny. But as the latest one departs due to the unruly nature of Jane & Michael, a new nanny literally blows into town - the practically perfect Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) whose magic and mysterious methods will end up having a profound effect on all of their lives.What can be said about a film as ubiquitous as Mary Poppins that hasn't been said before? As a child, I was somewhat dismissive of the energetic songs and dance routines, preferring the wonderful animated sequences that interacted perfectly with the actors which I had never seen before (and probably wouldn't have believed was even possible). But such is the magic that the movie weaves that you completely buy into the concept. It would be remiss of me to discuss the movie without talking about Van Dyke and his legendarily awful accent which, at times, is so bad that he's almost utterly incoherent. However, his physical comedy more than makes up for it as his spindly frame is perfect in the dance routines - check out the Step Right Up sequence which he's indistinguishable from the professional backing dancers or his genuinely amusing turn as the elderly head of the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, Mr Dawes Senior. But the movie rightly belongs to Andrews as Poppins, a character that has passed into popular culture folklore. Her performance and singing ability are faultless from start to finish, thoroughly meriting the Oscar she received for the role. Together with Van Dyke, their various adventures both surprise and delight audiences of any age even today.But it isn't just about great songs and funny cartoons. The film is a triumph of effects as well as imagination. In a film such as this, it's easy to be distracted from the little moments that would cause wonder such as smoke forming into a solid staircase into the night sky or different coloured liquid being poured from the same bottle. No wonder that Disney himself considered Mary Poppins as his masterpiece and I'm inclined to agree. Even more than fifty years after its release, it remains the definitive family film that all others aspire to and fall inevitably short of. There are a couple of scenes that might not maintain the energy and enthusiasm that the film establishes in the beginning but that's understandable for a film of such high quality in every aspect. And of course, there's Van Dyke's unforgivable accent. But taken as it is, Mary Poppins has become more than just a movie. It has become a cultural landmark and the turning point for the Disney corporation who, it could be argued, have struggled to match the success ever since.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 January 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Quinton Terantino's Reservoir Dogs is one of the most blood soaked, shockingly violent, and wildly entertaining movies I've ever seen. I honestly don't know if I've ever seen anything like it, and I'm certain nothing like this had been made before. It's brutal yet witty, with the tapings of a cheap exploitation film but the heart of a classic noir.What Terantino has done is to take the basic formula for a heist movie, crank up the violence by a factor of ten, and turn it on its head. Rather than taking us through the careful planning, the daring heist, and the inevitable final act in which everything unravels, Reservoir Dogs jumps straight ahead to the bloody aftermath. One guy's dead, another's missing, and another is bleeding out from a stomach wound. The only thing the robbers can be sure of is that someone set them up. Now they've gotta find out who- if they don't kill each other first.The amazing thing about this movie is that even though there are bullets aplenty and blood everywhere, it's not the action, but rather the characters and dialogue that drive it. Nearly half the movie takes place in an abandoned warehouse, where the main characters try to figure out what the hell went wrong and what they're gonna do about it. Much of this movie's success is due to the superb cast, Including Harvey Keitel as the veteran, professional Mr. White, Tim Roth as newcomer Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as the utterly psychotic Mr. Blond, and the priceless Steve Bulsami as the sniveling, slightly neurotic Mr. Pink.Another of the film's strengths is its dialogue; key when most scenes involve the characters standing around talking to- or screaming at- each other. Terentino has managed to give every conversation a comic edge, but without tipping over into the realm of farce. Highly instructive is the opening scene at the diner, where the wise guys discuss the meaning of Madonna's songs and the importance of tipping. None of this has anything to do with the plot, but it sets the tone and reveals much about the characters and their personalities, especially Mr. Pink.Or take the scene later on in which Mr. Blond sings and dances along to Joe Tex's I Gotcha- while dousing a tied up cop with gasoline! We've been hearing from the others that this guy is absolutely psycho; it would appear that they've seriously understated the case.

","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Quinton Terantino's Reservoir Dogs is one of the most blood soaked, shockingly violent, and wildly entertaining movies I've ever seen. I honestly don't know if I've ever seen anything like it, and I'm certain nothing like this had been made before. It's brutal yet witty, with the tapings of a cheap exploitation film but the heart of a classic noir.What Terantino has done is to take the basic formula for a heist movie, crank up the violence by a factor of ten, and turn it on its head. Rather than taking us through the careful planning, the daring heist, and the inevitable final act in which everything unravels, Reservoir Dogs jumps straight ahead to the bloody aftermath. One guy's dead, another's missing, and another is bleeding out from a stomach wound. The only thing the robbers can be sure of is that someone set them up. Now they've gotta find out who- if they don't kill each other first.The amazing thing about this movie is that even though there are bullets aplenty and blood everywhere, it's not the action, but rather the characters and dialogue that drive it. Nearly half the movie takes place in an abandoned warehouse, where the main characters try to figure out what the hell went wrong and what they're gonna do about it. Much of this movie's success is due to the superb cast, Including Harvey Keitel as the veteran, professional Mr. White, Tim Roth as newcomer Mr. Orange, Michael Madsen as the utterly psychotic Mr. Blond, and the priceless Steve Bulsami as the sniveling, slightly neurotic Mr. Pink.Another of the film's strengths is its dialogue; key when most scenes involve the characters standing around talking to- or screaming at- each other. Terentino has managed to give every conversation a comic edge, but without tipping over into the realm of farce. Highly instructive is the opening scene at the diner, where the wise guys discuss the meaning of Madonna's songs and the importance of tipping. None of this has anything to do with the plot, but it sets the tone and reveals much about the characters and their personalities, especially Mr. Pink.Or take the scene later on in which Mr. Blond sings and dances along to Joe Tex's I Gotcha- while dousing a tied up cop with gasoline! We've been hearing from the others that this guy is absolutely psycho; it would appear that they've seriously understated the case.

No, not in the 'Godfather' kind of way. No, it certainly won't be remembered as one of the greats when it comes to the history of cinema. However, it was a fun little film which has its place on TV on a Saturday afternoon. It was a good action-adventure film which could be enjoyed by all the family without much of a need for brainpower.Yes, it could be looked at as a 'poor man's Indiana Jones,' but it was just such fun it should be afforded some of its misgivings and simply enjoyed for what it was. So, because of its simple success (and commercial, obviously), a sequel was quickly greenlit. The second instalment certainly gets a fair few things right, yet it never quite gels together like the first. Not that's it's bad, it's just not &#x96; quite &#x96; as good as the first.The best thing about it is the cast. They all return from the original. And it's nice to see the two central characters (Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) don't need to fall in love all over again. They're married now and they have a child, Alex, who's not as annoying as 99% of the children we see in films. In fact, instead of Rik having to rescue Evelyn constantly, the two of them have to rescue their son. Yes, the Mummy does indeed return (never mind how he was firmly killed and dragged to hell in the first instalment. He's now back, okay?) and wants to borrow the mythical 'Scorpion King's' army with which he can then take over the world again. Unfortunately, little Alex just so happens to have the only bracelet attached to him, so he's captured and subsequently dragged half way around the world into to raise the army.One of the things 'The Mummy Returns' will always be known for is that it's the first filmic outing for 'The Rock' (better known nowadays as, former wrestler, Dwayne Johnson). He plays the Scorpion King himself &#x96; a secondary villain, also not the type you want to get hold of either your only son, or an army capable of taking over the world. It's a brave attempt to crowbar another villain into the mix, but he's not properly in it until the final showdown, therefore the main villain we go with is the Mummy, simply because he was in the first film and is basically in the second outing all the way through.So, The Mummy Returns sits nicely alongside its predecessor in the 'Saturday matinée' type of film. It too will be enjoyed by most families with a sense of humour and a forgiving nature towards daft films. But it's not perfect. It's hard to explain exactly what's wrong with it, but there's something there that doesn't feel right. And it wasn't in the first. It does seem a little more formulaic than the first. You get one action scene after the next, even going as far as to copy the sandstorm from the first film and changing it slightly using water instead of sand.It's a nice little film and most people should like it. Perhaps it's best to let the Mummy franchise die there. It will certainly save you from the very disappointing third instalment.

He expels the drug dealers and troublemakers and he chains the doors shut to keep the learners inside and the troublemakers outside....much to the disarray of the community.The acting is very good here. Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors Hollywood has ever had. This movie came out at a time before Freeman had his juicy roles, but this performance here is still top-notch. I may not agree with all the tactics Clark used to whip his school into shape, but Freeman does an excellent job in showing what a no-nonsense man Joe Clark was.Overall, Lean on Me is a very powerful film and is essentially a version of the old rags-to-rich tale, but here it's more of a dumb-to-smart tale.

It is a cautionary tale, a tale of misfits in a makeshift family and it is a story about an era--how a time and place felt, how wonderful that feeling was, and how it couldn't last.Innocence is a theme and a feel in this film. What could be less innocent than pornography? Boogie Nights admittedly sugar coats the industry enough to make it palatable to the audience enough to keep them focused on greater themes of human nature, family, finding a place in the world, and the idea that everyone has something special, a gift.It is often said by viewers that Dirk is pathetic and his penis is the star. The way he's portrayed though, it is clear he is the perfect storm and his 'gift' is his general sexual appeal mixed with pleasant personality, perfect for the industry at the time. Back then both male and female performers were seen as sexy people, not just meat. Very touching is watching how Walberg plays Eddie\/Dirk before he enters the industry. He's beat down by a loveless family and a mean mom who does not believe in him in any way. The archetype of this mom, far from outrageous, is so relevant to reality that it makes most viewers cringe. Eddie\/Dirk walks out with nothing but belief in self to find his own off beat version of self worth, and in the process he gets a de facto family.Boogie follows a whole array of characters with varying degrees of closeness. Few films allow one to feel connected to this volume of people. Perhaps, though, it is the odd father\/son substitute between Dirk and Jack (Reynolds) that is at the personal center of the film. We don't see it fully until their last hug at the end, but Dirk is no throwaway talent to Jack--he likes Dirk, and thinks he's not a replaceable person or talent. Perhaps he sees himself as a father figure to Dirk.Despite the changes in Dirk throughout the movie, fueled by B-level 'underground' stardom, he remains mostly a likable guy and you can see why the others in the 'porn family' like him so. He only loses control and breaks off (for a time) when his cocaine problem gets the best of him. Even then, he is kind and loyal most of the time. Everything in these late 70's early 80's days was more innocent, even if they aren't in principal. The drug of choice is coke, which while bad, is not as bad as the Crack and Heroin that would take over as the 80's ran on. Even at his lowest low, the infamous scene where he tries to sell fake coke and everything goes wrong, Dirk maintains a level of innocence and goodness that most wouldn't and later eras might not allow for. He makes a decision there, in the famous space-out shot, to go back to Jack and set his life back on track (relatively speaking).A dimension of Boogie Nights that astounds me is the documentary aspect. This involves rigorous recreation of the look, the styles, the fashion and the feel of self indulgent, brightly colored innocence that went so far as to make the porn industry something of a fun, light time.The bare bones production of the porn films is fondly milked for smiles. Andersen doesn't let this fondness for his characters and their era allow them off the hook. He constantly skewers how dumb most of the characters are. He allows us to have a laugh at what was considered classy and fashionable at the time--crazy collars, polyester, platforms, feathered hair. Perhaps the most pathetically funny scene I've ever viewed in a movie is when Dirk and Reed try their hand at music. Dirk sings (off key) a classic piece of 80's cheese from the transformers movie 'The Touch' and a song, right out of the era, Reed and Dirk work on in front of us (actually by John C. Reily and Anderson)'Feel the Heat'. No director has ever gone this far to recreate an era. In addition, we get some scenes from the actual Dirk porn films,(a hilarious foray into Dirk and Reed creating a 'James Bond type character'). Finally, we get to see a documentary about Dirk made by his mother figure, Amber Waves.Boogie gets us to believe in an era, one that has a reputation that's less than flattering. As a bit a parable, bit of a satire and a bit of a legend, it takes a black and white view--as soon as 1980 dawns trouble begins. It works in the mythic universe of this film and what it is trying to do. The changes we see under the small lens of the porn industry in the film help us to understand where we are culturally today, oddly enough. The fact that the 80's are a darkness that comes and can't be dodged, but the characters find ways to deal with it suggests something about human nature and also what our age is all about--putting up with our ever more destructive excess.The film also gives true pathos to mostly stupid people who at times make poor decisions. We are interested in them, and cheer for them. Even when we laugh at them we don't dismiss them. As an audience we relate to them, even as they are ostracized in a untouchable line of work. The film is a legend based on the most odd subject, yet we feel it on a personal level and the human tales are transferable to anyone's life.Few films do this much, show us this many aspects of the human condition, have this much humor, warmth and satire, bring to life an era in such vivid splendor, and are this much fun.

Perhaps he sees himself as a father figure to Dirk.Despite the changes in Dirk throughout the movie, fueled by B-level 'underground' stardom, he remains mostly a likable guy and you can see why the others in the 'porn family' like him so. He only loses control and breaks off (for a time) when his cocaine problem gets the best of him. Even then, he is kind and loyal most of the time. Everything in these late 70's early 80's days was more innocent, even if they aren't in principal. The drug of choice is coke, which while bad, is not as bad as the Crack and Heroin that would take over as the 80's ran on. Even at his lowest low, the infamous scene where he tries to sell fake coke and everything goes wrong, Dirk maintains a level of innocence and goodness that most wouldn't and later eras might not allow for. He makes a decision there, in the famous space-out shot, to go back to Jack and set his life back on track (relatively speaking).A dimension of Boogie Nights that astounds me is the documentary aspect. This involves rigorous recreation of the look, the styles, the fashion and the feel of self indulgent, brightly colored innocence that went so far as to make the porn industry something of a fun, light time.The bare bones production of the porn films is fondly milked for smiles. Andersen doesn't let this fondness for his characters and their era allow them off the hook. He constantly skewers how dumb most of the characters are. He allows us to have a laugh at what was considered classy and fashionable at the time--crazy collars, polyester, platforms, feathered hair. Perhaps the most pathetically funny scene I've ever viewed in a movie is when Dirk and Reed try their hand at music. Dirk sings (off key) a classic piece of 80's cheese from the transformers movie 'The Touch' and a song, right out of the era, Reed and Dirk work on in front of us (actually by John C. Reily and Anderson)'Feel the Heat'. No director has ever gone this far to recreate an era. In addition, we get some scenes from the actual Dirk porn films,(a hilarious foray into Dirk and Reed creating a 'James Bond type character'). Finally, we get to see a documentary about Dirk made by his mother figure, Amber Waves.Boogie gets us to believe in an era, one that has a reputation that's less than flattering. As a bit a parable, bit of a satire and a bit of a legend, it takes a black and white view--as soon as 1980 dawns trouble begins. It works in the mythic universe of this film and what it is trying to do. The changes we see under the small lens of the porn industry in the film help us to understand where we are culturally today, oddly enough. The fact that the 80's are a darkness that comes and can't be dodged, but the characters find ways to deal with it suggests something about human nature and also what our age is all about--putting up with our ever more destructive excess.The film also gives true pathos to mostly stupid people who at times make poor decisions. We are interested in them, and cheer for them. Even when we laugh at them we don't dismiss them. As an audience we relate to them, even as they are ostracized in a untouchable line of work. The film is a legend based on the most odd subject, yet we feel it on a personal level and the human tales are transferable to anyone's life.Few films do this much, show us this many aspects of the human condition, have this much humor, warmth and satire, bring to life an era in such vivid splendor, and are this much fun. Boogie Nights is one of the great films of our time.

The movie is about a couple of American friends vacationing in England who are attacked by an animal, killing one and wounding the other. The locals know something strange is going on in their area, but don't do what's necessary to keep them out of trouble. They do however get there soon enough to save David, played by David Naughton. If this was a werewolf that attacked them -- the legend is that if you survive you will turn into one at the next full moon, and this is David's fear. The doctor and nurse that initially take care of him get involved in a couple of different ways. The nurse, played by Jenny Agutter, takes him in and starts a romance. The doctor eventually tries to find out what actually happened as the authorities say they were attacked by a human lunatic not an animal. The movie is scary and funny(with most of the humor coming from Griffin Dunne, who plays David's dead friend who keeps showing up in a degrading state trying to get him to kill himself before he kills others and to send him to his final resting place). Rick Baker's makeup takes center stage especially during the initial transformation scene where David turns into a werewolf. The gruesomeness is a little overused and is a slight negative to the movie, in my opinion, but the movie keeps your interest until the final 15 minutes where it finishes way too quickly. The movie is unique in it's ability to fuse many genre's into one movie somewhat successfully.

The stoned out California surfer dude was perfected by Penn and for years people have made that stock character a part of many films, television shows and cartoons.Many years later, lad mags would push Phoebe Cates' famous nude scene as the most perfect display of breasts ever. That one point of the film, you truly feel that you're in an alternate universe when she undoes her top and presents her beautiful assets all shiny and wet to the viewer. That scene never gets old and to this day Ms. Cates is a legend to many young men.The acting is still solid, the music is 1980's and pretty much every character is likable. There's little to fault about it other than the questionable decision to have Amy Heckerling direct this. I just feel the film is better for teenagers. I would recommend finding Cameron Crowe's book and reading that (or seeing Animal House) instead of this film unless you love seeing Spicoli and Barrett over and over again.

It has fairly decent acting (Rosie O'Donnell and Walter Sparrow give excellent performances) and a pretty good soundtrack. Set in the nostalgic era of Super-8, modern suburbs and kids still frequently going outside, 1970, Now and Then is the story of four adult women going down memory lane in the Nineties and talking about their memorable summer as children. As kids they were all dealing with their own issues Roberta was obsessed with death and playing dead after her mother was killed, Chrissy has no idea what sex is and feels immature compared to her friends, Teeny is a stuck-up only child who seems to know too much and Samantha's father has run off; her parents are getting a divorce. Their summer goal is to save up enough money for a large treehouse, but they get sidetracked when ghosts, family matters and their own growing up all interfere.Now And Then was a pretty good movie but definitely not original, it's a girly version of Stand By Me and mimics nearly every aspect of it. Christina Ricci was in it as the childhood Roberta, and she's a really great actress, no doubt about it, but she was in so many similar roles during the 1990's (The Addams Family, The Ice Storm, Mermaids, etc.) that she's overused and not very effective once you've already seen her in a million other things. Just like Dakota and Elle Fanning and Chloe Grace Moretz are overused way too much in the 21st century, Christina Ricci was in their place during the Nineties. She does a good acting job but it's just not convincing when she's been in so many other movies like Now and Then.The plot was very childish (yeah, I know it's about kids), but childish that it makes the characters acting like eight-year-olds rather than their supposed ages in the story. Still, the cast choice as adults was amazing, they look very much as you would picture the characters to be as grown-ups. Rosie O' Donnell looks exactly like an older Christina Ricci and so on.Now and Then isn't bad, it's a typical nostalgia movie. It isn't as good as Running With Scissors (2006) or The Ice Storm (1997) but it manages to keep you watching, so you've got to give it credit for that.

His Young Frankenstein had appeared decades after the era of big studio monster movies, though TV reruns had kept them lingering in the popular consciousness. Westerns are an eternal American art form, but Blazing Saddles had come out at the tail end of their heyday. Brooks's love of old standards lay behind High Anxiety, To Be or Not to Be, and of course Silent Movie. Later, Robin Hood Men in Tights would take its title and supporting characters from a contemporary Kevin Costner film, but would be in even closer dialogue with a 1938 Errol Flynn classic.Spaceballs is unusual, then, in its relative timeliness. The first Star Wars movie was already ten years old, but the last (or what should have been the last) was barely four, and they were becoming ingrained in mass culture like few other works of fiction before or since. Brooks got in virtually on the ground floor, and his parody became a classic along with its source material. Because the subject matter was so new and so well-known, Brooks could be highly specific without going over people's heads. Laughs of recognition are therefore loud and frequent. The references derive from all three Star Wars films we get the munchkin-like Jawas of Tattooine, the little green wise man Yogurt, and a gloopy Pizza the Hutt. As a bonus, the sci-fi setting creates chances for funny if more dated Star Trek, Alien, and Planet of the Apes gags.But with Brooks, pop culture references are only part of the formula. He is also a master of that oft-reviled, broader and older form of humor the pun. Do the ones in Spaceballs work? Yep. She doesn't look Druish is a classic, but my favorites are the ones that lead into sight gags, like jamming the radar and combing the desert. There are also a lot of jokes that are barely jokes at all, just silly diversions, like Dick van Patten in a Renaissance wig gasping for air. Simple, but good for a grin. Rounding out Brook's bag of tricks are the crotch shots and dick jokes, well-sold by Rick Moranis and prolific TV character actor George Wyner. Shock humor queen Joan Rivers, though, who provides voice work, is unfortunately underused in that department. The movie is not nearly as scatological, profane, or racially- and sexually-charged as Blazing Saddles, but it does enough in those areas to satisfy fans of both the lowbrow and the irreverent.A send-up of a modern classic, Spaceballs ranks as one of Brooks's best spoofs.

The whole movie is fueled by fun humor that is pretty easy to enjoy. Although it has some light sci-fi elements, it is by no means an action comedy, nor does is have an interesting story. The plot basis is fine, but there are no end twists or earth- shattering revelations and there are no time traveling issues (e.g. Marty McFly almost preventing his own birth by interfering with his parents' past). For those who haven't seen the movie, the essential plot is that Bill and Ted are failing history and cannot graduate high school without acing their final report. To make matters worse, Ted's dad is threatening to send Ted to military school if he flunks out. With help from a man named Rufus (George Carlin) from 2689, they travel through time to find historical figures to help them make the perfect history report.While these two excellent dudes are presented and even treated like a unit, they are given individualized home situations and slightly different personalities. Ted (Keanu Reeves) is a bit more cheerful and goofy than Bill (Alex Winter), who has a few moments of irritation. While academically incompetent, they actually have some pretty good ideas and moments of resourcefulness throughout, rather like Harry and Lloyd in Dumb and Dumber. The whole time, they surf speak (e.g. Excellent, Triumphant, Bodacious, etc.) and play air guitar solos as they collect their historical figures. These small quirks are what I feel makes this movie so enjoyable.Of course, it isn't award winning in any regard. As mentioned before, the story is given very little thought. The scattered moments of sci-fi have pretty poor visual effects. Of course, it is a comedy so these technical aspects are not terribly important. Besides, the acting and scripting is satisfactory from the main characters, minor characters, and one- liner parts. The comedy has a consistent personality and mood to it, but there is a pretty good balance of situational and verbal humor. The comedy is presented blatantly and doesn't have much Home Alone style slapstick or Monty Python style British humor. The back half of the movie has lots of gags involving eight historical figures being put in California in the 80's. Bill and Ted have some pretty funny lines, but it's also quite amusing to just watch their non-verbal reactions to various situations. The humor is family friendly, though not written like a kid's movie. If that is confusing, it's essentially Wayne's World style comedy on a PG level, but again it isn't a kid's movie.You can watch this in almost any setting and not decrease the viewing experience. There's no problem if you watch it with a semi-boisterous crowd. If you don't find it funny or enjoyable after ten or so minutes, I would recommend turning it off. Your first impression of this film will probably be close to your opinion of it at the end. So in short, it's worth a try in search of a good comedy, but is by no means a masterpiece.

The whole time, they surf speak (e.g. Excellent, Triumphant, Bodacious, etc.) and play air guitar solos as they collect their historical figures. These small quirks are what I feel makes this movie so enjoyable.Of course, it isn't award winning in any regard. As mentioned before, the story is given very little thought. The scattered moments of sci-fi have pretty poor visual effects. Of course, it is a comedy so these technical aspects are not terribly important. Besides, the acting and scripting is satisfactory from the main characters, minor characters, and one- liner parts. The comedy has a consistent personality and mood to it, but there is a pretty good balance of situational and verbal humor. The comedy is presented blatantly and doesn't have much Home Alone style slapstick or Monty Python style British humor. The back half of the movie has lots of gags involving eight historical figures being put in California in the 80's. Bill and Ted have some pretty funny lines, but it's also quite amusing to just watch their non-verbal reactions to various situations. The humor is family friendly, though not written like a kid's movie. If that is confusing, it's essentially Wayne's World style comedy on a PG level, but again it isn't a kid's movie.You can watch this in almost any setting and not decrease the viewing experience. There's no problem if you watch it with a semi-boisterous crowd. If you don't find it funny or enjoyable after ten or so minutes, I would recommend turning it off. Your first impression of this film will probably be close to your opinion of it at the end. So in short, it's worth a try in search of a good comedy, but is by no means a masterpiece. Overall Rating 8.7\/10. ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Music"},{"date":"11 January 2015","score":"","review":" I will try to give this movie a critical overview, but it is a movie that is better if viewed without a critical eye. The whole movie is fueled by fun humor that is pretty easy to enjoy. Although it has some light sci-fi elements, it is by no means an action comedy, nor does is have an interesting story. The plot basis is fine, but there are no end twists or earth- shattering revelations and there are no time traveling issues (e.g. Marty McFly almost preventing his own birth by interfering with his parents' past). For those who haven't seen the movie, the essential plot is that Bill and Ted are failing history and cannot graduate high school without acing their final report. To make matters worse, Ted's dad is threatening to send Ted to military school if he flunks out. With help from a man named Rufus (George Carlin) from 2689, they travel through time to find historical figures to help them make the perfect history report.While these two excellent dudes are presented and even treated like a unit, they are given individualized home situations and slightly different personalities.
