Not many films have shown us what a mental hospital is truly like. The tough scenes from Terminator 2 Judgement Day and Changeling have us gasping but this representation shows us a true heartbreaking dramatic struggle of right and wrong for patients and the treatment in which they receive. The rules to maintain the peace are justified through strictness and a lack of activity for new opportunities.Enter Randall McMurphy, a man who wants to bring the outside world into the safely maintained hospital. Nicholson's Oscar turn as central character McMurphy shakes the plot up and gives a stunning feeling of freedom to a place confined by rules. So convincing is the Easy Rider that you feel he has the potential to set you free.The supporting cast couldn't be more impressive. Fletcher, De Vito, Lloyd, Sampson and an unforgettable debut performance from Brad Dourif as Billy. One of the finest collections of actors ever cast.Portrayals aside this is all about the concept of freedom in a place which wouldn't allow it, a fight against all odds. This is not like a romantic drama where the guy has to fight against his mistakes to win the girl, this is about a battle. A long fought battle of emotions that brings the best and worst out of people that will scar the contestants for life. The strong concept of freedom is juxtaposed against ideologies of suicide, punishment, sex, loyalty and professionalism, making a highly dramatic story, an important watch, which isn't for the fainthearted.The setting for this 1975 picture gives the story a dark image, even though it appears white and pleasant.Winner of 5 Oscars, One flew over the cuckoo's nest raises important issues about the system and people's well being and with stand out performances it is one of the most important films you will see for a long time.

Now, any movie I can watch repeatedly and not tire of it gets my vote as a good flick, but THE RUNNING MAN has somehow manage to elevate itself over the years as much more than that. It is yet another Arnold Schwarzenegger gem from the 1980s. Seriously, Arnie probably made more entertaining movies in the first 10 years of his career than most actors can lay claim to in their entire career!A futuristic film that is not so futuristic in terms of technology now that we know what the 21st century looks like (what 80s flick is?), this flick has so much more going for it. And the rather dated technology has a nostalgic appeal that many 80s movies still have. Actually, the technology is not that bad, and dare I say it, even cool-looking in parts. I especially like the futuristic outfits that the cast wears. It actually doesn't look ridiculous and one can even envision a future where people will dress like this.What makes TRM original and prescient is it's premise a game show where the contestants fight on a reality TV show for their lives! The contestants, hardened 'criminals' must navigate through an underground city maze and defend themselves against a plethora of crazed Stalkers on a game-show that shares the film's title. The host of this show is Killian (played by none other than the original, iconic real game-show 'Family Feud' host Richard Dawson). This is one of the best examples of casting TO type in any film I've ever seen! Dawson is terrific, utterly convincing as a heartless, ruthless host of a diabolical show. Of course Arnie delivers as the film's lead, as usual. Arnie plays Ben Richards, a framed cop falsely accused of mass murder in the film's opening sequence, then wrongly imprisoned. After a few months, Richards and some fellow inmates, including a do-gooder (solidly played by Yaphet Kotto) and a computer hacker, escape and go their separate ways, but not for long before they are all captured and forced to participate on the brutal game show.Maria Conchita Alonso is very memorable and makes the most of her role as the vivacious Amber, an initial thorn in Richards' side, who evolves into an ally for Richards and his crew as they all must work together to try to survive the game. Icons Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown also make good impressions (especially Ventura) as 2 of the Stalkers. Mick Fleetwood also has a wonderful brief couple of cameo scenes as the leader of the Resistance fighting the militaristic, totalitarian government.Having re-watched TRM a few times in later years, I realize now how prescient it is as modern television has become bombarded with reality shows. All the major networks have them. All the OTHER networks have them! They are everywhere. Back when TRM came out, reality shows really didn't exist. Sitcoms, nighttime soaps, silly fantasy shows, and cop dramas were all the rage! Ironically, Survivor, which started in the 90s and has a vein that is crazily similar to TRM, was probably the first popular game-show style reality series that eventually led to all that is on now. Viewers cheer for and against, egg on, and vote on their favorites to win or lose much like the audience members in TRM. While carrying an actual message and being provocative, THE RUNNING MAN is also, thankfully, one of those totally re-watchable 80s flicks that, while one might chuckle at some of the skewed technological vision of the future, it also possesses at it's core a fancy-free element of fun. The look and feel of the future manages to be simultaneously colorful-looking and bleak. The design and setup of TRM game show itself is very impressive with a stylish set, great techno dance music, and backup dancers, and the genius casting of Dawson to give it ambiance.Directed by none other than 70s icon Paul Michael Glaser (the Starsky half of Starsky and Hutch), populated with great Arnie puns and one-liners, a very capable supporting cast, a fast-pace, and satisfying ending, THE RUNNING MAN is both an iconic 80s nostalgic piece AND a foreshadowing of things to come!

Ken Loach's movies are always good and they always deal with sad and gritty subjects. The thing that struck me most about this movie was that although I initially felt sympathy for the main character, Maggie, I quickly lost it. She's so upset she is completely uncooperative with the social services people, who are often judgmental and unlikeable, but who are only trying to do their jobs. When Maggie finds a lover who does not abuse her as her earlier partners did, she refuses to appreciate his steadfastness, his decency and his loyalty to her, and she tries to drive him away. I was surprised to find myself so unsympathetic to Maggie. My frustration with her grew, and I found myself saying, aloud, God, she's impossible! Even though I didn't like the character, the movie is so good, I could not tear my eyes away from it. Ken Loach is a genius. I think the hardest works are those with unsympathetic main characters. If you still find yourself fascinated, even though you find yourself detesting the protagonist in a movie, it makes the viewing even more memorable. I sometimes feel sad that I have no children; yet, when I see this story, I feel better about it. I also wonder why I cannot muster much sympathy for Maggie, even though I have things in common with the character. Society is especially unforgiving when dealing with parents. In its well-meaning interest in the welfare of the children, it often fails to reach out to the parents who are sometimes quite good people, but who are struggling to cope. Almost everyone could benefit from seeing this movie. It's highly instructive. It makes you think about the roles we, as adults, play in society, and what our responsibilities are. None of the questions and issues raised by this movie are easy to deal with. There are no easy answers. I think both great objectivity and subjectivity are necessary toward finding solutions, and both are seldom possible at the same time; hence, mistakes are made, all around. The character of the good man she finally finds is beautifully played by an unknown actor. I wondered how he could continue to be so good, and yet I felt myself completely frustrated with him and annoyed with him when he tried to explain his reasons for being a political exile from his country of origin in a court hearing. He was so upset that for once, he couldn't think clearly and couldn't express himself adequately. This showed me that despite his good qualities, under extreme pressure, he could be as hard to understand and to help as Maggie is. This movie is based on a true story, which is, sadly, not hard to believe. This same type of situation is played out again and again. What to do? Leave children in questionable households, or take them away? Try to see this movie and to share it with someone who is troubled, who has been abused, and who has had problems dealing with administrations of almost any kind.

Jeffrey's curiosity propels the plot through a convoluted story involving strange characters, sex, drugs, and murder. It's all rather seedy. And the film's excessive violence is annoying.The story's inciting incident is not remotely plausible. The plot makes no sense. Some of the dialogue is sophomoric. And the characters are dreadful.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 January 2009","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Famously in the film Citizen Kane the title character Charles Foster Kane dies in his bed, muttering Rosebud and dropping a snow globe, without anybody other than Kane being visible in the room. Yet the whole film is based on the premise that Rosebud was Kane's last word and a reporter tries to find out the meaning of the word by interviewing people who knew him. So how could he do this if nobody heard him say the word? Towards the end of the film the butler claims that he was in the room when Kane died. We never saw him in the bedroom but not the whole room was shown to us, so it is very much possible. But why is it that he wasn't shown to us being in the room when Kane died? Given how extremely well thought through the film is it is more than likely that this wasn't only done intentionally, but with a purpose.The film mostly is told to us (quite literally) from a subjective point of view and through opinions of people who knew Charles Foster Kane. And Kane was a different kind of person depending on who told the story. A main message of the film - so to speak - is that there is no actual picture of a person, there are just many different fragmented pictures of which none are true or false. In the very first scene of the film we see a sign that says No Trespassing. This sort of makes us the intruders to Xanadu and to Kane's life. The camera goes through his garden around the castle leading into the castle. So in the beginning we, like, become another one of those subjective witnesses who try to get the full picture and who eventually will form an opinion about this person. And to include the viewer into this bunch of unreliable witnesses and to manifest the concept that we are in the same position as all of those characters who told us THEIR story of Kane's life, the viewer obviously (for now) is the only witness to the first act of 'Citizen Kane' and the last chapter of Kane's life. It is this very event that gets the stone rolling. It makes us a witness and now the investigation of Kane's past life can begin. Now if you think of the interviewer\/reporter who asks the people for Kane's story, we mostly see him from behind with the camera looking over his shoulders. Or he is obscured by shadows, a hat and (observating) glasses. Often he simply is off-screen altogether and we apparently are the interviewees' only listeners. The poor man is pretty much faceless. One could say that the interviewer, who never is fleshed out as a character - if you can even call him a character with an own identity - is taking the position of the viewer who witnessed his last word and who wants to find out what it means. You could look at it as an inside joke by Welles, that the very premise of the film is based on what initially looks like a goof.

Yet the whole film is based on the premise that Rosebud was Kane's last word and a reporter tries to find out the meaning of the word by interviewing people who knew him. So how could he do this if nobody heard him say the word? Towards the end of the film the butler claims that he was in the room when Kane died. We never saw him in the bedroom but not the whole room was shown to us, so it is very much possible. But why is it that he wasn't shown to us being in the room when Kane died? Given how extremely well thought through the film is it is more than likely that this wasn't only done intentionally, but with a purpose.The film mostly is told to us (quite literally) from a subjective point of view and through opinions of people who knew Charles Foster Kane. And Kane was a different kind of person depending on who told the story. A main message of the film - so to speak - is that there is no actual picture of a person, there are just many different fragmented pictures of which none are true or false. In the very first scene of the film we see a sign that says No Trespassing. This sort of makes us the intruders to Xanadu and to Kane's life. The camera goes through his garden around the castle leading into the castle. So in the beginning we, like, become another one of those subjective witnesses who try to get the full picture and who eventually will form an opinion about this person. And to include the viewer into this bunch of unreliable witnesses and to manifest the concept that we are in the same position as all of those characters who told us THEIR story of Kane's life, the viewer obviously (for now) is the only witness to the first act of 'Citizen Kane' and the last chapter of Kane's life. It is this very event that gets the stone rolling. It makes us a witness and now the investigation of Kane's past life can begin. Now if you think of the interviewer\/reporter who asks the people for Kane's story, we mostly see him from behind with the camera looking over his shoulders. Or he is obscured by shadows, a hat and (observating) glasses. Often he simply is off-screen altogether and we apparently are the interviewees' only listeners. The poor man is pretty much faceless. One could say that the interviewer, who never is fleshed out as a character - if you can even call him a character with an own identity - is taking the position of the viewer who witnessed his last word and who wants to find out what it means.

Three young, pretty female roommates in a big apartment, one an aspiring actress, another a singer, the third involved in the art world. There's some cutesy, inconsequential dialogue; we are struck right away with the director's command of image, sound (particularly off-screen) and his exquisitely put together sets. Soon we move to an art gallery setting, a young man in a leather jacket arguing angrily with a dealer who is trying to sell his work -- will he be the protagonist? The film in its first couple of reels doesn't give us any answers here; the man leaves with a wealthy patron and potential buyer, but we don't follow them and move on instead to another a brief scene set in the financial world, as a broker or buyer of some kind (Stephen Lack) alternates between shouting about business and some kind of personal issues on the phone. Close on the heels of this scene, we enter another segment of the art world, as one of the roommates - aspiring French actress and student Anna (Emmanuelle Chaulet) is seen perusing the old masters - chiefly Rembrandt and Vermeer - at what turns out to be the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and is in turn perused by our stockbroker, who hands her a note at which point she leaves.This is the scene that introduces the spectacular and fairly indescribable avant-jazz\/classical score by Jon English, one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard, and it also seems to introduce the rest of the film as we will now focus on these characters, and on the difficult lives they lead while being surrounded by and comforted by all the great art - photography, painting, music and architecture - that suffuses the film. An awkward scene in which Anna pretends to not speak English and is accompanied by her roommate Felicity (Grace Philips) as pretend-translator meets Mark (Lack) at a restaurant seems distancing and off-putting, and it seems very uncertain as to whether these two can -or should- meet again. There's also a very subtle and only briefly stated minor theme here about home and what it means; Mark is clearly Canadian and Anna French, and neither seems to really be comfortable - in Mark's case, with his profession and his inner life, in Anna's with America and perhaps her career.Is Mark some kind of creepy stalker? Is Anna a naive innocent, or is she planning on using the wealthy stockbroker for his money? The film never really answers these questions thoroughly, never really gets at what makes Mark so unhappy, why he even more than any of the characters actually working in the arts seems so attracted to beauty and culture; instead it peers obliquely in a few long scenes at the intersections, contemplating and watching, never telling. There is a gorgeous lengthy, probing tracking shot that traces an irregular path through the columns in the portico of the Met that seems to exist just to remind us of how beautiful, how stately and granitic art in the form of architecture can be, while the human beings are utterly frail and often incapable of ever reaching the transcendence in their own lives that they can in fact reach on canvas, in strings and percussion, in marble.I don't want to spoil the rather surprising ending, but I will add that what blew my mind even more than the finish of the film itself was learning that the entire film was improvised - on camera. Completely improvised; Jost says that he didn't have a story at all, really except that it had to involve art (a prerequisite of his funding), and he had the last shot in his head from the beginning. I found that out courtesy of his website, http\/\/www.jon-jost.com\/ where you can learn much more about this great but completely unknown American independent filmmaker, and buy some of his otherwise inaccessible films.I'd only seen one Jost film before, Frameup (1993) which had both the single most irritating character I've ever seen in a film and one of the most powerful and devastating endings I've experienced. On the basis of my memory of that film and this masterpiece, I definitely most see more. All the Vermeers had the widest release of any of Jost's films and might actually be available to some of you, and for its aesthetic pleasures alone - the beauty of the score which verges from neo-baroque to post-Ornette Coleman atonal free jazz, the beauty of the female cast and Chaulet in particular, the sumptuous art and sets, and the striking photography (in 35MM, as far as I know Jost's first in the format) I recommend this to anyone even remotely adventurous.Highest rating ","genre":null},{"date":"20 January 2009","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The film begins with a static shot of the tops of buildings, turrets and spires, an unnamed city that looks old and European but eventually turns out to be Manhattan.

I was ill in bed when it first came out but like thousands of others picked up on it much later via television, which had transformed a half-forgotten curio into a Christmastime classic. A good man, worn down by vicissitudes, is rescued from the abyss and restored to self-worth when the community he's supported rallies round to bail him out of his troubles. Capra's orchestration of human joys and sorrows, of frailties, frustrations, dilemmas and temptations is extraordinarily, dazzlingly, powerfully good. But his tacked-on fantasy elements become irrelevant to a point of annoyance.His 'hereafter' is a cosy extension of Bedford Falls, just dial a prayer to the Chief who can preside with perfect equanimity over World War II and so on but moves heaven and earth to reclaim one random individual from the (pertinently Catholic) sin of trying to do away with himself. This goes directly to the heart of all that's wrong with organised religion. It's partisan and self-serving. The world-without-George would have been better dramatised as a straightforward nightmare from which he awakes with relief to be saved by his friends. Same story, but without the guardian angel who belongs in a lighter-based film. This alternate world is like a scripting equivalent of trick-photography, a leaf through the family album from which all images of George have been carefully snipped while leaving the space around him intact. He still exists along with his memories and he can interact with other people but he's no longer RECOGNISED by his peers, even his loving mother doesn't accept him. In effect he's been blackballed from the club, his achievements stricken from the record. His ultimate oblivion is that of social exclusion, possibly reflecting the deep-seated fear of a good loyal assimilated immigrant like Capra, the American Dream turning to dust.This fear induces conformity, the need to stand with the crowd and to view with prejudice the stranger, the outsider, those who don't fit the frame, young girls who become old maids, wear glasses and work in libraries. It's not enough for a man to be heroic he needs a medal to confirm it like little brother Harry who gets to meet the President. Everyone must shape up and show their credentials (even Clarence the trainee angel). Bert the cop and Ernie the cab-driver also went to war, we're hurriedly told, though when we see them at the end they don't really appear to have gone anyplace.

It was pretty clear that this was a guy who had gone beyond the stereotypes I had of him as Dirty Harry and The Man With No Name. Though I skipped seeing The Rookie in the theater (and who can blame me?), since Unforgiven I've seen every film the man has directed and\/or starred in first-run.And I've also caught up to his back catalog. I think by around 1999-2000 I was basically complete as far as his starring or costarring roles back to Fistful of Dollars. Except for the 2 1\/2 hour musical with a wretched reputation, filmed in 'scope but unavailable in proper aspect ratio at the time. Shortly before I moved away from Chicago, I managed to tape it, uncut and widescreen, from the then-quality Bravo channel. And it has sat unwatched until now, when dear readers after the joy I felt at watching a master at work in Gran Torino I decided to finally dust this baby off...The title song isn't bad - but it's sung by an off-screen chorus as a wagon train heads into California full of farmer-settlers. One of the wagons alas goes off the trail and down a cliff, and Eastwood's young Pardner (he's never named anything else until the end of the film) almost dies along with his brother, only to be saved by drunken, curmudgeonly gold-miner Ben Rumson (Lee Marvin). Gold is found as Pardner's brother is buried, and Rumson quickly stakes a claim and cuts Pardner in for half - riches are to be found, and songs are to be sung.The Singing Pauline Kael accurately described Clint's voice as something like pleasant, light, thin. There's nothing horrible about listening to him, but you forget it immediately. Good thing he didn't try to make a career out of it. Marvin can't sing at all really but apparently enough people found him over-the-top bad that his Wand'rin' Star became a minor cult item. Female lead Jean Seberg (you knew there had to be a woman to cause trouble, didn't you?) was apparently even worse so she's dubbed. The various choruses aren't bad, and They Call the Wind Mariah became something of a small classic due to the powerful baritone of Harve Presnell, a real singer. But apart from that, nothing about the music is particularly interesting and I can barely call the instrumental score to mind now 16 hours after watching it.The Dancing uh, the less said the better. Really.Sex As mentioned, Elizabeth (Seberg) arrives on the scene to help cause disruption and dissent, as her Mormon husband auctions her - the second of his wives - off to the highest bidder, the dead-drunk Rumson. This may seem (well, is) horribly offensive and sexist, as the film treats it all like a good joke, but a fascinating twist soon develops as Elizabeth decides she's in love with Pardner - but also with her husband Rumson - and the three all consent to a plural marriage with Elizabeth as the more-or-less dominant member. Interesting stuff for 1969 and a mainstream release, but again it's all just treated lightly and jokily. It's hard to find the sexual politics either offensive or progressive, they seem there just to provide jokes and perhaps to bring in the youth audience (which they apparently failed to do).Plot development Do you care at this point? Suffice it to say that Rumson slowly corrupts Eastwood with drink and gambling, the two of them hatch a scheme to dig underneath the town and nab all of the gold dust that falls through the floorboards of the various saloons and whorehouses (oh I forgot to tell you, the settlement develops quickly into a boom-town when Marvin diverts 6 French hookers to No Name - clever town name eh? - and sets up bawdy houses and casinos). Eventually the tunnel system undermines the stability of the ground, the town collapses, Marvin the wandering spirit moves on, and thankfully the damn thing is over.Overall Marvin gives the best performance by far - if he was even acting - and there's a weirdness to the whole thing what with the odd sexual situations that does make this kind of fascinating.

Circumstances throw Kay Weston (Monroe), a somewhat slinky saloon gal, in with a non-idealistic, wilderness-savvy brute named Matt Calder (Robert Mitchum).The two, together with Matt's young son, Mark (Tommy Rettig) board a wooden barge and travel down a wild river that boils, churns, roars, and white-caps. It's a plot that vaguely resembles Deliverance (1972), but without the suspense. Throughout River Of No Return, never-smiling Indians, faces all smudged with war paint, get a bum rap as the film's main villains. But then, this is typical of 1950s Hollywood stereotype.The film's story is simple and straightforward, with contrived plot points. The story's message reflects the film's title move on without regrets; don't look back; go with the flow. The wilderness scenery is beautiful. And the title song is just as majestic, in a melancholy sort of way.Shot in Cinema Scope, the film has an annoying widescreen projection, leaving too much black above and below the images, rather like letterbox format. In addition, the film relied too much on rear-screen projection, typical for that era, but terribly hokey looking. The film's background music was at times manipulative and overbearing.The casting of Mitchum and Rettig was fine, although Mitchum gives his usual stiff performance. But Monroe was totally not convincing. And her red lipstick is a hoot in a story about survival.She strums a guitar and sings several songs in the first half; none of them memorable. But her colorful saloon costumes, combined with her brooding, pouty facial expressions, certainly are evocative.River Of No Return probably was better received in its day than it is now. Back in the early 50s, I doubt that audiences were as discerning about cinematographic techniques, thin story lines, or out-of-place lipstick.

But Monroe was totally not convincing. And her red lipstick is a hoot in a story about survival.She strums a guitar and sings several songs in the first half; none of them memorable. But her colorful saloon costumes, combined with her brooding, pouty facial expressions, certainly are evocative.River Of No Return probably was better received in its day than it is now. Back in the early 50s, I doubt that audiences were as discerning about cinematographic techniques, thin story lines, or out-of-place lipstick. Even now, it's not a bad film, if one isn't expecting too much. And that scenery and haunting theme song are terrific.

Simba's encouraging personality to be the best inevitably gets him into trouble and the hard drama starts with the encoding of evil Uncle Scar and a trio of horrible hyenas.

The use of these real life concepts is simply a splendid device to preach to the younger audience, to show them the point of life and its difficult issues, and what better way than a collection of likable characters and easy to understand story.The plot is always consistent with frequent realism in context and the characters make for riveting viewing.
