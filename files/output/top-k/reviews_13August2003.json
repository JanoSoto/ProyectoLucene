The movie is very heavy and won't leave you with a smile on your face but is a must see.The movie is about 2 people(played by Nick Cage and Elizabeth Shue) one a hooker the other an alcoholic. Both live on the dark side of life, this film deals with their struggles to find something better. This is a superb and important film but I too wouldn't recommend it to anyone under 18. Definitely deserving of all the praise it got and will stay with you, Cage and Shue are both flawless. There are more touching moments in this film then I can even recall right now but I will saySPOILER The whole thing with Shue pouring the alcohol over herself is quite powerful. Shue is an extraordinary actress-I want to see more of her!I'm not sure about seeing this movie a second time, it's pretty disturbing and doesn't make me want to see it in multiple viewings but there's no doubt that this is an absolutely superb film and one of Cage's best if not his best, acting role. 9 out of 10 for the movie and 10 out of 10 for the acting.

He has nothing left to live for and climbs to the top of a billboard to await a worthy adversary who will endhis life.  Instead, he gets a somnambulistic psychiatrist on the verge of retirement (Marlon Brando), who convinces him to come down and promptly commits him for observation.In tone, the film is similar to CHOCOLAT (which also stats Depp) and LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE; its environment of a psychiatric hospital where the young Don Juan must prove his sanity reminds me of the grandfather in A PRINCESS BRIDE.  It gives us a point of reference in our own world and prevents the unbridled romanticism of Don Juan's monologues from getting out of hand.No man other than Depp could sit squarely in this modern-world fishbowl and deliver the lines of Don Juan.  He insisted on working with Brando on the film, but he outshines the cinema icon in every shared shot.  His physical beauty is less important than his utter sincerity - a sincerity so convincing that even my I hate chick flicks husband can watch with a straight face and come away in a better mood.As Don Juan says, there are only four questions of value in life What is sacred?  Of what is the spirit made?  What is worth living for?  What is worth dying for?  By the end of the film, he has proven his point the answer to each is the same - only love.  Not that the story answers all of its own questions...Is Don Juan a pathological liar and a schizophrenic?  Is he troubled but sincere?  Does Brando's Dr. Mickler really get conflicting evidence from Don Juan's family, or has he slipped into a daydream fueled by his desire to recapture the part of himself Don Juan represents?  No matter how many times I see the film, I end up believing *in* Don Juan, even if I do not *believe* him.DJDM gets a 7 in spite of being one of my favorite films.

That was *it*?!?!? basically sums up my reaction.All through the film, what really intrigued me was *why* Bruce's character was going through such rough times. Why was his wife ignoring him so cruelly? What had he done that was so wrong in his treatment of that patient that the guy felt he had to shoot him for it? How had Bruce's character fared after that dreadful shooting? All of those questions were answered very simply by the startling revelation that Bruce's character never *had* survived the shooting.

A major character not realizing they're dead was part of Ghost (1990) as well.

DELIRIA), was Michele Soavi's first big foray as a Director. He was the protege of several famous Italian horror directors who took him under their wing, such as Dario Argento, Lamberto Bava and Joe D'Amato. You'd think that someone who was blessed enough to be the understudy to these legendary directors, would have put all of that experience and knowledge to good use.Wrong. STAGE FRIGHT is a laugh-riot, but for all the wrong reasons. Sure, Bava and D'Amato weren't Oscar-winning directors, but you remembered their movies from a particular style that they made you recognize. Soavi, on the other hand, is just one big hack.I was expecting a great deal more from this film. The actors are bad (obviously rounded up at the local theater playhouse), the music is plain nasty (I could picture someone banging out the entire soundtrack on a synthesizer) and the directing is pitiful (unless you call someone who follows a length of cable along a floor with the camera, a genius).What we are given is a thread-bare plot involving a group of struggling actors who are performing some low-budget trash about a serial killer in an owl costume murdering prostitutes (the genius title of the play is called The Night Owl). One of the actresses 'twists her ankle' and seeks medical attention from where else... but a Psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane! Needless to say, someone hitches a ride back with her and all Hell breaks loose when a psychopath is locked inside the theater with everyone.The death scenes are comical, if not laughable. A woman has a pick-axe driven through her mouth, a man is hacked with an axe, two people are chopped in half with a chainsaw, a man has a drill driven through his stomach, two women are stabbed with knives... the ideas are limitless. If not for making the death scenes somewhat spectacular, Soavi could at least have given us some characters to sympathize for. Unfortunately, all of the people trapped inside the theater are a bunch of whiny, sleazy annoying creeps, that you can't wait for each and every one of them to get offed.The heroine of the film who initially 'twisted her ankle', spends half of the time knocked out after she falls off a ladder. It is in the second-half of the film where she wakes up (after everyone has been butchered) and tries to escape the theater. The killer himself never speaks. Apparently, he is an ex-actor (oh, the irony!) who went nuts by chopping up people into little pieces, remarked one woman, and is continuing his work while disguised in an owl costume. The owl costume itself is the only cool thing about the movie. It's the only thing that looks even remotely real.You won't find yourself rooting for the heroine either. She does a lot of stupid things (like in one scene, whining about how she can't move because her ankle hurts, causing several people to get butchered, but in the next scene, is apparently okay to scale ladders and scaffolding). This heroine is also very indiscreet about getting caught. She rifles through a draw looking for keys in one scene, slamming the draws and throwing things around while unnecessarily drawing attention to her whereabouts. In another scene, Soavi has her trying to retrieve a key from underneath a stage floor, the killer sitting atop unaware of her presence below. As she inches along the floor underneath, she makes the loudest noises with her scuffling shoes, you'd have thought she would have removed her shoes first before trying to achieve the key.There is really only one 'scare' scene in the whole movie, and that was when she emerges from underneath the stage floor and is surprised by the killer. Other than that, there was nothing else that made me flinch in the least.Several misleading scenes cause you to believe that something exciting may happen. For example, when the killer explores the 'maintenance room' and eyes a drill press... I had visions of someone getting their head caught in it ala DRILLER KILLER. Alas, that never happens. Also, the poster of STAGE FRIGHT depicts several screaming heads and an axe breaking through what appears to be a fish tank. Well at the beginning of the movie, there is a nurse at the Psychiatric hospital observing fish in a fish tank. I thought that would come into play somehow, like maybe the killer would push her head through it. That never happens either.In fact, my biggest question pertains to the killer and the actor that plays him. The identity of the killer given in the film is Irving Wallace, played by a Clain Parker. Following his background on IMDB, it shows that Clain Parker played the same character, Irving Wallace in a film titled Eleven Days, Eleven Nights, which was filmed in 1986, one year prior. Are these two movies connected somehow? Is STAGE FRIGHT a sequel?Finally, the climax of the film is nothing more than a small puff of smoke. We all expected one last 'scare', but to have one so pitiful as the killer not being dead (surprise, surprise) and getting shot between the eyes by the maintenance guy was just stupid. The heroine didn't even seem to care - she just went back to retrieve her gold watch (obviously that was the most important thing to her), killer gets his head blown off, she proceeds to walk out with the watch, not even flinching. What the Hell? Are we supposed to believe that she has been so desensitized to the killings that she just doesn't care anymore? Right.What a disappointing movie. Soavi went on to direct a few more stinkers including DEMONS 4 and DEMONS 5. Obviously the teachings he received from the legends lead him on to far greater things...

That never happens either.In fact, my biggest question pertains to the killer and the actor that plays him. The identity of the killer given in the film is Irving Wallace, played by a Clain Parker. Following his background on IMDB, it shows that Clain Parker played the same character, Irving Wallace in a film titled Eleven Days, Eleven Nights, which was filmed in 1986, one year prior. Are these two movies connected somehow? Is STAGE FRIGHT a sequel?Finally, the climax of the film is nothing more than a small puff of smoke. We all expected one last 'scare', but to have one so pitiful as the killer not being dead (surprise, surprise) and getting shot between the eyes by the maintenance guy was just stupid. The heroine didn't even seem to care - she just went back to retrieve her gold watch (obviously that was the most important thing to her), killer gets his head blown off, she proceeds to walk out with the watch, not even flinching. What the Hell? Are we supposed to believe that she has been so desensitized to the killings that she just doesn't care anymore? Right.What a disappointing movie. Soavi went on to direct a few more stinkers including DEMONS 4 and DEMONS 5. Obviously the teachings he received from the legends lead him on to far greater things... (cue eyeball roll).My Rating - 2 out of 10 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"13 August 2003","score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  Sixteen years ago, as a young, pregnant mother of a toddler, I rented this movie, and could not believe anyone could make a picture with so many problems, and still have a career.

He wants the plans to Alderine as he holds Princess Leia hostage while her two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 have escaped on the pod taking them to another planet called Tatooine where they are slaves to Jawa's (aliens who own a pawn shop full of robots) until a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his Uncle Owen decide to buy the droids and use them.With great ambitions, Luke wants to train in the fleet academy where many rebel pilots are trained and fly X-Wing's. But his Uncle and Aunt refuse because there aren't enough people to work on the farm, leaving Luke in disappointment. He has heard rumors about Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Knights who protected the galaxy at one point, but Kenobi has never came out of his shell and is tired of hearing stories, even about his father who served as a Jedi Knight.Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) shows himself when spies attack Luke and C-3PO after losing R2-D2. Obi-Wan tells Luke about the Jedi Knights and how they protected most of the galaxies in the world; even shows Luke a light saber, an energy sword with a light as the blade that can cut through any objects from walls to human flesh. Luke even finds out about his father being in the Jedi before he turned to the dark side.Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids return to Uncle Owen's house where his uncle, aunt, the townspeople and the Jawa's are dead and is revealed that anybody who talked to R2 and C-3PO were eliminated. With nobody left in his family, Luke and the droids join Obi-Wan where they head into the town of Tatooine where it's full of gamblers, mercenaries, everything people consider 'evil.' But in order to get out of Tatooine and make it to Alderine, Luke and Obi-Wan must confront a mercenary by the name of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in which Luke has to sell his speeder to get the money; so now as all of them go to Han's Millennium Falcon, the storm troopers and other spies have a head out for Solo for which they leave the city of Tatooine and escape into outer space for which where they were heading doesn't exist anymore as Darth Vader's ship, the Death Star, is the only thing in space where the Falcon automatically goes in.It is where they catch up with Princess Leia and rescue her while they try to escape as Obi-Wan duels with Vader in which Obi-Wan dies as he disappears leaving Luke abandoned. It is now up to Luke, Han, and the Princess to join the rebel scouts in order to defeat the Death Star and save the planets from destruction.Star Wars is one of the greatest adventures ever made with a hero destined with dreams, a mercenary with a chip on his shoulder and great characters to which people will always make references about them and talk about the greatest moments of this film.
