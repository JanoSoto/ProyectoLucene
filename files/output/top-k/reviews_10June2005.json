That said you must be warned, Before Sunrise is what I label a 'hit or miss' movie (no, not in the rhyming slang sense, tsk), in that the impact of the film will depend largely on the viewer, you will either love it or hate it. Also in the film not a lot happens, there is no real drama, conflict or action just 2 people who meet share a day together in Vienna and fall in love. It is a 'talky' film, it almost all dialogue, the dialogue will not always be easy to digest for everyone, I found the film to drag at points, but there are at least some things in here that I think everyone can relate to. What makes the film a success (to some, not all) is the way that this relationship unfolds, with sublime realism and tenderness. A very simple film on the surface it has intricacies that are open for the viewer to interpret in relation to their own lives and feelings.This story put me instantly in mind of Lost in Translation, except for the age gap, the other difference is we have no prior knowledge of the main characters when they meet. We have two young folk travelling home through Europe by train, Jesse, a typically sceptical American guy who has just split with his long distance girlfriend who he left behind in Madrid to go on a whirlwind tour of Europe and Celine, a young idealistic French student, a quiet daydreamer. After sitting opposite each other they get talking, initially about how relationships ware thin with time, which relates to the central theme of the film, and after some nervous stutters a chemistry begins to grow between them. This is pretty much how the film develops, the pair share each others views on the world around them, the after life and the little idiosyncrasies in American and European cultures as the train hurtles on. Not everyone will be able to cope with such a duologue based story, I took time adjusting but unlike Waking Life I managed to do so because the words were delivered by characters as conversation, not monologue by random folk, and it had a context which made the experience easier to relate to. Some of the discussions connected with me, others made me recoil. Some of the philosophising and conversation was elegant in a manner, such as the talk of visions of the dead other times it was grating like Jesse's awful TV idea, made me cringe. This is only to be expected when you are watching 2 characters talk for extended periods about a wide range of issues. Sure these are conversations you would rather engage in than watch but it is the context that really matters, this does not really take hold until later in the film. The characters were not the sort of people I would spend time with personally, they were sorta whiny youths who seem slightly rebellious and perhaps overly sure of the validity of their own views, however although I did not really relate to them (usually not a good thing) I began to enjoy the situation. This is the sort of situation you always hope will occur, you start a conversation with stranger and you get to know each other and find you have an instant connection. Watching these two connect just by talking, the most simple thing, was strangely captivating. I think because it is so believable a situation because the 2 actors who just play it like normal everyday folk having a chat, it made it easy to relate to.On the spur of the moment Jesse, who has to get off the train in Vienna, asks Celine to spend the day with him instead of continuing her journey. She accepts and off they go to talk some more against the backdrop of one of the world's most beautiful cities (after Edinburgh of course), the shots of Vienna really show it off accurately in all it's wonderfully intricate grandeur contrasting with that almost desolate, sleepy continental atmosphere. You start to see slight signs of conflict between the pair's views on life, Jesse dismisses the palm reader who pesters them and has a generally sceptical view on life while Celine (being European) has a very open mind about such things. These subtle differences seem to draw them closer together rather than push them apart, they gradually and visibly become more and more comfortable and relaxed with each other.The film does drag at times, especially in the section where they first get off the train, and it took it's time to work it's magic on me. As their evening wore on though I did finally begin to get absorbed, as I knew the two would soon have to part. That is the beauty of the film, in the fact that for the couple's time is very limited however this means that their relationship will not have the chance to be stretched and eroded by time. Time won't allow for them to grow tired of each others company as it is time itself that will simply dissipate, not their connection. They are able to let go before that bond grows old and fizzles out. That is what makes the film a success, you feel you have had an insight into something most people can only dream of occurring, yet one that is entirely possible if we have the will and desire to act on our instincts. As I said not a film for everyone but one that contains a rare hidden beauty for those that can connect and persevere with it.

I also have no doubt that Richard Kelly, first-time writer\/director of this film, is talented. But after seeing the film for the first time recently with its strengths I also found parts to become a little 'much' (pretentious may not be the right word to use, some would say it though), or at the least trying to be weirder (or surreal if you would put it that way) then it needed. The story is an unusual one, as is its central character played by Jake Ghyllenhaal, however Kelly tries to cover too much ground in one sitting of less than two hours, and also loses much of his conviction in the little coherence of the story by the last ten minutes (especially the last five, although it is not elusive or misunderstood by me, that's not what I had a problem with). There is also something off about how Kelly injects his dream-like projections in the film, which I'll get to in a moment.First off, I would like to point out what I did find commendable in the film. Kelly is a very good director of actors, and out of Ghyllenhaal he does get a truly tortured soul to emerge through. Although one might find a similarly troubled character in a film like The Good Girl, he does make Darko his own. There are also good performances from Jena Malone as a sort-of love interest of Donnie's, and even by Patrick Swayze in a surprising and funny role as a motivational speaker. Also, Kelly knows how to set up certain scenes and let them work well in his 1988 setting (the introduction to Donnie's school was one, where there was an interesting collage of images against a cool 80's new-wave song), and creates some dark comedy in Donnie's rebellious nature at times (especially against the forces of authority). And in the first third\/quarter of the film, Kelly sets up a story that attempts to dig into a kind of adolescent mood that follows many outsiders in high school movies.Where I did find that the film went into territory that is questionable is how Donnie's strange phenomena is explained, or not explained. The elements of time travel, paranoid-schizophrenia, the controlling power of hallucinations, the end of the world, etc, are all jumbled up at times and Kelly doesn't seem to know where to go except to make things seem 'cool', perhaps, in a dark way (maybe like a high schooler Fight Club). A problem I had though is that, unlike a controlled and smart surrealist director like Bunuel or Lynch, Kelly doesn't take the visions and ideas anywhere except to a muddled point. There are so many ideas about topics and behavior that one almost loses sight of what the story is working to, which I won't reveal but is a little too obvious.In a way, the end result reminds me of seeing a student film at a university- you appreciate and get entertained by scenes and lines and such, but you see more talent that will later emerge than actually present. In short, like with 2004's Garden State (also directed by a first-timer Zack Braff), the hype doesn't entirely suffice, at least for me. Maybe it might serve more on a repeat viewing, or of the director's cut (which are really just the deleted scenes on the theatrical DVD incorporated in redux style). For now, I give it a B grade, however I would recommend it for most high school kids looking for a 'head-trip' who are still vulnerable to masterpieces like Eraserhead and Un Chien Andalou.

I think its supposed to be a joke but it actually just hammers another nail into the now splintered and well nailed coffin lid of what was once a tightly written and lavishly produced T.V experience. Trekkies should weep.

So you can't really call this mainstream, as it's not for everyone's tastes. That's why his films seem to have great impact in the realistic visuals and material context. It's flowing with originality, good psychological elements, erotica and it holds such an artistic feel with its stunning visuals and elegance to show.This thought-provoking drama is rather stimulating and quite downbeat. Though, it's mostly a talkative film; the dialogue is dense on many levels that it's truly captivating. It's more the material context that tries to shock and explore in a subtle way rather than the horrific visuals and shocks that we come to expect from most of Cronenberg's films. It doesn't contain much graphic moments, only about one or two. The sub-plots are drawn up quite well with dabbling in sexual desires and pleasure, technology (instruments and tools of the trade), the twins physical bond, addiction and a rather modernistic world. It's filled with sharp and intense sequences that are entrenched with an effective music score, as it overwhelmingly draws you in. This unsettling aurora builds into paranoia in the last half of the film and it ends rather disturbingly. The stylish production valves are incredibly glossy and professional. With beautifully crafted and slick cinematography. The gloomy colours that fill the screen hold great contrast in the moody and detail backdrop.

Think about what Phantom has been mainly criticised for, and then look at my reasoning below. In 1977 Lucas made star wars as a labour of love. Only star wars. Empire and Jedi were made to cash in on that films success, so when people say that he has only made phantom for the money, so what if he has? He's only human after all, and if its money he wants then he did well didn't he? Film-making is a money making business, and only a handful of directors are really in it for the artistic effect it has on the world. If Lucas made these new films halfheartedly, then so what?What you have to remember firstly is that when star wars was made, the effects were top quality and state of the art. Nothing like them had been seen before, so of course they were going to get praise. These days, instead of cardboard spaceships and wires, we have CGI. Yes its weightless and unreal, with too many smooth edges and not enough variation in the different shades of colour. But was Lucas really expected to go back to technology he had used twenty years ago?The fact that many people accused Phantom as just being a tool Lucas used to sell merchandise is a moot point. Star wars was made for a generation of children (and of course adults) who were brought up imagining what they were playing with. Toys and action figures weren't as advanced, but now they are, and mainly because of star wars we have a lot of merchandising. Lucas, clearly with one eye on that market has produced a movie thats not only a movie, but a cash cow he can make even more money off. So what if star wars toys were overflowing in stores around at Christmas? Lucas knows where the money is at, and he went straight for the sweet spot. If the film you make has the power to earn you x amount of dollars another way, then why not exploit that road?The above are just superficial points. Now we have the meat of my argument.Star wars comes out. Empire comes out. Jedi comes out. All three are lauded as magnificent films upon release, and twenty five years later they still are. When you think of star wars today, you usually think of great effects, great characters, and a great easy to follow storyline. Nobody thinks about the faults.Lets look at some possible areas for discussion relating to the always loved original star wars trilogy, and the mostly disliked Phantom.Jake Lloyd\/Hayden Christensen vs Mark Hamillyes I know Christensen isn't in Phantom, but you can see where I'm coming from. Yes, Lloyd is irritating as Anakin, and most people just wanted to punch his stupid whiny voice. But then, isn't that the same way most people felt about Hamill after star wars? Who can honestly say that Hamill is anything but a weener as Skywalker? Who would you rather be; Luke or Han solo? Nuff said. And Christensen is repeatedly attacked for his less than impressive acting skills. Did Hamill win an Oscar for best actor? Did Harrison Ford or Carrie Fisher? No they didn't. When the anakin actors are criticised, shouldn't we be remembering that hamill and co weren't exactly amazing back in the original trilogy?Old scripts vs new scriptPoor dialogue? Meaningless expressions and sentences? Words that nobody in the audience understand? Which am i talking about, phantom or star wars a new hope? Yes Lucas can't write a script to save his life, but as Harrison Ford so eloquently put 'you can type this s***, but you sure as hell can't say it.' the dialogue in the originals was shoddy, as it is today. Remember that when you say that Phantom has a poor script.Jar Jar Binks vs c-3poYes binks needs shooting. He very nearly ruined the movie. But in every nostalgia programme i watch people always refer to c-3po as being the most annoying character in the series. In fact, after empire came out there were calls for his head, and yes he is slightly annoying in that film, as binks is in Phantom. If we're going to attack Binks, we damn well have to attack c-3po.Overall what I'm trying to say is that while phantom has its much criticised faults, so did the originals. If we're going to have a go at Phantom, i think its fair that we do the same for the originals. After all, its slightly unfair to pick out various problems with one film, but then ignore them completely for another film thats identical. Don't let nostalgia blind you to the truth.

I would like to focus on the failure of Ed Wood as an artist -- as opposed to his success as a human being -- and explore the movie's definition of sucess. A few years ago, a very insightful gentleman made a number of brilliant points about why this movie wasn't a hit. (Check the IMDb comment index for An Unlikely Masterpice.) Basically Ed Wood's failure shows that the American dream is a lie. Do your best, believe in yourself and never quit, and you can still end up with nothing. Unquestionably that is the message the mass audience got, and that is why the movie bombed in theaters. But is that all the movie really says? If Ed Wood's failure as an artist was the only point, this movie would be just another dreary tract of the socialist realist school -- like Rod Serling's Requiem For A Heavyweight. Ed Wood is just another dreamer betrayed by the system -- he's Willy Loman gone to Hollywood.If you watch the movie closely there's another story going on. This is the story of Ed Wood's growth as a human being. Even as his movie dreams fail, the movie charts his successful -- I repeat, successful -- efforts to form meaningful relationships with people he cares about.Notice how the movie quietly records Ed's growth in relationships. At the beginning, he's living with Dolores. He doesn't tell her he likes to wear women's clothes. He's a gentle man, and he tries to be caring, but he lies to her and manipulates her in many ways. And their relationship suffers, not because of his lack of talent, but his inability to trust. (Note the superb performance by Sarah Jessica Parker, who makes the potentially grating character of the wife who doesn't understand into a completely compelling and sympathetic figure.) When Dolores leaves him, Ed has the opportunity to retreat, to become more bitter and manipulative. Instead he learns to be more open and honest. When he meets Cathy, (Patricia Arquette's character,) who is completely innocent and trusting, he knows he can lie to her and start another relationship like the one he had with Dolores. Instead he chooses to tell her the truth right away, literally on the first date. This extraordinary act of courage is in many ways the most compelling moment in the film. And the sweetness of their relationship is a victory many great artists never attain.The same principle applies to Ed Wood's friendship with Bela Lugosi. On one level, this is indeed supreme pathos -- Lugosi who once made masterpieces is reduced to working for a talentless dreamer. But as men, as opposed to artists, Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi are both redeemed by their special friendship. It becomes very clear that, whatever is failings as an artist, Ed Wood is incapable of failure as a friend. He agonizes over Lugosi's decline and gives everything he has so that the great actor can spend his last days doing what he really loves. The fact that the movies they make together are not great works of art is recorded honestly -- but the emotional value of their friendship is also important. These are two men with nothing who choose to create a family bond, and this too is a great victory.Watch the scene where Ed Wood is at home with his adoring new girlfriend Cathy and a dying Lugosi calls for help on the phone. It would be so easy to ignore Bela now that Ed has someone new in his life. But Ed Wood is as incapable of cruelty as he is of artistic success. What he is capable of is growth as a person -- a careful study of the picture shows that he is actually a far better man at the end than he was at the beginning. Far from being pessimistic about life, in many ways ED WOOD is an uplifting movie about the values of friendship, trust, and intimacy.

It becomes very clear that, whatever is failings as an artist, Ed Wood is incapable of failure as a friend. He agonizes over Lugosi's decline and gives everything he has so that the great actor can spend his last days doing what he really loves. The fact that the movies they make together are not great works of art is recorded honestly -- but the emotional value of their friendship is also important. These are two men with nothing who choose to create a family bond, and this too is a great victory.Watch the scene where Ed Wood is at home with his adoring new girlfriend Cathy and a dying Lugosi calls for help on the phone. It would be so easy to ignore Bela now that Ed has someone new in his life. But Ed Wood is as incapable of cruelty as he is of artistic success. What he is capable of is growth as a person -- a careful study of the picture shows that he is actually a far better man at the end than he was at the beginning. Far from being pessimistic about life, in many ways ED WOOD is an uplifting movie about the values of friendship, trust, and intimacy. ","genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"10 June 2005","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Not only is this bittersweet story of a failed Hollywood dreamer by far the best movie of Tim Burton's career, it seems to have inspired more compelling commentary than any other film on IMDb. I would like to focus on the failure of Ed Wood as an artist -- as opposed to his success as a human being -- and explore the movie's definition of sucess. A few years ago, a very insightful gentleman made a number of brilliant points about why this movie wasn't a hit. (Check the IMDb comment index for An Unlikely Masterpice.) Basically Ed Wood's failure shows that the American dream is a lie. Do your best, believe in yourself and never quit, and you can still end up with nothing. Unquestionably that is the message the mass audience got, and that is why the movie bombed in theaters. But is that all the movie really says? If Ed Wood's failure as an artist was the only point, this movie would be just another dreary tract of the socialist realist school -- like Rod Serling's Requiem For A Heavyweight. Ed Wood is just another dreamer betrayed by the system -- he's Willy Loman gone to Hollywood.If you watch the movie closely there's another story going on. This is the story of Ed Wood's growth as a human being. Even as his movie dreams fail, the movie charts his successful -- I repeat, successful -- efforts to form meaningful relationships with people he cares about.Notice how the movie quietly records Ed's growth in relationships. At the beginning, he's living with Dolores. He doesn't tell her he likes to wear women's clothes. He's a gentle man, and he tries to be caring, but he lies to her and manipulates her in many ways. And their relationship suffers, not because of his lack of talent, but his inability to trust. (Note the superb performance by Sarah Jessica Parker, who makes the potentially grating character of the wife who doesn't understand into a completely compelling and sympathetic figure.) When Dolores leaves him, Ed has the opportunity to retreat, to become more bitter and manipulative. Instead he learns to be more open and honest. When he meets Cathy, (Patricia Arquette's character,) who is completely innocent and trusting, he knows he can lie to her and start another relationship like the one he had with Dolores. Instead he chooses to tell her the truth right away, literally on the first date. This extraordinary act of courage is in many ways the most compelling moment in the film. And the sweetness of their relationship is a victory many great artists never attain.The same principle applies to Ed Wood's friendship with Bela Lugosi. On one level, this is indeed supreme pathos -- Lugosi who once made masterpieces is reduced to working for a talentless dreamer. But as men, as opposed to artists, Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi are both redeemed by their special friendship. It becomes very clear that, whatever is failings as an artist, Ed Wood is incapable of failure as a friend.

I had overhead so many negative reviews of this feature that I think it had seeped to deeply into my mind when I chose to pick it up. I had already thought that it was going to be a poor excuse of a film when I placed it in my DVD player, but to my surprise (literally), this was actually a well developed, superbly acted film. Now, it wasn't the greatest movie that I have ever seen, but as far as entertainment goes, this film did lift an eyebrow. The script was loose, but well thought out, the acting was well above your average independent feature, and the tone was light. I think that is what I liked most about this film (outside of the acting) was that it never went too deep into itself, but instead kept it light and seemingly fluffy. In an era of over-zealous directors, Eric Blakeney proved to me that he could gather great actors, place them in a decent story, and produce amazing results. I wish other directors would take his lead and push more towards this than just giving up and relying on the name of the actor to sell their film.There are three elements that really caught my attention while watching this film, and I must begin with the acting. You had in this film some of Hollywood's most dramatic, comedic, and talented people doing their best work in this little film called Gun Shy. Liam Neeson represented his character so well, that I nearly forgot most of the time that he was Neeson from Schindler's List, but instead this neurotic agent with problems around every bend. The twitching of his hands, the ability to bring life to his words and his comedic timing was brilliant. He really was a shining light in this film. This rubbed off onto the others in this film causing greatness from everyone. Oliver Platt was hysterical playing off of every Italian stereotype that can be seen in such hits as The Sopranos and The Godfather, but he does it with so much originality and creativity that it feels and smells fresh. I found myself laughing at everything Platt did, and he played so well against Neeson that I am surprised that the two haven't made more films together. Then there was Sandra. While this wasn't the mightiest role for her, she was enjoyable to watch. She didn't overdo it, nor was she lacking. She was the only average character in the film, and I blame this in part to only having a few short scenes in the film (kinda underdeveloped). The rest of the cast was well above par. What was interesting about the characters and actors of Gun Shy is that I wanted to watch them. They, unlike some recent Hollywood blockbusters, brought life into the film and they had fun (a Hollywood curse word) with this production. You could tell, and it provided some enjoyable cinema.The next element was the story. Director\/writer Eric Blakeney did a great job of complementing the actors with a simple script. This may sound like an insult, but so many times we watch films that have this overdeveloped story that causes are actors to get lost, our audience to get lost, and ultimately our film to get lost. By keeping the story simple, Blakeney was able to bring the best from the actors. I do believe that the script complimented the actors and pushed them to explore new possibilities of characters. It was a story that we had seen time and time again, but again, like the acting, it seemed original and fresh because it was simple and complete. My only gripes about the story is that it could have developed Bullock's character a bit more and sharpened the ending a bit, but that is all. Honestly, I thought the film worked the way the script was written, no changes were needed, but healthy constructive feedback is always welcomed.Finally, I would like to say that I loved the theme of this film. Perhaps it is where I am in my life that allowed it to hit me so hard, but for me it was sheer bliss. Here you have a story, which all the central characters hate, loathe, and dislike their lives. From Charlie's hatred and fear of getting killed by his job, to Fulvio's passion for a better life, to the Colombian's wanting to escape in love together, to even all of Charlie's friends in his group therapy that hate their lives as well, there is just this overwhelming sense of dislike for the world when this film begins. As we grow with our characters, they begin to see the brighter side of life and that we all need that moment of change to help us grow and develop ourselves. I thought this was a great theme to bring into a zany mob comedy, but it worked. So many times in Hollywood we see the happy family man who gets caught up in the mob mess, but never have we seen so many disillusioned people gathered in one film and still make it a comedy. It was very close to perfection.Overall, I enjoyed this film. I will say it again, it wasn't the best I have ever seen, but it did provide two hours of entertainment and sometimes that is all you can ask of a film (though lately it is becoming harder and harder). The acting is what pulled me into the picture, and the depressing beginning theme kept me glued to the screen. I surprise myself sometimes because this was not a crazy film. It was a generic story that allowed the actors and the director to be original and creative. You don't see that much anymore, and it was sheer bliss to finally witness it in the film Gun Shy.Grade **** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"10 June 2005","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I was very surprised by this film.

It will be a classic and permanent favorite of those who have their own internal time machines and can relive, or experience for the first time, the paranoia, despair and confusion that were rampant betwixt Vietnam, Woodstock (featured in the film I might add!) and Watergate.A classic to those with vision.

Me and my cousin had the choice of seeing this, Lost in Space or Godzilla. I wanted to see Lost in Space, and my cousin wanted to see Godzilla. In the end we came to a compromise; we'll see Armageddon. It looked decent enough, and its advert was on the t.v in every ad break so we though Why Not? Suffice to say, I'm glad we went to see this.Starting with a spectacular scene of destruction involving a space shuttle, moving onto a spectacular scene of destruction in New York, and then bringing us into touch with the plot, this film never once lets up with its pace. Its so fast and energetic, and you never have time to ponder any inaccuracies or errors. If we want to be highly entertained, this will suit you to a tee.Performance wise, this film hits every note on the head. Bruce Willis has always been a great actor to me, and in Armageddon he excels as cynical, hard edged and deeply patriotic father Harry Stamper. His daughter Grace is played by Liv Tyler, a beautiful girl who has been very understated in her role. Credit where credits due, she carries the slower more thoughtful earthside scenes well, linking to great effect with the impressive Bill Bob Thornton. Some people have said that Armageddon didn't give enough focus to what was happening on Earth while the asteroid was being dealt with, but Tyler and Thornton cover their end well.Ben Affleck. He's always had that slightly annoying presence, and recent flops haven't helped him either. But here, back in 1998 when he was given fourth billing in a Michael Bay movie, as opposed to when he was first billed in Michael Bays Pearl Harbour, he is actually quite likable. Not having to carry a movie is better for him, as lets face it he won't ever win a best actor Oscar. Here though, he is quite endearing as AJ, the young oil driller who is led by his feelings, and not his brain. Indeed, it is hilarious when Willis says 'you all right kid?', and Affleck answers with 'yeah of course, considering I've never been this scared before in my life, ever.' he has that boyish appeal, and here is when he really did look like he had a good career ahead of him. Nowadays of course, its different.The supporting cast are great as well. Steve Buscemi is gifted as a comedian, albeit a slightly weird one, and he has a lot of fun in his role. Although admittedly you do want to slap him when he starts going crazy and firing the machine gun (which after repeated viewings of the film i still haven't worked out where it came from).Keith David is always good value, and he gets the biggest laugh in the film when the astronauts start singing, and he turns to Thornton and says 'so trueman, this is who you found to save the planet.' the subplot involving him and the 'secondary protocol' is unnecessary, but it does have a certain 'this could happen' feel to it. Its easy to see President Bush making the mistake the President in Armageddon made, and trusting his advisor's over NASA, causing the death of the planet. Will Patton is good as Willis' best mate, and Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, and William Fichtner are all humorous and lovable characters. The acting by some is slightly weaker than you'd expect, but this is a big dumb summer blockbuster and Oscar winning acting is never going to be likely.The effects, backed up by the huge budget, are astounding, and standout sequences are the opening destruction raining down on New York and the shuttles take off. The meteors are well realised, and the asteroid looks incredibly menacing in evil, surrounded by green\/blue gases and chunks of wicked looking rock.A brilliant soundtrack, coupled to Trevor Rabins haunting and melancholic score gives the movie energy and emotion when required. Indeed, in the beautifully written sequence where Willis says goodbye to daughter grace is superbly done, with the great acting coupled with Trevor Rabin working his magic to draw every extra ounce of love and sadness from the scene.You can easily say the film has problems, not least in Michael Bays inability to keep his camera from moving in six directions at once, and the need to keep every shot down to less than a second in length. But this is a summer film, so sharp editing is required to keep the action sequences going at a lightning fast pace.Overall, this is great film. And if you don't shed a tear when Willis blows himself up with the asteroid, or when Patton is reunited with his son, you aren't alive.Essential viewing!

Star Wars gave new meaning to visual appeal and opened an entire galaxy of aliens, heroes, villains, soldiers, and legends to everyone everywhere. With inflation accounted for, Star Wars still stands as the best box office hit ever. But despite all the accomplishments of Star Wars Episode IV without the success of Episode V The Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars series would never have reached the longevity and greatness it has today.We all know the story. Luke is the last (as portrayed then) hope for a struggling rebel alliance trying to put a stop to the harsh, tyrannical rule of the Galactic Empire. Along with a bizarre group of companions (Chewbacca, Han Solo, Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C3PO, and R2D2) Luke goes from a typical poor farmer boy to blowing up the biggest space station in the empire. The Empire Strikes Back elaborates. With Obi-Wan having been killed by the mysterious Darth Vader Luke meets the isolated and nearly deranged Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo and Leia make shelter at the City in the Clouds only to be betrayed by Lando, Han's old friend who is the proprietor of the city. With his friends in captivity with the Empire, Luke abandons his training with Yoda prematurely and goes to save them. Luke and Vader confront one another giving the world the first great lightsaber duel and a true look at the power of the 'Force' and its manifestations.

Star Wars gave new meaning to visual appeal and opened an entire galaxy of aliens, heroes, villains, soldiers, and legends to everyone everywhere. With inflation accounted for, Star Wars still stands as the best box office hit ever. But despite all the accomplishments of Star Wars Episode IV without the success of Episode V The Empire Strikes Back the Star Wars series would never have reached the longevity and greatness it has today.We all know the story. Luke is the last (as portrayed then) hope for a struggling rebel alliance trying to put a stop to the harsh, tyrannical rule of the Galactic Empire. Along with a bizarre group of companions (Chewbacca, Han Solo, Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C3PO, and R2D2) Luke goes from a typical poor farmer boy to blowing up the biggest space station in the empire. The Empire Strikes Back elaborates. With Obi-Wan having been killed by the mysterious Darth Vader Luke meets the isolated and nearly deranged Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo and Leia make shelter at the City in the Clouds only to be betrayed by Lando, Han's old friend who is the proprietor of the city. With his friends in captivity with the Empire, Luke abandons his training with Yoda prematurely and goes to save them.

Michael Radford's Il Postino had played the night before, and never are there two more different films than B Monkey and the other one! The novel by Andrew Davies was a joy and it's translation to the screen suffers because of the adaptation we see in front of our eyes. It appears this movie has been badly chopped up as indicated by comments by Mr. Radford.This is a film about opposite characters that attract one another in ways that in other circumstances, they wouldn't have met. We meet the nerdish Alan Furnace, a teacher who also volunteers at a hospital where he loves to play jazz at night. He is fond of the great Django Reinhardt, a legend guitarist, whose records one hears on the background.Beatrice is a young woman with a past. She is trying to get out of that life and the unsavory characters around her. When she meets Alan, she has no clue of what is going to happen to her, but she falls for him. Alan wants to get out of London to a quieter and more subdued atmosphere in which he feels Beatrice will feel happy too.Beatrice's past gets in the way as Paul and Bruno come to interrupt the idyllic home life Alan and Beatrice have made for themselves, but in spite of the dangers, in an ironic twist, the couple finally manage to find peace in their newly found paradise.Jared Harris is perfect as Alana. Asia Argento gives a complex reading on Beatrice a role that offers her a lot of opportunities. Rupert Everett and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make good contributions to the film.The original film score by Luis Bacalov, a contributor to Mr. Radford in Il Postino, is easy on the ears. The other non original songs are well selected and give the film another texture.Although Mr. Radford did his best with the film, one can only recommend the viewer to check out Andrew Davies novel that is the basis of the movie.

Firstly Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a great mix of Batmans enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads within the story and penguin works in the same way that the joker worked in the original. The sets are stunning and immaculate. Gotham city has so many dark alleyways that you could never know what's happening at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which at times seems to lapse and then not recover for while. Tim Burtons direction bring superhero films into a new realm. Beats all the superman films and the other Batman films by a mile. Though in terms of realisation the new Batman begins has a bite where this one lacks, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.*First review written by me at 16. Re-written at 21*Tim Burton has an interesting history in film, between the surreal Pee Wee's Big Adventure and mis-interpreted Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's career has gone from an artistic darkly comic director, to unimaginative copy-cat of his own work. I still stand by my original review in that this film is very cleverly directed, beautifully shot, with stunning towering set pieces, but a script that goes from cheesy melodrama, to cheap and nasty humour. Though with some terribly written scenes there are some, incredible ones. Mainly those concerning antagonists Catwoman and Penguin. One scene in particular concerning the two concocting a frivolous ploy to destroy batman is one that springs to mind. The acting is first class, Danny DeVito is deliciously theatrical and sinister, Michelle Pfeiffer relentlessly sexy and smooth. Since my original review Dark Knight was released. Unfortunately for Burton I retract my youthful statement of his originality over Nolan. Dark Knight surpasses Batman Returns and almost eclipses its existence, but this instalment still has great merit and will stand out as one of the greatest superhero films, not to mention cementing Batman as the greatest superhero franchise ever.
