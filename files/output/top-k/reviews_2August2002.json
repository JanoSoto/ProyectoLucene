I even played Resident Evil Survivor and if you have played this, you know what I mean.  All right, to the movies credit, I thought the sets were awesome.  The sets really conveyed the corrupt corporation image and I loved the gritty white color scheme the set designer used.  Also, I too enjoyed the beginning very much.  It grips you right from the start and I thought it was a great way to kick off the movie.  However, from there on it pretty much goes right off track. The acting is horrendous.  I have no idea how anyone would fine the characters well-developed as they acted as they they didn't even want to be there most of the time.  I felt no connections whatsoever to them and found nearly every line of dialouge humorously misspoken or just out of place althogether.  On top of that, the characters looked like they saw zombies everyday of their life.  I didn't believe anyone was scared for a second.  And if the characters aren't scared, why the heck should I be?  Now, like I said, I love the games.  Obviously, the makers of this film wanted to attract the fan-base of the game series.  So why in the WORLD did they deviate so far from the games storyline???  They didn't even include the characters from the game!  I would have been happy if they had just had the charcters names and were completely different.  Ok, maybe not happy, but Id buy it.  OK, back to something I liked.  I really do think that there were some interesting ideas in this movie.

Is about the day to day, how people like us survive to the city again and again, and live to tell about it. The characters are so real. If you can't relate to one of them, if you hate one and love the other, then you can't sence the flow of time. Personally I was always waiting to see what happened to Linda because I feel inmediately in love with her personality. She is so frustrated because of what she's done, wants to go back in time and make things up, to demostrate her real love for her husband and the desire to be happy with her counscience even if Earl is dead.And the poor Stanley.

Tom Cruise's expression during the interview is fantastic, although I'm not sure what he was thinking.

Simply put this just could have been a lot better (and I am a fan of the cartoon too).Firstly it seems to be designed from a very narrow standpoint. People that loved the normal crew but hated Scrappy Doo may be just about catered for. However I can't help but feel the only characters accurate to the TV series was Scooby and Shaggy. I personally would have much rather seen the film simply about those two but they decided to include all the others, including Scrappy who is made a humiliating joke of on several occasions rather then being included in the crew. If the makers really hated the Scrappy cartoons (I seem to remember them being pretty successful at the time so obviously not everyone agrees with them) they should have just forgotten about him. If I had done this I would have happily forgotten about all but Shaggy and Scooby.While Scrappy is made to look pathetic, the other characters comical flaws are somewhat ironed out. Daphne has learnt to do martial arts (no surprise with her being played by Sarah Buffy Michelle Gellar), Velma is far less plain then she should be (putting stupid glasses on a really attractive woman is a very poor movie cliché that never worked). Fred actually comes out even more cardboard then in the cartoons. However he does suddenly become an adept combatant with a chain near the end, which seems somewhat out of character.The film seems undecided about how much is realism and how much is cartoon style. Switching from parody of cartoon events to attempts at originality and back like you're watching two different movies and switching channels. The soundtrack is also similarly confused, sounding like an awkward cartoon parody at some points and virtually empty at others. The plot is predictable, as are the jokes (and they are pretty slow to come too). Even the special effects are poor and unimaginative.The plot...well the less said about that the better. You can see what they've tried to do with it, and frankly that was a bad idea to start with. It's a bad idea done badly. The plot holes would be forgivable in this kind of movie were it not for all the other flaws. The attempts to inflict Hollywood morality (The perfect people are totally perfect and the freaks should be ridiculed and laughed at) ruins most of what could have been good. All that is left are the two elements that were central and safe from being messed with Scooby and Shaggy.Of the cast the only one I could say did a good performance is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar did pretty well too, but her character was ruined by the scripts and she was given way too much screen time for the character (obviously she was going to be a big draw, so you can see why they did that, the same with the kick boxing).If you want to see this kind of film, but done well I'd recommend the newAustin Powers movie. True it's less of a family movie, but its pretty close in style to Scooby Doo, the only difference being that you will probably enjoy Austin Powers even if you find it somewhat disposable. If you want to see a modern parody of Scooby Doo (with no Scrappy at all btw) I'd suggest downloading the special the cartoon network did called The Scooby Doo project.Unfortunately this is the kind of film most people will see regardless of what others say simply for curiosity (that's why I'm here). So unfortunately a sequel is highly likely. But you never know, if they just keep it with Scooby and Shaggy it could be very good.

You can see what they've tried to do with it, and frankly that was a bad idea to start with. It's a bad idea done badly. The plot holes would be forgivable in this kind of movie were it not for all the other flaws. The attempts to inflict Hollywood morality (The perfect people are totally perfect and the freaks should be ridiculed and laughed at) ruins most of what could have been good. All that is left are the two elements that were central and safe from being messed with Scooby and Shaggy.Of the cast the only one I could say did a good performance is Matthew Lillard as Shaggy. Sarah Michelle Gellar did pretty well too, but her character was ruined by the scripts and she was given way too much screen time for the character (obviously she was going to be a big draw, so you can see why they did that, the same with the kick boxing).If you want to see this kind of film, but done well I'd recommend the newAustin Powers movie. True it's less of a family movie, but its pretty close in style to Scooby Doo, the only difference being that you will probably enjoy Austin Powers even if you find it somewhat disposable. If you want to see a modern parody of Scooby Doo (with no Scrappy at all btw) I'd suggest downloading the special the cartoon network did called The Scooby Doo project.Unfortunately this is the kind of film most people will see regardless of what others say simply for curiosity (that's why I'm here). So unfortunately a sequel is highly likely. But you never know, if they just keep it with Scooby and Shaggy it could be very good. The odd brief moment of the two of them in this film showed an amount of promise.

Smith's films had not yet achieved the fanbase nor the level of infamy they now have...since this was, of course, his first movie.  On a mere budget of $24,000, Kevin Smith made Clerks, a movie he wrote and directed, and yeah, was featured in as an actor as well.  The results?

Dante works in the Kwik Stop, a convenience store, and Randal works in a video store adjescent to it.  Dante is the protagonist of the film, as it is his troubles with the insane patrons of the store and his relationships that form the center conflicts.  His buddy Randal is more or less along for the ride to provide his always entertaining comments and insights, and to kick some sense into Dante when necessary.  The film follows them over the course of one day, not a particularly good day in the life of Dante Hicks.

Night Shyamalan, at least until the ending.  The ending wasn't bad, but it lacked the uncertainty that marked his other works.  As the end of the movie rolled around there was a point when everything became very obvious and even felt a bit contrived.  Of course that was sort of the point but it was still too heavy handed.The movie as a whole was very beautifully done.  The style is completely Shyamalan, who seems to pay extraordinary attention to the visual details.  The effect is somewhat diminished by the funny looking aliens...  Although I think men in costume are better than the inevitably fake look of CGI.There was also a small problem with the casting.  Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are supposed to be brothers, but there is clearly at least 20 years of age between them.  Sure Mel looks good for his age and Joaquin was made to look old for his age, but the gap was still large enough to be confusing, especially because the chemistry feels more like father-son (or maybe uncle-nephew) than older-younger brother.  Incidentally it doesn't become clear until a third of the way through what the relationship is.  Of course they both put in good performances, on par with their best.Aside from the three minor points, too foreshadowed\/clean ending, no so good aliens, and the age issue, this movie was very enjoyable.  There were moments of laughter to break the tension (too much tension is after all as bad as not enough).  The children were amazingly cute (how many Caulkin's are there anyway?).  Also it is refreshing to see a large scale problem (aliens) and how it relates to only one specific family, which incidentally prevents the movie from being too preachy.  It is about one man's choice and not saying it is globally the right choice.  I give it 8\/10 with a possible upgrade to 9\/10 upon further review.

I even enjoyed the first one in a don't take it seriously bit of action bit of kid fun way but this was pure drivel from start to finish, the action scenes were ridiculous, the plot was dull in the extreme, the love interest sub plot was obviously written by Lucas's 3 yr old niece (disclaimer I don't know if Lucas has a 3 year old niece, I was making a point) in fact I now think I was generous in giving it 2 out of 10.The more I think about it the more it seems to me that these 3 films are a mistake particularly as they will spoil future enjoyment of the original ones.  For instance anyone watching all six in order will already know about the identity of Luke's dad and his sister, kind of ruins the drama and suspense when these facts are revealed later.All in all I sat through the whole film without walking out but I came out wishing I hadn't bothered.....I won't be watching number 3.

So from Russia with love they send Nicole Kidman. Who I must say, spoke quite good Russian and was very convincing as a Russian woman.And the movie starts off calm and doesn't rush anything.

But then it goes wrong, as well in the movie as the movie itself. Suddenly from calm it goes to very chaotic and from worse to bad and everybody tries to get back to everybody. To me this wasn't the fault of the actors, but the director. He tried to make a big birthdaycake with all the ingredients that would make it good but when he looked at the result it was just flat. He had mixed too much and got nothing.The movie really supported only on the result of the actors and nothing more. The story was weak and could have been done allot better then this.Nicole Kidman almost got a flawless record this year but just at the finish she fell down, although she did a fine work.

I doubt it because I had only seen the hackney, corny 60s Batman before the movie came out and that was a great piece of work.Comnparisons to Batman aside this movie cannot stand alone on its own two feet. This film is two-hours of anti-climax without an interesting or even developed character in the lot of them. While Tobey McGuire is a decent actor he's always had a boring screen persona, in fact, I couldn't find a vibrant personality in this film to liven it up. David Koepp, who has written or co-written some exciting films such as Jurassic Park and Panic Room couldn't have come up with a more boring and I'm guessing faithful storyline. There wasn't anything to punch it up or make it more lively. Of course, a slow paced story can be made more interesting and Sam Raimi is also largely to blame even though he's made some great movies in the past this most certainly is not one of them.Even if the story was designed with cliches in the comic book couldn't they have been avoided?

Along with them came John Woo's style of story telling, namely human relationships between characters ala 1989's THE KILLER.Nicolas Cage plays Joe Enders who is assigned to protect the force's Navajo codetalkers but most of all, protect the code at ALL COSTS. Adam Beach plays Yahzee whom Enders is assigned to, and with his part you can see the Navajo culture. Christian Slater, who expectedly did not have that much screen time as one might think, plays the friendly soldier Ox who is assigned to another Navajo named Whitehorse.Cage's performance in this movie is nothing less than excellent, in fact I believe it's his best performance since his award-winning role in 1995's LEAVING LAS VEGAS. Enders is traumatized in the beginning, has personal clashes, suffers from his left ear, and tried so hard to relate with others before finally realizing his mission and its value. Cage also showed A LOT of emotion throughout the movie.The Navajos were well portrayed. Not only did they have to leave their homeland and families to train and fight, they also had to deal with the realities of war, war horror and even discrimination in their own army. The movie showed that Navajos truly deserved honor right in the beginning, and they had to wait over 55 years for it. Another thing here...you can really feel the pain Navajos get when they're discriminated or snubbed or used.John Woo's directing in this movie is rather different from his other movies. Don't expect any 2-fisted gunplay here, don't expect any of his action gimmicks but the one thing you should expect is the way he directs his characters...through human relations. Just like the classic THE KILLER, Windtalkers showed deep character development between Enders and Yahzee. While The Killer showed the boundary between an assassin and a cop gets erased, the boundary between the white man and the Navajo also gets cleared off leading to one major cause to fight and stand for in the war.There are several slow motion scenes here as well, although I do find them shorter played and seemed to run kinda faster than those in old movies. As for the violence, expect A LOT of bombing, firing, killing and other elements of destruction to fill the screen. It is John Woo's most violent film since his Hong Kong movies, but they are not as graphic as that of Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's not a bad thing though because the violence on-screen is very well worth watching. Woo surprised me with the fact that he is truly CAPABLE of directing a war movie. He can really direct thousands of extras to run forward with all those explosions and still make it look realistic and convincing. Woo is indeed not limited to the lone action hero style of screenplays with this movie, and aside from violence he can really bring out the act and emotions from his characters.In concluding this, I give TWO-THUMBS UP for Woo's direction, the expressive cast and the story. WINDTALKERS is one of the best movies I've seen this year and it easily kills the earlier war movies like HART'S WAR, BEHIND ENEMY LINES and WE ARE SOLDIERS.WINDTALKERS is not SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but it sure sits up there beside it. Easily one of the best war movies ever made.Salute to Woo, the stars and the Navajos!
