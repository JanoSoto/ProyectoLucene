Splash is one of his early films and it showcases his talent. This is also an early directorial effort by Ron Howard and it is a very good one. As a romantic comedy, one may have to suspend disbelief because of the far-fletched plot. But the film itself is very likable and funny. It will endear to nearly everyone, especially fans of Tom Hanks.Howard's film is about a Manhattan bachelor named Allen Bauer who falls in love with a mermaid from Cape Cod and when their romance is made public, they must fight to save the mermaid's existence......and their love.This is Tom Hanks at his funniest. He is a really funny guy, and the film proves that. He makes many jokes and even is adept at physical humor. However, he does show a very sentimental side which comes very useful in the film. Daryl Hannah does a good job as the mermaid, even if she does learn the entire language of English in six hours. Eugene Levy was fantastic as the man trying to prove the urban legend is real. Finally, as always, John Candy is pathetically dumb but really funny and sweet-hearted in the film.Overall, Splash is a very endearing rom-com and it is a different style from what we are used to seeing with these kind of films and that is fine with me. It may not be entirely believable, but the film is about how love can find anyone, even the working man. This is a very good film and from what I see, not many people have seen this film, at least my generation hasn't. I rate this film 9\/10.

Why I may ask?.The story is about are main character Todd who is an engineered military fighting machine, but after being left for dead on a remote planet he starts a new life. He must fight his very replacements to save his newly found friends. In every Paul W.S. Anderson movie that he direct's it always looks like it has a good budget to it like The Resident Evil film series, Mortal Kombat, Death Race and now this film, and just like some of his other films it always has the same results; a wasted opportunity of being good. I know Paul W.S. Anderson can be a good director, I found Alien Vs Predator to be my biggest guilty pleasure of all time and Mortal Kombat wasn't all that bad, so I know he can be good, but Soldier isn't one of them. The best way to possibly describe this nonsense of a film is be saying something like this Imagine you got all you're army action figures and you're small plastic gun figures together and simply set them on fire and throw them down the stairs and watch them go all over the place making has much noise as possible, then close your eyes and think to yourself God that was annoying and stupid, yeah that's this movie, that's this freaking movie!.Let's start off with the good Kurt Russell dose the best of what his got and that's saying a lot because of the blandness of his character. The action scenes are pretty well done if I must say and Gary Busey once again brings such a goofy performance but his so enjoyable to watch with the little screen time he got.Now for the bad and these a lot The movie is just bombarding with dull scenes and cardboard character's that the end of the day is a waste of time watching. Todd the main character of the film barely speaks a word through the film, yes he dose say a couple of lines but for most part his dead silent. Main character's barely not saying anything can be a big risk in movies but some films pulled it off really well like the movie Drive and it was all down to good writing, but this doesn't have good writing and the silent hero thing completely did not work at all and made the character less interesting to watch. The writing was pretty poor, the other character's I didn't really care about at all and I doubt that Kurt Russell has ever had less dialogue to work anywhere. Overall this movie sucks and to the people who are defending this movie I got this to say to them, Don't even try it. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2014","score":"","review":" Oh Paul W.S.

The woman in the pictures with the victim, wants his film, but she was not the one with the gun. Other than seeing a body, which disappears, we learn absolutely nothing else about this matter. We see the photographer conducting two short photo shoots, visiting an antique store twice, and buying only an airplane propeller, which wasn't connected to anything else in the movie. He has encounters with three different women that show some measure of nudity. His wife is briefly seen having sex with someone else&#x97;but that seems to have had no meaning. The man goes to a rock concert and a pot party and meets with a guy putting together a book of the star's photos, none of which has anything to do with anything else. Twice he encounters the so-called mimes (They holler and yell, unlike actual mimes.) First at the beginning of the film one day, then at the end the next day. Nothing we see in his life is changed, nor do we ever see a purpose in what happened in this film. At no time in the movie did we see anything to make us care one whit about a single character.

As a seasoned officer for the SFPD, Inspector Harry Callahan has made these various experiences his routine, and he doesn't like it one bit. Preferring the shoot first, ask second approach to police work, Callahan is living in a city where his version of justice is old-fashioned. His grit has put him at odds with the upper-ranks, and as a result he is given every dirty case investigation. When we first meet our titular character, he has been brought into the Mayor's office because a psychotic man self-named Scorpio has sent a ransom letter. The man has already killed once, and we have seen his skill with a sniper rifle. The criminal says that he will continue his killing rampage unless he is given $100,000. Contrary to Callahan's insistence on taking down the crook before he kills again, the department decides to play the bad guy's game. This decision will send Callahan to track down the elusive Scorpio, and to reveal the growing failure in the city's justice system.For years and years, I've heard that Dirty Harry is a classic. The did I fire five shots or six? and do you feel lucky, punk? lines have been on every list I've ever seen of Most Famous Lines of All-Time, and so I was excited to see this film at last. Clint Eastwood is a master of the lone hero sub-genre of action flicks, and this is one of his signature roles. While this film does highlight Eastwood's steely composure and quick gun-hand, I found this film lacking in one major area its storyline. Maybe it was the fact that I watched it on TV (meaning multiple pauses for fast-forwarding), or maybe it's because it truly did lack in proper execution, but this movie just did not flow well enough for my liking. Hailed as one of the best thrillers of the 1970s, I came into this film with quite high expectations, and these prospects were found soundly untouched. Putting aside this fault, from a technical standpoint, this film was well done. The cinematography was done reasonably well, and the acting was the same. Though this movie did not receive any attention from the Academy, this film in my opinion was edited very well. Following my time watching this film, I looked up some other people's reviews, both amateur and professional. In some cases, the reviewer saw something in the film that I did not. However, I found the factor that both made it a success at its time of release and the reason why it did not click with me it's portrayal of society at a time where it clashed with the norm. At the time of Dirty Harry's release, the popular trend in society was to be more focused on sympathizing with the killer and less on the victim. This film was in conflict with the fashionable and recycled idea of its time period, and that is what makes this film a classic. In addition to the storyline flaws, there were also some, in my opinion, unneeded nudity pieces. We see at least two naked women (prostitutes), and I don't think that they added to the story. As I think about it, I think that I know where the director was going with it. By showing these foul people living in the city that Callahan has sworn to protect, we see one of the major reasons why he does not trust in his own cityWith the combination of the pacing errors and the extraneous nudity, I found this film to be pretty good, yet not as good as I had hoped. I think that this film only did fire five shots and not six; leaving one needed bullet in the chamber. www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In the early 70s, the city of San Francisco was a place of many diverse lifestyles.

As a seasoned officer for the SFPD, Inspector Harry Callahan has made these various experiences his routine, and he doesn't like it one bit. Preferring the shoot first, ask second approach to police work, Callahan is living in a city where his version of justice is old-fashioned. His grit has put him at odds with the upper-ranks, and as a result he is given every dirty case investigation. When we first meet our titular character, he has been brought into the Mayor's office because a psychotic man self-named Scorpio has sent a ransom letter. The man has already killed once, and we have seen his skill with a sniper rifle. The criminal says that he will continue his killing rampage unless he is given $100,000. Contrary to Callahan's insistence on taking down the crook before he kills again, the department decides to play the bad guy's game. This decision will send Callahan to track down the elusive Scorpio, and to reveal the growing failure in the city's justice system.For years and years, I've heard that Dirty Harry is a classic. The did I fire five shots or six? and do you feel lucky, punk? lines have been on every list I've ever seen of Most Famous Lines of All-Time, and so I was excited to see this film at last. Clint Eastwood is a master of the lone hero sub-genre of action flicks, and this is one of his signature roles. While this film does highlight Eastwood's steely composure and quick gun-hand, I found this film lacking in one major area its storyline. Maybe it was the fact that I watched it on TV (meaning multiple pauses for fast-forwarding), or maybe it's because it truly did lack in proper execution, but this movie just did not flow well enough for my liking. Hailed as one of the best thrillers of the 1970s, I came into this film with quite high expectations, and these prospects were found soundly untouched. Putting aside this fault, from a technical standpoint, this film was well done. The cinematography was done reasonably well, and the acting was the same. Though this movie did not receive any attention from the Academy, this film in my opinion was edited very well. Following my time watching this film, I looked up some other people's reviews, both amateur and professional. In some cases, the reviewer saw something in the film that I did not. However, I found the factor that both made it a success at its time of release and the reason why it did not click with me it's portrayal of society at a time where it clashed with the norm. At the time of Dirty Harry's release, the popular trend in society was to be more focused on sympathizing with the killer and less on the victim.

Like Groucho or The Tramp or Mae West or Buster Keaton's stone face, Fields was such a strong personality that any situation or plot was simply an excuse to let him loose and see what kind of damage he could do.The first time that I saw Fields was in a bizarre 1933 short called The Fatal Glass of Beer. That was the one where he goes to the door of his snowbound cabin and proclaims And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast. Then is rewarded with a face-full of fake snow. That's also the one where he utters the immortal words I think I'll go milk an Elk. From there, I set out to see everything of Fields that I could get my hands on. I have noticed an interesting thing In nearly every film, in nearly every short film, he always plays the same character, the same irascible, mean-spirited little man who hates children and dogs and whose entire existence is the endless pursuit of the drink and the misadventure therein. The experience is something akin to hanging out with the bad kids at school, you can see them getting away with doing bad stuff but it is a fun journey even if you only sit on the sidelines.Of his features, The Bank Dick is my favorite. He wrote the screenplay himself but the credit went under his pseudonym Mahatma Kane Jeeves (say that name out loud slowly). Like most of the great comedians of the time, he was given control over his own project but still had to battle the Hays office over content. For instance, the Black Pussy Cat Cafe was written in the original script as The Black Pussy Cafe and Snack Bar. Joe Breen and the Hays office changed the name even though somehow the film's title remained.He plays henpecked Egbert Sousé, his usual lecherous drunk who accidentally foils a bank robbery and is offered a job as the bank's guard. A light bulb goes off in his brain to employ his good-for-nothing future son-in-law in an embezzlement scheme to siphon bank funds into a fly-by-night mining enterprise. From there, it is just one damn thing after another. The movie has no real structure and in any other comedy that would be a problem but for Fields it's just a series of set ups and comic pay-offs that have no real connection. Like The Marx Brothers, the plot is more or less an afterthought. The problem in describing Fields is that he can't really be described in words, he's an experience, not an explanation.The persona that Fields created has, today, fallen out of favor. After a brief revival in the 70s, the generation that followed has yet to discover him and I don't think they ever will. Today, in these politically correct times, Fields drunk act doesn't fit. We take alcoholism seriously and a man whose happy pursuit of the sauce frames his very existence doesn't seem in step with the times. But for me, I am bound to see comedy for what it is. If is makes me laugh, it's not my business whether it's politically correct or not.

Local police have found an extremely obese man dead in his house, and after a few minutes of investigating, the initially believed cause of death, brain hemorrhage, is soon replaced with murder. The two detectives conclude that the victim was forced to eat by his killer, and then kicked in the stomach. This is but our first taste (insensitive pun unintended) of the sick world that this story takes place in. Within 24 hours of this, a top-notch attorney is found dead in his office, and the word greed written into the carpet. On an inquiry of the first victim's apartment, Somerset finds the word gluttony carved into the wall behind the fridge. It does not take Somerset and Mills to realize that this unknown killer is systematically murdering his victims using the themes of the Seven Deadly Sins, which are gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, wrath, and envy. With the identity of the killer, and 5 more victims helplessly unaware of what is to come, detectives Mills and Somerset must find their man, and navigate the dark world that surrounds them. If the first murder wasn't an obvious clue, this is a dark movie. The gluttony victim, and all of the other victims for that matter, is brutally executed, and most of the grisly remains are what we see. Though we do not see the murders themselves, there is little left to the imagination. In this aspect, this luridly-themed film took me to my limit, and perhaps past it. I would like to think that I can handle just about anything that a camera can show, but this film proved me terrifyingly wrong. Putting the murders aside, this film was very well put together. Freeman does a great job of playing the old vet archetype, and Brad Pitt as the young rookie is a well-cast role. Kevin Spacey as our John Doe makes the antagonist utterly sickening, which is exactly what director David Fincher wanted. From a cinematography standpoint, the film was well-shot, and the editing (Oscar-nominated) was very well done. I will leave you with a few key points that I feel I must emphasize. As a devout Christian, I found the killer's system very appalling, and I dearly hope that the public does not associate this with any Christian value. In case you did not pick this up in my previous notes, this film is DARK. I myself had to watch through my fingers at times, and I have no doubt that any future viewer will as well. The language in itself is R-rated, and it just adds to the dreariness. In his review of this film, the late film critic Roger Ebert began by saying  'Seven,' a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch, it you will see film-making of a high order.The thrills did thrill, and the horrors did horrify, but I found it too far exposed.

The movie is about recent law-school grad, Rudy Baylor (Damon) who is assigned to a case involving a poor family suing a wealthy insurance company for not paying for their son's cancer treatments. The company hires a high-power law firm with years of experience with very little losses. Rudy has never even been involved in a case before. At first, the lawyers make him look bad. Then Rudy slowly turns the tables on them as he shows what the company has really been up to. That is what makes the courtroom portion so interesting. A youth fresh of of school successfully files a lawsuit in such an exciting and believable way. But it is not realistic how he is assigned a high-profile case right off the bat. In reality, Rudy would have to work for years near the bottom of a firm and slowly get to the position he is at in the film. This is not as good as most of Coppola's other movies and not 1997's best.

This is a Lynch film I like a lot, the rocking opening music score, a mini entree, for what follows, demands heavy concentration. This is Lynch all over again, weird moments and unforgettably dark and funny images. Sax player Fred (Bill Pullman) is framed for murder, and sent to jail. He comes out, only he's another person in the film, Pete. What happened in between? A big problem is to be solved here. Fred's wife, Alice (Patricia Arquette) was seeing Pete, while also being a mistress and star of porno flicks, for a bad arse Mr Eddy (Loggia at to peak). Arquette exudes so much sexuality, this is a talent to her acting, she's really good at, after whetting our whistles in True Romance. When she strips in a flashback scene, when introduced to Mr Eddy, it's a really gratifying moment, as is the whole film is gratifying. Lost Highway is very dark, and vaque as in trying to master it's story. Robert Blake as a mystery man, exudes so much menace, he's one of the best things about this cinematic experience, while Richard Pryor in his last acting role, and very sick at the time with MS, has minimal viewing time, running a mechanic's garage, where Pete work, where for Pryor's presence, it's kind of degrading. Lost Highway ends too on the same highway, with the same music score, and the end credits rolling along, as we speed down it. This 97 Lynch is taken up a few more notches, as in it's trying to master plot. You really have to think about, if more so don't, and just enjoy it, especially Lynch fans.

Touch Of Evil is not a bad film at all, but one of those classic films which doesn't quite deserve the hype.

It's also an interesting story in terms of morals, and the elements of police corruption give it a new dimension. Its refusal to rely purely on set pieces is admirable and it relies on characters and tension instead.TOE is in many ways a visual master class, and Orson Welles crafts every shot brilliantly. Orson Welles is a fine visual director, but his story lines often leave you cold. He may be a good director, but his constant insistence on showing off how good he is at filmmaking in every single frame of his movies is very off putting and the visuals detract from the story. TOE has an interesting plot but it feels somewhat hollow and since every single character is corrupt in some way and the plot is so confusing the film is difficult to engage with. Definitely a case of style over substance, although not a big one.

Despite the horrid title, it's not as violent as it's made out to be and there's not a lot of blood. Although it was banned until 1999 it looks fairly tame by today's standards, but what horror filmmakers should realize is that gore is not scary. It can actually be rather tedious. This low budget horror film about a group of 5 young adults on a trip to the house of the grandfather of 2 of them who encounter a family of cannibals, including a chainsaw wielding maniac thankfully defies expectations and avoids the red stuff mostly. Mixing subtle social commentary with terrifying, borderline harrowing horror, be warned Bring the cushions (to hide behind). Tobe Hooper, sadly stuck on B movies presently, uses documentary style camera-work with excruciatingly long takes and an uncanny sense of realism mixed with surreal imagery to create a nightmarish story of terror that feels strangely real.The acting is decent. There are no standouts but none of the actors give bad performances. The script strips the genre right down and keeps things uncomplicated, making the film feel more realistic. Leatherface, the chainsaw wielding maniac, never says a word and isn't even the leader of the grotesque parody of a family that capture the main characters, but certainly leaves the biggest impression. In general, the film is shot brilliantly and thanks to the social commentary isn't just tasteless exploitation. However, the social commentary is a bit too subtle for many who haven't already read analyses of the film to get, so the film may just seem like unpleasant violence for no reason. The characters and plot are paper thin; minimalism works well in this case, but whenever the characters die there's little emotion associated with their exits. The lack of interesting protagonists with distinguishable personalities prevent this from being a truly great film, but it is something of a classic which is a truly scary classic.

In the first 15 minutes, fewer than 20 lines are spoken, and they are all inconsequential. Even the first full line of the line of the film spoken by a recurring character is just a joke about a horse's prowess. Nothing is said, and yet everything is so clear. Too clear. We see everything and feel everything, just like the boy. It takes a very good screenplay to say so much with next to nothing. The scenes where Simon takes the train and wanders through the station could be its own short film... Amish Boy Takes The Train. I don't think that these moments, and the beautiful shots of Pennsylvania country, should be taken for granted. This film was made with care. I believe it's a visionary film, and I was transfixed. It is a film about a boy, as the title suggests, not about Harrison Ford. Samuel is part angel, witnessing the deeds of humanity, and he is human, witnessing how we share our sins. We learn from this boy, as do the other characters.The most important detail is this... the little boy witnessed a murder. This isn't something that will go away for him or be given compensation. Some reviewers have said they don't like how certain scenes and characters appear smarmy. Well, to a little boy with innocence, any person who doesn't have the highest personal integrity and truthful intentions appears smarmy. The murder itself is messy and mean, because that's what most murder is. It isn't some slick and stylish operation carried out by highly intelligent hit men. About the music. It sounds like the score by Maurice Jarre was influenced largely by Aaron Copeland. Jarre was regularly hired for visionary films; ones with a person who sees the value in what other people don't theme like Gorillas In The Mist and Dead Poets Society, or ones with religious themes like Almost An Angel and Witness, or supernatural themes like Ghost and Jacob's Ladder (and Prancer!). The synthesizer is dated, yes, and therefore it's slightly unnerving, but if taken at face value and in context you can hear the otherworldly effect that Jarre is going for. It is music for strings, but airing in sampled sounds... so what you hear are the ghosts of the strings, the echo, the strings reincarnated. It's eerier. Besides that, the music is complex, sophisticated, and it's front and centre. It isn't in the background, nor should it be. I believe that for the average moviegoer who doesn't regularly enjoy listening to a variety of orchestral music, the score might seem like too much and therefore distracting. It's too bad that some people can't admit that complex orchestral music isn't too their taste, and instead they judge the music as bad. It most certainly isn't bad. Perhaps in places it really is too much, but there are places where the movie overall is too much, music aside. Easily forgiven.

Perhaps in places it really is too much, but there are places where the movie overall is too much, music aside. Easily forgiven. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"18 December 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It is easy to see why Witness took home the Oscar for Best Screenplay. In the first 15 minutes, fewer than 20 lines are spoken, and they are all inconsequential. Even the first full line of the line of the film spoken by a recurring character is just a joke about a horse's prowess. Nothing is said, and yet everything is so clear. Too clear. We see everything and feel everything, just like the boy. It takes a very good screenplay to say so much with next to nothing. The scenes where Simon takes the train and wanders through the station could be its own short film... Amish Boy Takes The Train. I don't think that these moments, and the beautiful shots of Pennsylvania country, should be taken for granted. This film was made with care. I believe it's a visionary film, and I was transfixed. It is a film about a boy, as the title suggests, not about Harrison Ford. Samuel is part angel, witnessing the deeds of humanity, and he is human, witnessing how we share our sins. We learn from this boy, as do the other characters.The most important detail is this... the little boy witnessed a murder. This isn't something that will go away for him or be given compensation. Some reviewers have said they don't like how certain scenes and characters appear smarmy. Well, to a little boy with innocence, any person who doesn't have the highest personal integrity and truthful intentions appears smarmy. The murder itself is messy and mean, because that's what most murder is. It isn't some slick and stylish operation carried out by highly intelligent hit men. About the music. It sounds like the score by Maurice Jarre was influenced largely by Aaron Copeland. Jarre was regularly hired for visionary films; ones with a person who sees the value in what other people don't theme like Gorillas In The Mist and Dead Poets Society, or ones with religious themes like Almost An Angel and Witness, or supernatural themes like Ghost and Jacob's Ladder (and Prancer!). The synthesizer is dated, yes, and therefore it's slightly unnerving, but if taken at face value and in context you can hear the otherworldly effect that Jarre is going for. It is music for strings, but airing in sampled sounds... so what you hear are the ghosts of the strings, the echo, the strings reincarnated. It's eerier. Besides that, the music is complex, sophisticated, and it's front and centre. It isn't in the background, nor should it be. I believe that for the average moviegoer who doesn't regularly enjoy listening to a variety of orchestral music, the score might seem like too much and therefore distracting. It's too bad that some people can't admit that complex orchestral music isn't too their taste, and instead they judge the music as bad. It most certainly isn't bad.

They are disciplined, code-oriented, and courageous. But what happens when a Marine is not up to par with the others physically, and he wants to transfer to another base? According to Colonel Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), he needs to be trained, which, in Jessup's mind, is hazing. This is the case with PFC William Santiago, a young Marine who repeatedly applied for a transfer because of his being bullied and tormented. During his training, Santiago died from a towel being shoved down his throat, and the two men have been arrested. The fate of these two men, who were just following orders, must be decided soon. Enter Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), a young and ultra-confident lawyer 9 months out of law school. He was assigned as the lead counselor in the case, in front of Commander Joanne Galloway (Moore). Just as Kaffee is wild and energetic, Galloway is serious and does her work with the rule book in hand. After meeting with the two Marines in custody, LCpl. Harold Dawson and Pvt. Louden Downey, Kaffee can already tell that this will be a tough case. With Jessup claiming that he never ordered the hazing, there is no evidence that Dawson and Downey were ordered. All of this has set the stage for the showdown behind the facade of a murder trial.I had seen this movie once before, about 6 months ago. On my first viewing, I thought it was relatively slow, and the climax came too late. However, this time around, I found it generally well-paced, and Jack Nicholson's performance stood out more as well. The key to watching this movie is to stick with it. Put down the laptop, put your phone on silent, and avoid any other distractions, because they will take away from how the film plays. Nominated for 4 Oscars (Picture, Film Editing, Sound, and Best Supporting for Nicholson), the Academy agrees that this is a film worth paying attention to. The movie's director, Rob Reiner, has possibly one of the most diverse and well-rounded directorial careers to date; in the director's chair for such films as The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and Stand By Me. His work on this film is no different, and to me it is definitely one of his best works behind the camera. Jack Nicholson. He is the most Oscar-nominated actor in film history (12 times), and he still holds a presence in our society today. Winning Academy Awards for One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest, As Good As It Gets, and Terms of Endearment, Nicholson is tied for most wins for a male nominee. He turned in one of his signature performances in this film, and his monologue is legendary. I leave you with my one negative remark about this film. I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, and I doubt I ever will. I would say that his performances while playing a jock or a hot-shot are great, but he plays it in every movie I've seen him in. In this movie, his attempts to be passionate come off as a brat who only cares about what he wants. Had it not been for Nicholson's screen- time in the courtroom, the film's most famous scene would have failed miserably. I had to take off a point because of Tom Cruise, but I have to. As the lead in the story, it is hard for me to look past him and not let him influence my views.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2014","score":"","review":" In the eyes of the public, a United States Marine is the embodiment of toughness and physical prowess.

He goes into full philosopher mode with this complex, haunting war movie. A strong ensemble cast, many of who are given little to do, deal with the fight against the Japanese on the Pacific islands. They have many different arcs which are often left unsolved, ultimately adding up to a more universal portrait of the effects of war on both man and nature. If you don't like Malick, don't watch it. This is pretentious and indulgent filmmaking; when it wanders, and believe me it does wander, the film can feel lost and confused. It doesn't quite feel complete even though it's 3 hours long (A bit too long in my opinion) It's not to everyone's tastes and requires patience to appreciate. I didn't get it completely, but I still enjoyed it overall and despite the snail pace of The Tree Of Life, Malick crafts some pretty thrilling battle set pieces here which I wasn't expecting at all. This may be for very specific tastes, but it's a fine war poem to rival Wilfred Owen.Acting all around is good, even though most of the actors have little to do. The script feels confused in places, but it's well written and has a subtle e but genuine emotional power. Thankfully it's not just endless voiceovers this time. Malick's direction is excellent and the cinematography is absolutely jaw dropping, with beautiful image after beautiful image illuminating the screen. Despite how good Saving Private Ryan's cinematography was, this should have won the Oscar. It's got an interesting narrative and despite the absence of brutal combat and harrowing war sequences, it's a very anti war movie. The Thin Red Line is not as good as SPR and is too long, but it's a very interesting movie with great direction. Despite its complexity which ensures many viewers won't completely get it, there's still plenty of emotion and drama to speak to the audience.
