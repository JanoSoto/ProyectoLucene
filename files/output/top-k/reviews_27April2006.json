The reason? You cannot see the killer. In fact the killer isn't an he or she, but rather an it. Not even a monster. It is Death itself. While it lacks good acting, (they may make it look real but you can tell some fake it and the only GOOD actor is Tony Todd.) Final Destination starts off with Alex Browning. Your regular guy at a regular school with regular friends and a regular life. He is taking a class trip to France with his best friends Tod Waggner and his brother George. Along with them are The Jock\/jerk Carter Horton and his girlfriend Terry Cheney. The Teacher Valerie Lewton, and the funny guy but with no friends kid Billy Hitchcock and the lonely orphan girl at the school Clear Rivers.Pre-boarding Flight 180 Alex sees on his flight board that his flight has been Terminated weird enough he goes on and sits down. He then takes a break at the bathroom and hears Rocky Mountain High by John Denver who happened to die in a plane crash.Still a little shaken by the thought Alex boards the plane and sits down. And the plane takes off. At first it seems like a normal ride but then the turbulence builds and all of sudden the masks come down and taking one section of the plane out finally blowing it up into Alex's face.And he wakes up. It was a premonition. Alex goes and has a freak attack and gets Tod, Carter, Billy, Terry, and Clear kicked off while George stays. When they are told that someone must stay with them Mrs. Lewton tells the other teacher to go back. As the arguing continues suddenly the plane does in fact blow up and they are taken by the FBI to be investigated. The agents though happen to be interested in Alex seeming that he was the one that started it all. Though they let him go.A few months later after a memorial service for the victims everyone starts treating Alex like a freak and Tod's father is making him stay away from Alex because he is upset that George died. They all give him crap and the service ends.Later that night while Alex is working at his desk an owl comes by his desk and Alex throws a pencil at it when the newspaper flys to the fan and gets sliced. A piece of paper he happens to read say Tod. Meanwhile over at Tods while inside the bathroom we see a liquid emerge from the toilet and start to slowly make its way towards Tod. Tod slips on the liquid and the falls into the tub with the wire from the curtain around his neck and it strangles him. The liquid get sucked back down into the pipe.Alex comes by later to find him dead having commited suicide. All fingers point to Alex. He and Clear together who think the incident was a little too weird decide to go to the morgue where they meet the mortician William Bludworth (Tony Todd) who seems to know a lot about death. He explains to them how death works. He also points out that Tod was pulling at the wire. He explains that death has a design and that when you cheat death. Death makes a new design to kill those who were supposed to die.Later Clear and Alex sit at a Cafe discussing what they just learned. As he looks to the window he sees a bus go by and then he looks to see that there was no bus. All of a sudden fate brings the group together and Carter starts to give Alex a bad time. Terry sick of it yells at Carter. She tells him that if he doesn't want to stop giving Alex a hard time then he can drop dead. Instantly a second later she is run over by a bus.After this incident they realize that they must try to figure out deaths design and try to stop each other from getting killed.This film is a really unique story that I can see becoming just like the Nightmare and Friday the 13th series. Just have them keep on throwing them at us.The only thing this one lacks (not the other two) is the gore. Otherwise that I can watch this again and again. For a 90 minute horror movie this is one you should see. Enjoy!

The film shows Reinaldo, a famous writer, go from early childhood where he live in Cuba with his mothers sisters and her parents all the way to his death in America.The movie starts out with an amazing scene of Reinaldo being cared through the woods, by his mother, on the way home to his grandparents. The opening lines are full of poetic narration, and tells how Reinaldo was born out of wed-lock and how his mother would forever be looked down on by society, because of him. In his words through the narration he refers to her returning home with Reinaldo as, With me as the proof of her failure. The camera work through out the movie is very interesting and beautiful. Starting at the beginning as Reinaldo and his mother travel through the woods to the very end. While they are going through the wood it shows the film to you as if you are there traveling with them, worn out but knowing you must carry on till you reach the grandparents home.The next amazing shot is when it rains at the grandparents. The way that Reinaldo narrates the event along with the music, makes for very beautiful images. But with listening closer, as he talks about how the rain just kept coming destroying everything including houses, you see how the artist can look at events as beautiful even if they are not good events. This theme will travel through the film.Another very interesting use of the camera comes when Reinaldos grandfather finds out, by his teacher, that he is good at writing poetry. The grandfather gets up immediately and grabs an ax to cut down a tree where Reinaldo had carved little messages into it. The film makes you become the ax, as if the ax had eyes and you were looking through them.After that when Reinaldos family moves to the city, in hopes of a better life, the film starts to show the Cuban culture and how sad and poor the society is. There it shows how Reinaldo went of to join the fight for the Cuban revolution, but eventually returns home. During those scenes the camera once again does something very interesting and cuts into old footage of the revolution from back in the day. It makes it interesting and gives the movie credibility for accurately portraying this time.Then the movie goes to an older Reinaldo and how he meets his first gay lover while developing into this world famous writer. When Reinaldo is first coming to the conclusion that he is gay indeed, the war had just began and homosexuality was not persecuted. However it quickly starts to show how Reinaldo got very lucky in many cases to stay alive all while taking risks to get his work out. He goes through some time in prison where he survives by writing messages for other prisoners to send home. He also is persecuted horribly for his lifestyle and for nothing other than being gay. He was said to be a rapist, because some boy who stole his clothes from him at the beach, told the police in order to avoid getting in trouble himself. When Reinaldo is put into solitary confinement. It breaks your heart to see him like that. The camera is placed perfectly and the buzzing of the small light makes you feel like going crazy as well.After some smart maneuvering Reinaldo makes it to America so that he can write freely and not be persecuted or censored. While there he contracts Aids and dies with his roommate Laz.Through out the whole movie the camera work is very interesting and keeps the story serious and emotional. The different techniques used on the film make the film also appear more accurate in telling the story almost as if it really was how Reinaldo saw things while he was here on Earth.Over all it was a great movie about a great writer. It showed all the necessary parts to make the movie meaningful and really didn't use any boring fillers for time or anything like that. The movie was an emotional movie that makes you feel terrible for the people of Cuba. It shows you the poor and the rich of Cuba, but you still want to help both of them. The movie starts with poetry as a visual art and ends that way to. So I think that the overall success of the movie was very high. The only thing that made it hard to follow at times was, the two languages being spoken regularly throughout the film. But it was very important to really get the movie.

Too bad Hollywood never gave him the sort of roles William Holden had after his own precarious start in Smiling Jim sort of roles. Holden and McCrea have a lot in common as actors--manly and professional at all times.It's also an eye-opener to see just how luscious VERONICA LAKE was at an early stage in her career. Her flair for light comedy and flippant remarks serves her well as the girl who decides to join McCrea on his hobo adventures to see how the other half lives. He's tired of directing unreal films and thinks a taste of real life will influence his next film project.It starts out as a screwball comedy--smart, fast-paced, crackling with good dialog.

Allen plays a memorable role as the Jewish comedian Alvy Singer, who is unlucky in love and completely neurotic about the rest of his life. He falls for a beautiful young girl named Annie, played by Diane Keaton, but the relationship falls apart. Alvy takes the viewer back through time, to his relationship with her, his childhood, and his other romances, showing the viewer the wild and funny ride that has been his life.The films flies in a variety of directions, flashing back at odd times, and the chronology of events is sometimes hard to follow. Basically, Alvy is from Brooklyn, a young Jewish boy who grew up with a pessimistic view on most aspects of life. Because of his interesting upbringing, his Jewish heritage, and his short, wiry frame, he grows up to be a successful comedian. He is married two times, both unsuccessful, and during a tennis match with his tall, bearded friend Rob (played by Tony Roberts), he meets the long-legged Annie. She gives him a ride home, and although he is terrified of her driving skills (or lack thereof) they are attracted to each other and develop a relationship.Allen shows us bits and pieces of the relationship; high times, low times, and everything in between. Allen shows us a silly scene of the two of them trying to boil lobsters, and having some trouble since both of them are somewhat afraid of touching them. When one lobster gets stuck behind the refrigerator, Alvy tells Annie maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side. Another scene, after the two have taken a break, is when Annie calls Alvy over to kill a spider in her bathroom. This scene shows both character's fragility, and how much they still rely on each other.However, in the end, Alvy and Annie's relationship can never work out. Alvy is too stuck on New York, and Annie wants out, wants to try new things and move around. Alvy tries proposing to her, flies out to California to see her after she moves there. But it never works out. Alvy is eventually arrested for tearing up his driver's license when it is requested by a policeman (he tell the cop he has a problem with authority), and goes back to New York, trying to forget about Annie.Many people wonder what this film is about. Because it is so disjointed, and seems like more of a 90 minute joke than a movie, people have trouble finding a point to it. However, Allen seems to tell us something pretty valuable about life, and the human experience. Relationships are a part of life. They're funny, and heartbreaking, and terrible and wonderful. At the end of the film, Allen speaks to the audience, and tells us another bad joke about a man thinking he's a chicken and somebody keeping him around for the eggs. He says this joke is a lot like relationships. He says they're totally irrational, and crazy, and absurd but, uh, I guess we keep going' through it because, uh, most of us... need the eggs. Despite how crazy and weird relationships are, and although they don't always last, humans need them to experience life. I think Allen portrays the idea of relationships perfectly in Annie Hall. However, he uses comedy to disguise the importance of this film. Despite this, it is still powerful, enjoyable, and certainly deserving of its various awards.

Alvy is a somewhat overly intelligent, somewhat pompous, incredibly neurotic and slightly depressed comic. Annie is a woman who only gets pleasure out of smoking pot, is not too intelligent, and is too shy and nervous for her own good. Having these two characters fall in love seems slightly insane in itself, but then again, that's what Woody Allen was going for with this film. In many ways, this film could be seen as kind of a comment on how film portrays romance&#151;how unrealistic romantic relationships had been portrayed by Hollywood and how the unhappy ending is usually the more prevalent in reality.California (more specifically Hollywood and L.A) in this film is portrayed as a place full of overly tan, vanity obsessed, materialistic celebrities and their agents. Alvy, being the model New Yorker, hates California. Some of the most amusing lines in the film are between Alvy and Annie concerning the others' hatred for the two cities. Alvy's opinions on L.A all seem to hold up, however, so do Annie's opinions on New York. They're entirely polarized cities and the fact that Alvy and Annie don't choose the same city as their city of preference only emphasizes their differences even more. These two people are polar opposites, just like L.A. and New York&#151;they don't belong together. Annie and Alvy are not the type of couple that Hollywood usually had fun portraying. They are not the Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett couple from Pride and Prejudice, they are not Romeo and Juliet, they are two people who are completely wrong for each other and know it but somehow can't seem to figure it out. Every time they break up, they fall deeper into their depression because it's another failed relationship, another thing they couldn't make work. They're constantly bickering and fighting, and it doesn't really seem like love anymore after a certain point. It's the kind of love that only two mentally unstable and off base people can understand (and considering Allen's real life love situations, it becomes obvious that he is one of those people). This film is re-defining romance, re-defining how people look at relationships. It doesn't work out for Annie and Alvy in the end, and they both seem to be slightly okay with it. That's how things would have worked out for them in real life, and that's what Allen wanted to portray. If he had been a conventional Hollywood director with classic notions of grandeur and romance, then he would have had them live happily ever after. It's refreshing, for once, for the audience to figure out that not everyone gets that. Not all romances end with a ride off into the sunset.Annie Hall is also a critique of American culture and the elite intelligencia. Alvy and most of his acquaintances in New York are the kind of cynical and judgmental people who are so intelligent that it makes everyone else of moderate intelligence seem like morons and scum. Alvy (even as a child, as we see in multiple flashbacks) has very high standards for people he would consider worthy of being able to share their opinions. One of the most humorous scenes in the film is when he and Annie are in the line to see a film about Nazi Germany and WWII and there is a pretentious man in line behind him spewing off his opinions on directors. When Alvy confronts him about his seemingly terribly wrong opinions, he pulls out one of the directors to back him up. Alvy is the standard that the audience is supposed to hold everyone else up against. He is a neurotic man who never has nothing to say and is usually able to voice his opinion in a witty manner. The irony of this film is its greatest feature. The depressive and cynical comic, who is too into himself to give anyone else the time of day, meets and falls in love with an unintelligent and somewhat boring girl from the mid west who would usually do nothing for him.

In many ways, this film could be seen as kind of a comment on how film portrays romance&#151;how unrealistic romantic relationships had been portrayed by Hollywood and how the unhappy ending is usually the more prevalent in reality.California (more specifically Hollywood and L.A) in this film is portrayed as a place full of overly tan, vanity obsessed, materialistic celebrities and their agents. Alvy, being the model New Yorker, hates California. Some of the most amusing lines in the film are between Alvy and Annie concerning the others' hatred for the two cities. Alvy's opinions on L.A all seem to hold up, however, so do Annie's opinions on New York. They're entirely polarized cities and the fact that Alvy and Annie don't choose the same city as their city of preference only emphasizes their differences even more. These two people are polar opposites, just like L.A. and New York&#151;they don't belong together. Annie and Alvy are not the type of couple that Hollywood usually had fun portraying. They are not the Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett couple from Pride and Prejudice, they are not Romeo and Juliet, they are two people who are completely wrong for each other and know it but somehow can't seem to figure it out. Every time they break up, they fall deeper into their depression because it's another failed relationship, another thing they couldn't make work. They're constantly bickering and fighting, and it doesn't really seem like love anymore after a certain point. It's the kind of love that only two mentally unstable and off base people can understand (and considering Allen's real life love situations, it becomes obvious that he is one of those people). This film is re-defining romance, re-defining how people look at relationships. It doesn't work out for Annie and Alvy in the end, and they both seem to be slightly okay with it. That's how things would have worked out for them in real life, and that's what Allen wanted to portray. If he had been a conventional Hollywood director with classic notions of grandeur and romance, then he would have had them live happily ever after. It's refreshing, for once, for the audience to figure out that not everyone gets that. Not all romances end with a ride off into the sunset.Annie Hall is also a critique of American culture and the elite intelligencia. Alvy and most of his acquaintances in New York are the kind of cynical and judgmental people who are so intelligent that it makes everyone else of moderate intelligence seem like morons and scum. Alvy (even as a child, as we see in multiple flashbacks) has very high standards for people he would consider worthy of being able to share their opinions. One of the most humorous scenes in the film is when he and Annie are in the line to see a film about Nazi Germany and WWII and there is a pretentious man in line behind him spewing off his opinions on directors. When Alvy confronts him about his seemingly terribly wrong opinions, he pulls out one of the directors to back him up. Alvy is the standard that the audience is supposed to hold everyone else up against. He is a neurotic man who never has nothing to say and is usually able to voice his opinion in a witty manner. The irony of this film is its greatest feature. The depressive and cynical comic, who is too into himself to give anyone else the time of day, meets and falls in love with an unintelligent and somewhat boring girl from the mid west who would usually do nothing for him. How could it not end up amusingly awful? Woody Allen is truly at his finest in this film.

The first was fresh material and Brando's presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.Michael's descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, it's not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? It's a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.Pacino's performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.The secondary story is the rise of Michael's father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiro's look? What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of it's generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiro's expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. That's unsurpassed acting.The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900's New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. That's sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.Some weak points Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.One of the greatest films of all time.

With an astounding body of work to his name, few actors can claim to hold an audience's attention as well as Jackson. He's the living embodiment of cool, bringing an edge to every role he plays. Great as he is, he can't carry an entire movie by himself and that is the fundamental flaw with this remake-slash-tribute that actually has more in common with another recent rehash, Starsky And Hutch. Simply by getting Jackson in the costume and having Isaac Hayes sing on the soundtrack, you have a new Shaft but sadly, this film needs much more than that.Jackson, as you've probably gathered, plays John Shaft who's a tough New York cop who gets the job done and parties hard. After a racist murder outside a bar, Shaft arrests the obviously guilty Walter Wade Jr. (Christian Bale), the son of a multimillionaire tycoon who skips bail and flees the country. Two years later and Wade is still a free man due to the unwillingness of a witness (Toni Collette) to testify and racial prejudice within the system. Disgusted by this turn of events, Shaft quits the force and tries to locate the missing woman in order to secure Wade's conviction. But Wade will not give up so easily and soon hires local drug pusher Peoples Hernandez (Jeffrey Wright) to kill the woman before Shaft gets to her.This is a film without an idea about what it wants to be. Is it a gritty crime thriller or a glossy, stylish tribute to the original? Certainly the appearance of the original Shaft (Richard Roundtree) tends to suggest that this shouldn't be taken that seriously, coupled with some laugh-out-loud lines (It's my dooty to please that booty. - brilliant) and the obligatory cameo from a rapper, in this case Busta Rhymes. But everybody seems to be taking it very seriously with the exception of Jackson himself, who was surely born to play Shaft, and Wright who is fantastic as Peoples. But beneath the coolness, there is a sterile feel to it all and the thing quickly degenerates into a standard action-cop movie, complete with a horribly dated car chase sequence. It lacked the out-and-out comedy of Starsky And Hutch but maintained that film's enthusiasm for nostalgia without offering anything new at all. And although there is absolutely nothing wrong with Isaac Hayes' funky soundtrack, it did highlight how dated this movie actually was and just smacked a little bit of laziness.I'm all for looking back but if you have to keep taking and remaking earlier films then audiences are pretty soon going to give up. There seems a trend at the moment of rehashing old TV shows (stuff like the Dallas and The A Team remakes, which I'm not touching with a bargepole) and they all seem to be weary, tired and superficial - everything that Shaft is. There was absolutely no reason to remake Shaft except to see Samuel L Jackson in the role and if that's all you want then you'll probably enjoy this. But this film adds nothing to the original or the action-cop genre as a whole. Shaft may still be the man but this man is getting older by the day.

When two residents have been murdered, the 'town elders' call on Constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) to solve the mystery. Other characters include Katrina Anne Van Tassle (Christina Ricci) and a handful of power house British actors that give life to this Burton masterpiece. The overall mood of the movie is dark. Every minute is filled with suspense. It was straight-forward (absolutely no mercy) when it came to the murdering of each victim. Burton must be going for a world record and see how much blood he could throw onto Depp during the entire movie. The headless horseman was ruthless and pure evil. Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane was absolutely stunning. Although at the start he looked like the perfect hero (good-looking, calm and wise demeanor, in-charge, intelligent)his flaws come as quickly as you thought he was the perfect man for the job. He was a flawed man who tried to look strong on the outside but absolutely faints at the sight of blood and is terrified of bugs and pests on the inside. Depp definitely played this character right. Ricci was credible as the innocent (or so you'd think), naive and beautiful love interest of Ichabod Crane. Overall, this movie made me and my best friend, jump out of our skins. In my opinion the best Tim Burton film ever.

That pretty much sums Rawhead Rex up, as the movie is so completely ridiculous that the audience is never allowed to take it seriously. However, believe it or not; horror fans have a lot to be thankful for when it comes to Rawhead Rex, as it was the crappiness of this movie (and the earlier 'Underworld' by the same director) that lead to Clive Barker's decision to direct Hellraiser himself...and that turned out pretty well. The plot is based on the story by Clive Barker, and features his typical ideas of otherworldly evil. The story takes place in the British countryside, and we follow the idea of a farmer who accidentally unearths a demon. After plaguing the English countryside for a while and upsetting a few people by doing things such as killing children and smashing up kids' toys, it soon becomes apparent that there may be more to this demon than just a daft-looking killing machine, and perhaps the church has the answer...It's easy to see why Clive Barker wasn't happy with this adaptation of his story. The themes of good against evil and religion are put across rather well, and the story behind Rawhead Rex is full of intrigue. The screenplay isn't bad either, and while the story feels stretched (despite the 85 minute running time), it's usually at least entertaining. The reason why it's brought down if you ask me is almost completely down to the demon itself. After the ridiculous intro scene, it's impossible not to approach every scene that the monster is in without laughing; thus making being scared impossible. The demon at the centre is supposed to be absolute evil...but if absolute evil really did exist, I doubt it would look as silly as it does here. The murder scenes aren't bad, though, and the British countryside bodes well with the story and provides an excellent location for having victims picked off in. I liked the way that the characters speak with thick country accents too; it gives the whole piece a little bit of credibility, which it lacks in so many other areas.

The vampires disintegrate into dust and Blade moves on.This opening action scene is one of the best ever, and sets a dark but constantly entertaining tone for the rest of the movie. Directed by Stepthen Norrington, who went onto make Sean Connery flop LXG, Blade came out before The Matrix and in terms of coolness, beats Keanu's film hands down.When vampire Deacon Frost (Stepthen Dorff) plans to resurrect a long dead vampire god, Blade and his mentor\/sidekick Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) use their heavy arsenal to stop him. With doctor Karen Jenson onboard (N Bushe Wright) Blade also searches a cure for his thirst. No, not that kind of thirst...Blade, played to understated perfection by Wesley Snipes, is a half blood, or 'daywalker'. His pregnant mother was bitten before giving birth to him (it turns out later it was Frost who bit her) and he has been given all of the strength of a vampire, and none of their weaknesses (daylight, garlic, silver). Unfortunately he also has their thirst, and he uses a garlic compound to quell his thirst. Snipes is physically able to perform in the film, and with Blade a man of few words he has no problem conveying the human emotions.Kristofferson is effective as Whistler, and his death scene late in the movie is accompanied by superb melancholic music. Dorff, while not the beefiest of bad guys, is able to give Frost a youthful exuberance and cocky persona that sits as a perfect opposite to Snipes and his brooding.Wright is decent support as the token female, working away on a cure while also letting Blade bite her when he can't find any serum. Donal Logue is annoying as Frosts sidekick, but thats the point. However, when he finally gets his comeuppance its a great comedic moment as he charges at Blade and gets decapitated by an acid edged piece of rope.The fights and effects are superbly staged, with the nightclub massacre one of the highlights of action film history. The gleaming white tiles end up blood splattered as Blade takes no prisoners. Later Blade jumps off as building, grabs onto a speeding train and gets put in some kind of ancient tomb style device.

When launching his one man assault on Frosts headquarters, he annihilates the human bodyguards of Frost and discovers one on the floor lying injured. Blade points his shotgun in the guards face, and the guard shouts 'no! i just work for them!' before Blade blasts his head off. Its an incredibly powerful moment, coming after Whistlers death and filling Blade with anger and a lust for revenge.

Having the blood float in space is really cool and one of the best effects of the film, but purple? This takes away from the seriousness of the situation and I don't know who okayed such a stupid thing. But I digress...We see the Original Cast on their last voyage, where they try to secure a peace treaty between the Klingons and Federation. Unfortunately, someone assassinates the Klingon Chancellor and Kirk\/Bones are framed.The film is great for a closing to the series, but also as a launching pad for the Next Generation universe. We see Worf's grandfather, and we see the Klingons moving into their TNG phase. We see Kirk and Bones working together to fight the wrongs assigned to them.

I can complain they put David Warner (the Lexus guy) in this film as a Klingon after he appeared in part 5 as a human, but you probably didn't even notice until I pointed it out, did you? So yeah, it's fine. If you watched the other five, you are pretty much obligated to complete your run.

This takes away from the seriousness of the situation and I don't know who okayed such a stupid thing.

Based on the Braqm Stoker this film version was adapted from the 1927-1928 Broadway play. Bela Lugosi reprises his role from the stage play written by Hamilton Dean and John L. Balderson as Dracula in this film version and Herbert Bunston reprises his role to film of Dr. Steward from the same play. Director Tod Browning was successful in a number of films he directed in the horror genre in the Devil Doll and Mark of the Vampire. He also directed the unusual film about circus freak show performers called Freaks. Browning got his directing start in the early days of silent film and was also a successful writer and had written the story The Hypnotist that he adapted to the Lon Chaney film London After Midnight. Chaney was to star as Dracula in this film but he died before the film began and Browning turned to the original Broadway star of the play, Lugosi to star in the film. the role of course made Lugosi a household name but typecast him in the role and similar vampire roles for the rest of his career. Austrian-born cinematographer Karl Friend who had a long career as a cinematographer, director and producer photographed this film. He had come from the German Expressionist movement of film-making and had photographed Fritz Lang's Metropolis among many others. his career would include such films as The Good Earth, Camille, conquest, Key Largo and The Pride and the Prejudice and he received several Academy Award nominations and also went on to be an innovator in television film. As a director Freund directed the classic The Mummy. Among the cast are Helen chandler, David Manners, Dwight Frye and Francis Dade. This is a creepy classic and a trend setter in sophisticated horror and did much to re energize the Dracula story and I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.

Eventually the medical students figure out that in order to possibly stop what's happening to them they must confront their past sins, but that ain't the way to end it for some of them, who's sins from the past are much, much worse...FLATLINERS was a smart thriller, it perfectly balances splendid acting, interesting characters & well crafted writing & directing, to create a great thriller that will keep you glued to you're seat & slap you in the face with several interesting plot twists. The subject matter is fascinating & always interesting. The film however is a bit overlong & the look of the picture (The cinematography) is somewhat cold & unattractive looking (Though that may be due to the films subject matter) as each frame of the picture is bathed in blues, blacks & oranges, still it's a fun film & worth you're time to watch.
