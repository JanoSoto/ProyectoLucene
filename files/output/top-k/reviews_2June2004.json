[{"date":"2 June 2004","score":"","review":"  Vin Diesel plays an amoral murderer by name of Riddick, forced to play nice with a bunch of idiot survivors - among them his bounty hunter transporter charge (Hauser) on a wasteland planet in order to survive against a nocturnal monsters. As Riddick tells it to Captain Fry (Rhada Mitchell), As soon as the s*** hits the fan, this little family of ours is going to fall apart. Well, he says something like that and he's basically right. Now the question who will survive? Well, Riddick survives, as the previews for The Chronicles of Riddick probably showed, and the voice of Goliath from Gargoyles, Keith David, survives. I can so no more of who else does and doesn't make it. Formulaic yes but redeemed somewhat by the sheer ambition of the men and women who made it. If you can't understand what Vin's saying, don't feel ashamed to turn on the closed captioning for the hearing impaired.

You are all correct. And you know what else? I couldn't care less.Comparing Xander Cage to James Bond is like comparing the Incredible Hulk to Superman. Both are comic book heroes, but they have little in common. Bond is suave and debonair; Cage is muscular and quite throughly un-handsome. But it really doesn't matter. I went to XXX with no illusions about what I was going to see. I expected a 100-minute-long music\/extreme-sports video, and that's what I got. And I was entertained every step of the way.When I was a teenager, I enjoyed all the lowbrow Arnie movies that came out (Commando, Raw Deal, Running Man); you watch them now, and you wonder for a moment why you like them. Then it hits you; because they are simple, good-guy\/bad-guy shoot-em-up entertainment. And that's why XXX works; sometimes you need to watch a movie where you can just enjoy it without having to think too much about it! There comes a time in everyone's life when one, for the most part, grows out of movies like that. I will still go see the occasional lowbrow shoot-em-up, but not as often as when I was younger. Sometimes I am entertained, and sometimes not, but that's the risk you take with any movie. In this case, I was entertained. Very much so!It's a bad pun, but there are two kinds of films movies with action, and movies with acting. If one goes to a movie and expects one thing but gets another, they will be outraged, and pepper this website with negative reviews. My advice to them just enjoy it! How can one watch the scene where X snow-surfs down the mountain just seconds ahead of the avalanche and not go Whoa! That alone was worth the price of admission!In this day and age, all movies will be analyzed, dissected and scrutinized down to the microscopic level - that's a fact that won't change. But as far as this movie is concerned, I say only this put the magnifying glass down, park your butt on the couch and enjoy XXX; a campy, overly macho, thoroughly implausible, completely enjoyable romp.My score 9 out of 10.
