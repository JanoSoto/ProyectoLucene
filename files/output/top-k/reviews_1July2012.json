I don't love it, but I do like it; it's a good piece of cinema and is notable for many things. First of all, the black-and-white cinematography is good, and it really contributes to the tone and mood of the film. There are several great camera shots and sequences. The music is good too, and it also contributes to the tone of the film, probably even more so than the cinematography. Finally, and probably most importantly, the film is noteworthy for its storytelling. Alfred Hitchcock broke several Hollywood cinema traditions of the time, and created a film that contains elements that can be easily recycled, yet at the same time is very unique, and is a good mystery horror thriller.The story isn't all that great, but what makes it good and involving is the way it develops and unfolds. There are a lot of aspects of the movie that are not so special, and ones that have been used again and again over the years. There are some things about the movie that seem cliché, and possibly a bit cheesy. However, despite all this, after all these years, Psycho still has a uniqueness that is memorable and ultimately not copied to this day. Like I said, it's not the most extraordinary story, but it's structured in a great way. It tampers with some traditional narrative elements. It starts out seemingly normal in terms of narrative. Then, we are shocked at the movie's midpoint as Marion, our protagonist for the first half of the movie, is killed, and the course of the film is drastically changed, and what follows is a series of (like I said before) shocking discoveries and twists. The audience's expectations keep being flouted, especially in the second half of the film, especially in two major ones, the second of which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. It doesn't have great story or character complexity, but yes, it's strong.The stark black-and-white cinematography used in the film is very good, and even further contributes the the tone of the film. Also, by far one of the most important aspects of the film is the music. Bernard Herrmann composed an excellent score for the film. The film works fine with its narrative alone, but the music really brings it all to life and supports everything. The music consisted of all string instruments, and the music is consistently dissonant and tense. The music, like everything else about the film, can be easily recycled in movies, but, like I said before, Psycho still has a level of uniqueness that really can't be matched.Overall, it's an important landmark in the history of cinema, and it's still a good film, even to this day - not at a four-star level, but still very good.

The Shining can seem emotionally distant and even ghoulish in its cold cerebral dissection of human deviance and trauma, but it is a bookshelf of interesting concepts and ideas that have relevance beyond its metaphysical trappings.I may be one of few people who enjoy both the novel and the film equally; but they are two completely different animals. Stanley Kubrick took the fantastical skeleton of a very personal story that Stephen King wrote dealing with alcoholism, abuse and parental responsibility and gave it an entirely new form. The blood in this body is stimulated less by the heart than by the mind. Where King never strays far from the interior landscapes of his characters, their philosophies and their pain, Kubrick uses his characters as analogues for more abstract and universal themes; the dubious nature of perception, the inherent violence of the species, the fragility of familial bonds, existential fears (such as a fear of eternity, which is expressed in several of Kubrick's films), the psychological stress caused by isolation and expectations and the overarching absurdity of the human condition.Stephen Kings novel is a humanistic philosophical horror-fantasy. Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is a satirical, farcical, surreal and dramatic (though its drama is largely played through musical and compositional aspects) morality play which simultaneously pays homage to and transgresses conventional Hollywood techniques within an oppressive bright-light Gothic horror atmosphere. Again, very different beasts.Where Kubrick's The Shining does tread similar ground is in the area of responsibility. There is a central story of a father and husband so terrified of the obligations these roles require that he becomes suggestible to a demonic force and wildly accepts its subversive invitation to destroy his family, thereby annihilating the real world responsibilities that disturb him, while mock embracing the one sole responsibility of the hotel's maintenance. This theme alone is interesting and more relatable than King's, admittedly amusing, idea of a jealous and disturbed father being manipulated by ghosts so that they can gain access his son's psychic gifts.Kubrick's film also manages to do something few others can hope to achieve; it takes complex issues and translates them in simple visual terms that actually enhance, rather than diminish or make superficial, their complexity. It works as a simple passageway through which complicated concepts can be passed from one mind to others. It is one of the few popular films I have seen that actually seems worth reading deeper meaning into. And such attempts are made easier by the fact that The Shining remains interesting on repeat viewings due its multitude of background aspects which work like extra layers in a piece of music; you might not see or hear certain things the first time around, even if they are affecting you in some way, but you may notice them the second or third time, giving a the work a rejuvenating effect. Because of this Kubrick's work is very easy to read into, though it is amusing when people muse on why Kubrick had Jack Torrance speak about 'White Man's Burden' or what he was thinking of including a strange homosexual scenario involving a dog costume when both things are simply taken from King's original work (in fact much of the dialog and attitude in the film is actually taken directly from the book).I understand why the film would have so offended Stephen King despite the fact that it is arguably the most impressive production based on his writings. Such a personal story made into an intellectual\/psychological funhouse ride with seemingly little interest in the suffering of its characters could easily come off like an artistic slap in the face. But it is a fascinating journey for those who want some serious intellectual substance with their pulp.

The visual style, colorful language and interwoven plot threads keep you on your toes, and even though I always turn on the captions to watch a modern film, here it was completely necessary as I've never taken English as a second language. I think that's where a lot of the picture's humor comes from actually, because British slang and it's colloquialisms are so off-beat and unfamiliar to the American ear. So even though the film is liberally laced with the 'F' word, it's offensiveness almost evaporates because it doesn't come across as done for shock value but as part of Cockney sentence structure.A word to the wise up front if you haven't seen the picture yet. Take out a pen and a sheet of paper to keep track of the players. There are a half dozen separate sets of characters here that interact with each other that are pretty distinct, but because none of the actors are very well known (at least not to me), you might have trouble keeping track of them from the outset. As things progress it gets a little easier, but having a scorecard around makes it less cumbersome to follow.No sense going into the mechanics of the film or rehashing what the story's about, there are plenty of those reviews here already. I don't even want to draw comparisons against other films as this one is truly unique in it's style and story telling, though if you enjoy Quentin Tarantino's work you'll probably like this as well.

So even though the film is liberally laced with the 'F' word, it's offensiveness almost evaporates because it doesn't come across as done for shock value but as part of Cockney sentence structure.A word to the wise up front if you haven't seen the picture yet. Take out a pen and a sheet of paper to keep track of the players. There are a half dozen separate sets of characters here that interact with each other that are pretty distinct, but because none of the actors are very well known (at least not to me), you might have trouble keeping track of them from the outset. As things progress it gets a little easier, but having a scorecard around makes it less cumbersome to follow.No sense going into the mechanics of the film or rehashing what the story's about, there are plenty of those reviews here already. I don't even want to draw comparisons against other films as this one is truly unique in it's style and story telling, though if you enjoy Quentin Tarantino's work you'll probably like this as well. Not for the prissy or squeamish, there's a lot of swearing, boozing, gambling and drugs on hand, but it's a memorable flick and wildly original. Recommended for multiple viewings.

There was no such thing as a blockbuster film spawned from a comic book. All superhero movies were hilariously cheesy B-movies with no name actors and whose budgets I spend in one month on gas. But then in 1978 Warner Brothers Studios released Superman. It marked the new beginning of the superhero franchise. It was a film that boasted a high profile director, big name cast members like Gene Hackman and none other than Marlon Brando, and lavish special effects that would truly bring the comic book world of Superman that had been so revered for forty years to life. The end result was a loud, flashy, and grand film that, by todays standards, would be considered very campy, but at the time it was the film that would forever change the face of superhero films.Superman is obviously the origin story of how the Man of Steel came to be, as well as his first battle against the nefarious Lex Luthor. The film takes the liberty of assuming that it's audience has an already decent understanding of the Superman mythology, and doesn't hinder us with verbose introductions. It does a good job at telling the story of Superman with all the details in place, but it doesn't spend much time in examining our main characters. For instance, when we meet Lex Luthor for the first time he's already an evil genius and he becomes Superman's arch nemesis as soon as he learns of his existence.Granted, this is how comic book lore works for the most part because that is the age old relationship between superhero and supervillain. Why does Lex Luthor hate Superman? Because he is Lex Luthor and Superman is Superman. However, given the already campy nature of the film these hurried characters, along with the rushed plot line, make the film feel shallow. Yet, in a way it is shallow and it knows it. It's only aim is to shower the audience with incredible special effects and grandiose sets that never cease to amaze, especially to an audience watching in 1978. And really, these are the things that just make Superman a fun film.At the end of the day we have to remember that Superman is just a superhero film. It's not an in depth character study and it's not a social drama commenting on why people like Lex Luthor do what they do. It's a fun, action packed, purposefully cheesy superhero film that definitely succeeds in what it is doing. It's a film of high quality with excellent production value.

However, there are a few other things that set True Lies above the pack. The first is the director James Cameron. However you may feel about him personally, the man has a proved pedigree when directing action movies with Schwarzenegger. He shows that pedigree here by inserting some classic 'Arnie' humour to relieve otherwise tense scenes (Schwarzenegger criticising the horse for being a 'bad cop' and telling his wife that the guys he killed were all bad). The second is the effective 'buddy cop' interplay between Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold (?!). Sometimes they're as thick as thieves, sometimes they're quibbling over their wives. I especially laughed when Schwarzenegger shattered the SUV glass after Arnold's character wouldn't give him the script of the interplay between his wife and the used-car salesman.The third is the examination and development of the relationship between Schwarzenegger and his wife after Schwarzenegger learns of her 'extra- curricular' activities and after his facade his exposed. Many action movies use some sort of hokey, cringe-worthy romance with the main character. This is more interesting though, because Schwarzenegger's character (Harry Tasker) is already married and has to rekindle a romance to save his marriage. It's funny to see how he uses all of his agency's resources to do so. However, is the film perfect, or on par with the first two 'Terminator' films? No, not quite. For one thing, Art Malik and co. fail to convince as villains the way that either of the two bad Terminators did. Malik's character comes off as a nut-case, but he lacks the menace and cold sense of purpose that makes a great villain. Tom Arnold is still a limited comedian so sometimes his routine falls flat, while Bill Paxton is more of an all-round actor than a great comedian. As such, he is sometimes funny as a used-car salesman (especially when it is implied that he wet his pants), but sometimes he's just irritating. The likes of Carrere and Dushku are fine but don't need to do much other than be sexy and act like a hysterical teenage daughter, respectively.On the other hand, Jamie Lee Curtis is good firstly as a wife, secondly as somebody who wants an adventure and thirdly as a fish out of water in Arnold's 'real' life. She conveys a whole range of emotions here. I could've done without the strip-tease though; what was she, in her mid- 40's by this time?! It must also be said that Tom Arnold is probably at his peak here. The movie doesn't always pace itself perfectly; there's certainly a spectacular beginning and end alongside ample action, but I feel that they spent a little too much time in the middle examining the relationship between Tasker and his wife. Perhaps it would've been better for Schwarzenegger to discover what his wife was up to when he was in a more action-packed situation or some such. The movie may have dragged a bit less. However, these are relatively minor quibbles. True Lies is still a quality action movie which stands up well above the pack. It is probably not one of James Cameron's best movies, but it's a mark of his quality as a director that Schwarzenegger has not starred in a better film since. As such, I have no problem giving it4\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"1 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" True Lies has pretty much all of what defines a good action film - a rapid beginning, plenty of pyrotechnics, several exciting action scenes where Arnold (literally!) avoids death by a few metres, spectacular stunts and plenty of ass-kicking by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Perhaps it would've been better for Schwarzenegger to discover what his wife was up to when he was in a more action-packed situation or some such. The movie may have dragged a bit less. However, these are relatively minor quibbles. True Lies is still a quality action movie which stands up well above the pack. It is probably not one of James Cameron's best movies, but it's a mark of his quality as a director that Schwarzenegger has not starred in a better film since.

However, there are a few other things that set True Lies above the pack. The first is the director James Cameron. However you may feel about him personally, the man has a proved pedigree when directing action movies with Schwarzenegger. He shows that pedigree here by inserting some classic 'Arnie' humour to relieve otherwise tense scenes (Schwarzenegger criticising the horse for being a 'bad cop' and telling his wife that the guys he killed were all bad). The second is the effective 'buddy cop' interplay between Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold (?!). Sometimes they're as thick as thieves, sometimes they're quibbling over their wives. I especially laughed when Schwarzenegger shattered the SUV glass after Arnold's character wouldn't give him the script of the interplay between his wife and the used-car salesman.The third is the examination and development of the relationship between Schwarzenegger and his wife after Schwarzenegger learns of her 'extra- curricular' activities and after his facade his exposed. Many action movies use some sort of hokey, cringe-worthy romance with the main character. This is more interesting though, because Schwarzenegger's character (Harry Tasker) is already married and has to rekindle a romance to save his marriage. It's funny to see how he uses all of his agency's resources to do so. However, is the film perfect, or on par with the first two 'Terminator' films? No, not quite. For one thing, Art Malik and co. fail to convince as villains the way that either of the two bad Terminators did. Malik's character comes off as a nut-case, but he lacks the menace and cold sense of purpose that makes a great villain.

Sandler would become a far more rounded actor later on, but at this time he rarely played anything over than a clownish idiot. Here is no different...but most of the time, it actually works quite well in this movie because Sandler takes that shtick to new and sometimes shocking levels. He does all sorts of wildly over the top and absurdly stupid stuff - whacking people off their balconies with golf balls, throwing tax-men out of houses, fighting with celebrities and coaches, threatening rivals with beer glasses. However, most of it works BECAUSE of its absurdity. Even the other characters sometimes get in on it, with Carl Weathers' character melodramatically falling out of a window at one point. The plot also works as a fairly simple underdog story. Happy Gilmore is a failed hockey player who has to try and get his grandmother's house back after it is repossessed, causing him to take up golf more seriously and face a fancied pro to get it back. However, at a deeper level, the story is all very predictable, replete with the failure, the requisite love interest, the lovable little grandmother, the mentor, the largely humourless golf director and the twisted villain. Nonetheless, the plot does enough to make you get behind Gilmore and laugh as he does absurd things.The acting is often about as predictable as the plot. Indeed, Sandler largely carries this film BECAUSE he is so over-the-top, with deliciously pig-headed lines of dialogue like you eat pieces of s*** for breakfast?. I suspect that if he tried to be a bit more understated, the film would not be as funny so we therefore could not ignore the film's otherwise basic plotting and acting as easily. However, basic acting doesn't necessarily mean BAD acting - everybody else, from Bowen to Bay to McDonald to director Dugan, perform their relatively one-dimensional roles pretty well. Even Ben Stiller and Richard Kiel are a nice surprise as the twisted nursing home warden and Happy's old boss respectively, while the fight scene with Bob Barker is hilarious. The likes of Trevino, Lye and Lundquist provide well-known faces and nothing more. The scenery is quite nice, while I don't take serious issue with the product placement because it makes the tournament a bit more realistic, even if there wasn't any big need for a SUBWAY ad.

It had an extremely predictable plot line, with some of the most retarded characters I've ever seen. all in all, this movie was actually worse than 2012. Trust me people, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! Almost everyone on the bus was asleep within the first 2 minutes of the movie, and slept through the whole thing. I some how managed to stay awake for the whole movie, but I wish I had fallen asleep.

This is a movie that has real heart, real emotion, real themes at its core and one of the best film soundtracks ever. Sure there a bits where it drags a little and you want it to get back to the main action but it all makes sense in the end. This film probably won't make a massive amount of sense to the average 12 year old I must say, but to the 30 somethings amongst us it carries a great deal of our childhoods with it and along with that I feel a massive emotional attachment to it. The film deals with themes such as loyalty, friendship, the transition from youth to adulthood, the acceptance of responsibility, respect for elders, working toward a common goal and much else all backed by a superb 80's soft metal soundtrack composed by the much underrated Stan Bush. The soundtrack is the driving force behind much of the emotion of the movie, watch the scene where Hot Rod becomes Rodimus Prime without The Touch and its nowhere near as effective. Watch Optimus take out the decepticons without The Touch and you won't pull for him. Watch Hot Rod and Kup escape the Sharkticons without Dare playing and it doesn't work as well. This is a movie worth seeing. If only to compare it to the newer rebooted films which are technically superior and have had more spent on the catering for the cast than this movie probably cost to make but don't have the plot lines, heart, story or sheer entertainment value that this 80's throwback does.

Alejandro Amenabar is one of the biggest talents in Spanish film but the ending to this flick is unacceptable.The movie ends when the main characters realize that they are dead. I think you could end any movie this way. Why think of a smart ending when you could end all movies with the characters realizing they're dead? You could either do this or make them realize that they were sleeping. Think about it Saving private Ryan Tom hanks was sleeping, he never went to fight WWII.
