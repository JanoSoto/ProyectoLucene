What does he have to learn on this journey to the great capital and a great career? Some say compromise, others humiliation. If the latter exaggerate, it's going to be the compromise that will lead to something Hendrik would probably never want nor expect...MEPHISTO directed by Istvan Szabo is a movie based on true events from the life of Gustav Grundgens (1899-1963) and based on the novel by Klaus Mann. Therefore, we could say that it is partly a biopic. Yet, this view would lead to confusion and misinterpretation. MEPHISTO is foremost a film about a life in a particular situation, about decisions one has to make, about burden one has to carry, about misunderstanding one has to prepare for and about treason one has to cope with. Hendrik Hoefgen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) appears to be a very complicated person he wants to do something powerful yet, he is haunted by insecurity and fear that lie within his four walls of the psyche. As a result, he wears a symbolic mask among people. The role of his life is Mephisto which he portrays twice. However, he does not expect that this second time, in order the portrayal to be accepted, he will have to adjust it. Moreover, what he never foresees is that he will also have to adjust his entire life and career in order to exist. The moment that presents his character in a nutshell is the meeting in the theater with Nazi Prime Minister Hermann Goering (Rolf Hoppe) - his behavior changing from insecurity and soft handshake so despised by the new leaders to cold smile and obedience. Then, they will start to like him, then, they will call him Mephisto (our Mephisto). But is that the only way to popularity?...But the development of the main character, which is close to masterwork, is not all MEPHISTO offers. It's a movie about a particular reality (presumably a political content) that Germany was exposed to in the 1930s, the reality that never leaves you indifferent. It is a movie that provokes emotional thoughts in any viewer ready to reflect. A pack of fanatical men rule, force a code of proper beliefs and behavior and...what to do to survive? Either immigrate or adjust oneself to this reality. Those who reject a new vision of Germany (e.g. Hans Miklas or Otto Ulrichs) experience the worst (of course, communism was another evil of the time); those who immigrate (Hendrik's wife Barbara) are regarded traitors; yet, those who stay and parrot the pseudoclassic slogans are, for the time being, used for certain purposes. Yet, not all people can choose...In this case, a very interesting, though upsetting, facet of the problem is developed racism. Hendrik's mistress Juliette Martens (Karin Boyd) is black, she wants to have a baby. However, the career of the actor and the director of Berlin theater would come to an end. He cannot dare for love with a black woman. In a memorable scene, she asks him desperately What guilt is there to blame on a child born of black mother and white, famous, father? Then, as he immediately puts aside this question, she shows him an old photo from his childhood in which Hendrik stands upright in his most young, fresh, pure years. Juliette looks at him in despair and says Do you still recognize yourself? I'll leave this thought to you who read... You must see this scene, a little psychological pearl!The performances are terrific. Klaus Maria Brandauer portrays his part in a very powerful way. You see an actor playing an actor, a mask among people, an actor in his roles, an actor in his life, a person who once appreciated freedom; yet, in time, asks himself Freedom? What for? It occurs that the Nazi dominate his life already. I think that if you like Mr Brandauer as an artist, you would definitely regard this role as one of the best ones except for Redl (1985) and Nebuchadnezzar (1998). I am proud to say that Krystyna Janda, a Polish actress, is in this film. Although I don't list her as one of my favorite actresses, I have to admit that she very well fits to the role of Barbara Bruckner, Hendrick's wife. In a memorable conversation in Paris, she does a very fine job showing helplessness, rejection and disgust to what happens in Berlin. The third role absolutely worth consideration is Rolf Hoppe's Hermann Goering - he portrays a real Nazi whose behavior is supported by three pillars of the ideology POWER, ABSOLUTE PRIDE and INFLEXIBILITY. As for purely technical aspects, the movie does not boast much. The picture is rather pale and the camera job is also not very outstanding. Yet, Sztabo's film is primarily meant to win by its content, to leave something psychologically precious in the viewers, appears to be more for the MIND than for the EYES. Therefore, this weaker cinematography may be forgiven for the sake of flawless aspects galore.MEPHISTO, though a sad and rather a depressing movie, is a must see for people who appreciate thoughts, who want to get something from a film. Perhaps not that historical to the letter but a pretty nice insight into a complexity that human appears to be. But see it in spring or summer rather than long, dark and upsetting autumn evenings.

The first film to be made under this agreement, 'Citizen Kane,' was a controversial cinematic masterpiece, and is often held as the greatest of all time. The second film was 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' which was reportedly butchered by the studio (something that would become a saddeningly frequent occurrence in Welles' career) and was received poorly by both critics and audiences. Though the director's original vision has long been lost, with time, critics have discovered a streak of genius shining through 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' and the film's stature continues to grow.Orson Welles wrote the screenplay himself, based on Booth Tarkington's 1918 Pullitzer Prize-winning novel, which traces the descent of a respected American family into poverty and obscurity. The film was seemingly quite a personal project for Welles, and his decision to produce a period-piece could perhaps be described as a bit unusual. The role of George Amberson-Minafer &#150; the arrogant, conceited young man from a proud and wealthy family &#150; seems positively perfect for Welles' smug boyish charisma, but, for this film, he appears only as the narrator, casting B-movie Western actor Tim Holt in the aforementioned role (this was one of only two serious acting performances from Holt, who also starred in John Huston's magnificent 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948),' opposite Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart). Regular Welles-collaborator Joseph Cotten is excellent as Eugene Morgan, an admirable but unpredictable entrepreneur who has never really recovered from being rejected in love by George's mother, Isabel (Dolores Costello). Meanwhile, the selfish and rude George falls in love with Eugene's daughter, Lucy (Anne Baxter).There is much to be admired about 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' but I don't think it worked quite fully as a film, perhaps due in no small part to the intervention of the studio. We'll start off with the many excellent things about the production. Stanley Cortez cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, perhaps even improving upon the achievements of 'Citizen Kane.' Of particular note is the lively party sequence during the opening half of the film, employing the use of smooth, deeply-focused tracking shots, gliding gracefully among the dancing party members and catching snippets of conversation from several groups of people. The film has a dark, very bleak outlook on life, making excellent use of lighting and shadows to set the depressing mood. Tim Holt portrays the blundering stupidity and arrogance of his character exceedingly well, his unflinching stance on numerous issues &#150; most notably in the worth of the horseless carriage, the automobile, and in the lingering romance between his mother and Eugene &#150; ultimately contribute to the downfall of his family and its legacy.I've never particularly been a fan of period-pieces, and so perhaps this is why the narrative of 'The Magnificent Amberson,' despite being a great technical achievement, failed to entirely draw me into its world. The greatest evil, however, is the extremely disjointed structure of the film's second half, as well as an absolutely unforgivable, overly-optimistic, tacked-on ending. After Welles' original 148-minute cut (as well as a later 131 minute preview) performed poorly with test audiences, editor Robert Wise removed about one-third of the original footage (Welles himself was absent and unreachable somewhere in Brazil) and a few new scenes &#150; including that ending &#150; were filmed, directed by Wise and Fred Fleck. If I could have re-edited the film myself, I would have concluded 'The Magnificent Ambersons' with what is now the penultimate scene, as George Minafer sits beside his bed and stares helplessly downwards, the somber voice of the director informing us that George Amberson-Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who had so longed for it were not there to see it, and they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him. It would have been among the bleakest and most brilliant endings in film history; however, I've heard that Welles' original version didn't end with this scene, either.

The role of George Amberson-Minafer &#150; the arrogant, conceited young man from a proud and wealthy family &#150; seems positively perfect for Welles' smug boyish charisma, but, for this film, he appears only as the narrator, casting B-movie Western actor Tim Holt in the aforementioned role (this was one of only two serious acting performances from Holt, who also starred in John Huston's magnificent 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948),' opposite Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart). Regular Welles-collaborator Joseph Cotten is excellent as Eugene Morgan, an admirable but unpredictable entrepreneur who has never really recovered from being rejected in love by George's mother, Isabel (Dolores Costello). Meanwhile, the selfish and rude George falls in love with Eugene's daughter, Lucy (Anne Baxter).There is much to be admired about 'The Magnificent Ambersons,' but I don't think it worked quite fully as a film, perhaps due in no small part to the intervention of the studio. We'll start off with the many excellent things about the production. Stanley Cortez cinematography is absolutely phenomenal, perhaps even improving upon the achievements of 'Citizen Kane.' Of particular note is the lively party sequence during the opening half of the film, employing the use of smooth, deeply-focused tracking shots, gliding gracefully among the dancing party members and catching snippets of conversation from several groups of people. The film has a dark, very bleak outlook on life, making excellent use of lighting and shadows to set the depressing mood. Tim Holt portrays the blundering stupidity and arrogance of his character exceedingly well, his unflinching stance on numerous issues &#150; most notably in the worth of the horseless carriage, the automobile, and in the lingering romance between his mother and Eugene &#150; ultimately contribute to the downfall of his family and its legacy.I've never particularly been a fan of period-pieces, and so perhaps this is why the narrative of 'The Magnificent Amberson,' despite being a great technical achievement, failed to entirely draw me into its world. The greatest evil, however, is the extremely disjointed structure of the film's second half, as well as an absolutely unforgivable, overly-optimistic, tacked-on ending. After Welles' original 148-minute cut (as well as a later 131 minute preview) performed poorly with test audiences, editor Robert Wise removed about one-third of the original footage (Welles himself was absent and unreachable somewhere in Brazil) and a few new scenes &#150; including that ending &#150; were filmed, directed by Wise and Fred Fleck. If I could have re-edited the film myself, I would have concluded 'The Magnificent Ambersons' with what is now the penultimate scene, as George Minafer sits beside his bed and stares helplessly downwards, the somber voice of the director informing us that George Amberson-Minafer had got his comeuppance. He got it three times filled, and running over. But those who had so longed for it were not there to see it, and they never knew it. Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him. It would have been among the bleakest and most brilliant endings in film history; however, I've heard that Welles' original version didn't end with this scene, either. Is this the masterpiece that got away, or is it a masterpiece, anyway? You decide.

Certainly The Thing has its dated moments. Some of the flirtatious exchanges between Magaret Sheridan and Kenneth Toby might make you cringe a little, and the portrayal of the head scientist as an emotionless workaholic may be a little bit cliché. And of course the reporter's outburst We've found a flying saucer! might get a few more chuckles today than in 1951. Given these few shortcomings, it is still a very watchable and enjoyable viewing experience and brings us back to the early days of Sci-Fi films which were mostly slotted as B-movies for the Saturday afternoon double features. The science fiction genre was not considered as important in the 1950's as today and regarded more for comic-book reading kids than mainstream audiences. It would still be 25 years before the premiere of Star Wars legitimized Sci-Fi for a wider audience.Directed by Howard Hawkes, The Thing does a good job of not revealing too much too soon. Even at the beginning, only sparse hints are made as to what will be found or what the story is about. Only gradually does the story unfold its secrets and allow The Thing to come into existence. Briefly, the setting is an outpost\/research lab in the arctic with scientists and military personnel. There, a strange vehicle buried thousands of years in the ice is discovered. Amidst the wreckage, a humanoid thing is found, still entombed in ice, and the men bring it back to the outpost for study before it escapes.The plot is based on the novelette Who Goes There by the classic SF and mystery writer John W. Campbell in the 1930's. The original story literally reeks of pulp noir as Campbell describes the stench of the outpost to begin his tale. This makes sense as Campbell was as much a noir writer as a sci-fi writer. And this may be where the movie falls just a little bit short. The original prose evokes shadows, stench, and darkened doorways, in a way that the 1951 film does not quite achieve. Occasionally, the characters seem a little too matter-of-fact about the strange visitor that has entered their lives. Maybe I wanted just a little more of the claustrophobic and darkened feel that makes Alien such an excellent film. And maybe a little more horrific emotions.Still, The Thing is a good film with interesting moments, and James Arness as the creature is worth the price of admission. And certainly an absolute must for fans of the sci-fi and horror genres. And again, this film led the way for later science fiction offerings, without which the genre would not be what it is today.

I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now.

His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wow-ed me. This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport. Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for. Dogtown and Z-Boys is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again &#150; they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time. I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming &#150; the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events. Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.Grade *** ½ out of ***** ","genre":"Documentary, Sport"},{"date":"29 July 2007","score":"","review":" I hate films about sports.

Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level. This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for. Dogtown and Z-Boys is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship. We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that. I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again &#150; they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time. I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming &#150; the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events. As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times. The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film. Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voice-over, wasn't needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events.

I guess the pre-fabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre. Use exhibit A &#150; The Game Plan as evidence of this if you want. So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like Step into Liquid and Billabong Odyssey. I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I wasn't happy. I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs. With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s. The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating. The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention. I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now. It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day. I wanted to know the men behind the myths.Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wow-ed me. This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera. He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface. He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project. While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me. It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml.

There has been the X-Men trilogy, several Spider-Man movies, Hulk, Catwoman (a Batman spin-off), the first Batman movie in a while, etc. Some of them have turned out to be excellent, while some have failed. This first installment in the Spider-Man movie franchise, which turned out to be an absolute success upon its release in 2002, isn't the best superhero movie of the decade, but it certainly isn't the worst.In the beginning, Peter Parker is a very unpopular high school student who is often picked on. However, while in a laboratory, he is bitten by a genetically mutated spider, and after that, he is no longer the same! He suddenly becomes very strong, and soon discovers that he can climb walls, shoot webs from his wrists, and swing around the city! He uses his new powers to swing around in a new costume to hide his identity, and fight crime in the city, going by the name Spider-Man! Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a local scientist and the father of Peter's best friend, Harry, has created himself an alter ego as well, but an evil one, as a result of taking the performance enhancer he has developed! As Green Goblin, he begins to wreak havoc in the city, and makes Spider-Man's job as the local hero more difficult! I have seen Spider-Man several times since seeing it in the theatre, and have basically been impressed every time. Mind you, certain moments in this adaptation of the popular comics are a bit cheesy. The part where Peter Parker enters a wrestling match looking like a kid in a Halloween costume is a tad awkward, and some of the lines in the movie are ridiculous, including some things Peter says to Mary Jane Watson. So, this 2002 blockbuster may have a few slightly embarrassing moments, which is why it's inferior to certain other superhero flicks that have come out this decade. However, this movie also has a good amount of action, as well as some gripping moments, and maybe some occasional humour.While this first installment in the Spider-Man franchise may be just a tad overrated, it sure beats Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (even though there may be some slight but unfortunate resemblances), and overall, it's a good action\/superhero movie. It's really not surprising that it was such a big hit. For those who are generally into movie adaptations of popular comic books, whether you're into those comic books at the moment or not, Spider-Man should be fun. As long as you can get over the shortcomings, and don't expect perfection, it shouldn't be a major disappointment, if a disappointment at all.

There's a really amazing sequence in their apartment that almost feels like real-time and goes on for around 25 minutes. I really can't think of any other films that so illustrate the breaking down of a marriage, except for perhaps Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From A Marriage and a few others.Interestingly, there's also Fritz Lang (who directed the great M) playing the director of the Odyssey adaptation in this film.

No real scares anymore, but some really good film-making and interesting, if somewhat dated, special FX.Never did I actually expect to be SCARED. But then the final 15 minutes of F13th Part 2 had me on the edge of my seat. Something about Ginny (Amy Steel), all alone, in the dark, and the demented-nature of Jason (very effective hessian-bag thing over his head - genuinely believable as the complete psycho who's been hiding in the woods for a few years) as he pursued her in the cabin and then to his shack in the woods.

And it's surprisingly underrated.This is by no means a comedy, although it has its funny moments. It is dramatic, more than anything. In fact, this is often a depressing film but joyful at the same time. Unlike its sequels, this one has a clever plot (a sentimental one, I'd say). It's heartwarming, in the line of others like this such as 'Old Yeller', 'Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey', 'Napoleon' and 'Fluke'.Despite the title, the story isn't just about our very dear canine friend Buddy (even if he is the main star). The story also focus on Josh Framm, who is a crucial character, together with the dog. After all, they are destined to be best friends. Josh is Buddy's salvation, but Buddy also plays an important role to save Josh's life. Buddy escapes from his alcoholic and aggressive owner and finds a peaceful life with Josh. On the other hand, Josh gets over depression and shyness thanks to Buddy, which gives the him will to live and brings back Josh's lost interest in basketball.That's when the movie's most original thing happens Buddy can play basketball! That is just amazing! Like everybody else in the movie, to see the dog playing basketball leaves me speechless. That dog has an incredible talent for basketball and even more unbelievable is that he never fails. He's a much better and natural-born player than the humans themselves. He becomes the mascot of Josh's basketball team... which brings them lots of luck.The beauty of this movie isn't just in the dramatic story, but also in the friendship between Josh and man's best friend. Plus, Buddy is a Golden Retriever, my favorite dog breed. Golden Retrievers look so friendly and pacific. They are in fact. They are among the world's sweetest and most beautiful dogs.But the magnificent scenario also gives beauty to the movie rivers, green places, a nice village. All of this is very well combined with soft, relaxing and beautiful piano music (like in Fluke).Tom is an eccentric boy who always carries minor pieces of garbage to give him luck. It is, however, a bit disturbing to see that Joe coach throwing him numerous basketballs, causing the boy to shake nervously and feel very tired.Larry, although constantly picking on Josh, isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments, the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes.As for the cast, Kevin Zegers (a sports boy in real life, just like Noah Hathaway) is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly, adorable, beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister (whoever she is) is alright either.But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk, abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.

The answer is indubitably, no.Personally I think Paul Newman has done a lot better roles than Hud Bannon, but the film certainly does have a lot of merit to it. Hud's the less favored son of Melvyn Douglas, the older son having been killed in a car crash years ago. Living on a rather large cattle ranch is Newman, Douglas, fetching housekeeper Patricia Neal and the son of that late brother Brandon DeWilde.Two Oscars came from Hud, Best Actress for Patricia Neal and Best Supporting Actor for Melvyn Douglas. Neal is the 40 something housekeeper taking care of the aging Melvyn Douglas and even in those drab housewife outfits, Neal somehow manages to look fetching. Newman and DeWilde would like a quickie with her and if truth be told, old Melvyn wouldn't mind either. She kind of likes Newman, but his drinking, his womanizing, his total contempt for any values repels her. She's a tolerant, take life as it comes soul, but Hud proves just a bit too much to take.But it really is Melvyn Douglas who sets the tone of the film. He's a righteous man with a set of ideas that cannot change with the times. Even with the crisis of which he brought on by buying infected Mexican cattle with hoof and mouth disease which necessitates killing the whole Bannon herd, he won't go for the oil on his land. He'd rather earn through hard work though he won't be in a position to earn anything for a few years with cattle.Hud maybe no good, but that doesn't stop him from seeing the gross stupidity of his father's idea.

He might not care now, but in years to come when he's his father's age, or his own age in real life now, they're going to be lonely like he can't conceive.Newman got one of his many Oscar nominations, but he lost to Paris Blues co-star Sidney Poitier for Lillies of the Field.Hud is not dated in the least and with oil in the news so much today, it has a relevance undreamed of by Paramount and director Martin Ritt in 1963.

I just could not resist the feeling of hitting the pause button and pouring out my feelings to someone....God! What a movie. I have made a point not to write something about a movie if I am really not moved by it. And I was on a 'high' after watching this one.I just can't tell you how beautiful everything is in this one. And I am wondering why is it so underrated....When you hear about the plot line you would say 'Well... another Christmas movie'... Well, it is and yet so different in so many ways!. When Kate and Jack enter there million dollar apartment for the first time it reminded me of Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron in 'The Devil's Advocate'. And just when I thought the scene is gonna turn out to be a copy.... it twists. And that's not just one of the twists.You can watch it over n over again.

Why is she not as big a star as Meg Ryan, Sandra Bullocks or even Julia Roberts(Ouch!) and others is a great mystery and a very depressing issue for me. In 'Deep Impact', 'Jurassic Park 3',the one with Woody Allen n of course this one ... I thought she was wonderful. She is a great actress and looks fantastic. Guess people have there own reasons(like I despise J Roberts for instance). I think Téa Leoni is a VERY beautiful women ....among the best!Well, whatever the reason you watch it for, rest assured that you won't be disappointed.There is something about Christmas movies and this one definitely fits the bill.BTW it's comparison with Capra's 'It's a wonderful life' is unfair.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"29 July 2007","score":"","review":" 'When A Stranger Calls' is perhaps one of the great injustices in American cinema. Far from successful when it came out, and still overlooked to this day, it's actually hard to quantify the impact that this movie had on the subsequent generation of movie makers.The story is nothing new, especially by the standards of an age in which it has been bled dry countless times, but the delivery of this movie still takes some beating. Carol Kane is the unlucky babysitter in the now infamous opening sequence. While the scene may be overlong and some of the scares far too drawn out, this scene still holds up as one of the best openings to a horror movie that has ever been made.One of the biggest complaints about this movie is that we don't see Carol Kane for a full hour after the opening number, but I think that this is one of the film's strong points. We could so easily have ended up with a carbon copy of Halloween, but instead we are presented with some of the most interesting character studies ever seen in a horror movie.Most surprising is the film's ability to evoke sympathy for the killer, without ever showing us any redeeming qualities in him. He is presented as sad, desperate and pretty pathetic, but never to the point where we know we are being manipulated. The killer's story is never laid out, nor are we given any information about him other than his actions in the film. In spite of this, Tony Beckley manages to make us pity his character to such an extent that we almost feel more for him than his would-be victims.Charles Durning pretty much plays the same burnt-out-detective character we have seen a thousand times before and since, but brings a quality all his own to it, even if it does feel a little like typecasting at times. A cop who has lost faith in what he does is not exactly a jaw-dropping idea but, as with the killer, we are never smothered with in-your-face character study or extraneous information, and the character works precisely because the film does not sink to patronising the audience or insulting our intelligence.Colleen Dewhurst appears as an alcoholic in whom the killer takes a frightening interest. Again, we are not subjected to playing by numbers or nicely palmed off with a reason for this woman being a lonely, hostile alcoholic, we simply shown that this is who she is. It is rare indeed that a movie can simply allow the audience to believe it's ideas without going into full-on explanations of everything.It is this integrity, and this faith in the audience's intelligence that ultimately allows the film to really succeed. As we are led into wanting to figure these people out, rather than being allowed to simply sit back and enjoy the ride, we find ourselves buying into the story, making the jumps and scares infinitely more affective.In the third act, when we are re-introduced to our babysitter, our emotional investment is torn equally in favour of the three main protagonists, making the final reel one of the biggest pay-offs in the horror genre.The proof is in the pudding, so to speak. There are intelligent, subtle and moving horror movies out there. You just need to know where to look.
