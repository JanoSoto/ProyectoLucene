One is her acting abilities and the second one is when she met the riders that rode from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a few years back. I know she can do more and I hope she is given the opportunity to move forward. The supporting cast (and all crew members) who put this film together deserve praise and a raise.

Good Lord. How much suspension of disbelief can you demand of one human being? The story involves a handful of thieves and murderers taking four innocent Mountain Rescue Team hostages and forcing them to lead the way to three suitcases containing collectively some forty million dollars. Maybe it wasn't exactly forty million but, as you'll see, it makes no difference.You can mostly figure out what's going to happen from moment to moment and you don't have to work especially hard to do it. Sylvester Stallone escapes from captivity and acts alone against the hoodlums. Will he natter them in all sorts of unimaginable ways? Will there be one or two times when he is forced to doff his shirt and show off his muscles? If you really need to ponder issues like these you may find the flick more absorbing than I did.Think for a moment of a stereotypical action movie. The first red digital readout on a bomb that I remember seeing on film was in a James Bond movie, the one with Odd Job, from perhaps 1963. The movie was made 43 years ago, as of this writing. I'm not at all sure that there has been a single action movie involving a time bomb since then that has not features a red digital readout clock, ticking down the second. This movie gives us THREE red digital readout clocks attached to bombs. Okay? Getting the picture? Let me note, though, to be fair, that the final stunt was very well choreographed, a failed helicopter on the side of a huge mountain, slipping away, held only be a wrought-iron ladder from which Stallone is swinging. Don't ask. It's not as finely tuned as Harold Loyd in Safety Last. But it's the equal of the stunt in Die Hard in which Bruce Willis leaps from the top of a skyscraper with a fire hose tied around his waist.Beyond that scene -- well. This takes place atop some giant snow-veined colossals, so we have multiple bodies falling through space, sometimes with parachutes, sometimes not. We have two avalanches, one of snow and one of rock, so you can thrill at the avalanche of your choice.The thieves are led by John Lithgow with a fake British accent. Often these otherwise mindless movies are redeemed by a good, smart heavy who has been given good wisecracks. Example John Travolta in Broken Arrow. Earlier (and classic example) Orson Welles as Harry Lime in The Third Man. Not here, though. The wisecracks mostly fall flat, as if they'd been toppled from some stony peak. You'd like to kill me, wouldn't you. Well take a coupon and get in line. There is one pretty good bit of dialog given to Lithgow though. See, this jet is damaged and wobbling around in the sky, and one of the gang has been wounded. What are we going to do with him? asks another thief. Lithgow Get him to a hospital -- fast. (Throws him out the door.) Otherwise the dialog is not only not innovative but redundant. A helicopter is chasing Stallone across a snowy field. Stallone is running like hell in slow motion, while Janine Turner watches. RUN!, she screams.The hull of the helicopter with Lithgow trapped inside falls to the valley and explodes in a slow motion fireball. Stallone, his bare torso flexed, is trapped under a sheet of ice while a heavy stands over him and aims a machine gun at him. So long, Pal, says the heavy, or something like that. That's what he thinks. Stallone simply pulls out a pistol and shoots him several times -- THROUGH THE WATER.I wonder if I ought to revise my opinion when I reconsider incidents like that.

Whilst I am not against this, as crime is a particularly favourite genre of mine; 'Gangster No. 1' is one of those rare occurrences where the typical criminal gangster film doesn't really hold up.One thing straight away is the title of the film. It's not particularly subtle, is it? In fact, the plot its self could be summed up by just saying the title of the film. A guy wants to go from 'Z' all the way up to 'A'. So the hierarchy element is very much present. Ever wonder why 'Scarface' didn't use the same title? Because it could've done.This film is very deliberate. It's not afraid of going over the top for the sake of it and it's not afraid of clichés. Given the fact that this was only the directors second ever feature film, it seems he's used these clichés as a kind of insurance so as to not get anything wrong too early on in his career. Some evidence here is made very blatant during the opening sequence of suited gangsters, puffing away on cigars to roughly voiced voice-overs as everyone swears like it's as necessary as breathing is. Another thing is our hero during the 1960's. Paul Bettany does a good job as the ruthless, psychotic gangster that he is but he steals the show a little too much from everyone else. The leader of the gang, normally a real hard-arse, mastermind, ruthless S.O.B is nothing more than another guy in a suit. He looks like he's just some business man out to attend another board meeting for his company that makes office equipment. This isn't good and it's rather laughable at times. So he swears a few times and dishes out a few threats. So what? Everyone does this in the NON-criminal world.Most of the other characters seemed a little eccentric and just out to start an absolute riot whenever they could; shouting as loud as they can just to get a simple message across. There are no cool, calm, collected criminals\/gangsters that have been so effective on screen in past years. Think of Mr. Blonde in 'Reservoir Dogs' or Peter Stormare's character in 'Fargo'.There also doesn't seem to be much structure to the actual plot. This may be down to the director but the screen writer, it seems, had this film as HIS first proper outing. No wonder pathetic excuses to advance the plot crop up. The way Bettany got into the mob in the first place, the way that '6 months later'(!?) two characters randomly see one of their own leaving a rival club and then go on to discover a planned hit on their boss. What was a random drive in the middle of the day has suddenly turned into a major plot point\/discovery and it was '6 months later' than the events we've just seen! It's pretty poor story telling. No wonder he hasn't had much work listed since 2000.What I also didn't like is the fact that whilst one character gets jailed for the murder of another when he didn't do it, a few scenes later we see the REAL murderer kill again &#150; in the exact same way he did before. Aren't authorities going to be suspicious that this guy's already in jail yet another murder has happened in the exact same way? It couldn't have been him, obviously, since he's in jail. Again, sloppy writing and a plot hole opens up.Then, the years, literally, fly by. This was very bad. I can't work out if the montage that followed was supposed to be funny, dramatic, powerful or whatever! Maybe they did it in such haste that they wanted to avoid opening up another plot hole. Pretty weak, if you ask me.Although 'Gangster No. 1' has some good bits now and again, it has no real 'core'. The violence is entertaining and disturbing enough and the dialogue is rather snappy. During some scenes, Bettany's decent into madness and envy is rather good and the colour and camera work is rather impressive, especially as he's making his way through lifts and down corridors; narrating everything he's doing. This was truly gripping. The torture scene that followed was brutal as it was slick.However, with things like this few and far between and a really weak sense of the scriptwriter knowing what's going on; this was nothing better than just average.

No wonder he hasn't had much work listed since 2000.What I also didn't like is the fact that whilst one character gets jailed for the murder of another when he didn't do it, a few scenes later we see the REAL murderer kill again &#150; in the exact same way he did before. Aren't authorities going to be suspicious that this guy's already in jail yet another murder has happened in the exact same way? It couldn't have been him, obviously, since he's in jail. Again, sloppy writing and a plot hole opens up.Then, the years, literally, fly by. This was very bad. I can't work out if the montage that followed was supposed to be funny, dramatic, powerful or whatever! Maybe they did it in such haste that they wanted to avoid opening up another plot hole. Pretty weak, if you ask me.Although 'Gangster No. 1' has some good bits now and again, it has no real 'core'. The violence is entertaining and disturbing enough and the dialogue is rather snappy. During some scenes, Bettany's decent into madness and envy is rather good and the colour and camera work is rather impressive, especially as he's making his way through lifts and down corridors; narrating everything he's doing. This was truly gripping. The torture scene that followed was brutal as it was slick.However, with things like this few and far between and a really weak sense of the scriptwriter knowing what's going on; this was nothing better than just average.

This starts a huge investigation by the suburbanites, especially when they discover Hans is driving the squelchy garbage out of his garage and bashes it into a bin with a stick.

Gibson's intelligent charm contrasts deeply with Brother Theodore's abrupt rough mannerisms as Hans captures the 'scared animal in headlights' look accurately.However, the film loses it's way in the end because it opts for the two endings in one which I think is a bit of a cop-out.

Cinematic fantasy was a very mixed bag. Outside of Conan and a mixed bag of Ray Harryhausen films, most of it was pretty bad. I saw the trailer for Krull and was greatly intrigued.The film has an interesting take on the quest story the setting is another world, with a monstrous invader, rather than some home-grown horror. The young prince must recruit a ragtag band of magicians, thieves, strange creatures, and seers to save his princess and destroy the Beast. He must also obtain a mystical weapon and storm an impregnable fortress. Pretty good mix for a fantasy film. Unfortunately, the execution was a little shaky.Now, the film is quite enjoyable, mostly, with some great scenes and characters. It has some problems with story structure and casting, as well as pacing in the second act. The music is wonderful and the design is astounding. Some of the make-up is a little dodgy, but the Slayers and some of the Beast are quite effective.The acting is definitely a mixed bag. if it weren't for the supporting characters, this film would be awful. Ken Marshall is rather bland as the hero, Colwyn. He handles the physical stuff well, but the romance comes across stiff, and his line delivery lacks spark. It's hard to tell about Lysette Anthony, since she was dubbed by Lindsey Crouse. Crouse's delivery is very wooden and seriously mars the scenes with Anthony. I have seen Anthony in other work and she was just fine, so the burden seems to be more on Crouse.What really makes the film are the supporting actors. We see early performances by Robbie Coultrane and Liam Neeson, as well as Alun Armstrong. Coultrane doesn't get much screen time, but is memorable. Neeson, and especially Armstrong, are great. Armstrong gets some of the best lines, while Neeson's charisma makes up for his smaller part. David Battley is fantastic as Ergo, the Magnificent. A favorite since Willy Wonka, he is a master of comic timing, and his relationship with Titch is quite charming. The character of Ergo illustrates how badly George Lucas erred with Jar-Jar. Ergo is a cowardly figure and a fool, but he shows great compassion when he fulfills Titch's wish, then finds courage when he defends him from the Slayers. Jar-Jar is never redeemed for his cowardice and, thus, becomes an object of contempt.Freddie Jones has some fine moments, but is a little over-the-top in others. Mostly, he gives a fine, stage-influenced performance.The biggest problems lie in story structure. The quest for the glave is resolved in the first act, thereby removing a goal that would have better propelled the second act. There are some fine moments in the second act, but the pacing is slow and it nearly stops the film. One seer should have been enough for the film.The Beast is also a problem. He is more menacing when he acts through surrogates and his true form is unseen. The monster make-up is better when it is hidden, but far less effective in the final confrontation.The biggest problem is the rather bland romance. Between Marshall's acting and Crouse's line-reading, you never really get a sense that these two are deeply in love. It all sounds like a teenage girl's short story.What does work are the Slayers as a constant threat, the beautiful and other-worldly designs, and the supporting characters. These elements make-up for the wooden leads and story problems. Ultimately, Krull is an entertaining fantasy film, and one of the better ones from the 80's.

I had several seemingly vivid memories from it, stemming from some of the magnificently imaginative visuals, but was shocked by how little I actually remembered of the movie. The Turner Classic Movies host, with whom we are all familiar, and who does such a good job of hosting, and giving off the air of a movie expert, mentioned Bertolucci's recent Dreamers, then said that compared with it, The Conformist is not racy at all. Now we know that he hasn't seen all the movies he introduces!

Of course you don't know this until you see the same hotel later, and its name, when Giulia and Marcello are honeymooning there.It's certainly a stimulating and powerful movie, but I can see why some were put off by the coldness of the protagonist, reflected throughout much of the movie.

The actors are all top notch with Tobey Maguire (Spiderman), Reese Witherspoon (I Walk the Line), Joan Allen, William H. Macy (Fargo) and Jeff Daniels.Pleasantville has its moments especially when the characters begin to be affected by Maquire's appearance in their town. I don't want to reveal how they change because that would spoil the movie. My problem with the film is that the second half seems to lose its way and to not know what it's about. As a result, it tends to drag. The cinematography is clever and Pleasantville is charming. Reminiscent of Back to the Future, in a way, but more serious. The story idea is clever full of potential but the script gets muddled, probably because there are so many characters there is just not enough time to develop their stories properly. Still, Pleasantville is definitely worth seeing.

The problem with this movie is that in the previous movies I could feel for the characters but in this one I actually end up rooting for Jason. I feel that the cast are just going through the motions and the writing is worse than poor and slapdash.The movie brings nothing new to the franchise and is a remix of the other six films taking little bits and pieces from each.One or two of the death scenes ARE good such as everyone's favourite sleeping bag bashing against the tree death. Some of the main reason's for this and other slasher films being so successful is a high body count, which in this case is 15.Having seen all the movies up to date in this franchise and consider myself a fan of it, this is one movie which wouldn't be missed if erased from existence. The reason for this film to have gone ahead is like some would suggest with some of the others in this series is the quick lets make some money by doing another sequel and lets not bother with a script and just watch the money come flowing in. I personally think that they made the lines up as they went along as its so terrible.Apparently this went through heavy censorship before being released so perhaps if it was seen uncut, then who knows it could be better.There is always going to be a problem when a franchise has gone on for so long. Making Jason super zombie in the 6th film Jason Lives(which i feel is the only thing wrong with that particular film) has been both a godsend and drawback. The godsend is that further films could be made, the drawback is that things will be repeated and rehashed and that. Sooner or a later a further sequel in the series will be produced which will result in a re-shoot of one of the previous films, how i hope it isn't this.The only bright side (if there can be one) is that the role of Jason was taken up by Kane Hodder who is really enthusiastic in his role as Jason in this and the next three films. Many fans were disappointed when he wasn't cast as Jason in the most recent film Freddy Vs Jason.The first movie and Friday 13th part6 Jason Lives are still the best of the series.

Whatever the truth may be, the fact stands today much as it did several thousand years ago, when this piece of Canon was created.

And yea, that is what this piece of cinematic genius is, dictated to Saint Connery in a way very similar to Mohammad's reception of the Qur'an directly from God. From these five simple words, a generation of servitude to the divine and righteous spawned, dedicated to the spreading of his good word, and the opposition of the evil works of the devil, Bauman.
