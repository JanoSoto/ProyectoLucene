[{"date":"14 October 2011","score":"","review":" Considering the makers of South Park, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, are the stars of this movie, one can expect it to be quite sick and twisted. In fact it is as the humour ranges from foul toilet humour to absolute stupidity, which is the expertise of David Zucker, the maker of the Naked Gun series and similar movies. Unlike the Naked Gun movies, it isn't simply a payout of similar types of movies with bizarre happenings in the movie, it actually has more of a firmer plot, but it is still quite funny.The main characters are basically losers who have amounted to nothing while all of their high school buddies are successful. Then they reveal to them a game that they play in their driveway, and soon more and more people become interested in it and it suddenly becomes a national phenomena. The one thing is that it is never to become like the other sports, controlled by money and sponsorship, but rather it is to be completely independent and played for the sake of playing a sport. The plot that emerges is rather simple, but it is simply there to tie the movie, and the farce that it makes towards professional sports, together.Basketball is practically a payout of professional sports. The complex rules mimic all of the rules of the professional sports, and it makes a hard hitting comment about the commercialism of sport. It pays it out at the beginning and does the same at the end as well, especially when Trey Parker sells out and becomes a sponsored goon.The movie itself is quite shallow and the theme very blatant, but what it does it that it shows us straight out the patheticness that sport has become. Unlike other movies, it doesn't pussyfoot around with subtle messages, but is very blatant and open about it. In the end though, it is simply an hilarious farce.

The Goodbye Girl was a very frustrating movie for me to watch. While it's clearly a very good film and I liked Richard Dreyfus' character very much, the writing irritated me as it seemed a bit irresponsible.My problem is with Marsha Mason's character. The film begins and her live-in has apparently dumped her--moving out and leaving a 'Dear Jane' letter (nice guy, huh?). You feel a bit sorry for her until you soon learn that this bum was STILL married and she knew it! And, she'd been married once before. Now it's obvious she's not good at making decisions involving guys. BUT, here's what really bothered me...she had a young daughter and seemed to have no problem with her kid seeing all this chaos. And, in a weird twist, the little girl sounds like the mother--dispensing wisdom and rolling with the punches. And, Mason often seemed to expect her kid to parent her--making her feel good about herself when bad things happen. Considering how wildly popular the film was, obviously most folks didn't feel the way I did. I just found her character difficult to like and the film could have been better had she had failed relationships BUT they were not caused by her own stupidity. Sleeping with a married man?! What man would want a lady like this? To me, this does NOT seem to be the makings for a romantic film! It's sad, really, as the rest of the film was excellent. Richard Dreyfus was exceptional and I could see why he got the Oscar--he was likable but flawed and quite charming. Mason, on the other hand, seemed like an emotional basket-case in need of saving--not a woman a reasonable man would want in his life. So, as a result of loving and hating the film, I was left VERY emotionally torn--frustrated and touched at the same time (which is a very strange feeling!). Well worth seeing but I can't help but wonder if folks watching the film internalized this weird message and perhaps thought Mason's parenting wasn't that bad and might have unconsciously emulated this. Kids need a lot more security in their lives than the one in this film got. It sure seemed like a case of child neglect in order for the mother to make herself feel good.

Had the director searched for the more suitable actor for the role of Frank, he wouldn't have found the better one than Silvester Stalone, I am very sure of that. Being involved in acting as an amateur for the last 30 years I can tell you that everyone who says that Sly is a terrible actor is wrong!! He is a great actor and a great film person! In this movie with his acting he puts in shadow greatness like Robert De Niro or Ray Liota, both amazing film values. We are talking about interesting drama plot which Stallone makes the most interesting by his movie appearance and film charm. What I love about him is his face and body talk. Considering the fact that he has beaten the face paralysis big time, I just say that I am amazed by him. Except Stalone, I loved acting of Harvey Keithel, so creepy and convincing and also of Robert De Niro - original and witty as always. As for directing I have to say that was a very good job! I love this movie and I give it the greatest rate. I think that it is pretty underestimated on this site.
