This is a really entertaining film that is almost comparable to Ocean's Eleven. The cast was incredible. Edward Norton, Martin Landau, John Malkovich, and especially the main lead, Matt Damon did there roles very well and without their great performances, the film would be a let down. The direction by John Dahl and the screenplay written by former writers, David Levien and Brian Koppelman, were very well done also. The dialogue was written well and the narration by Matt Damon, made the film even better. Overall, this is a very gripping and entertaining movie. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook 8.5\/10 ***+ B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"22 August 2006","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Rounders is about a reformed gambler that must return to playing big stakes poker to help a friend pay off loan sharks.
