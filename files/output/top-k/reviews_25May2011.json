When you consider that films like My Fair Lady, the Sound of Music, Driving Miss Daisy, Rain Man, and Forrest Gump have also earned the Best Picture prize, Lambs sort of stands alone. Best Picture Films which match Lambs on the disturbing meter are predominantly set in historical situations, such as Platoon, Gandhi, the Hurt Locker and Schindler's List. Possibly the only other fictional Best Picture winners which could compete with the horror of Lambs is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Unforgiven. But none of these movies ever dealt with not one but two serial-killer sociopaths in a suburban-rural setting.Despite the outstanding quality of this horror-suspense film, Lambs is not for the feint of heart. Lambs centers around three characters dealing with intense psychological dysfunction. Each character in turn not only reacts to their dysfunction in their own style but is in very different circumstances. Two of the three engage in horrific behavior of extreme violence, succumbing to the darkest side of human behavior as a result of their mental illness and dysfunctional pathology. At the story's beginning, one of them is in an institution for the criminally insane, having had a history of violent and sadistic behavior. The second is on the loose, dispatching young women for reasons yet unknown. The third character deals with her psychological issues by joining the FBI, and her reason d'etre becomes a mission to stop such behavior and rescue potential victims at the hands of psychological killers. If a story is about the growth and change of a character, then Lambs' narrative is really about Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is majoring in the Behavioral Science division which does psychological profiling of criminals, particularly serial killers. Her first real task, or test in a sense, is to psychologically profile the serial killer Hannibal Lecter, nicknamed the Cannibal, played with such a believable yet sadistic sensibility by Anthony Hopkins that make Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seem more like Saturday morning cartoon villains by comparison. Lecter is possibly one of the most fascinating and simultaneously repulsive characters in fiction and film. He is a fusion of an Ivy League liberal arts professor who easily quotes ancient philosophers and the Monster of Venice, an Italian serial killer who dispatched victims, usually women, without a shred of empathy. But Lecter also has a fondness for high culture, displayed by his drawing of the Duomo in Milan. Italy. We learn Lecter had been a university professor of psychology who made it a habit of eating human victims. At story's beginning, he resides at a prison of mentally disturbed criminals where Starling first meets him in person. Starling and Lecter form a strange yet compelling bond, not quite true friendship but something more meaningful than mere acquaintance. Part of the story is the evolution of Starling's and Lecter's relationship. A very subtle undertone of sexual flirting is hinted at in some scenes and yet we know that these two worlds could never permanently mesh.Eventually, Starling begins to solicit the help of Lecter to arrest the perpetrator of the horrid acts of the second character. At film's beginning, we learn the FBI is hot on the trail of a strange woman-killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill by the press. Buffalo Bill has dispatched five women, but no one at the agency can figure out his motive. With Lecter's help, Starling begins to unravel who Buffalo Bill is from a psychological standpoint as a means of finding out his identity and where he lives. Part of the narrative involves the revealing of both Starling and her target Buffalo Bill, although the most interesting and colorful character, Hannibal Lecter, remains completely enigmatic. The story then pushes into a new direction when a young woman from a prominent family is kidnapped and it is believed she has been abducted by Buffalo Bill. Can Starling extract enough information from Lecter to save the young woman before Buffalo Bill dispatches another innocent victim?One of the first elements that strikes you about Lambs is its foreboding atmosphere with some scenes having a quasi-medieval flavor. When Starling first visits the corridor inside the mental prison which houses Lecter, you feel like you're walking into a medieval dungeon. The stone brick is dirty and damp, and the inmates seem like something right out of Dante's Inferno (Hell). The same is true for Buffalo Bill's hideout, a maze of dark corridors filled with strange objects, like mannequins and costumes. The place where he imprisons his victims rings of something out of the Spanish Inquisition. Themes of raw sexuality permeate the entire story, although there is no love affair between any of the characters. Simultaneously, there are also overtones of objectifying human beings. Dr Chilton, the doctor in charge of Lecter at the hospital, boasts of having his sociopath patient, So rare to capture one alive. From a research point of view, Lecter is our most prized asset, as if Lecter is a rare object rather than a person. Also, the serial killers objectify their victims as a means of rationalizing their behavior. The Silence of the Lambs is one of the best horror-suspense films of its type with absolutely first-rate acting by the leads and the supports. And one of the most disturbing. But if you're looking for escapist innocent fun, Lambs will have you running under the covers, or at least switching to My Fair Lady. Lecter and Buffalo Bill are the stuff nightmares are made of.

Fritz Lang with cameraman Karl Freund creates a world of the future that is all too present-day. The pro-labor, pro-union message is blatantly obvious, but presented in a compelling way. Almost in a socialist way, though not quite.I do not even want to write a review of this one because anything I say will not do it justice. I do want to point out the need to watch the complete version from Kino. I once tried to watch a public domain version, and it was awful. I do not think I made it twenty minutes.

It certainly was not as good to me as the second Beverly Hills Cop film, which was my favorite. I did not even like this as much as the first film which I was not all that crazy for. This one has Axel going back to Beverly Hills to find those responsible for the murder of his chief, and of course it is a rather flimsy reason. Well he goes back to the Hills and an amusement park seems to be at the center of things here and you get this scene where Axel jumps with ease on a moving Ferris Wheel type ride making people in the movie theater wonder aloud if he were Spider-man. Along the way of finding his chief's killers and catching the bad guys he runs into his old friend played by Bronson Pinchot who is a bit funny, but you have seen the character once and there really is not much more you can do with him to make him any funnier and fresh. So all in all a rather dull ride of a movie, this film came at a period where Eddie was in a horrid slump and he probably thought this was the film that could break that slump. He thought incorrectly and I am afraid if he makes part four it will be for the same reason, to break an even more horrible slump and again I am afraid he will be mistaken.

According to Wikipedia Don't Look Now was, along with Hitchcock's great film Rebecca, one of only two movies Daphne du Maurier liked based on her work. But living in North America, I found it a hard movie to see and harder to buy. If you can get ahold of this one, it's worth it.After losing their young daughter, a depressed married couple (Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland) encounter two weird sisters who claim they can see the girl in spirit and that she is happy. This gives Laura (Christie) much relief, but John won't accept his daughter's afterlife. He thinks he's being realistic, but he's really in denial- Laura is making peace with the child's death and John isn't. His failure to do so makes him think he can still find her and chase after her- a mistake that destroys him, despite psychic warnings.What are we to make of that killer dwarf? The viewer is free to decide whether she was real or a metaphor, a deformed serial killer or death personified. Maybe John was killed by a murderer but he had delusions as to what the killer looked like. Maybe he actually killed himself. Maybe he died in the accident at the Church and what happens after that is all in his mind in his last few seconds. In that light, the dwarf, which might be regarded by some as strange and random, is open to interpretation.The story possibilities are helped along with beautiful direction, editing and cinematography. There does seem to be some influence from Hitchcock. Not all of the acting is perfect- Sutherland yelling out Dead! Dead! Dead! was overkill- but in general it works. The movie is intriguing, haunting, and captivating.

Personally I'm all for Sequel's As long as they are entertaining and add some things that are new, and Death Wish 4 Does that.The Plot Once again involves Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson)Now Living with a Girlfriend (Kay Lenz)in L.A,everything Seems to Be going Good for them until Kersey's Girlfriend's Daughter Dies From a Cocaine Overdose, Kersey Goes out to find the Pusher who sold her the Drugs and Kills him, however the next day Kersey gets a mysterious phone call from someone Claiming to know who Kersey is, and telling him to meet the caller at a specified address, he goes to the address and meets a Reporter who's Daughter also died from a Cocaine overdose, and with Kersey's Help wants revenge on the entire drug underworld. He offers Kersey Info on all the Drug Dealers in L.A as well as access to more weapons.

Not in the sense of a maniac with an axe and buckets of blood spewing everywhere, but in that it portrays the slow, inexorable and unexplained destruction of a family's happiness.Constance and Edward Sumner (Diane Lane and Richard Gere) should be a happily married couple. They're rich enough to own a huge house by a lake. They have a circle of interesting friends. They have a darling young son. They have a cute dog. They're both incredibly attractive and still appear to be attracted to each other. But one day, while Connie's running errands in the city during a wind storm, she meets a handsome book dealer named Paul Martel (Oliver Martinez). He's young and charmingly European and Connie finds herself drawn to him. They begin a torrid affair with Paul consuming more and more of Connie's thoughts and time. Eventually, Edward becomes suspicious and asks a private eye to follow his wife. He sees photos and Connie and Paul together and confronts Paul about the affair. What happens then changes Connie and Edward's lives forever.This is a very engrossing story, but it's not exactly light and frothy entertainment. This isn't a thriller where suspense is generated through some twisted little game between characters. The tension this film doesn't come from artifices of plot but from watching the pain of desperate people trapping themselves in terrible situations. There are no moments of melodrama in Unfaithful, no easy rationales or easier resolutions. This is very much a movie for adults to appreciate on an adult level&#x85;and that's not a reference to Diane Lane getting naked.Though she is unclothed and terrifically sexy in this film, Lane's performance is so powerful and real that her nudity isn't titillating or exploitive but simply a match to the raw emotions overwhelming Constance Sumner. In her first sexual encounter with Paul, Connie's body literally shakes in equal parts anticipation and apprehension. The pain and the fear she feels when the affair threatens her family almost visibly radiates off her face.Richard Gere matches Lane's work, but in a different way. Edward is a man disconnected from his deeper emotions. He only swims on the surface of himself and when something comes up from deep within, he can't control it. If Lane's Constance is like a quivering exposed nerve, Edward is a rumbling volcano that erupts uncontrollably.For his part, Oliver Martinez isn't a third wheel in this adulterous triangle. His Paul may be a cad, yet he's not bad. Paul is a thoughtless hedonist, but he doesn't want to cause anyone harm. He just never allows himself to dwell on the collateral damage of his romantic and sexual behavior. Martinez may look like one of those Euro-heartthrobs who pop up in Hollywood every few years and get drooled over by all women before disappearing again, but he shows a lot of acting talent and skill here.The reason why I call Unfaithful a horror movie is because it embraces the defining theme of the genre - it is about the normal world being assaulted and destroyed by The Other. In this case, though, The Other isn't Paul Martel. He's actually part of the normal world. The Other in this horror movie is the unthinking, uncontrollable desire that seethes through Connie Sumner. Some people may watch this film and think it's about a woman dealing with a neglectful husband and an unfulfilling life. But Edward isn't neglectful and while her life may be a bit more domestic than romantic, Connie isn't some Madame Bovary trapped in an empty existence. As I mentioned earlier, Connie should be happy with her life. She even seems happy with it, but she's still caught up by this unreasoning, unexplained impulse to betray her husband and imperil her family. The fear and anxiety of watching Connie and Edward's life inescapably implode comes from thinking that it can happen to any family at any time.Unfaithful is a romantic-horror movie.

Who the hell's Gordon?-The film is not a big political agenda, which I admire, but it's portrayal of Somalia and the people there is so simplistic. They're a bunch of one dimensional savages who drop like flies when killed while the Americans get long drawn out deaths. According to Brenden Sexton, one of the actors, many scenes asking questions like the true purpose of their mission in Somalia, etc., were cut out. Why? I have no idea. The topic of American interventionalism is something that would have been very interesting to explore.The movie also fails to explain the reasons behind the Somali's opposition to the U.S. military presence in their country.I can't comment on acting, because they're isn't any. There are maybe 30 lines spoken in the film that aren't simply get down, reloading, *curse word* etc. The fact that none of the actors have any personality doesn't help the acting either.

There are maybe 30 lines spoken in the film that aren't simply get down, reloading, *curse word* etc. The fact that none of the actors have any personality doesn't help the acting either. I guess the acting wasn't bad, so there's that.The action scenes started out strong, but in the second half, it just kinda dragged and felt redundant. Sometimes movies and shows can be so intense that you feel emotonally exhausted (the Chaos episode of Southland or the Ozymandias episode of Breaking Bad) and Black Hawk down definitely tried to do that, but I was so uninterested in anything going on that it failed to have that effect on me.it just didn't work for me. Most people seem to love it. Professional film critics, IMDb, and that's fine. I just don't agree. It's alright, I guess, not something that I plan on watching a second time. It simplifies a real life event and takes what could have been an interesting story into a fairly dull war film, but that's just me.

But this is rarely the past as actually experienced, but the past as imagined and idealised through memory, forgetfulness, distortion, reorganisation and desire. In this sense nostalgia is always less about the past than about an inadequate present. It is a historical inversion, in which the ideal that is not being lived now is projected into the past.

You can look and reject, learn, critique etc. Or you can look and linger longingly. In its yearning backwardness, postmodernism is thus not only a recovery project, but an attempt to defy the end.

Opening sequence John Baxter studies projected slides of the inside of a Venetian church. At his side, John's wife repeats a question their daughter once asked If the Earth is round, why is a frozen pond flat? John smiles, but then notices a figure cloaked in red on one of the slides. He leans in for a closer look. His smile fades. Outside, his daughter Christine, similarly dressed in a red mackintosh, falls into a pond. Baxter senses trouble, runs outside, but is too late. She's dead. Director Nicholas Roeg edits the sequence, cutting back and forth from John to his wife to his son to his daughter to the church, to suggest fateful rather than coincidental connections.John and his wife travel to Venice. The city becomes a nightmarish dream-space, their daughter's death carved into the very landscape. Grisly murders happen out of sight, the city's canals recall the pond in which Christine died, a child's doll is seen floating in the water, corpses are pulled out of rivers, and red cloaked killer dwarfs lurk in the shadows.While the city haunts, a manifestation of their troubled psyches, the Baxter's grief in their own, unique ways. The wife, Laura, becomes obsessed with a pair of mediums whom she believes can summon her daughter's spirit. One of the clairvoyants is blind, literally privy only to the metaphysical. John, however, denies outright the existence of spiritual, supernatural realms. He is an architect. A man of reason. Clean lines. An empiricist. Laura has a mental breakdown. In the hospital, a child plays with the very ball that bounced while her daughter died. John blocks out his wife's mental disintegration, denies the possibility of conversing with the dead, purposefully avoids the clairvoyants and seems to have forgotten about his daughter entirely. His denial bleeds into every scene like ink. I know this place, he says of a waterway, before chasing a red figure and later denying the occurrence when questioned by his wife. Similarly, throughout the film, John and Laura travel through Venitian canals. In the background, almost subliminally, police are seen ferrying bodies on boats. At one point John talks to an officer. Laura asks what's going on. John dismisses it. Nothing, he says, as bodies are fished out of liquid.Throughout the film it is subtly implied that John is himself clairvoyant. It is only when the mediums bring this to Laura's attention that we learn this outright. John's denial thus stems, not from simple grief, but an attempt to deny his own supernatural abilities and therefore responsibility; he let their daughter die. As such, Roeg shows John increasingly withdrawn, boxed in, drunk, shut off from the outside world. And yet...John restores an ancient church, the building like some Gothic window into his own heart. As the church is restored, so to is, not only John's belief in the otherworldly, but his confrontation with his capacity to tap into the future. We recall that John authored Beyond the Fragile Geometry of Space.Ending John chases what he hopes to be a restored Christine through the alleyways of Venice. They meet in an alcove, where the figure is revealed to be a serial killer, who swiftly kills him. Confronting the death of his daughter, he receives her admonishment. The father kills the child, the vengeful child the father. A failed restorer of imagery, John fails yet again to foresee death. Final shot Laura on a funeral barge, surrounded entirely by water.The film was based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, who also wrote stories upon which Alfred Hitchcock's Jamaica Inn, Birds and Rebecca are based. Don't Look Now thus at times strongly resembles Hitchcock's works, pushing the master's brand of opera, big emotions, expressionism and baroque imagery into more nervous, kaleidoscopic territory. Roeg's use of composer Pino Donaggio also recalls both Hitchcock's collaborations with Bernard Herrmann and Brian De Palma's collaborations with Donaggio. De Palma has himself made a career out of making films like Don't Look Now (and Vertigo, one of Don't Look's more obvious ancestors), most of his films baroque, operatic, and reflective of his hero's dream-spaces. His Obsessions, like Don't Look, also takes place in Italy, is scored by Donaggio, and revolves around tortured fathers and restoration projects on churches.The film also recalls Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, another film about the return of the repressed, though Kubrick rejects the supernatural outright and presents the flip-side of Don't Look. In The Shining, a father's flight into fantasy and an audience's desire for the supernatural becomes a means of denying a history of scars wrought on children and others. Or as Deleuze put it We do not repeat because we repress, we repress because we repeat. The kind of repression Don't Look presents therefore has little real world basis. Typicaly, traumatised humans do not deny the supernatural but immediately resort to fantasy and magical thinking she's in a better place now, it was meant to be, she's with God, shes okay, it didn't really happen etc.Don't Look belongs firmly to the occult horror genre (Polanski, Wicker Man etc), but what's remarkable is how naturalistic it feels, despite Roeg's hallucinogenic tone and rapid, elliptical editing. Rather than distract, Roeg's razzle dazzle creates a vivid impression of Baxter's grief and anxieties. This is largely due to the casting of Donald Sutherland as John. With his unusual face\/eyes and large moustache, both of which seem to humanise John and make his anguish and loss all the more real, Sutherland is the kind of hero you can find only in 1970s cinema. In its ability to evoke and conjure up the ordinary, Sutherland's moustache is perhaps the most supernatural thing about the film.8.9\/10 &#x96; Worth two viewings.

Shot through what can only be described as a grainy grey lens, the film highlights the ambiguity of it's characters by drowning the city and in it's landscape in a hopelessness reflective in the killings. It is also invariably raining in the film, which also adds to a sense of depravity and despair amongst those who inhabit this place of woe. John Doe (the offender) is breathtakingly realised by ***** ******(I won't give it away) and Pitt and Freeman both work brilliantly together as their on screen alter ego's work tirelessly on the case at hand, whilst all the while deliberating on such themes such as morality, redemption and whether or not the guy they're after is just another fruitcake or something much more...So to conclude Se7en is astonishing throughout, with mesmerising direction, perfect casting and a top notch ending worthy of the award for the greatest film ending of all time...Se7en..it'd be a sin to miss it.

Much has been made about the butting of heads between Alfred Hitchcock and famed Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but Rebecca ends up feeling like a Hitchcock picture with the sweeping feel of a Hollywood film.Despite being Hitchcock's first experience working with Hollywood and Selznick's reputation for controlling his projects and making literal book adaptations (this being of Daphne Du Maurier's novel), the best parts of the film have Hitchcock's thumbprint on them. He infuses the story with total suspense and discomfort, refusing to let it bore for long in spite of its length.The story follows a Gothic romance storytelling model akin to the Bronte sisters, which explains why star Joan Fontaine won the lead in Jane Eyre opposite Orson Welles just a few years later. Hitchcock channels nearly everything through Fontaine's performance as the aptly unnamed main character, a personal assistant who on a whim during her stay in Monte Carlo meets and marries a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). Fontaine exudes a lovable naivete, one that starts out earning sympathy but twists into an attribute that antagonizes the audience as the film goes on as the presence of the late great first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca grows more powerful.The role of Rebecca easily ranks as the most powerful character in cinema to never appear on screen. Hitchcock sees to it that her presence not only fills the mansion that already overwhelms the new Mrs. De Winter, but also consumes the film itself. She's felt both on camera and in the audiences mind, enough so that when Hitchcock pretends that she's really there by following her with the camera in a key scene late in the film where Maxim recalls the night she died, you honestly believe it and picture her as some terrifying figure. But there's no depreciating the characters on screen. Fontaine as she writhes about in mentally anguish does manifest everything a bit too physically, but the reaction she creates in the audience is a palpable paranoia and fear. Olivier portrays a man quick to anger but clearly for deep-seated reasons that come from a dark place. Then there's Mrs. Danvers, the woman who runs the house. The moment Judith Anderson walks on screen she enters your mind. A good comparison would be Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch in The Wizard of Oz. It helps that Mrs. Danvers also serves as an antagonist, but in an entirely different way. We connect with our unnamed heroine's fear of Mrs. Danvers, but not simply because she plays the creepy housekeeper, but as we come to know her and understand her connection to the late Rebecca, she becomes this psychologically complex individual. Although Hitchcock's directorial voice runs through Fontaine, Anderson adds punctuation to his efforts, especially as she steals the final moments of the film.Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences would have you believe Rebecca to be Hitchcock's finest effort, it merely showcases his ability as an artist to overcome what was a producer-driven Hollywood at the time. Despite David O. Selznick's name appearing before the title card, Selznick will always be better remembered for Gone with the Wind.' Rebecca &#x97; that was Hitchcock's work.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"25 May 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Both a Golden Age Gothic romance and a true Hitchcock thriller, Rebecca somehow merges its director's style with its producer's sensibility.
