The comedy feeds off the chemistry of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. And the action, while doesn't surpass the original, Shanghai Noon, nor does it even come close to previous great Jackie movies, is still fun to watch.The movie begins just days after the first Rush Hour ends and from the first movie, we already know that the two detectives, Inspecter Lee (Chan) and Detective James Carter (Tucker) share a bond and there's no need to jump into character development. We know them and we smiled to see them together again singin' the beach boys down the streets of Hong Kong. There is some character development as the story progressing involving more off the fact that both parents of our two heroes were legendary police officers themeselves. But again, what's there to really know about the plot... it's a reasonable enough plot involving fake printed money and takes them from Hong Kong, to LA, and ultimately, of course, to Vegas within the span of 120 minutes.To help with the action, the movie casted Zhang Ziyi. I was hoping perhaps for a Chan and Ziyi fight scene, but was let down to see instead a floppy Tucker and Ziyi, with an horrible ending. However, she's impressive in the role as a villian and had no trouble with her lines which were all in chinese. John Lone plays our main villian man behind the whole fake money printing deal and is also the leader of the Chinese gang, the Triads. He is also Lee's father's partner and had something to do with Lee's father's death. And undercover U.S. secret service agent Isabella Molina, is played by relatively new comer Roselyn Sanchez. Male audience in attendence to last night's sold out show liked her a lot. Chan is wonderful carryin' the action in the movie. It's not his greatest nor is it even close as stated EARlier, but it's still fun to watch. He complained he had little time to do things the way he wanted it, a mistake on hollywood's rush to get it in theaters ASAP. Previous Jackie films leave you gasping and thinkin' AWESOME!, this time we're just left thinkin' pretty cool.What we really depend on for this movie to work is the comedy from the chemistry of Chan and Tucker. They have so little in common, yet they mesh so well. It's important to note that when you have a Chinese Guy who doesn't impress with his English, and a African-American who talks and talks... you're going to run into a lot of racial jokes. A majority of them from Tucker about Asians, but I didn't really find them offensive. There are a few about white people, and Roger Ebert seemed a bit offended. But I found them to be very much light and unintentially harmful... and for the most part they aren't harmful at all. Try not to be serious about them, and you'll end up enjoyin' the movie. Aside from the racial jokes, a lot of the other comedy material were priceless Chan trying to talk like Tucker, Tucker's Karoakin' Michael Jackson's Don't stop till you get enough, Tucker's endless persuit for Mushu, and Chan's great ability for physical comedy which should be more, but is less appreciated that any of the verbal comedy. But with all that material, plus the sure box-office success, Rush Hour 3 and 4 are inevitable.And for me, I didn't really want it to end.

It suffers from too many drawbacks in the story, as well as Barker's own direction, and never quite lives up to its ability to deliver consistent good scares.  The story of Hellraiser is fairly in simple in technical terms.  A man, Frank Cotton, purchases a configuration shaped as a box and fiddles around with it, opening a dimension that lies between the depths of pleasure and pain.  Years later, Frank's brother, Larry (Andrew Robinson), and his wife Julia (Claire Higgins) move into the same house.  Larry gets a deep cut on his hand and the blood spills to the ground, which actually revives Frank (in a rather gruesome sequence).  He and Julia shared a past together and he convinces her to bring men back to kill so he can use their blood to bring his flesh back.When it comes to some shocks and jolting moments of suspense, Hellraiser has some well-done scenes.  There are some scares in the film, and the gore effects, which are in a gratuitous abundance, are quite impressive.  There are a few moments of startlingly effective imagery and some very suspenseful scenes, but Clive Barker does so many other things wrong I can hardly believe this movie is actually considered a classic by so many people.This movie is essentially about pleasure and pain, or so I think Barker would try to lead us to believe that's what this is all about.  Those ideas are given a ham-fisted presentation in flashback torture scenes.  Yeah, I see all the pain, but where's all the enticement of pleasure? In the novella, Frank was tempted with the possibility of sex (but in the most repellant manner). The torture scenes are all Barker really cares to show us when it comes to these ideas, basically featuring some people get ripped apart by chains. I suppose I can't forget the fact that people also talk about it, too.  The character Frank goes into these frank and quite dumb brief conversations about how he was bored and simply wanted to experience more and go to the limits, his words not mine.  I'm sorry, but this hardly sounds like a decent reason to do anything like this.  If he was close to death or something along those lines, I could almost believe it, but I could only scoff when he uttered those lines.When it comes to horror films, logical lapses can be accepted.  It's a lot easier to take such moments in fun-based horror films that are simply meant for escapism, but this movie's pretentiousness is overbearing.  Thus, it's a little hard to believe that nobody in the house could smell the rotting, maggot-infested corpses of three men.  It's also a little hard to accept the fact that Robinson's character never realizes just how repressed his wife is.  Sure, he notices she's got problems, but she's a murderous psycopathic bitch.  Barker gives the movie a dark and grim look, not necessarily a bad choice, but he likes to conjure up a lot of dark themes and taboos for the sake of just trying to make the movie look...well, different, dark, and offbeat.  The movie focuses on extramarital affairs, serial killings, and even incest and does all this just by simply tossing these odd moments on-screen without any care or background for it in the first place.  These characters' motivations for such odd behavior is never explained and they're simply way too evil to be taken as real people.The cenobites are only sparingly used in the movie, probably a good idea on Barker's behalf.  They're a little scary at first, but I felt a little goofy after awhile when I realized I was getting scared by a creature that likes to look straight in the air and speak in a dull monotone.  Yeah, I'm talking about Pinhead, the famed horror villain of the series.  Played by Doug Bradley, he's a little enigmatic at first but after a few moments, you really don't care what he is.  In the film, the cenobites appear to have the ability to transport around as is seen when they suddenly appear at the Cotton residence.  (Spoiler)  Yet, when they try to take Kirsty with them, they move towards her at a slug's pace and she simply uses the box to transport them back (speaking of which, I'm clearly certain the fat cenobite only fell through the floor).  That doesn't sound like the all-powerful demons we were prior shown.  Oh, and by the way, this visual lightshow in the finale is pretty embarrassing.    Ashley Laurence is the main character of this film, as well its first sequel.  She's a little wooden here at times, but is relatively okay.  Andrew Robinson is also not bad as the unwitting husband, but claire Higgins is absolutely horrendous.  Trying to act like a repressed woman turned murderous fiend, she just comes off with a terrible impression.  As for the rest of this franchise, I've only seen Hellbound, which is worse than this.  I sure do sound like I'm bashing Hellraiser, but as I said before, it does have its scares and jolting moments.  The only reason I give it as much a harsh criticism as it seems like I am is because of its beloved acclaim from horror fans everywhere, which it really doesn't deserve.

The Princess Diaries is certainly no exception as he makes a meticulously by the book corny fest (I had to walk out at one point and have a breather for sanity) with Hathaway playing a 15 year old (isn't she 21?  no sense huh?) who finds out that she is the princess of Genovia or some country and she has to take it over and will she be able to and, and DO I NEED To GO ON?  I think not.  Unless you have never seen a movie before, you will be knowing the entire plot of the movie while your watching it (I knew it before I even saw the trailer which is never a good sign) and it uh, uh, just sucks.  Let me put it this way, the only reason I saw this movie was because it was in theaters and I try to see all movies in theaters around me, that's all.

Opens with a  funny scene where one of them is trying to pitch a really twisted, 70's nostalgia idea called The Brady Killers.

It almost completely collapses into a serious romantic flick  with a pretty sunset and soft Michael (SUMMER OF 42) Legrand like piano chords. Fortunately it manages to revive itself by having a nice wrap up.  Showing how although their obsession to TV pop culture can at times be a social impediment, it can also help them work thru (and get thru) life's obstacles and disappointments. The best thing about this picture though is William Shatner who is funny and engaging in absolutely every scene he's in.  Whether it's talking madly about making a musical version of Julius Ceaser with himself in every role or drunkinly stumbling over other patrons at a bar. He's fresh, fun, with just the right touch of self depreciating humor. He also allows for added insight by showing how celebrities, even 'idols' by some, must deal with the same problems as the 'ordinary' person.

It's pointless stuff to set up him going on the rampage. At least it is in Commando, The Running Man and Raw Deal. Unfortunately Red Heat contains none of their insane mayhem. What it contains is scenes of plot exposition through dull dialogue no-one understands, to lead up to a completely uninspired conclusion, which is a rip off of Walter Hill's own earlier and far superior 48 Hours. The kiss off moment is so sudden I can barely remember it now. Arnie's performance is memorable for him trying to pronounce the name Viktor in a Russian accent. I'm not sure why he bothered. Sadly the film is also memorable for Belushi's poor acting. His character is obnoxious throughout and he lacks any charm whatsoever. There's a moment where he puts a gun to a bad guy with the words Freeze motherf*****, with no threat at all. Just think of Sam Jackson saying that to emphasize how poor Belushi is.

However, since it was released on video, it has acquired quite a crowd of fans. Including me. Stand By Me is one of my all-time favorite movies, up there with the grittier, more violent films I usually give masterpiece status, i.e. Midnight Cowboy, Naked, Yi Yi (A one and a two), Pixote and Taxi Driver. Like these classics, Stand By Me gets top marks from me.Based on the Stephen King novella 'The Body', Stand By Me is the coming-of-age story of four twelve going on thirteen-year-old boys who set off into the Oregon woods to find the body of a missing boy their age who they've overheard was killed by a train. Gordie (Wil Wheaton) is the main character who, as an adult (played by Richard Dreyfuss), tells the story. He is the brightest of the bunch, sensitive and emotional. Like his friends, he has family trouble. His older brother Denny died in a jeep accident, and his parents now just ignore him. His father is even openly hostile, considering Gordie, a wannabe writer, to be second-best to football-star Denny. Chris (River Phoenix) is the leader of the gang. He is Gordie's best friend but they are like chalk and cheese. Chris is tough and athletic, whereas Gordie is skinny and thoughtful. Chris comes from a bad family and everyone knows that he'll turn out bad, including Chris. His brother is Eyeball, a friend of Ace Merrill (Kiefer Sutherland), the local criminal and bully. The Chambers' family is very unpopular in Castle Rock, something that the intelligent Chris is only too aware of. Teddy (Corey Feldman) is the group's psycho. He comes from a loony family, his dad once tried to burn Teddy's ear off. It is generally considered that Teddy won't live to be 20. Yet he is devoted to his dad, who stormed the beaches at Normandie, as he shows by going into a rage when junkyard-owner Milo Pressman calls his father a loony. Vern (Jerry O'Connell) is a scaredy-cat. He's a jolly, roly-poly guy, the butt of many jokes from the others. He is the least serious of the group and his only known family trouble is with his brother, Billy, also one of Ace's goons. Vern is the group clown. In a way he is the most relaxed.Stand By Me's story sounds a bit simple and a bit pointless, yet the search for the boy's body becomes a journey of discovery and growing up for all four boys. Gordie, my favorite character, goes through the greatest changes and hardships. The dead Ray Brower becomes a parallel with Denny, by seeing the body, Gordie is faced with coming to terms with his brother's death and his dad's anger and scorn. That is why he is obsessed with seeing the body, he needs to get a weight of his chest. He also discovers true friendship through Chris, who acts as a sort of father figure for Gordie, convincing him to join the college courses. The closeness the trip puts them in allows them to bond and help each other. Therein lies the true quality of Stand By Me, that whole voyage of discovery part. The same applies to Chris, who opens his heart to Gordie about his need to escape the town that hates him and his whole family. He has obviously been harbouring this feeling for a while. The trip gives him a chance to unload. And Gordie shows him his (Chris') true worth by convincing him to join him on the college courses. Again, they show the meaning of true friendship. Even Teddy shows signs of growing up, despite his conversation with Vern about the difference in strength between Superman and Mighty Mouse. He displays a surprising devotion to his loony father, which may stem from denial, but he seems to realise that he hasn't much chance in life I better go before my mom puts me on the 10 Most Wanted List, he says with a rueful, thoughtful smile. He then tries to make his peace with Chris, he's realised the importance of friends. Vern shows less signs of change at the end, he picks up a penny, harking back to the beginning.That is the real quality of Stand By Me its intelligent portrayal of friendship and how 4 friends, who start off as just 4 kids, smoking, swearing and goofing about, who overcome hardship through each other and at the end have grown to be more than they were and have learned the true meaning of friendship. There's the line We had only been gone two days but the town seemed different, smaller. It resumes the whole message of the film, it shows how the boys have grown. (Warning!! Serious spoiler ahead!!!) And the adult Gordie remembers this friendship when he reads in a newspaper that Chris has died. It prompts him to tell us his story, and although he hadn't seen Chris in 10 years, he still remembers his unique friendship I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 12. Jesus, does anyone? That is a truly beautiful line that also evokes the true message of Stand By Me.Rob Reiner does a sterling job as director. He does several beautiful shots of the countryside, with the kids appearing in the bottom left-hand corner. Hence, they appear to on some kind of frontier, about to cross into adolescence. The train tracks they follow seem to be a road leading them onwards. Nice filming.The music is great, the retro soundtrack is great, particularly the title song. My favorite element, though, is Jack Nitzsche's instrumental arrangement of the afore-mentioned 'Stand By Me' song. It's beautiful.But it's the acting that's really brilliant. All four boys are terrific, but especially Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix. Phoenix is great as Chris, perfectly portraying Chris' mixed tough-guy\/sensitive attitudes and his desire to escape. The campside scene where he breaks down in front of Gordie is stirring because of hom, you want to reach out and hug him. It serves to remind you just how tragic his death really was. I do still prefer Wheaton's performance though. He has a really expressive face and he really gets Gordie's sensitivity and his emotional turmoil across. A love the leeches scene, and the scene where he cries in front of the dead kids body, but these are just two of the many scenes in which he stands out. In no other film have I seen such wonderful acting from kids, except in Empire of the Sun (Christian Bale) and The Cure (Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro). The chemistry between the 4 boys, especially Wheaton and Phoenix, is fantastic. And the supporting cast is good as well, especially Kiefer Sutherland.All in all, this is without a doubt the best coming of age movie ever. The acting is great, the direction is perfect and the story is both moving and profound. The ending is really touching, but then so is the rest of the film. It made me really nostalgic for my childhood. 10\/10!Uppers 1)The tremendous acting; 2)Especially, Wheaton and Phoenix; 3)Great score\/soundtrack; 4)Reiner's directing; 5)The landscapes; 6)The story and the message; 7)The perfect evocation of friendship; 8)The leeches scene; 9)The campfire scenes (dialogues What's goofy?; Chris' opening up); 10)The discovery of the body scene (Gordie crying); 11)The train scene on the bridge; 12)The confrontation with Ace; 13)The dialogues in general; 14)The junkyard scene.

It made me really nostalgic for my childhood. 10\/10!Uppers 1)The tremendous acting; 2)Especially, Wheaton and Phoenix; 3)Great score\/soundtrack; 4)Reiner's directing; 5)The landscapes; 6)The story and the message; 7)The perfect evocation of friendship; 8)The leeches scene; 9)The campfire scenes (dialogues What's goofy?; Chris' opening up); 10)The discovery of the body scene (Gordie crying); 11)The train scene on the bridge; 12)The confrontation with Ace; 13)The dialogues in general; 14)The junkyard scene. And I could go on for hours! Downers 1)A microphone manages to slip into view on two occasions (a forgivable error); 2)Nothing else!

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, better known as actors, put together the screenplay here which has to be regarded as a promising first attempt (they did get an Academy Award for it), but which is still rather uneven. There is some good dialogue and some very trite stuff,  the characters do not surprise or even develop much and the story is reliant on coincidence.Will Hunting (Matt Damon), from working class South Boston, is a 20 year old janitor at MIT, who happens to have mathematical ability exceeding that of the professors, not to mention a photographic memory and a firm grasp of Western history and philosophy. Something of a coincidence? Strangely, he remains undiscovered until he is spotted by a professor solving on a blackboard a difficult problem set for students. Will has an attitude and a liking for thumping people (acquired it seems in his disturbed childhood) and is about to go to jail, but the prof intervenes and Will is let out on a bond provided he learns some maths and sees a counsellor. After a couple of false starts (to emphasise just what a difficult little b'stard Will is), Robin Williams hoves into view as the counsellor, Maguire. The rest of the story concerns Dr Maguire's attempts to help Will sort out his problems, which become more complicated when he become involved with English medical student Minnie Driver (called Skylab or something).Both Matt Damon (nearly B A Harvard) and Ben Affleck (his childhood friend in Cambridge, Mass.) have middle class backgrounds and it was no doubt a bit of a challenge for them to write a script  about someone like Will. It would have been very interesting if someone really from a poor Boston background like Mark Wahlberg had done it. Will is sensitively realised and we see that it is difficult for someone with his fractured upbringing to have much self-worth. Yet no-one with a brain like his lacks an ego and I couldn't help thinking he wouldn't need Robin Williams to discover it for him.I thought the most intriguing character in the film was Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), the MIT maths professor who discovers Will. Even though Lambeau has won the maths equivalent of the Nobel Prize, Will can still out-prove him, if that's the word. He is jealous, but he also is determined that Will succeed. He needs to believe Will is like him in that he must be pushed to succeed. Then Lambeau can tell himself if he had been pushed even harder he might have reached Will's level. At least then he will get some of the credit.I had Gus Van Sant down as a rather odd-ball director with a gay sensibility (`My  Own Private Idaho', `Even Cowgirls Get the Blues') though he got a bit more mainsteam in `The Rainmaker' (also with Matt Damon). This is a very nice ordinary quiet mainstream picture with a few good moments. Van Sant has since revisited the topic of nurturing genius (literary this time) in `Forrester'. This earlier effort is more effective because the Will character is a kind of Mozart of math, with God-given ability, and it's hard not to root for him, whereas the protagonist in `Forrester' is a cultural product, albeit black and from the slums. With his beefy glower, Matt Damon looks right and  projects Will's hostility well while Robin Williams turns down the volume and puts in a restrained, almost elegant performance. You could rent worse for a quiet, cerebral, Friday night.

I thought he was hilarious but if you don't like him, think before seeing this movie.From the very beginning, the scale of this film is much bigger and I would like to congratulate Brett Ratner on a good job. The film picks up from the end of the first film where they are both on holiday. However, the fun is ended at the beginning of the film with a bombing of US Government building, but this a bit more complicated than that but I won't give that away. In general, the plot is thin but this film was never going to win any Oscars, but compared to recent films it may do.This film was made to show off Chan's  moves, Tucker's jokes and their relationship. This is what makes this film good. Although, Chan is showing his age, he can still perform and excite the audience. Tucker is LOUD an there is no stopping him. I found him funnier than in the first film and he deserves more film roles. The supporting roles were good as well. Zhang Hi from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame is superb in this film and does her best with a 2 dimensional character.One thing that makes this film better than the first film is the pace of the film. I found the first film a bit too slow and it took 45 minutes before it really kicked off. Whereas the sequel kicks off within the first 5 minutes and it never lets up. Even when it gets soppy, the pace is still fast and it is still funny (not in a this is so bad kind of way).The comedy factor in this film is much higher than before, although I think you have to see the first film to get a few jokes. The karaoke scene is personally a favorite of mine. The voyeurism scene is also a particular favorite, where Jackie Chan gets to show off his comedic side. There are many laugh-out loud scenes and I think they will still will be laugh-out loud on repeated viewing.I also have to mention Don Cheadle's cameo which I found hilarious. Recently he has been taking a break from serious roles like Traffic. It shows that they were all having fun.Another IMPORTANT mention is to stay to watch the out-takes, which is funnier than some of the film. It shows that Chris Tucker is worse at English than Jackie Chan. It also shows that you should never leave you phone on during filming.Overall, a well made film, breathing fresh air into an old genre.

As a child of about nine, I wasn't even interested in a movie like Labyrinth.  Although I love the Muppets and I liked The Dark Crystal, I wasn't willing to give this movie a second chance.  It looked too dark and the Muppets were scary.  They didn't even look like Jim Henson muppets to me.  The first few times I caught it on TV, I didn't even watch five minutes of it, but then one night, when my sister (whose name is Sarah) was watching it for the umpteenth time, I decided I had nothing better to do, and I actually sat down and watched it with her.  I was completely amazed.  I can't ever remember being so spellbound!  From the moment the Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie), appeared on the screen, I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Now, don't get my wrong, I was afraid of him, I mean, he truly frightened me.  One my first observations were his multicolored eyes, which made him even scarier.  He was the kind of character that was scary, but at the same time, so........WEIRD, you just couldn't help but stare. SPOILERS!!  I rented Labyrinth this past weekend after reading the comments and remembering how cool the ballroom scene looked and the pained look on Jareth's face when he realizes Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) isn't going to stay with him.  And now that I watch it again, I can see the flaws.  But the flaws are far outweighed by how wonderful the rest of the film is.  David Bowie pants are a little too tight for my liking, but just ignore the pants and look at his hair.  I have never seen hair so AWESOME!  And he wears that jacket armor so well!  Jennifer Connelly does get a little trying in the beginning, but gets much better as the film moves on.  In the first thirty minutes of the film, I thought it was going to be some campy Sci-fi flick, rather than the magical fantasy film I remembered.  First Jareth tells Sarah she has thirteen hours to find Toby, and then fifteen minutes later he says she only has nine hours and twenty-three minutes.  I was like, Whoa!  Where did the time go?.  But it all gets better when he reduces her time to only an hour, the film is all uphill from there.  And I must say I'm very pleased to say it is as enchanting as I remembered it.  And yes, when I was nine I did want to be Sarah, and yes, I did wish that I could dress like a princess and have the cool-looking Goblin King sing to me.  Those blue highlights he had in his hair were so cool!! The casting in this movie was excellent.  David Bowie was the perfect Jareth, and his singing....well what can I say?  He's David Bowie! Jennifer Connelly is a very believable Sarah, and I feel sorry for her that she has to make the decision to take Toby instead of staying with Jareth, and it looks as if she is sorry that she can't stay with him, but she realizes she has to leave all the fairytale behind her.  My favorite character, besides Jareth, is the worm.  I wish they sold little replicas of those worms!  Now that I'm older and I actually know who David Bowie is, I can appreciate the songs and the music.  The only part I don't like is the part right before the chorus Dance Magic Dance but that is the only flaw in the music. I wish so badly that I had recorded this movie!  And I'm having trouble finding it a decent price, but I think my new life mission is to buy the soundtrack and the VHS tape.  Anyone who likes, the Muppets, 80s Sci-fi, or Fantasy films you should see this movie.  Heck, even if you don't like any of those things, you should see this movie.  It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and it keeps getting better and better.

The first few times I caught it on TV, I didn't even watch five minutes of it, but then one night, when my sister (whose name is Sarah) was watching it for the umpteenth time, I decided I had nothing better to do, and I actually sat down and watched it with her.  I was completely amazed.  I can't ever remember being so spellbound!  From the moment the Goblin King, Jareth (David Bowie), appeared on the screen, I couldn't take my eyes off him.  Now, don't get my wrong, I was afraid of him, I mean, he truly frightened me.  One my first observations were his multicolored eyes, which made him even scarier.  He was the kind of character that was scary, but at the same time, so........WEIRD, you just couldn't help but stare. SPOILERS!!  I rented Labyrinth this past weekend after reading the comments and remembering how cool the ballroom scene looked and the pained look on Jareth's face when he realizes Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) isn't going to stay with him.  And now that I watch it again, I can see the flaws.  But the flaws are far outweighed by how wonderful the rest of the film is.  David Bowie pants are a little too tight for my liking, but just ignore the pants and look at his hair.  I have never seen hair so AWESOME!  And he wears that jacket armor so well!  Jennifer Connelly does get a little trying in the beginning, but gets much better as the film moves on.  In the first thirty minutes of the film, I thought it was going to be some campy Sci-fi flick, rather than the magical fantasy film I remembered.  First Jareth tells Sarah she has thirteen hours to find Toby, and then fifteen minutes later he says she only has nine hours and twenty-three minutes.  I was like, Whoa!  Where did the time go?.  But it all gets better when he reduces her time to only an hour, the film is all uphill from there.  And I must say I'm very pleased to say it is as enchanting as I remembered it.  And yes, when I was nine I did want to be Sarah, and yes, I did wish that I could dress like a princess and have the cool-looking Goblin King sing to me.  Those blue highlights he had in his hair were so cool!! The casting in this movie was excellent.  David Bowie was the perfect Jareth, and his singing....well what can I say?  He's David Bowie! Jennifer Connelly is a very believable Sarah, and I feel sorry for her that she has to make the decision to take Toby instead of staying with Jareth, and it looks as if she is sorry that she can't stay with him, but she realizes she has to leave all the fairytale behind her.  My favorite character, besides Jareth, is the worm.  I wish they sold little replicas of those worms!  Now that I'm older and I actually know who David Bowie is, I can appreciate the songs and the music.  The only part I don't like is the part right before the chorus Dance Magic Dance but that is the only flaw in the music. I wish so badly that I had recorded this movie!  And I'm having trouble finding it a decent price, but I think my new life mission is to buy the soundtrack and the VHS tape.  Anyone who likes, the Muppets, 80s Sci-fi, or Fantasy films you should see this movie.  Heck, even if you don't like any of those things, you should see this movie.  It's one of those movies that you can watch over and over and it keeps getting better and better.

Cornelius discovers the opposite to be true during his archeological dig in the forbidden zone -- he finds among the ruins a human doll with a voice mechanism, which hints at the previous existence of a hi-tech society. (a similar scene occurred in Planet 1968).The real shocker comes towards the end of the novel, when Cornelius, desperate to show that apes are not just skillful imitators (he is afraid that this truth may explain their progress up to this point -- they have simply copied what humans have already done throughout history), demonstrates via shock therapy on human subjects that he and his colleagues can actually tap into HISTORICAL human memory and shock subjects into babbling about events that took place hundreds of years ago.Some of the snatches of vocalized historical memory reveal that humans rested on their technological laurels, became lazy, and, before they knew it, apes had taken over their world.  Snatches of these ancient memories reveal that apes were hungry for knowledge while humans were hungry for leisure (what, humans hungry for leisure?!  never!)  The takeover was violent and humans were enslaved.  Fast forward to Boulle's planet Soror and you have apes in control and mute humans with brains turned to mush.When Boulle's hero Ulysse Merou heads back to earth, he too is shocked to discover that apes now rule his home turf.  Yet, how hard is this to believe when we've already seen what has happened on Soror?  The formula is well-understood by now.  Superior species accomplishes much and then loses its edge.  Formerly inferior species, long discriminated against, tortured, etc., takes advantage of human sloth and eventually assumes control.In Planet 2001 we have seen the same thing.  Leo returns to earth naively expecting it to be similar to the way it was when he left.  Thade is worshipped here for the same reasons he was feared\/worshipped on his planet -- he is the alpha-warrior and leader of the apes.  What happens on Earth is similar to what happened on Boulle's Soror.  Human minds melted after too much television, pornography, and sports\/entertainment.   Though Leo eventually went back in time to return to earth, he still had to make the trip back to earth and that means hundreds of years have passed while he's been in space.  Thade's legend is well-known throughout the cosmos at this point and we should not be surprised to see him worshipped on earth as well, where he's obviously been the inspiration for the ape takeover.One last note during the feast at the senator's home early in the movie, we hear one of the table guests exclaim (paraphrase)  We're getting lazy, we should be careful lest the humans take over.  This is a nice homage to Boulle, who works the reverse angle in his novel when the human electroshock subjects reveal through historical memory that it was the human race that dropped the ball the first time around.The lesson is clear  let your mind melt and you will perish.  I think the homage just mentioned actually telegraphs the plot of the sequel, in which the apes will be corrupted by the same mindless entertainments that corrupt us today.  Leo will lead a revolt and a new breed of humans -- men and women hungry for literature and learning -- will rise up and reclaim their planet.
