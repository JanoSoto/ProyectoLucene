My brothers were always watching them when I was as young as 5 (now 18) and thanks to that, it made me become a fan just like them.  My favorites are The Spy Who Loved Me, For Your Eyes Only, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Goldfinger, and Licence to Kill.  The World Is Not Enough will most likely be up there on possibly one of the best bonds, easily on the top 7.As we all know, Sean Connery is the best Bond.  He set the standard, said the one-liners first, got the women first, got the gadgets first, did the stunts first, etc.  Following him were George Lazenby (honestly not that bad, but far from Connery), Roger Moore (much different from Connery, but one of the best), Timothy Dalton (didn't have the looks but definatly had the role down cold), and now Pierce Brosnan.  After seeing Goldeneye I figured damn, he really does looks like Bond.  Then Tomorrow Never Dies he was more comfortable with the role but of course, the film lacked in many ways.  But after The World Is Not Enough, he not only has the part down perfectly but he's the best Bond since Connery.The way I look at it every Bond film is truly a good film.  Some lack quite a bit like Moonraker or A View To A Kill where as they either get to corny or try to do to much.  You always are thrilled when you are watching the Bond films, however.  But From Russia With Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service had very suspenseful plots that added the tension that was needed to make them great Bond films.  This tension lies in The World Is Not Enough thanks to a strong plot and stronger acting.  The ones I liked best were for there own reasons.  On Her Majesty's Secret Service because it was very suspenseful and dramatic ending.  For Your Eyes Only because it had the best action sequences of the series.  The World Is Not Enough has both these aspects that make an excellent Bond film.  It's sad to see Q leave, but it's great to see that Bond is back on track.

This is the only film from this period to contextualize the emotional lives of its characters with issues like slavery and genuine poverty.One of the best lines in the film comes Fanny returns home from Mansfield Park to her desperately poor family because she does not love the man who has proposed to her.  Her mother sneaks into her bedroom late one night and tells her, Remember, dear.  I married for love.  It's the kind of moment that none of the other Austen adaptations would have known what to do with. But it is part of this film's subversive humor and trenchant social critique, and it gets the biggest laugh from the audience.The film's deft handling of the issue of slavery is also noteworthy. Austen's characters make much more sense given the full social context in which they lived.  Harold Pinter, the playwright, is powerful and terrifying in the role of Sir Thomas, the patriarch of Mansfield Park.

I still am not 100% sure why I do not like ROTJ as much as the other 2 (not including TPM). There is just something missing.

Ok yeah they blew the death star up again (something new would of been good) but Surely the Empires fleet could wipe out the small rebel fleet after the death star was destroyed.

Oh the last one is finding out Luke and Leia are brother and sister. And straight away you think of them sharing a kiss in Empire. Plus there was a more passionate kiss cut out as well (thankgod). The acting wasn't the best, I think Mark Hamill tried too hard, and Harrison Ford seemed really uncomfortable at times and was nowhere near as good as in Empire (maybe it was being around the ewoks) On the positive sides though, there are some extremely good battle scenes. I thing some scenes were well written where Luke told Leia he was her brother and then straight after that with Vader talking to Luke. I guess it's a little bit of a let down from the other 2. You just expect a better ending and justifying. Although the special edition ending was a lot better then the original. With a lot better music to end it then that silly ewok song. In the end I'd give it 3 1\/2 stars out of 5. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"19 November 1999","score":"","review":"  I love Kevin Smith.

Dogma has a lot of traditional Kevin Smith humor in it, has some very good acting, but overall the movie tries too hard to send a message that really is not all that original or mind numbing. I have read a lot of people on this board who have said Dogma is a great movie which provides food for thought. I beg to differ. Honestly, if you are going to go in the opposite direction of the Catholic Church, or maybe even any religion, you do what Kevin Smith did. Make God a woman, make Jesus black, stress the fact that no religion has it right, and make every one in heaven a little more human (ie fallible) and you have a very predictable script. This was not earth shattering philosophy here and you could go into any college coffee shop and hear about two dozens students debating that very same thing. The plot and the humor was wonderful, but Smith tried to do too much in the realm of explaining religion, the after life, and God's intentions for us all. Almost every scene, even the ones that should have just been left for humor, had a monologue to explain some religious conotation.Chris Rock was used almost solely to explain to us that Jesus was black, that he hated people doing bad things in his name (what a mind blower) and that the bible was politically incorrect. The moments of levity really came from three sources; Jay and Silent Bob, who were wonderfully funny and perfectly out of place in the movie, which I am sure was Smiths intention, Affleck and Damon who were great as Angels, and Alan Rickman as the head Angel, who played the part with humor and also power where you could believe he actually could kick some butt.The movie isn't all that bad. When Dogma is at its best it is simply trying to make the audience laugh instead of beating them over the head with predictable philosophy. It is entertaining, Damon and Affleck do a wonderful job, and it will leave you a bit dissappointed but not disgusted by any means. As for the controversy, there really is none in my mind. I consider myself to be a pretty religious person, a Christian not a Catholic, and I did not come away insulted at all. Even the Jesus Buddy in the begining I thought was hysterical and not blasphemous. I could even see the powers that be, watching from a top some great planet in the universe, getting a big old kick out of a lot that is done in this.

Sadly, I found that the rest of the film didn't warrant that sort of ovation.  While the film has the slick visual sheen of all the best Bond pictures, the plot seems rather hurried and muddled; I often found myself having to piece together crucial details in my head.  Bond first-timer Michael Apted does a good job with the more terse, serious dialogue sequences, but shows something of a lead foot when it comes to the comic interludes, and his action scenes seem rote and rather uninspired.  Apted's work lacks both the suave elegance of Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) and the  over-the-top action finesse of Roger Spottiswoode (Tomorrow Never Dies).Fortunately, Pierce Brosnan helps to fill in a lot of the deficiencies with another solid, tough performance as Bond.  He plays the role in the Sean Connery mold, and it works well.  Sophie Marceau is also quite good as Electra King, an oil magnate's daughter who finds her life under threat, and Judi Dench brings her wonderful patrician snap to M.  Sadly, Denise Richards just ain't cuttin' it as Dr. Christmas Jones (!), a nuclear physicist (!!) who helps out Bond.  She's a sweet enough girl, but she can't act her way out of a brown paper bag.  A few more wet T-shirts and a few less lines of dialogue, and we'd all be better off.  Robert Carlyle's villain also seemed to have been short-changed of some screen time, and he lacks the heft and true monomania of Jonathan Pryce in Tomorrow Never Dies, the best recent Bond villain.Still, there's enough of the old spark here that Bond fans will find some things to enjoy.

It would have been nice if she could have come in handy by the end of the film, but there's very little that she does that Bond could not have done for himself. After all, he has deactivated bombs before (Octopussy).However, the plot is a real knockout. It's not your typical point-and-shoot Bond plot, where he somehow seems to miraculously know who the bad guy is right out of the gate. Instead, he finds he has his work cut out for him, as well as a surprise or two in store along the way; not only for him, but for the audience as well.The opening sequence is also a stunner. It's probably the longest opening sequence in the franchise history a chase covering air, land, and sea. Unfortunately, the rest of the film never manages to reach the same level of intensity in its action, but there is real character development to be had, a sacrifice I, for one, was more than glad to make.If you're at all inclined towards seeing this film, I highly recommend it.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"19 November 1999","score":"","review":"  WARNING CONTAINS POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS.Let me tell you what I thought of Rushmore Brilliant.This film skirts the romantic commedy genre without entering into it (Thank God...) Instead, it's more of an offbeat comic melodrama that is more of a character study than a typical three-act movie.   But make no mistake this does, as Max Fischer would require it, follow the three-act movie formula.ACT 1  We are introduced to Max and his cohorts who attend Rushmore academy - a private school somewhere in the U.S. of A.   We quickly come to the realization that Max is not your typical snob-nosed rich kid, instead he about the most non-conformist conformist that one would ever likely to meet. He's obsessed with his school, obsessed with writing plays (usually based on films....) and obsessed with a first grade teacher far too old and too different to make any sort of meaningful romance.   But that doesn't stop our hero Max....ACT 2  Max, unable to win the affections of the lovely grade school teacher, goes slightly insane.   Meanwhile, his buddy Mr. Bloom (Bill Murray), without really trying, does win the teacher's heart - as well as body.ACT 3  You guessed it, somehow the writer finds reconciliation for everyone - though I won't spoil it by going into the details.   However, I thought the ending of this movie one of the cleverest since A Boy and His Dog - a cult film which has one of the best endings ever.As I sat watching this film unfold before me, I could not help but to think of Harold and Maude and The Graduate.   As other reviewers have mentioned before me, it seems that Rushmore, in it's own offbeat way, pays tribute to both of these wonderful films of the past.I'll admit it the reason I rented this one was because Bill Murray is in it.  Bill can put on quite a show when given the opportunity, and he does not disappoint in this film!  I fell in love with his Mr. Bloom character, and would gladly watch this one several more times just to see Mr. Murray's performance.   Also, I agree with all those reviewers that have mentioned that this is his best performance since Ground Hog Day.But the character of Max is truly the glue that holds this film together. Jason Schwartzman does one of the most brilliant, subtle performances I've seen from a non-Brit.  His characterization, even in the midst of Max's own self-destruction, is a wonderful surprise.Max is my kind of guy.  You hate his guts, but can't help but feel a bit of pity and compassion for his plight.   You want to take him by his preppy school uniform jacket lapels and just shake some sense into his little holier-than-thou head.   But one need not to, for Max is more than capable of doing it to himself, with a bit of help from his Scotch archenemies Magnus.But I must heap the most praise on the director,  Wes Anderson, who obviously has the guts to take a film off the beaten path and have some fun with it.   There's a whole slew of people who won't care for this film, but I appreciated every little odd touch the director gave this work.  There's a level of craftsmanship here that one rarely encounters in films anymore. And it is obvious that director deeply cares for his characters and their plight - something that is the mark of the truly great Hollywood filmmakers.The beauty of Rushmore is that there's a whole lot more to this film than the actors and the script.   The director actually has the GAUL to ask the audience to think and feel about that which they are watching, not just react to it.    This is the kind of film a wine loving, Shakespeare reading, cultural commando - dyed-in-the-wool film buff just loves to dive into. And this is what sets this film so far apart from the usual crap that comes from Warner Bros. and Universal...By the way, I'd watch this movie again just to listen to the soundtrack. It is a wonderful compliment to the film.   Whoever put it together deserves great praise as well.For those of you tired of the same old Hollywood refuse, Rushmore is a breath of life, and easily one of the top ten films of '98.
