DAF is just an excuse for Bond to say some corny bad jokes which don't evoke laughter but make the audience cringe in their seats. The real joke is on the Bond fans who would have gone to see this movie in the cinema expecting a great Bond movie(my heartfelt condolences to those who did). DAF was seen as Connery's comeback, after YOLT Connery decided not to do another Bond movie and the producers had to find someone else to fill his shoes and George Lazenby. In my opinion Lazenby is severely underrated as Bond. After OHMSS the producers persuaded Connery to do another Bond movie. After DAF he quit again and Moore stepped into his shoes and Connery made another debut in Never Say Never Again in 1983, which is not an official Bond movie and Octopussy was released in the same year.The producers followed up the classic OHMSS the only way the Bond producers can, with a truly despicable Bond movie that had none of the brilliance of it's predecessor movie. DAF in a way doesn't feel like a Bond movie for me because it lacks the thrills that the rest of the Bond movies had. Even the bad Bond movies had one or two thrilling sequences. For instance in Die Another Day, which is widely regarded as the worst Bond movie there was the opening sequence.In the opening sequence of DAF,which is more of a continuation from OHMSS sees Bond on the hunt for Blofeld who was responsible for the death of Bond's wife Tracy(Blofeld killed her when they were on the way to their honeymoon at the end of OHMSS). Bond eventually finds Blofeld and he thinks he has succeeded in killing him. Then Bond is sent on another mission, to investigate a smuggling operation and find out who's behind it. He does that by taking the identity of a man called Peter Franks. When he does finally find out who is behind the smuggling operation he is shocked to discover that it is no other than Bond's arch Nemesis Blofeld himself. It's hard to study a movie like DAF objectively, I can think of mostly negative points. I suppose the moon buggy sequence can count as a positive as it is easily the best thing about it. The Shirley Bassey's theme song is bearable so I think that counts as a positive. Onto the negatives, now where shall I start?. First of all there was Connery's frankly half hearted performance as Bond. Then there is the flimsy plotting, half of the time I was struggling to understand what was going on. Secondly the change of tone, from action to comedy doesn't work, particularly not in a Bond movie. Next there was a poor Bond girl in the form of Jill St John. Then there is the awful villains, there was Mr Kitt and Mr Wint who are easily some of the worst villains in the history of Bond. Then there was Charles Gray who is appalling miscast as Blofeld. This is a real shame because Blofeld is easily my favourite villain and he is given such gross misjustice here. Coincidentally Charles Gray was also in YOLT in a cameo as Henderson. Usually I find a redeeming quality in all the Bond movies, even the bad ones but I am well and truly stumped when it comes to DAF. There is the moonbuggy sequence but that is mildly entertaining and can't save the movie single handedly. I would go as far as saying DAF is a real Bond disaster and none of the bad Bond movies can even come close to topping the awfulness of it. If only I could erase the Bond travesty that is DAF from my memory and pretend there are only 21 Bond movies.

Although, Kirk Douglas is given first credit, the emphasis is on Burt Lancaster's character, Harry Doyle. As a man who has been in prison for most of his adult life and is getting old, you could go a lot of directions with the character. Lancaster plays it beautifully and never once do you think that he is playing it for laughs as I'm sure many lesser talents would do. Kirk Douglas on the other hand is given less to play with. A man, who tries to keep up but ultimately is pretty much out of step. He gets a younger girlfriend but the storyline is a bit hackneyed and does not contain one single thing that couldn't be predicted.Meanwhile, Lancaster gets to have some fun with an old flame. Not to say that this story is anymore interesting to see than the Douglas romance but it is sweet.The thing to admire here is Douglas' and Lancaster's dealing with their antagonists which consists of basically everybody they meet, save for the two ladies and one caring probation officer (Dana Carvey in a rare unfunny performance). They seem to take the approach that so what if they have enemies and I can see why. Their foes are made to look pretty ridiculous and absolutely no threat. The great Charles Durning, plays a cop who wants to nail them one more time but not so much because he think they are bad but to prove something to himself.

For me, this was the type of film that could have been a masterpiece, in which some scenes were done so superbly that I just loved them. Other scenes needed some work, however, and some of them left me a little bored and waiting for better. The first 30 minutes or so was spectacular, and I couldn't help laughing at so many things, such as Cher coming home announcing her engagement and her family's response being Again?, though she was only married once. After Cher goes to meet Nicolas Cage, the film slows down and there seem to be less laughs for a while. The ending scene, however, is perfectly done and makes the whole film worth watching, as it is filled with laughs and happy endings.

This film is far more improvised, more off-the-cuff, then staged films made in years prior to 1960.The story, about an unlikeable cad who romances a young woman in Paris, is dull as dishwater. It has no thematic depth. The script treatment, written by Francois Truffaut a year or two before Jean-Luc Godard filmed the movie, is used more or less as the basis for the plot and the dialogue, sans screenplay. And it shows!Characters are not well thought out. Our cad is a killer and a petty thief who smokes a lot. He's also obnoxious. At one point he looks directly into the camera and tells viewers If you don't like ... then get stuffed! The young woman is unremarkable in every way, apart from her unisex hairdo, which may have been chic in 1960; today it looks atrocious.Likewise, the film's improvised dialogue is horrible. At one point the cad asks the young woman Why are you looking at me? Her response Because I'm looking at you. And then later, the woman says Well, I don't know yet whether I love you. The cad asks When will you know? She responds Soon. He asks What does soon mean? In a month, a year? She answers Soon means soon. Submit a screenplay to a studio these days with dialogue like that, and see what happens.Casting and acting are mediocre and bland. The two main roles are not demanding. The film's production design conveys the impression that Godard was trying to appeal to an audience of haughty sophisticates. Thus, we get an artist's studio, convertible sports cars, and lots of cigarette smoking. The background music is mostly light jazz, and when combined with the costumes, production design, and hairstyles makes the film seem very dated.Maybe Breathless was Godard's way of breaking through as a major film director in 1960, specifically by thumbing his nose at Hollywood film directors from previous decades.

The result was a six-year hiatus, the longest ever gap in the series.During those six years after Licence to Kill opened in the summer of 1989, the world had seen many changes. The Cold War had ended, the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Soviet Union had collapsed. Goldeneye was therefore the first post-Soviet Bond. Yet these changes were not necessarily a disadvantage for the film-makers. While the works of more realistic spy writers such as John Le Carre and Len Deighton were mostly rooted in the espionage battles of the Cold War, Ian Fleming's hero had always done battle against a wide spectrum of villains, most of whom were neither Russian nor Eastern European, nor even Communist. Indeed, the makers of Goldeneye were able to turn the changes in the international political order to their advantage, setting the film in a post-Communist Russia. Even the opening titles depict the destruction of Soviet symbols such as the red star and hammer and sickle.In real life a goldeneye is a species of duck, but it was also the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate, which is doubtless the reason it was used as the title. (Its similarity to Goldfinger may also have been a factor). In the film Goldeneye is the name of a secret satellite weapon which has fallen into the hands of a Russian crime syndicate who intend to use it to blackmail the West. It falls, of course, to Bond to thwart this scheme.The six year gap between Goldeneye and its predecessor provided the producers with a chance to rethink the way in which the series was developing. It was the first Bond film to be based on an entirely original story; all previous episodes had had at least a nominal connection with a Fleming novel or short story. Only one actor, Desmond Llewelyn, returned from earlier episodes. Bond's superior M was played for the first time by a woman, Judi Dench, a development possibly inspired by the real-life appointment of Stella Rimington as the first female head of MI5. The most important change in casting was, of course, the appointment of Pierce Brosnan to succeed Dalton as Bond.The film also varies two important elements of the Bond formula, the villain and the Bond girl. Traditional Bond villains, like Gerd Frobe's Goldfinger or Michael Lonsdale's Drax, were mostly gloating megalomaniacs bent on world domination, surrounded by wicked henchmen and, occasionally, by glamorous but equally wicked henchwomen. Here we have not one main villain but a quartet. Colonel Ourumov is a rogue Russian officer reminiscent of Orlov in Octopussy. Boris Grishenko is a brilliant but childish and sex-obsessed computer nerd. Alec Trevelyan is a renegade British intelligence officer of Cossack descent and a former friend of Bond, now heading a Russian crime syndicate. And finally there is Xenia Onatopp, the sexiest Bond villainess since Caroline Munro's Naomi in The Spy who Loved Me. Onatopp is a beautiful but sadistic former KGB operative; her speciality is crushing men to death with her thighs while having sex with them.In the early films, although there were exceptions like Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, Bond girls were normally bikini-clad bimbos like Ursula Andress' Honey Ryder. To try and make the films rather less sexist, during the Moore\/Dalton era this characterisation was altered somewhat and the typical Bond girl became a bimbo actress trying to pass herself off as either a tough secret agent (Barbara Bach, Carey Lowell) or as a brainy scientist (Lois Chiles, Tania Roberts).

The result was a six-year hiatus, the longest ever gap in the series.During those six years after Licence to Kill opened in the summer of 1989, the world had seen many changes. The Cold War had ended, the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Soviet Union had collapsed. Goldeneye was therefore the first post-Soviet Bond. Yet these changes were not necessarily a disadvantage for the film-makers. While the works of more realistic spy writers such as John Le Carre and Len Deighton were mostly rooted in the espionage battles of the Cold War, Ian Fleming's hero had always done battle against a wide spectrum of villains, most of whom were neither Russian nor Eastern European, nor even Communist. Indeed, the makers of Goldeneye were able to turn the changes in the international political order to their advantage, setting the film in a post-Communist Russia. Even the opening titles depict the destruction of Soviet symbols such as the red star and hammer and sickle.In real life a goldeneye is a species of duck, but it was also the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate, which is doubtless the reason it was used as the title. (Its similarity to Goldfinger may also have been a factor). In the film Goldeneye is the name of a secret satellite weapon which has fallen into the hands of a Russian crime syndicate who intend to use it to blackmail the West. It falls, of course, to Bond to thwart this scheme.The six year gap between Goldeneye and its predecessor provided the producers with a chance to rethink the way in which the series was developing. It was the first Bond film to be based on an entirely original story; all previous episodes had had at least a nominal connection with a Fleming novel or short story. Only one actor, Desmond Llewelyn, returned from earlier episodes. Bond's superior M was played for the first time by a woman, Judi Dench, a development possibly inspired by the real-life appointment of Stella Rimington as the first female head of MI5. The most important change in casting was, of course, the appointment of Pierce Brosnan to succeed Dalton as Bond.The film also varies two important elements of the Bond formula, the villain and the Bond girl. Traditional Bond villains, like Gerd Frobe's Goldfinger or Michael Lonsdale's Drax, were mostly gloating megalomaniacs bent on world domination, surrounded by wicked henchmen and, occasionally, by glamorous but equally wicked henchwomen. Here we have not one main villain but a quartet. Colonel Ourumov is a rogue Russian officer reminiscent of Orlov in Octopussy. Boris Grishenko is a brilliant but childish and sex-obsessed computer nerd. Alec Trevelyan is a renegade British intelligence officer of Cossack descent and a former friend of Bond, now heading a Russian crime syndicate. And finally there is Xenia Onatopp, the sexiest Bond villainess since Caroline Munro's Naomi in The Spy who Loved Me. Onatopp is a beautiful but sadistic former KGB operative; her speciality is crushing men to death with her thighs while having sex with them.In the early films, although there were exceptions like Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, Bond girls were normally bikini-clad bimbos like Ursula Andress' Honey Ryder. To try and make the films rather less sexist, during the Moore\/Dalton era this characterisation was altered somewhat and the typical Bond girl became a bimbo actress trying to pass herself off as either a tough secret agent (Barbara Bach, Carey Lowell) or as a brainy scientist (Lois Chiles, Tania Roberts).

This is what fantasy calls for. Middle Earth feels like another world entire. The use of rotoscoping works perfectly here. As a child, I could not have been more scared when seeing the orcs and black riders in real form. Even when the animation of the orcs has a flickering, unfinished nature to it, it works perfectly with the nightmarish tone.The voice work is exceptional. Bakshi's Gandalf is infinitely better than McKellen's kind hearted wizard. Bakshi's Gandalf is stern but gentle in a way that adds so much more complexity. You realise how brilliant Gandalf is but how he is also slightly mad in his brilliance. Similar with Aragorn - John Hurt gives so much more gravitas and wisdom to the role than Mortensen's angsty, pathetic performance. There is more presence in these two characters alone than any of the cast in the Jackson's films. Similar credit goes to Galadriel whose beauty is utterly terrifying but in a far more subtle way than Blanchett's embarrassingly overdone performance. The script should get some credit here - so many of the lines are actually taken directly from the book (in this way the Bakshi version is actually far more loyal to the book).Other characters Legolas - certainly better than Orlando Bloom's wooden performance. Thankfully there is no one liner action banter with Gimili in the Helm's Deep scenes.Gimli - A real character - this guy is no comic reliefHobbits - Not bad but I would concede they are all better in Jackson's version, especially Samwise (Sean Astin).Gollum\/Smeagal - Jackson's Gollum feels far more like a cartoon than Bakshi's ironically. Bakshi's Gollum feels like a paranoid drug addict constantly on the edge of an abyss - that scream is terrifying. In Jackson's hands, Gollum is merely 'cute', his eccentricities safely couched in a obvious split personality device (there is no comforting line in Bakshi's)Black riders - far more scary in their twisted body movements, and their strange whining, shrieking and whispering.The voice work is also a large part responsible for the sense of history and other worldliness Middle Earth has. There is gravitas in it. Through them we hear stories of forgotten legends around the campfire and at Rivendell. Fragments of journal entries long lost are read out in hope of some sort of revelation. History here envelops and defines the story as much as it provides the mystery that alienates\/fascinates us as viewers. With Jackson's film, history is actually explained too much (through flashback) diluting the mystery and simplifying the world. Bakshi's history is elliptical, unexplained, but far more affective.Better sequences than Jackson's The Black Rider on the road (actually scary and not in broad daylight)The Knife in the Dark scene and the Prancing Pony (far more surreal than Jackson's)Flight to the Ford - the film's best scene, a nightmarish six minutes as opposed to a pathetic two minute scene in Jackson's (with the bland Liv Tyler).Helm's Deep - the blood! the chants! the wolves! Theoden's horn!Boromir's death - in long drawn out silence - all we hear are his blood curdling screams. no lame tragic hero music here.

Many of the reviews simply become criticisms of the animation or what was cut out without fully confronting the film's uniqueness. Jackson has none of the nightmarish vision of Bakshi.

We see little of David Berkowitz, the serial murderer. He's in the background, a kind of hovering, invisible presence. But, his relationship to the main plot is encapsulated in an angry exchange between Vinnie (John Leguizamo) and his wife (Dionna). She's angry at his infidelity and recent looniness and he's trying desperately to explain Dey think Richie is da Son of Sam. It's drivin' me nuts. And she shouts What does THAT have to do with you ****ing Ruby? That's pretty much it. The boys of the hood sit around in diners wondering who it is who is doing all the killing in their neighborhood. A black out adds to the confusion and hysteria. The good old boys try to make a list of possible suspects among those they happen to know. Let's see. There's Father So-and-So. Remember him? How he used to beat hell out of us? One night they stop the priest and search him and his car, meanwhile asking him to give them their blessing.But Richie is at the head of the suspect list. He's a freaky looking guy, what with his punk hair do and his working as a stripper and hustler in a gay night club. And there's a lot of his time that he can't account for because he's so busy boffing Vinnie's wife.Spike Lee and his two Italian-American writers have got a reasonably good handle on life in this kind of neighborhood. They nail down its good points -- if there's a blackout, a neighborhood power broker throws a block party and assigns patrols to keep potentially lethal strangers out -- and they nail down its bad points, as reflected among kids like this, say, in Howard Beach. If it's different, it's bad. The compliance is forced. The wrong haircut can win you a broken face. They get the incidentals too -- the religion that pervades everything and the precepts of which nobody bothers to follow too closely. No apologies for the vices are given. Every other word is the F word and that's okay for the guys, but the women use it all the time as well, and if that's the case, things have evolved a good deal since my youthful experiences with these kinds of folks.The movie sometimes DOES seem to be going nowhere but it's never boring. Nothing so vivace could possible be dull. There's always somebody talking, often overlapping, even if the utterances are mostly repetitions of what someone else has just said. And there's always movement, even if it's only someone running off at the hands.Anyway, the neighborhood portrait we get is both good and bad, a tribute to the objectivity of the writers and to Lee, and glory be to God for dappled things. A movie without a Manichaean scheme. And to top it all off, Mira Sorvino carries off the sexiest dance ever put on celluloid, including the one in Gilda.

This makes the audience feel they are in the room and seeing everything that occurs, since there are very few cuts in the picture. What doesn't work is the fact that this is a murder story, and much debate has been made over whether or not Hitchcock was right in showing the murder in the opening scene. This takes away suspense of whether a murder was actually committed, and keeps the audience focused primarily on if these two men will get caught.Despite some of the shortcomings of Hitchcock's decisions in holding our suspense, this is for the most part yet another success for the great director. The cast is strong, particularly the two men, played by unknowns John Dall and Farley Granger. Dall, as the stronger and more subversive believer in Nietzsche's theory of the superman, is a most effective actor and is very convincing in his dark and sinister nature. James Stewart is a great actor but feels misplaced as the prep school teacher from which these two young men have taken inspiration from.

In true Cinderella Man style Rocky guaranteed him a career and screen immortality. A whole lot like the protagonist ROcky Balboa in the film.There was an Irish equivalent of Rocky during the early Sixties in real life, a boxer named Tom McNeeley from South Boston, just as Rocky Balboa is from South Philadelphia. McNeeley was a barely ranked contender, ranked in fact at all just to give him some kind of credence as an opponent for Floyd Patterson. McNeeley fought Patterson in Boston for the local gate attraction. Needless to say his showing against Floyd wasn't quite as good as what Rocky did against Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, showboating heavyweight champion in the style of Muhammed Ali.And that's what happens to Rocky. Stallone is a local club fighter who also works as a part time enforcer for the loan sharks, but his heart isn't really into it. His heart is torn actually between boxing and his love for Talia Shire, the plain Jane sister of his friend Burt Young.When opportunity comes you have to take it. For some reason a scheduled match between Weathers and another contender for the championship falls through. Several other name contenders aren't available, so it comes down to Rocky Balboa being given a once in lifetime chance in a bout to be held in his native Philadelphia like McNeeley's was in real life.Rocky was the Cinderella story of the Oscars that year, it won for Best Picture, Best Director for John G. Avildsen, and Best Film Editing. Sly Stallone was nominated for Best Actor and Original Screenplay. He lost however to Peter Finch for Network. Burgess Meredith as Rocky's cornerman and gym owner and Carl Weathers were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, but both lost to Jason Robards, Jr. for All the President's Men. My favorite in the film was Talia Shire, she is really touching as the Thirty something unmarried plain girl who grabs a last chance for love with Rocky. The role is so different from Connie Corleone in any of the three Godfather films. Sadly Talia lost to Beatrice Straight as William Holden's wife in Network.John Avildsen winning for Best Director is great though I think the film is so much Stallone's own creation, he should have won for Original Screenplay. Avildsen never directed anything as good as Rocky before or since. In fact he directed seven years later one of my all time favorite trash films, A Night In Heaven.Rocky is the great Cinderella movie of all time, the creation of its leading character who put enough of his heart into this film and gained a career for himself. None of the succeeding Rocky films came anywhere near this one for quality. And the story itself was pure Cinderella. How paradoxical and how great.

You need to keep the audience attention.2010 The Year We Make Contact is a sequel to the Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001 A Space Odyssey. Never has a film never needed a sequel then any of Kubrick's film. Of course, 2010 is set after 2001 A Space Odyssey. The American government know that the Discovery mission to Jupiter was a failure. Dr. Floyd (Roy Scheider) was blamed by the American government and lost his position. The American planned a second mission to Jupiter, but the Soviet Union were about to launch a mission before. The Soviet Union have a problem, they need America's information about the Monolith and be able to access Discovery's computers. They want Americans to join them and in return their would share information and scientific research. Floyd also wants to prove himself and redeem his reputation. Whilst in space the join American-Soviet discovery some strange scientific information about the Jupiter moon Europa. Things on Earth and in space become very surreal with the real of the astronaut, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) who had returned (or may not have) from the space gateway that he went through. On Earth, the Soviet Union and the United States are edging closely to a World War Three, in a Cuban Missile style crisis.The acting was adequate, and this film is a lot more Earth bound then 2001 was, having some political elements to it. That could have been planned on more. But once the film goes into space, it easy to lose interest. The writing, plotting and pacing is poor, and the direction nothing compared to the great Stanley Kubrick. 2001 was a really profound film, with themes of evolution, scientific discovery and man ending up destroying itself. 2010 does not have any themes like that. At best you could argue that it about scientific co-operation, pacifism, the ghosts of the past and a message of peace and new life at the end. But as I said, it is nothing to 2001. The surreal elements of Dave's return even reminded me of the Event Horizan, but not even as good as that film. 2010 also ruins the mystery of the Kubrick classic.If you love the first film then avoid this film. If you have seen it then just forget it (which isn't hard to do). It is a poor film. ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"}]
