I also liked the convention scenes at the beginning and end of the film while the alien enemies aboard the spaceship are fierce and the small aliens on the planet where the show's cast try to retrieve a beryllium sphere are cute and amusing if not as colourful in the film as they are on the film poster and DVD cover, they especially made me laugh when they cheered on Jason trying to defeat the pig-lizard that was well-designed before its unfortunate death I mentioned earlier and I liked how the rock monster was designed as well. The musical score was powerful with the occasional haunting chorus vocals and one piece of the incidental music reminded me of Also sprach Zarathustra from 2001 A Space Odyssey. The ending is clever due to it consisting of the opening sequence of the relaunched Galaxy Quest show.Overall this film offered me slightly less than I expected but it had its dialogue, costumes, sets, alien planet scenery, a TV-show-within-a-film concept and music as its best aspects. 7\/10.

How wrong I was!A friend introduced me to the 'Alien' series after I loaned him 'The Omen' franchise and, while I watched it mainly as a gesture, I discovered that this is truly an awesome film. And the fact is that, even for others out there like me who probably aren't too keen on sci-fi films, this does not really strike you as one. Indeed, chances are that through things like 'Family Guy', 'South Park' and 'The Simpsons', you've probably seen reworked scenes from 'Alien' already!!!For one thing, the cast is excellent. Sigourney Weaver broke into mainstream films here, John Hurt got the most memorable scene, even Yaphet Kotto who played Bond villain, Dr. Kananga in 'Live And Let Die' (1973), and Ian Holm in a particularly memorable turn early on in his film career. And, for horror aficionados, Veronica Cartwright, who made her debut in Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' (1963) and appeared in the disturbing remake of 'Invasion of The Body Snatchers' (1978), gets a key role here. As does a cool little cat named Jones. Oh, and don't forget 'Mother'.The model work, set design, costumes and even all the space-style gobbledegook that would usually put you to sleep - it's all great. And did I mention that the legendary composer Jerry Goldsmith provided the musical score? To savour this film, all you really need to be is a fan of horror and\/or action films, or just an adventurous audience member.So this really was a pleasant surprise for someone who's proud to admit that he was wrong. I even have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' DVD set because of this film and its sequel 'Aliens' (1986). I can really recommend this set of DVDs (or Blu-Ray, if you prefer), because it includes both the theatrical version and the Director's Cut, the latter of which includes so much stuff that wouldn't have appeared in the cinema and adds to the plot.If in doubt, read some of the other reviews. Hopefully there are other people like me who have been turned by Ridley Scott's genius! Sit back and enjoy a different kind of classic!!

Seven years between the original and a sequel (especially a sequel starring one of the original cast members) can be a very long time. A long time for things to go wrong. And this was, perhaps, what was going through the minds of executives at Twentieth Century Fox when they green-lighted James Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's masterful horror film set in space.If anything, if you're going in to 'Aliens' blind or having already watched 'Alien', you're in for an interesting sequence of events.From the beginning, it's very clear that, as an audience member, you're getting a rare treat, not just in terms of horror or action -- literally in terms of any genre of cinema. You are getting a proper sequel!But, a sequel that establishes its own rules.Sigourney Weaver was feisty and held her own in 'Alien', but here she becomes a pure bad-ass! If you have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' set, you can see from the Director's Cut that her character, Ellen Ripley has a lot of issues going on. The perfect early example of a conflicted, brave and determined heroine. The theatrical release gets these things across well, too. As does the fact that Weaver was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance -- in a time when horror\/action flicks were largely denied such honours. Forget Lara Croft - here's the real deal!But it's in Ripley's interaction with Carrie Henn's character, Newt and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks that the film develops its pathos. A chance for redemption and a life beyond being terrorised by a load of slimy space monsters.Not to give too much away, but 'Aliens' is, in an odd way, drawn from similar threads as 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and 'The Lost World' (1997). It's distinct from those films, obviously, but the gung-ho element of an overpowered military force confronting a swarm of devilishly sly and powerful creatures rings similar bells. For die-hard fans of the 'Alien' franchise (or even of films in general), they will know what I am saying when I mention that 'Aliens' also shares key links with Tim Burton's original 'Batman' (1989), from its design to its filming.There's a really great and touching story here, though, which develops James Cameron as the worthy successor (perhaps even an equal) to Ridley Scott himself in terms of developing the original ideas of Scott and his crew. Incidentally, this is the only one of James Cameron's films that I have seen and enjoyed.Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein and Bill Paxton in some of their best known and pervasive film roles are all superb and a perfect match for the extremely well cast original film. Goldstein, in particular, has the ballsy attitude of Grace Jones, whilst still remaining a likable character, and Paxton steals some of the film's best dialogue. Even Jones the cat returns!For once, a sequel that is just as (if not more) enjoyable and hard- hitting as the original. If I had to raise a qualm with the film, it is that the 'Alien' series went into serious decline after this instalment. And, even though I've seen the other sequels, I prefer to accept things as they happened here as rote!!

The one thing he didn't count on was Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) who plays by his own rules. I've always found it amazing that DIRTY HARRY received so much controversy back when it was released and watching it forty-two years later it's somewhat scary seeing the various warnings here coming true. I think this film says quite a bit about the bad people being protected while the victims are forgotten and the bad guys often get released back onto the streets to harm more innocent people. It's clear that director Don Siegel and star Eastwood had a political agenda when they made this but that's one thing that makes it so special after so many years because not too many films had the guts to go in this direction. The film is masterfully directed by Siegel who knows how to build up the tension in each of the scenes without creating any fake emotions or scenes just there to try and make the viewer feel good. The film is a really dark, rather creepy and at times disturbing look at some very bad subjects (heck, two children are murdered) yet Siegel never makes it so dark where the viewer is turned off. There are many brilliantly done action scenes here including the infamous do you feel lucky sequence but the entire sequence where Eastwood has to run around from phone booth to booth is just perfect as is the sequence where he finally gets his hands on the bad guy. Speaking of Eastwood, is there anyone in the history of cinema that could have done this role more justice? The laid back, calm, cool and collective style of Eastwood is just right for this role and especially some of the darker humor. Eastwood is the perfect person for this type of tough guy role and he perfectly milks every scene. Robinson makes for one of the sleaziest and most hated villains in film history and think he never gets the credit he deserves. Harry Cuardino, John Mitchum and John Vernon are also good in their roles. As the series went along I think some winks and one-liners were aimed at the viewers and for the most part the sequels were fun. DIRTY HARRY, the original, is something different as it certainly has a message to give and it's also quite tense and disturbing with some of its subject matter. It's certainly a film that plays just as well today as it did when it was first released.

The directing lens is fairly poor, however, being too closely framed throughout. There's a significant deal of inauthenticity attached to the story line, largely in part how easily the terrorists infiltrate Air Force One and then precede to execute and carry out their evil plans without any real resistance, but it all works for the good as it allows for a really fine and I think fun, family adventure.Air Force One soars all the way up to a 7!

Some disregard it entirely and move straight on to 'The Final Conflict'; others adore it, sometimes even more so than Richard Donner's original film.I love it on a par with Donner's film, but I admit that, whilst he was away trying to make audiences believe that a man could fly, his presence was sorely missed.Overall, the film is a great horror sequel and an entertaining one at that.It takes the view that Damien Thorn is the Antichrist and charts his rise to power as he establishes himself further within the Thorn family, hoping to inherit a global conglomerate controlled by his adoptive uncle, Richard (William Holden). Although this loses the mystique of whether Robert Thorn was right or actually a raving lunatic taken in by the doubts that he had regarding Damien and the lie that he had fed his wife, to be honest, how else would a sequel to 'The Omen' have been crafted? Not all the Thorns could have been that insane or deluded!!There's a great cast here, with Holden embarking on his only horror film and leaving behind a memorable performance for posterity, whilst he is joined by the incredible Lee Grant as his wife, Ann. I saw Grant for the first time in this movie and only later discovered her performances in 'Columbo Ransom for a Dead Man' (1971) and 'Airport '77' (1977). She's a great actress in all, but this is the performance I remember the most. If you see or have seen this film, you'll probably understand why!Supporting cast members are also memorable, including Sylvia Sidney, Lew Ayres, a young Lance Henriksen, and the always sly Robert Foxworth. The latter two are almost criminally underused characters, but they use their time well enough. Novelist, Gordon McGill even crafted a further two sequels after 'The Final Conflict' that, had they been adapted, would have given Foxworth much more screen presence to show what a great actor he is. Nicholas Pryor also deserves credit for his performance and British stalwarts, Leo McKern and Ian Hendry also get cameos.And Jonathan Scott-Taylor is great as Damien, too! He grabs a few scenes that lend the character some inner conflict and even perfects his own icy 'Omen' stare as he starts to come into his powers. It's just a shame that the planned 1979 second sequel to 'The Omen' starring Scott-Taylor didn't go ahead, as there is too much empty time in Damien's life between this and the next film!Although it was implied in the first film that he was possibly aware of his demonic lineage and that he may be adopted by the President of the United States, these are not really big things that leave you wondering what happened here, then? Even though William Holden\/Richard Thorn wasn't in the original, who cares? 'The Omen' was meant to be a one-off and accidentally led to sequels. Plus, as 'The Final Conflict' shows, Damien was far more effective and enjoyable when he did have parents running around trying to stab him!!But the film is cheesy. Elizabeth Shepherd's British journalist arriving in a terrible, gaudy red coat practically shouts it at you This is a film that isn't being taken quite as seriously as the last one. And that's it - this film is fun! It wasn't intended to be 'Haha' funny (despite some of the performances) but, when compared to the overbearingly grim 'The Final Conflict' and the deadly serious 'The Omen', this film has a real pace to it, particularly when Richard Thorn starts to realise that he can no longer ignore the omens surrounding him. Things just happen and you go along with them. It's like Marmite -- you either love it or you don't!Naturally, to compete with 'The Omen' and David Warner's classic end in that film, there is a whole spate of memorable death sequences here that are fun and, sometimes, quite chilling as well... You can see them coming -- but, again, who cares?Picture quality has improved a bit since 'The Omen', but largely due to the increased budget resulting from that film's success. There are more special effects, more family drama scenes, more Damien... It really complies with those three 'Scream' rules for a horror sequel, really more, more, more!And, on that note, be prepared to enjoy another musical contribution from Jerry Goldsmith. Although he didn't shoot to Oscar fame with this 'Omen' score (or its more lyrical successor, either), Goldsmith delivers racy, thrill-ride compositions, with a maximum of one pleasant interlude, a handsome amount of eerie uncertainty and foreboding, and a lot of that famous 'Ave Satani' returning, albeit in an altered form. It is clear that he was having fun tinkering with a set formula that he helped to create!There is some quite beautiful location work, this time set in Chicago, Illinois, Wisconsin and Israel.And, despite some confusion, if you're prepared to look hard enough for it, there is actually quite a decent chunk of plot involving Thorn Industries, Damien's rise to power and the interaction of the Thorn family and those surrounding it, as well as the usual contextual Biblical references. There are plot holes and strained plot lines, but films like this are still rather fun!Finally, to dispel popular myth, there is actually a church in this sequel...see if you can spot it!!

In fact this was Brooks last major film in which he starred and directed.Now I must admit that when I first saw the film I didn't really like it much, the whole thing looked cheap, tacky and wasn't overly funny. But the strangest thing, like with other Brooks films, I have found myself appreciating it a lot more over the years.Like his other spoofs this has pot shots at various classic vampire films over the years but the main target is of course the Lugosi gem. Its a real blend of styles which kinda works and kinda doesn't. Naturally the film is created with an old time appearance reminiscent of the 1931 film, but at the same time it has those great cheesy cardboard cutout visuals of Hammer horrors. I personally think the film has a lot in common with 'Spaceballs' in the fact that it looks hammy but at the same time it also has some neat effects. The main negative aspect of the film in my opinion was most of the sets are obviously sets which is a bit off putting I can't deny and there is a distinct lack of scenic spooky landscapes or creepy castles which is a real shame. I realise the film is suppose to be low rent as it were but all Dracula flicks need some nice eerie real locations and spooky castles. Despite that there are some nice touches here and there, the low budget bat transformations of Dracula are kinda cute, lots of little homages and visual gags, everything has been over done, forced and blown out of proportions on purpose which is amusing, costumes are suitably stuffy and set the mood well, plus the casting is actually quite good.Now I know you can't expect top rate acting in a Brooks spoof but there are still some nice little performances here. The best for me being MacNicol as the whimpering stir crazy Renfield. The character does get a bit too loony tunes as the film progresses but initially I really like his stiff upper lipped Englishman when he first travels to see Dracula. The best scene must be when Renfield sits down with Dr Seward for tea and ends up eating bugs. Not only that but the pronunciation of raspberries by Harvey korman in this sequence is hilarious.Even though he has top billing the late great Nielsen wasn't the best thing here (the combination of him and Brooks together in films came too late in the day unfortunately). Bottom line Nielsen is miscast as Dracula, he doesn't look the part and he doesn't sound the part, but that's why he is perfect in the role. The fact he's completely wrong for the role makes it work, its just funny that he doesn't come across as a Dracula kind of guy and I think Nielsen knows that and uses it. Whilst watching I can't help but think Leslie is actually trying in certain scenes bless him, he does appear to actually go for it and really put on his best Lugosi\/Dracula performance just for the hell of it, he's enjoying his chance in the role. End of the day only Nielsen could get away with this kind of deliberate miscasting, he was (and still is) such a popular lovable guy.Brooks himself enters the fray as Van Helsing and fits the role pretty well with his mock German, Jewish accent. In a sense he's playing the same characters as President Skroob and Frederick Bronski with similar facial hair but not as dumb. Yeah sure we've seen it all before with Brooks but if you're a fan then you won't complain. His best scene must be the stake through the heart sequence, simple but effective.I do get the impression that Brooks is merely working his way through every genre he can and this film simply ticks a box on the list...pretty much like 'Men in Tights'. I also get the feeling he is trying to recapture the same level of success he achieved with 'Young Frankenstein' and the Gothic horror genre. To be brutally honest most of the jokes have been used before in previous works but at least its not as childish as 'Men in Tights' and does offer some adult content.

Aliens (1986) was pretty much like Rambo, and Alien (1979) is a little bit dated, so Aliens 3 has succeeded to find the right tone dark, gore, with a multitude of troubled characters. I believe it has commercially flopped in America because it's too sophisticated for the masses. Visually, the movie is beautifully photographed, with a great ambiance.

And those are the Jim Carrey films that I love to see, because when you take away his comedic appeal, you can get a very dramatic and emotional actor. Carrey plays a man who is unaware that his entire life is a television show. He has been on the show ever since he was an infant. Despite having kept this a secret for 30 years, Truman soon begins to suspect something different about his perfect life, despite the shows clever and hilarious lengths to keep him uninterested in the world outside of him. Where does Truman want to go? Well, in a very interesting subplot, we learn that Truman wants to visit Fiji. Why? Because the girl of his dreams, (previously an extra on the show, now an activist living in the real world with an ambition to free Truman with the help of political activism) was taken away by her supposed father, who hastily replied that they were going to Fiji. Now Truman wants to go to Fiji to reunite with the love of his life, and escape his blond and boring wife. If there's one thing that holds this film together, it's the acting. Not just from Carrey, but from the supporting cast, which has an exceptionally difficult job of being a good actor when portraying a good actor, and they pull it off flawlessly. One of The Truman Show's themes is feeding into ones anxieties. It carries this off by having Truman live in a world where travel is frowned upon and made to seem to dangerous and too expensive. There's a really funny and well done scene where Truman goes mad, and attempts to drive to anywhere in America, and the show tried to retail irate by presenting Truman with controlled dilemmas like traffic, forest fires and chemical leaks. It makes me happy that I didn't see it when I was younger, because it surely would upset me. But even still, Truman still attempts to escape, giving the character a sense of courage. And that's what makes The Truman Show work. The character is great. The character is relatable. He represents a great film character. And what great film character would be complete without a great film. The Truman Show. Check it out.

Now however grim this premise may seem, it is anything but. With grand performances from Jack Nicholson, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Jack Black (for the first 30 minutes or-so that he was on screen). This film contains an onslaught of all-star cast members, and although some of them remain a bit too satirical through out the picture, performances from Pierce Bronson, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, and Jim Brown make up for such an unusual base of comedy(and what the hell, lets throw in Tom Jones just for good measure). The CGI (computer-generated images) was also quite impressive, from the onslaught of saucers coming to our beautiful blue planet, to the deliciously addictive need to want to see the martians' brains splattered across the pavement (or even in their own helmets, just for the sake of less clean up later on). Tim Burton has definitely made himself known for his darkly artistic style and refutable casting options, but the great deity of dark comedy himself has really taken a big leap from his usual vision, and took on a level of directing I have never seen from the great visual artist. So luckily, despite a barrage of cheesy dialogue made cheesier and a boast of generally bland characters, Mars Attacks! is comical, greatly conceived and in many ways is a step up from your usual martian invasion parody.

High school girls run naked through a gym locker, soaping themselves and whipping each other with towels. Sissy Spacek rubs suds in between her legs as she starts her period.Elevator music and Vaseline lens shots are turned on their head when she get  The Curse, and thinks she is dying because nobody told her about it. Enter a bunch of classmates including Amy Irving in her screen debut as Sue (later Mrs Spielberg) and Nancy Allen as Chris Hargensen, the school pin-up. None of whom are under 18. In fact, Spacek was 27 the year Carrie was made. Amy Irving was 24, and Nancy Allen, 26 (two years later, she was Mrs De Palma). Not really the 17 year-olds they are meant to be here. Thank God, after all that nudity and soaping.And so we debate the poetry of  The Curse. Carrie is a gifted telekinetic &#x96; or is she cursed? The others smell her difference; like a pack of wolves on an injured deer, they taunt her as she wails in the still-running shower &#x96; saved at last by the pneumatic Miss Collins (Betty Buckley, also an ex of De Palma's). A woman barely older than the girls, cast as their teacher. I let this one slide. But.When we come to the ridiculous detention scene, the girls are berated by Miss Collins, and the viewer is subjected to several minutes of girls in tight shorts bouncing, bending and stretching. Another misogynist bit of movie making by De Palma. This scene is not only completely hammy, but is accompanied by terrible comedy music I can only describe as some weird organist beating off to Sesame Street. He employs the deep field, split screen effect here, probably egged on by cinematographer Mario Tosi and his Panavision Split Diopter Lense, which gives this look used in many horror and sci-fi movies such as The Andromeda Strain and The Boston Strangler. And &#x96; um, a Hitchcock look.The issue in general here is there is no story left &#x96; Stephen King's original tale is so pared down by De Palma that the viewer is just waiting. Waiting for the big Prom scene at the end. Why this is, maybe, is that De Palma didn't mine that treasure chest of female angst deep enough &#x96; and unlike Stephen King who had wife Tabitha at his side filling him in on female psyche (He dedicated Carrie the novel to her This is for Tabby, who got me into it &#x96; and then bailed me out of it.) De Palma misses the mark without this personal input. Wide.So The PROM. Frankly, I don't remember it being this lame. Carrie is kind of covered in blood with her big shot breaking out a fire hose and dousing everyone *to death* with water. Not really very scary. Somehow everything is aflame after a mic sparks and kills two male teachers we don't care about. She kills poor Miss Collins who did really nothing to deserve it, and actually comes across as the most ealistic actress here, with a board, cutting her in two. De Palma, with Tosi, more or less trademarked split screen depth of focus for this type of horror action. He uses it many times in the film, both to highlight Carrie's utter alienation &#x96; or indeed the alienation of Miss Collins from her students.But as much as he pioneers, he apes. Every time Carrie uses telekinesis, the Psycho shower violins creak up. The high school is called Bates High School instead of Ewen as in the Stephen King novel. It's a bit obvious, and not in a good way. And he uses the multiple ending as in Hitchcock's Topaz, forming a kind of syllogism, says the book Hitchcock, Past And Future. Is the film over, or is there more? I jumped only once, a minute from the end &#x96; and many other horror movies have used these tropes to varying degrees of success &#x96; this is certainly an influence on the fantastic Drag Me To Hell's end scene.Despite this version of Carrie being thoroughly dumb and having script dialogue that reads like Murder, She Wrote or worse (at one point Amy Irving's mother says  Oh, I didn't hear you come in despite them being seen clearly in the kitchen together for around three minutes immediately beforehand), there are reasons, albeit car-crash-viewing reasons, to check this version out &#x96; it does give origin to many horror clichés and it's entertaining to discover them first time around.I can't bring myself to call it a classic, and you may feel you need to skip huge swathes of the film just to get to the prom scene, which you will probably find disappointing. I felt that the women in this film had been used to make De Palma's vision in a way that left a dry taste in my mouth the nudity and sexual overtures are presented in a voyeuristic fashion that voids their value immediately.I can't help thinking that in the hands of director Kimberly Peirce, known for her profound understanding of women in Boys Don't Cry will do a much deeper and broader job of the material, and with the sorts of technology used in 2013, surely she can do something more sinister with the prom scene than the humongously spraying penile extension of De Palma's fire hose...

I felt that the women in this film had been used to make De Palma's vision in a way that left a dry taste in my mouth the nudity and sexual overtures are presented in a voyeuristic fashion that voids their value immediately.I can't help thinking that in the hands of director Kimberly Peirce, known for her profound understanding of women in Boys Don't Cry will do a much deeper and broader job of the material, and with the sorts of technology used in 2013, surely she can do something more sinister with the prom scene than the humongously spraying penile extension of De Palma's fire hose...

With the high profile serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum behind bars, he passed the time away writing to his pen pals and fan club. One of Daryll Lee's many followers was a young man played by actor William McNamara as Peter Foley, serial killer in the making. Typically from what psychologists have been able to learn about serial killers is that they each have their own modus operandi. The detectives assigned to tracking down this new serial killer are Holly Hunter and Dermot Mulroney. They approach Dr. Helen Hudson for her assistance in analyzing the murder scenes. However Dr. Hudson has been in seclusion for over a year now as she is the last (and only surviving) victim of the scary looking serial killer Daryll Lee Cullum who remains behind bars. Dr. Hunter provides the much needed assistance to Detectives Monahan and Goetz from her secluded penthouse condo. The movie is filled with suspense, a few relationships in progress with some potential for conflict, and a look alike Tom Cruise played by William McNamara as the unknown serial killer with a new modus operandi that the detectives have never seen before.I enjoy a good suspense film and I place Copycat in this category.

This movie could only have been better if Jamie Lee Curtis had reprised her role Laurie Strode, or as it is suggested Laurie Lloyd. As it is having Michael Myers (George P. Wilbur) and Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleascence) back in the script made this a hundred times better than Halloween III.First of all, I have to say that the script and acting were pretty damn good. Bringing the next generation into the storyline was a great idea. The fact that Michael Myers ends up going after his seven year old niece, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), was a nice twist. Also, writing in that Laurie Strode had died in a car accident with her unnamed, but assumed to be Jimmy Lloyd, husband; Laurie and Jimmy are Jamie Lloyd's parents.Now for my favorite scenes.My first favorite scene is when Dr. Loomis is heading to Haddonfield tracking Michael Myers. Loomis stops at a roadside gas station for gas, but finds only death. Loomis goes into the service bay area where he finds the mechanic dead. He then goes into the restaurant and finds a waiter behind the counter, also dead. Loomis looks around and sees Michael standing in an adjacent doorway, he tries to talk to Michael, but is unsuccessful. And so Loomis shoots at Michael. Michael escapes but not before destroying the gas station and Loomis's car, and taking out the telephone lines.The second of my favorite scenes is when Jamie Lloyd goes out trick-or- treating with her foster sister Rachel Carruthers (Ellie Cornell). They go to several houses and end up at Sheriff Ben Meeker's (Beau Starr) house. When Sheriff Meeker's daughter, Kelly (Kathleen Kinmont), opens the door Rachel sees her boyfriend, Brady (Sasha Jenson), inside. Rachel notices that Kelly is half dressed and so is Brady, at which she walks off and Brady chases after her. Jamie wants to continue trick-or- treating so she and Rachel end up getting separated.The third scene I liked was when Michael Myers gets into Sheriff Meeker's house. Michael first kills Deputy Logan (George Sullivan) and sits in the chair that Logan was sitting in holding the shotgun. Kelly Meeker comes out of the kitchen with a tray of coffee and discovers that Logan is dead. She tries to leave but Michael stabs her with the shotgun. Thought that stabbing her with the shotgun was an interesting choice.I really love this movie, but it is still not as good as the original. What do you think?

First up we have Charlton Heston, who also made the epic disaster film Airport 1975 the same year. Then we have the always great George Kennedy, who was in all of the Airport movies. In perhaps the movie's most ridiculous casting, Lorne Greene plays the father of Ava Gardner. Richard Roundtree is a black Evel Knievel type character. Genevieve Bujold plays Heston's mistress. There was always at least one adultery in these movies for maximum soap opera dramatics. Victoria Principal, wearing a particularly risible wig, provides the movie's eye candy.

That is if you pay attention, The Others is an immensely scary movie.Nicole Kidman is outstanding; no one could've done a better job at this role and I appreciate the makers to use confined rooms for their scenes. Well, they do induce some chills. With an amazing setup and the idea of inventiveness about the characters, the plot talks about the story of a woman and her two children. A gardener, two housekeepers enter their mansion for work and trouble begins. Some sequences, coupled with eerie sound mixing and BG music are sure to keep you hooked. The two children are amazing, as well.And when you reach the final 20 minutes, blast! the plot will hit you like a cold corpse from 200 feet above. That is the effect of The Others. It is not void from goofs and dull moments, but if Scary Movie 3 can spoof one of its scenes, it sure gotta be good.BOTTOM LINE American or British or take Spanish (The Orphanage for instance) horror movies don't scare me much, but if I had to list, this one would sure find a number. Highly Recommended! Beautifully written!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?
