A friend of mine recommended this movie to me years ago. He saw it at the theater and was stunned. I remembered seeing a trailer of the film and wanting to see it badly. Fact is, the film only stayed in the cinema for about five weeks in my country. I was too late, I had to rent it on video. I can imagine that Event Horizon has a scary effect in the cinema, but watching it home alone made me probably feel more shocked then ever before. What I thought to be a mediocre Alien ripoff, turned out to be something completely different. It scared the hell out of me..For those of you who saw Ghost Ship, this movie has a lot of similarities, only Event Horizon is way better. I'll start with the opening credits. Nothing really special, but the music score that comes along with it; absolutely terrifying! Great work by both Michael Kamen and Orbital, who use a sublime mixture of techno, orchestra music and all kinds of chilling sound effects. At that moment I knew I was going to be scared, which didn't take long to actually happen.The acting in this movie is quite well. My credits go to Sam Neill in particular, who plays a role in which I never saw him before. Watch and see for yourself. The story is the worst thing in this movie, although I like the concept of a spaceship that creates black holes to travel faster than light. But the whole 'rescue mission that goes awry' is done so many times before, it didn't impress me much. The same goes for the ending which is in my opinion a bit of a letdown. On the other hand, it probably had a more lasting effect on me just because I was still confused with what actually happened.For those of us who can't stand any gore, don't watch this! Although most of the gore in Event Horizon comes in flashes, there are particular scenes which do not leave much to the imagination. Shocks will be there plenty for the most of us, as everything hits you right in the face over and over again.Adding everything in this film up special effects, music and the atmosphere are the best things here. The storyline is the worst, but is still enjoyable as long as you don't take it too serious. So what's my conclusion? If you want to be scared, do as I did and watch Event Horizon alone in the dark with loud sound.. If you enjoyed Ghost Ship, go and see this movie as it is the same concept, only way better and more believable.. If you liked The Shining, you might consider looking at Event Horizon as well because a good description is The Overlook Hotel in outer space. It's chilling, it's shocking and it stays in your head for a very long time. Liberate tutemae ex inferis! (Safe yourself from hell!) 8\/10!

Not that this story makes a bad movie, I really enjoyed the movie, I'm just saying it's been done before, was done afterward, and I'm sure will be done again.I suppose I shall now contrast Serendipity and Wicker Park since I have reviewed WP as well. There weren't any freaky scenes in the movie like there was in Wicker Park, which was better for me because I really don't care to see all of that. The music in Serendipity was good, however it certainly was no (The) Scientist.The only reasons I did not give Serendipity the same rating (or more than) as Wicker Park was not because of the acting or the story, but more towards the directing side. Paul McGuigan did an unreal job of directing Wicker Park and the way he was able to clearly (if you really think about it-and pay attention) tell almost the whole story backwards. Serendipity is simple, to the point, and...not...backwards, which is probably a good thing for people who don't have a long attention span, or time to sit and watch the whole movie at once. Serendipity also had more comedy in it than WP. All in all, I'd say that if you like either of these movies, you should give the other a try.Kate Beckinsale was a wonderful actress, as in any movies I have yet to see her in (PEARL HARBOR!! YEAH!!! WOO!!!!), and she's so beautiful! I was also very pleased with Jeremy Piven's job in the movie. He did a great job acting as the encouraging tag-along best friend.Life is not merely a series of meaningless accidents or coincidences, but rather it's a tapestry of events that culminate in an exquisite, sublime plan.

I feel that this is a great movie for a younger child who likes adventure novels and whose parents are willing to watch the movie with them to help them interpret key parts. It teaches many values of life, and one of the most important told by Jim the slave himself was to not always think that something is always right just because other people tell you it is. It is a good movie and I would recommend it to young children and adults alike especially after reading the novel. The novel by Mark Twain shows the relationship between a young white uncivilized white boy and a black runaway slave named Jim. Huck is living with a Widow and he likes to go on adventures and play pretend games with his friends especially his one friend Tom who has quite the imagination. Huck's harsh Pap comes to get him because Judge Thatches has a large lump sum of money that is supposed to be Huck's someday and he is after the money. He takes him to a secluded log cabin in the middle of the woods and Huck has to live with his alcoholic dad for all this time and he treats Huck Finn poorly.Eventually Huck finds a way to escape and he takes a boat and gets to an island where people seldom visit. He finds Jim who is the slave of the widow where Huck was previously residing. Jim tells him the secret that he ran away because he didn't want to be sold into slavery into the South he is on a hunt for freedom and wants to buy back his family. So Huck agrees to help Jim on his journey to Cairo and then go back up the river to the free states and earn money to buy his family back from slavery.In this novel Huck learns that just because the majority of people are doing something that it doesn't mean that it is the right thing to do. He learns that African Americans are people too and the color of their skin doesn't change that. He learns that Jim has feelings for his family and he sees just how much Jim cares for him when he shows how excited he is to see Huck. The movie shows all of the main scenes with some twists to keep the viewers attention and understanding, but it still portrays the same feelings and morals.

I got this movie out from the library, and was watching it and feel asleep just after the black guys got killed and the film changed to color. It just looked like another one of those crazy American youth type films. I saw the comments on this site, however, and thought I'd better have another look as I still had it out.On watching it a second (first?) time, I overlooked the lecturing (American style) and bad language, and got through to the end. I also found out why the color was being switched on and off. The here and now was in color and the past events in black and white. The film actually got better as it went on. It has an important message of forgiving your enemies and that race hatred doesn't pay. It is also best to get along with everyone if possible, and not try to annoy others.The film also acts as a sort of documentary of American city life, and the problems that young people have.

Women who find John Cusack adorable will also like this film.There are three major selling points for High Fidelity. The first is the novel technique of mixing 1\/3 traditional narrative with 2\/3 talking directly to the audience (that's breaking the fourth wall for you dramatists). Usually, I hate this technique, because it indicates a lazy\/untalented scriptwriter who couldn't figure out how to get his points across skillfully. But the technique works here (for the most part), because the script is intelligent. It made me remember back to the dreadful period in my and my friend's lives where we experimented to reconcile our preconceptions of relationships with what we actually wanted, and what the women we dated seemed to want (they were doing the same thing, you know).But a good script needs good execution, and Cusack's believability and likability are the film's second selling point. By the time he'd made High Fidelity, Cusack had perfected the blending of being earnest and wry. In fact, I think Julliard has added a Ham on Wry course just to study his technique. In this film, he adds the right amount of youthful, rebellious surliness required for his character. His skills as a monologist are impressive, and I'd like to see him take to the stage for a show.The third selling point is the performances of the supporting cast. Rob and his two record store employees (who show up twice as often as Rob hired them for) are pop music snobs who desperately need to develop their lives.

The diverse and interesting characters are really fun to watch, one of the big reasons I rate this film so high. Hayden, with his big body and tough demeanor, was perfect for film noir. He is a legitimate tough guy, nobody to fool with.

I had never been a huge fan of spy\/espionage type stories but he assured me I would enjoy the read. And enjoy I did. I absolutely loved the book and was so taken with the mystery behind Jason Bourne. When I heard that the novel was to be a movie, I waited with high hopes, knowing what an amazing story would be put to screen.Unfortunately though, I was not so blown away. While I realize it is hard to fit a book of 250 pages plus into a 1 1\/2 hr film, I felt that there were so many important things that were left out of the film. The film got turned into just another action movie with cool fight scenes and guns. While I do admit the fight scenes were choreographed well, this wasn't really an action story. So much of the story is about Jason Bourne struggling to know who he is and what he is. It is a mindtrip keeping a reader turning the pages to know what is going to happen next. The film gave the viewer this sense of uncertainty and mystery, but not the way the book does. Something was lost. In the film, the time lapses were too short and the answers are given too quickly. Rather than leaving Jason and the audience guessing and guessing, the suspension got lost in a shoot-out. Nor does the audience really connect with Jason as a character and what he is going through. In the book, the reader really gets inside Jason's head and we are as lost as he is. We discover things as he discovers them. I feel that the film could have done a better job of connecting the audience to the character.Over all, not a bad film, but if you enjoy this sort of story, please read the book and the ones that follow, the series is purely enjoyable.

I absolutely loved the book and was so taken with the mystery behind Jason Bourne. When I heard that the novel was to be a movie, I waited with high hopes, knowing what an amazing story would be put to screen.Unfortunately though, I was not so blown away. While I realize it is hard to fit a book of 250 pages plus into a 1 1\/2 hr film, I felt that there were so many important things that were left out of the film. The film got turned into just another action movie with cool fight scenes and guns. While I do admit the fight scenes were choreographed well, this wasn't really an action story. So much of the story is about Jason Bourne struggling to know who he is and what he is. It is a mindtrip keeping a reader turning the pages to know what is going to happen next. The film gave the viewer this sense of uncertainty and mystery, but not the way the book does. Something was lost. In the film, the time lapses were too short and the answers are given too quickly. Rather than leaving Jason and the audience guessing and guessing, the suspension got lost in a shoot-out. Nor does the audience really connect with Jason as a character and what he is going through. In the book, the reader really gets inside Jason's head and we are as lost as he is. We discover things as he discovers them. I feel that the film could have done a better job of connecting the audience to the character.Over all, not a bad film, but if you enjoy this sort of story, please read the book and the ones that follow, the series is purely enjoyable.

Kline plays Howard Brackett, a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the Academy Awards this year because one of his former students (Matt Dillon) is a nominee. He is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins, he thanks Howard in his speech for inspiring him because Howard is gay. Now this floors Howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television. Howard is even engaged to be married (to Joan Cusack, in an Oscar-nominated performance)so he has no idea where Dillon;s Cameron Drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what Cameron said on the Oscars. Howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to YENTL and ends up explaining to his guests why Barbra Streisand had to make FUNNY LADY. His parents (Wilford Brimley, Debbie Reynolds) are shocked but promise to support their son, even if he is gay. He also gets a visit from an out of town reporter (Tom Selleck) who wants to do an article about him because he's gay too. The moment when Selleck plants a big kiss right on Kline's lips is a classic. But all of these little things have Howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gay...much to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancée, Cusack, who is beyond confused. The scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic. But what I like about this movie is the way Kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay. There is a fabulous scene, probably the most famous from the film, where he buys a record, on how to be macho, and the guy on the record is talking about how real men don't dance and a disco tune comes on (I WILL SURVIVE if memory serves)and the narrator on the record says no matter what you do, don't dance, but Howard can't help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room. It's hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. The film is not pro or anti gay...it's just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is. Wonderful film.

The movie, face it, doesn't really make sense in a bad way - people's actions don't look real (people are so obviously playacting transactions at the store counter that it's not funny), things happen as obvious set-ups for jokes, and it's so haphazardly shot that you don't get any sense of the locations and where people are in them. Brian O'Halloran isn't bad at all, but the rest of the actors are terrible (no fault) and have obviously in many cases not learned their lines (no excuse). The writing is only fair at best - sometimes funny, often dull, frequently obviously writing.It's interesting to contrast this with another zero-budget personal film, Mark Borchardt's Coven. Borchardt has a surprisingly good visual sense and is a much more imaginative writer, but he apparently doesn't have the personal organization or support to pull off directing a feature-length film. Smith seems to have those things, and so he has a career. That's good for him, but I can't imagine taking the time to see anything else he's done.

I believe the movie actually has a couple of high points.It starts off with a dramatic Let me die. Let me die! Unfortunately for her, we see the title The Brain that Wouldn't Die. Then, we head to the movie. Dr. Bill Cortner works in the hospital with his father to do surgery. After they lose a man (He dies before he can save them.) Dr. Cortner decides to experiment. When his work is finished, the patient comes back to life. Well, they get a heart beat from him. After that, Dr. Cortner and his wife go on a trip to some science convention. But, they crash, and the wife's head falls off. So, Dr. Cortner rushes to his co-workers' house to operate on the fallen head. When she wakes up, she wishes that she were dead. However, there is a twist! She can communicate with the monster in the doctor's closet, due to some serum thing used to operate on her. So, as Dr. Cortner searches models and strippers for the perfect body for his wife, she spends time with the co-worker and talking to the monster.This movie actually has some high points. There is some good dialogue between the characters. It also offers decent thrills, a sense of unknowing. The story unravels itself in an exciting way. Plus, there is an unintentionally funny fight between the two strippers.Of course, its low score is because of numerous flaws in the movie. First of all, it's black and white, which makes it feel a bit dated. Second, the story line is very far-fetched, and the thing with the serum isn't very realistic. Third, the reason the fight between the two strippers was funny, was because it was so corny! Fourth, the ending has to be one of the worst in history! I know many people hated the endings for Vertigo, The Village and Dead Poet Society, but this has to be the worst!Yes, the movie was bad, but not as bad as I expected. Watch The Brain that Wouldn't Die with your friends for some entertainment value, and unintentionally funny parts. Don't you just love B-Movies?5\/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.

The surrealistic looks of the castle, the bright colours of the townspeople and the plot of socialising with a man who has never been outside of the castle gates and adapting to our way of life, it still thrills me. The violence doesn't occur until the end but still dramatic and frightening because of Edawrd protecting Kim. The music in this movie is memorable, Danny Elfman always does a very good job with the choir on this one, Jerry Goldsmith is another person who does just as good as Danny Elfman. The Photography by Stefan Czapsky, from Child's Play, captures the atmosphere of the whole movie, but not so great on CP 2. If you haven't seen this movie yet, SEE IT!!! i recommend it to the highest order, you'll laugh (maybe), you'll cry for Edward and Kim, you'll despise Jim and have a good time.Rated PG for Aussies for Sexual References and Violence ","genre":null},{"date":"23 December 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I have watched this movie since i was 3 years old and this movie never gets old on me.
