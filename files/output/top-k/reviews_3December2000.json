[{"date":"3 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Election is a very great comedy built on a poisoned and exceptional screenplay (by Payne and Jim Taylor, which was nominee at the Oscar). The story is told by the protagonists of this story which are four Jim McAllister, idealist and beloved teacher of the Carver High School. Tracy Flick, the favorite student to win the election of the President of the school students, perfect and ambitious. Paul Metzler, the ex quarterback of the school, a naive boy chosen by McAllister to contrast Tracy. Tammy Metzler, lesbian sister of Paul and third sudden candidate. That's because Paul has stolen her the girlfriend. McAllister hates Tracy for his perfection and ambition and wants to prevent the possibility of her victory. For that it will do everything. This is an exceptional comedy, which reflects in itself the atmosphere of war of thousand of other kinds of elections. If the part of the betrayal of Jim to his wife is the less interesting, the study of the war at school, supported by three young actors of sure talent Reese Witherspoon leaves the pure character of Annette (Cruel Intentions) for a cruel, ambitious, hateful girl with a smile which remembers the worst Doris Day. Chris Klein seems a young, (and stupid) Frank Capra character and he has the right look for it. Jessica Campbell is a revelation as the revengeful Tammy.

Unlike previous disasters like The Avengers and Wild Wild West, Charlie's Angels escapes by having a sense of humor about how stupid it is.  That doesn't make it LESS stupid, but it is refreshing to see a film not take itself seriously.  The women are gorgeous, the direction is often interesting (if a little too derivative of music videos), but the script barely rises up to the level of a saturday Night Live spoof (back when SNL was actually good).  I give it a five. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 December 2000","score":"","review":"  I'll give them this much--for 90 minutes I wasn't thinking about the election outcome.
