Ben Stiller is Greg Focker, It's pronounced like it's spelled...Focker  who is getting ready to engage to his girlfriend (Teri Polo).  But first he must meet her parents.  His girlfriend's father, (Robert De Niro) is a flower expert who is well known for not liking some of his daughter's choices in boyfriends.  First off, Focker is warned not to smoke in the house, because the father finds smoking as a sign of weakness, and his girlfriend throws his pack of cigarettes on the roof (which come in later).  To help his craving, Focker purchases some Nicarette gum, in which he chews several pieces at a time.  The big laughs start with an urn containing a dead grandma's ashes and the family cat, who has an unusual talent of using the toilet.  Ben Stiller's character is similar to his character in There's Something About Mary, he's a clumsy, shy guy just trying to impress his girl and her parents, but everything seems to go wrong for him.  For anyone who has tried to impress a date's parents, or has had bad experiences at airports will be able to simpify with Stiller's character.  There are many big laughs in this movie, and most of the jokes all join together perfectly (ex, Focker is trying to catch the family cat on the roof, but ends up just causing more trouble in a hilarious sequence I won't ruin for you.)

Generally speaking, what critical appraisal a film saw upon its initial release is handed down through the years, almost set in stone, and rarely challenged. Occasionally something slips through, such as the notable redemption of Blade Runner with its Director's Cut, though usually if a film was called a turkey; it stays a turkey forevermore. No self-respecting critic is likely to say that Casablanca is a very good film, though overrated and a little dated. And so it is that a garish, gaudy old children's film from the late 30s seems destined to be a classic for an unforeseen future.For make no mistake, despite it's critical praise, The Adventures of Robin Hood is not a classic work, merely an enjoyable mainstream action-adventure. The production is the type of overblown melodrama where men give women chaste kisses to a crescendo of music, and people throw back their heads and put their hands on hips to laugh heartily. But what really shocks is how camp the whole thing is. To get a feel of it, it's perhaps worthwhile to note that the tagline for the film was the understated Only the rainbow can duplicate its brilliance! Claude Rains has a wonderfully fey time as Prince John, Errol Flynn ain't exactly butch, and Patric Knowles plays the girliest Will Scarlett ever seen. Only Olivia de Havilland misses out on the poncy fun, being forced to contend with long monologues, speeches and soft focus.

Some of the swordfights look as if the film has been sped up, though there's a nice moment when we see Robin and Sir Guy of Gisbourne fighting in silhouette.It's all very well made, and nicely presented, the sort of throwaway fun you can really appreciate on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

The director wisely chose the action path to draw the viewers back.  From the jaw-dropping stunts at the start to the end was one rollercoaster of an action film.But fortuently for us it wasn't just an action film, it was meant to be a refresh on Bond - to show younger viewers who Bond was.Anyway the film, I felt, was more action than story.  The plot of a spy turning bad and using a satellite to rob the Bank of England was pretty inconsequential.  Okay, it sounded a little like the novel of MoonRaker - but that didn't matter - what mattered was the action.  And there was plenty of it to satisfy the hardened action lover.So okay, the fall-after-a-plane looked physically impossible - actually it is possible to fall after a plane, catch up to it, and climb inside (the parts with the stunt man are actually real, its just the close-ups on Brosnan climbing inside the plane made you THINK it wasn't possible).  The plane turning from one angle to another in a matter of seconds, however, isn't possible.So, okay enough of the physics and the action, what about the story, the bad guy, and all that?  Yes, yes, they were great, Sean Bean puts in a good, but pretty unmemorable appearance as 006 - its a shame the ending wasn't better - or perhaps a team of 00 agents verses 007 would have been a better plot.Anyway this is a good, reintroduction to bond, if you can mind the action, the moore-styled plot and script then you'll enjoy it.  But if you preferred the style of Dalton and Connery or the novels - you won't enjoy it.

From the jaw-dropping stunts at the start to the end was one rollercoaster of an action film.But fortuently for us it wasn't just an action film, it was meant to be a refresh on Bond - to show younger viewers who Bond was.Anyway the film, I felt, was more action than story.  The plot of a spy turning bad and using a satellite to rob the Bank of England was pretty inconsequential.  Okay, it sounded a little like the novel of MoonRaker - but that didn't matter - what mattered was the action.  And there was plenty of it to satisfy the hardened action lover.So okay, the fall-after-a-plane looked physically impossible - actually it is possible to fall after a plane, catch up to it, and climb inside (the parts with the stunt man are actually real, its just the close-ups on Brosnan climbing inside the plane made you THINK it wasn't possible).  The plane turning from one angle to another in a matter of seconds, however, isn't possible.So, okay enough of the physics and the action, what about the story, the bad guy, and all that?  Yes, yes, they were great, Sean Bean puts in a good, but pretty unmemorable appearance as 006 - its a shame the ending wasn't better - or perhaps a team of 00 agents verses 007 would have been a better plot.Anyway this is a good, reintroduction to bond, if you can mind the action, the moore-styled plot and script then you'll enjoy it.  But if you preferred the style of Dalton and Connery or the novels - you won't enjoy it.

It seems that creativity and true freedom to have an individual voice have been restricted quite a bit in the last 25 years. This movie shows us how costly standing up for one's values in the face of public pressure can be. It also shows us some of the rewards possible with such integrity. The movie names Democrats and Republicans as such, within the fictional world of the story. No generic or safe amorphous political figures, unidentifiable and therefore inoffensive to all. That is rare in movies, and exciting in a sneaky kind of way. No big fuss is made over it, but as an audience member you later realize how cool that is. No 555 faked-up personas here! That's a quiet victory, perhaps, but I was nonetheless impressed (later) with how much courage that took. So Yaay! to the writer\/director Lurie.The cast was also great. I had never heard of Joan Allen-- until I read a profile of her in the NY Times. Turns out I had seen her several times before, and had enjoyed and admired her talent quite a bit. But like another great actor, Robert Duvall, Joan Allen seems to disappear so completely in a role that she may be somewhat Invisible as an actor. That's a blessing, and the highest compliment. But it also might be frustrating for her and her fans, at times, wouldn't you think? The very thing that makes her so great as an actor is the same thing that might make it hard to remember her outside of the role she played.Jeff Bridges is fantastic, as usual. Gary Oldman is another actor with a two-edged sword thing going. He always seems to play creeps and villains. He is such a good actor that he seems creepy himself, because we don't get to see a better side of him.Overall, this is a great movie. Oh-- one flaw What's with all the focus on chewing and eating? Where did modern movie makers get the idea that people talking with a mouth full of food is somehow real-er or grittier or whatever the quality? There were moments when the key characters were shown shoveling piles food into their mouths, while still talking a mile a minute. This movie wasn't as bad as the recent Random Hearts (I still shudder when I recall Harrison Ford chewing... and chewing... and chewing for what seemed like two hours). All that gulping, smacking, and gasping, especially while talking, is such a turnoff. For me, it's like fingernails on a blackboard.

I even bought the damn Prince soundtrack, even though I hated Prince back then. Of course, times have changed - now Prince is just fine and this movie has deteriorated with every viewing. Not only is everything about the Batman character from the comic book (before the revisionist post-film writers got a hold of him) utterly gone, the acting is horrendous (on ALL fronts) the story makes no sense, and it is, above all else, BORING. Of course, compared to the other films in the series, it's Citizen Kane. To list just one of the many examples of anti-Batman like behavior, Batman would never drive his car into a warehouse, drop bombs and drive away. What is he, the UN? The Elfman music is just lovely, sure. But what we have is a movie that is all style and no substance. Batman comes across more like Iron Man - or a pre-frowning-90s-twentysomething Iron Man - and all of the other characters (including Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent, whom they apparently kicked to the curb for Tommy Lee Jones a little later in the series) are ridiculous and if they bear any resemblance to their comic book counterparts, it's in name only. Bruce Waynes decision to reveal his identity to Kim Basinger and Alfred's decision to just let her into the Batcave afterwards remain two of the most puzzling oversights in script history. I am constantly amazed at the kudos given this film. Tim Burton is a fine director, sure, and this film SHOULD have been good but is bad at EVERY turn. My God, people, watch it again! And oh yes, when I saw this in the theater eleven years ago, the showcase had printed The Joker on my ticket stub. Perhaps that was a mistake, or perhaps that was a way to clue the viewer in that Batman has a supporting role in his own movie. I understand the next film in the series is going to use Frank Miller's Year One, which, while a fine story, is also completely revisionist Batman history. I suggest that anyone who has a sincere interest in the Batman mythos, read the 70s and 80s comic books, up to The Dark Knight Returns and stay as far away from these cinematic stink bombs as possible.

I know! - Let's give her the best actress nod so we can round her out as the woman of my dreams.-The sentiments of sixteen year old boys and Film Critics the world over and god forbid, the Academy Bjorking off...What's wrong with this picture? Is it just me or are cute perky chicks given too much credit these days?  Seems every time I turn around there's some new darling media girl getting too much recognition for too little work, be it Binoche, Diaz, or in this case Bjork.Before you dismiss me as a rampant chauvinist, set only on dissing actresses, let us remember men are not guilt free here either. Witness Hollywood's unrelenting efforts to hand generally subpar actor Robin Williams parts more talented actors would give their eyeteeth for.David Bowie once said about the first major film he did, Just a Gigolo, It was my 32 Elvis movies rolled into one.Perhaps that's the sentiment we should take here.Unlike many popstars before her though, Bjork's acting debut is competent and moving. I'd even go so far as to call it art, for the emotional roller coaster ride it took myself and the rest of the audience through last night.Ask yourselves though, how much of this performance was due to an artist who has mastered the craft of acting versus someone well versed at being themselves. I suggest it is the latter.Don't get me wrong, Bjork plays her part well, but the best actress suggestions I've seen on this board really get my goat.If you want to see a great actress, see someone with whom you are likely not enchanted with before you enter the theater and see where they take you. If you'd like to do some homework, might I suggest Linda Hunt in The Year of Living Dangerously, Anne Bancroft in The Graduate  or Helen Mirren in The Cook the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.But why even bother looking that far when you could enjoy Deneuve's performance beside Bjork in the same film.That said, Bjork does bring a lot of great qualities to this film such as the aforementioned audience involvement, steady acting and some wonderfully creative music.That said, why do I still feel angry and queasy after seeing this movie 24 hours ago?It ain't just the lack of steadicam.I came into the movie a Von Trier virgin. I came out feeling date raped. From what I've read this is pretty standard fare for one of Lar's movies.Perhaps it is his ability to negotiate illogical plot points with his audience so well. For example, why didn't Selma open a bank account? It would have saved a lot of trouble. But then we wouldn't have a movie would we.No matter, it was too late, with every successive act of the story, they sucked us further into the tragedy and we went along willingly.That said, see this movie for a variety of compelling reasons1.) You will actually enjoy a modern musical even if it lacks what my friends like to call that Steve Miller HummabilitySteve Miller - you may not like him but at least you can whistle his tunes on the way home. Try that with half of the Disney features these days. 'Nuff said.2.) You will be seduced by a director's melodramatic albeit pretentious storytelling technique. You will no longer think it hokey that people might have cried at operas two hundred years ago.3.) Unrelenting as it is, it is a modern fable and damnit we need more of those.4.) While I don't think she should nab the best acting trophy Bjork's sure to be in line for the best soundtrack and rightfully so.That said, I have enjoyed their latest effort and look forward to what these two great artists will bring us in the future.-The Nebbish ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"15 October 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is a flop before the opening credits are done. 'Get Carter' should have been named ' I'm going in circles, get me out.' Stallone plays the macho Carter. However, the character has no depth, style or dialogue to be the main character. The whole concept is Stallone trying to find out who 'took out his brother'. Get Carter spins with poor subplots, bad acting, and over used one-liners, making the movie drawn out and boring. The action scene last seconds, and do not even belong in this movie. The rough and tough image is skewed with large gaps in the story line, acting and directing. At times the movie seems to be shot by a two year old, playing with his parents camcorder. Movies need a good screenpay and a good director. 'Get Carter' had none of these.

This film is a fantastic thrill ride for lovers of horror like myself.Although I have heard people argue that the acting was sloppy, the storyline was brief and choppy at best and the camera work was complete crap; but I say thats what makes the film so creepy and entertaining.The acting was obviously pretty bad but HELLO!, they weren't actually acting. It was intended to be a real life account of their search through the woods for the Witch, so when they found themselves lost and obviously not alone they started to panic; as anyone would in that situation. I myself thought it strange that they would continue to film even though things started to go wrong but the pieces of footage after the second or third night were done with Heather's camcorder on which she recorded a personal diary of the project, plus being committed to her work she probably wanted to capture every moment on film no matter how scared she was.Speaking of the camera work, i believe that it was what really made the film so scary with the scenes at night where the camera was pointing toward the ground so you couldn't actually see anything but you still could hear the sounds from the woods and its then that you get the same feeling that they have, you cant see what is going on you can only hear it, which is much more frightening.When I heard of the upcoming Blair Witch 2, I was disappointed that the makers had chosen to film it in the standard 3rd person perspective as all films are. Although they can't have another group of kids in the woods with their own camera again as it would simply be a redo of the original, I would have preferred if they leave it be and let the legacy that was created with the first live on instead of trying to commercialise it into a big budget film.As you can tell i speak highly of this film and believe that it was what the horror genre needed, a truly creepy film that can shock you every time it is watched.

(In the theaters I have seen it about 5 times, the rest on video\/dvd)It may not be the best acted, or original in terms of story and characters, but a movie about the admiration for movies can only heighten the enjoyment for the viewer. I was so engrossed by the wonderful photography of the town and for it's inhabitants that I actually thought this place was real and that this little boy lived and worked there. I came out thinking that I had grown up there myself and was on a first name basis with all of the characters. It's a wonderful comment on the power of motion pictures, where they've come from and where they have gone. But what I am specifically draw to is the tragic yet tender closing of the main character's relationship with 2 people from his past, Alfredo the projectionist, and Elena his first true love. Sweeping and elegant, the film seems to take elements from classic European and American films and uses them to perfect the interactions between Toto, Alfredo & Elena. Even though we have seen these kind of friendships\/relationships in films many times over, the director manages to make them fresh and unique.A question I always had with the film was within it's closing credits. They use footage from the film as the credtis role past. But the very last scene shows a grown Toto looking behind himself to see a modern day version of his love Elena. This was what made me seek out information about another cut of the film. My first confirmations were through a Japanese movie magazine which showed stills from scenes not released in the 2 hour North American version. Years later the director's cut (162 mins) was released in the UK and I managed to get a copy. What a diference between the two! More footage of Toto as a teenager showing how he and his friends were just like any other horny teenagers. The footage also showed a darker side to Alfredo the likes of which were never even hinted at in the shorter version. But the one storyline I was waiting for was the grown Toto meeting Elena and finding out just what happened those many years ago. These added scenes gives the film a much more mature feeling and darker quality to it and really can not be compared to it's shorter companion.
