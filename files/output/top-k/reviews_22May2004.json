But if you are looking for a film to watch by yourself or with other adults, don't waste your time with Shrek. Maybe this is obvious advice, but unfortunately I never received this advice. All I received was loads and loads of comments about how this film is entertaining for all ages and blah-blah-blah. So, if your age is in the single-digits, this film is for you.

How's that for a bad setting ? Especially  for a film with such an infamous reputation. How surprised I was to find myself loving this  film. I watched it many times, studying it, trying to find what was supposed to be so bad but  couldn't get it. I then found a Wide Screen VHS of the original long version. Maybe that would  explain the bad reputation. Well, it was even better. A good film made great. Actually, the  short version didn't seem to make sense after seeing the director's cut. But their are many  factors imaginable to justify the incomprehension of the film. First, the characters are not  defined by what they say but by what they do. Cimino volontarily leaves a lot of ambiguity in  them. Something audiences are not very used to. Second, there's the unusual techniques  used. For example, when a character walks along the train, talking, we loose some of the  dialogue as it would be in real life. Then there's the historical aspects of this western that  put a lot of viewers off. No more myths, everything is believable. From clothes, to music, to  accents, to the immigrants origins. Which brings me to the historical point of view. Heaven's  gate gives us an uncompromising look at the Far West and the building of the U.S.A. Like  most countries, it was often built by the rich eliminating the poor, by corruption in the  highest spheres of power, by the use of violence by the alleged noble men of the time, and  by making sure that nobody kept track of these invents, replacing them with mythology. And  many people didn't want to know about these aspects of american history. Plus their were of  course all the gossip around Cimino's dictatorship on set, his wild demands, going over  budget and length, but the real reason nobody wants to see this film for what it is, is that few  will accept the fact that violence is in the very fabric of America. And violence, betrayal,  disillusion (the main theme of the film !) are NOT pretty things to look at. Take another look  at Cimino's best movie. It's a demanding, intelligent, unique and uncompromising vision  of a country still looking for it's identity.

Escapism in its purest form if I may say that! And what makes it even more powerful as a beginning of such a long movie (about 11 hours) is the Shire theme made by Howard Shore. It fits perfectly to the lovely nature and the freedom shown on the screen.It is a very beautiful contrast to what follows in the second part and at the end of the third one, namely the battle on the Plennor Fields.This movie lied the foundation for the success for it's followers.

This is a funny, witty, oftentimes sarcastic film that makes you really like the main characters. It entices you to wait and see exactly how the movie is going to end, even though the outcome seems fairly obvious from the get-go. But in the case of this movie, it's not about the finish line, but about the path which leads there.-Humour The dialogue in 'My Cousin Vinny' contains a lot of swearing, but the swearing is so funny and so well mixed in with the action, that the film invariably seems dull if you try to see the syndicated TV version. Some lines are so smart and full of clever irony that you will laugh even if you've seen the scene before. It's not all funny, like the Naked Gun movies, though. 20\/25-Physical Comedy There are a few funny bits of physical comedy; most from Joe Pesci, naturally. And it is quite entertaining to see Marisa Tomei in a backless, one-piece, flower body-suit arguing with Mr. Pesci about her biological clock. 12\/20-Plot This film has a very interesting plot, that keeps the viewer's attention until the end.

Sure, Gene Hackman was great, but you pretty much expect that from him, and Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar Nomination; but Sartain really stood out as the sheriff. He managed to be compelling and charismatic and scary as hell all at the same time. Actually, so did Gene Hackman, which I think was intentional--the filmmakers wanted us to notice the very thin line between Hackman's ex-sheriff character and Sartain's Sheriff Stuckey.I thought the movie was a little heavy-handed, and its obvious attempts to be powerful and moving made me wince at times.

Tarentino did not direct this, but he wrote it.It has almost as much (or as much) violence as Pulp Fiction, so if you hate Pulp Fiction maybe you wouldn't like this film either -- but otherwise it's AWESOME...! Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Patricia Arquette, Christian Slater and many others in this star-studded cast were excellent in their roles. This is most of all a FUN movie to watch. Brad Pitt's role is amazingly small -- and even more delightfully funny. I've watched this film at least 10 times and he cracks me up every time.I really can't write a good enough review for this film. It is something you really must see for yourself.

De Palma adds all of his favorite flourishes. The camera is used in the classic De Palma fashion. When Pacino's Tony Montana sees his sister with another man there is a close up and threatening music to show the viewer that the man who dared to touch his sister would ultimately play. I believe what makes Montana such an intriguing character is the fact that he is completely conflicted. He never is quite satisfied. He has an impulse and doesn't hold back. If something fuels his anger, Montana will not keep it buried. He is not a good man, but not scared of anything or anybody. This characteristic appeals to many who view the film. Montana will not take no bones from anybody. BUT..and this is a huge but..Montana is also a victim of his own rage and pays for it. He doen't know when to let go of his pride and makes careless decisions because of it. And Montana loves to embellish in the money and greed is the ultimate thrill to him. Greed is like a blood supply. That and cocaine. Coke really is indeed in full supply and many suck it up in this film. Montana does have courage, yet it can be blinding to him like his greed. You know that the film can only end in tragedy with a figure like Tony Montana. Too many enemies will eventually lead you to a demise. The film is also a comedy to me. This is De Palma's touch to the film. The character of Montana is so crazy at times that he will say the oddest things. He just says what pops into his head. This is also an appeal to many viewers. The first time I saw the film, I didn't like it. Yet after my second viewing I saw that it was very tongue in cheek yet also a sad film.

I have always considered that some of the most entertaining and enjoyable movies came out during the 1980s and `Trading Places' definitely falls within this category.Everything is a success with this movie &#150;the high quality of acting from both the main actors and the supporting cast, the wonderful humour and engaging dialogue contained within the script, the development of the plot, the music selection provided for the various scenes and even the atmosphere and scenery contained in the movie. Eddie Murphy and Dan Ackroyd are particularly outstanding in their various roles &#150;and keep the excellent performances up in their reversal of roles. Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche and Denham Elliot also provide their characters with a great amount of depth and dimension and make what would have already been a wonderful comedy success even more entertaining. The only very minor criticism is that Jamie Lee Curtis is meant to portray a prostitute in this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis is much too high quality of an actress for the role of a prostitute and I think if the emphasis had been on her character's profession it would have weakened her contribution to the movie. But thankfully the writers and producers recognized that she shouldn't be portrayed in a one-dimensional role and her truly wonderful and highly excellent acting abilities shone through during the whole movie.The script flowed naturally and had an edge to it that made it both entertaining and intriguing. Even though the storyline and outcome was slightly predictable, the scriptwriters succeeded in keeping you interested and keeping you entertained as the sequence of events unfolded. The humour contained in the movie is genuinely entertaining and doesn't sound forced or strained in the same way that it does in some other movies. Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy make a thoroughly wonderful team and I hope they someday consider doing another movie together. I think the 1980s marked the high point of Eddie Murphy's career and this was one of the movies that cemented his reputation as a great comedian. I couldn't recommend this movie highly enough.

The fact that John Carpenter composed the music himself is also worth noting.I watched it in the best possible way, with about 8 friends in a room with only candlelight.
