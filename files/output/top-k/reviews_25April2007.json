Okay, it's a bit outdated (1981), and okay, it's a Linda Blair vehicle, so that doesn't exactly makes you expect Oscar-winning material, as less as the credits of this director DeSimone do, who seems to be especially renowned for gay (adult?) movies. And sure, the guys in this movie look either like Donny Osmond in his puppy love days or like long-haired surfer dudes, while the girls look like&#133;, well, like Linda Blair. The acting may be mediocre, the special effects simple and the story a rather predictable blend of several horror-cliché's. But still&#133;.. I liked it. How come? Well, because it's high-paced, because it's actually pretty d*d scary and because all the cliché's are upgraded with some very inventive direction and photography. For instance, the main characters are presented as real persons that you come to like and regret to see getting killed. The setting is a very convincing scary house. The dark atmosphere is authentically photographed with no extra lighting, so for a change you don't see people prowling around with a torch through supposed 'darkness while you think hey, why bother! The use of the musical score, alternated with stretches of dead silence, is very effective. The alarm and panic of the characters is never over the top but actually very realistic. Surely there are flaws too. There are some improbabilities in the script, like this frat initiation in the spooky manor seems to be a yearly recurring tradition, so how come these killing maniacs never before went havoc? Or how stupid and irresponsible can a police-station be to let their weapon-room open for everyone to barge in and grasp some! And there are some inconsistencies, like what's the silly appearance of a ghost supposed to be? a prank of the hazing friends? or something stirred up by the deformed maniacs? It never gets explained. And how long can a night take?? The president of the fraternity says that he'll be back at dawn within six hours, and all the goings on in the house, included some time sleeping and waiting, impress as a lot more than the passing of 6 hours! But these few flaws are of minor importance. The most important of this movie is that there is actually a very genuine and effectively build up sense of suspense. There are no graphically displayed killings here, so if you're looking for that, don't bother. But if you like to be spooked and goose bumped and made jump up in your chair now and then, this is really a treat. It only proves that good horror doesn't necessarily needs gallons of blood or the flying around of chopped-off body parts. See for instance the scene with the carpet in this one, or the scene on the roof earlier in the picture. Or the scene where Van Patten tries to climb over a high and sharp-pitched fence to escape, nothing much actually happens there but it makes you sit on the edge of your chair and cringe with anticipation! I was highly entertained throughout the whole movie, and the extended ending has some pretty surprises to top it. I only felt so sorry for Linda who so much deserved her (very cute!) love-interest Peter Barton after all that she had to endure, but alas&#133;.

Sure it wasn't perfect, but it is MUCH better than a 5.6.The story is absolutely engrossing. There are so many good and realistic things going on... a man learning about all the little things he has missed in life, an Indian princess striving for adventure and guidance amongst her steady and safe society, and a full-blown war between civilizations who both believe that the other is made of savages. I appreciate that this story is a realistic depiction of war, with two disagreeing sides, neither of which is necessarily right or wrong.The animation in this movie is absolutely spectacular. And it is spectacular in the best way with a basis in cinematography. The animation is not only spectacular because of the details in the backgrounds and the characters, but even more so because of how beautifully it is used. Scenes such as when Pocahontas and John meet in the mist are the kind of simple beauty that more movies need. When you hear the song Listen With Your Heart, you can practically feel the breath of the surrounding forest. Fantastic stuff.Another big high point is the music. Everyone's heard the show-stopping Colors of the Wind, but the others are worthy of praise as well. Steady as the Beating Drum, Just Around the River Bend, Savages, Listen With Your Heart, Mine, Mine, Mine, and the deleted If I Never Knew You ALL fit perfectly. Musically, this movie is on par with Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and just a tick behind Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.So if all these things are good, why only an 8? Two words... the ending. Everything leading up to it is so engrossing, and Savages builds up such an intense conflict drama, and everything is falling apart. This was the chance for Disney to turn this movie into a classic, and with what had to happen, they easily could have. But they completely failed. After Savages, the scene that should have been the most intense and dramatic climax in their history ended almost instantly. It was too fast, there was almost no drama like their should have been, and the dialog was awful... captured none of the epic feel that it should have. Such a shame that such a great film was wrecked by such a horribly executed ending.I also wasn't a fan of the constant distractions of the animal sidekicks, and of course there are the matters of historical accuracy and non-stereotypical depiction of the Indians, but as an avid animation fan I was willing to overlook these issues and give it a chance to be a good film in a non-contexted world. Some may be put off by this, but since when have animated films been historically accurate? So, honestly, those who are put off by things like People in the dynasty when Mulan lived weren't praying to ancestors yet should probably not expect to like this movie.Out-of-context, I give it an 8\/10 because everything up till the ending was completely magical, and had some of the best moments in all of Disney history, but the ending fell flat. I still want to watch it over and over again, because the rest of the movie really was fantastic. With a proper dramatic ending, I really do think that it could have been nominated for Best Picture like the Disney people thought it would. As is, it's a great entry into the animated classics canon. Definitely recommended even though it falls well short of the greatness achieved by the early 90's films.

The result is a tight, classy, explosive film that is definitely one of the series strongest. Never before has a Bond effort been so efficient, the hallmark of great modern action. Never before has the villain been as good, either.That man is Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), the world's most powerful media baron. Carver is a megalomaniac, but the difference is the film's reliance on powerful characterization, not outlandish schemes, to define him. Constantly making pompous self-references, at one point comparing himself Caesar, Napoleon and God; Carver is so full of himself his ego juice evaporates from his every pore. The difference between genius and insanity is measured only by success, he declares. He enjoys punctuating his sentences with unusual adjectives like delicious or outstanding, words that describe the movie well.Some Bond fans have taken up arms over the speed of the film, asserting it goes too far. What they forget is the way Bond's popularity fell in the 80s at the hands of superior competition, not to mention how quickly he was forgotten in the early 90s. Changes needed to be made in order for Bond to survive in a new era. In the end, he is more exciting than ever, despite complaints about the changes, which began in the Dalton era anyway and are more superficial than the outcry suggests.True, Tomorrow Never Dies is kinetic, but it never forgets its characters or neglects the story. It maintains its pace yet still creates and develops interesting people, which has not consistently been a strength of the franchise in the past. The two preceding films did a superb job with their characters, but this one manages to top even them. The plot is in fact unusually intricate for a Bond movie, or any action film. It is well fleshed out and clearly explained, so the diligent viewer will not have any trouble following it. Both changes are most refreshing.The story involves ascending tensions between Britain and China, beginning with the sinking of an English battleship in the South China Sea. The captain gives his final position in international waters, and M (Judi Dench), the head of British intelligence, soon suspects that Carver deliberately led the ship off course. While all doubt about the culprit's identity is quickly removed, the how and the why prove much more complicated. During Bond's investigation, he meets Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh), a Chinese secret agent investigating Carver from the other end, and Paris (the lovely Teri Hatcher), a former mate and now Carver's wife.It is difficult to become involved in a Bond movie without an affinity for Bond, and Pierce Brosnan engenders that as well as anyone. After a very solid, but not exceptional debut, Brosnan now possesses all of the swagger, cool confidence, and toughness needed. He also continues his practice of making Bond more human, which leaves the character more likable than he often was in the past.A paramount element of any action thriller is the villain, and Jonathan Pryce's shoots a bullseye with every arrow. He understands Carver's complete amorality, and takes command of the role with fire and spirit. He deftly avoids making the mistake of taking his role too somberly, as he provides several chuckles for the audience with his captivating performance. That task is not an easy one. He combines his talents with those of writer Bruce Feirstein and director Roger Spottiswoode to create the splendid opponent for Agent 007.Götz Otto also leaves a lasting impression in his role as Stamper, Carver's muscular, psycho-blonde Chief of Security. Stamper becomes the most imposing henchman since Oddjob, and that is a powerful statement. Unlike many of Oddjob's successors, however, he is not invincible. Vincent Schiavelli also makes a brief appearance as a self-absorbed doctor of death in one of the film's best scenes.As for the Bond girls, Spottiswoode breaks the tradition of casting for skin only. Instead, he chooses one who is athletic; she can take care of herself almost as well as Bond can. Yeoh shows almost no skin, but leaves an indelible impression with her stunts and fight scenes.If the villain is not the most vital element in a Bond film, then the action is, and Tomorrow Never Dies delivers in pure adrenaline. It has four major action segments starting with Bond's daring raid on a confused terrorist camp, an ingenious pursuit through a parking garage with Bond literally backseat driving his gadget laden BMW and an incredible motorcycle chase through Saigon.The fourth comes in the climactic battle as hundreds of bullets shred and sunder the interior of Carver's catamaran, not to mention more than a few bodies. This scene has shooting, dodging, running, diving, aiming, chaos, strategy, cover, and desperation abundantly. Legendary stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong's choreography is peerless and the set is covered so well that we feel like we are in the boat, covering the event like one of Carver's newsmen. Spottiswoode understands that the great directors do not try to be innovative, but let the quality of the production speak for itself. As in GoldenEye, the melees are bone crushing, but are photographed so the movie can maintain its PG-13 rating.Tomorrow Never Dies proves that after 35 years, Bond is still bona-fide entertainment, and far from brainless action. If some of the naysayers have discouraged you from seeing this, cast aside your doubts and enjoy. After all, Gene Siskel gave it a thumbs-up not because of the action, not because of Brosnan, but because he liked the supporting characters, and that is only part of the fun.

Des Sjunde inseglet has some great and thought provoking themes in it and is also beautifully made at the same time, by Ingmar Bergman and his entire cast and crew. The movie questions and debates several issues concerning the meaning of life, religion and death. Of course this movie provides no answers to any of that because of the simple reason that nobody knows the answers to these questions and everybody interpret life and belief on their own way. This movie can also be seen as a free interpretation of those subjects and it triggers the mind of its viewers, which is also the reason why this movie can be interpreted in many different ways by many different people. It makes Des Sjunde inseglet a rare really thought provoking movie.But the movie is not only just about this depressing and heavy subjects, it's also about hope, if you at least look deep enough into it. Also the movie is way more accessible to everyone then it might sound. The themes and entire subject of the movie might sound a bit off and difficult and certainly will scare of a large group of the average movie-watcher but the movie is perfectly watchable for basically just everyone. I think that the great surrealism of the movie is a reason why it works out so way and is perfect to watch for basically just everyone, regardless of age, race or religion.The movie has a great look in which less is more. The movie chooses a simplistic and more warm approach, to keep the story real and as involving and thought provoking as possible. It gives the movie an unique look and atmosphere and also provides the movie with some beautiful images. The cinematography is really first rate and so are the costumes and sets for the movie, that all adds to its atmosphere of the time period the movie is set in.The movie is filled with a couple of beautiful looking sequences that also make a lasting heavy dramatic impression. It's a powerful movie to watch that both provokes and is easy on the eyes.All of the actors also did a great job and the movie features some of the best Swedish actors of that generation. Of course most are unknown today by the general public but the movie also features some 'big' names that are known around the world, of which Max von Sydow is of course the best example. I enjoyed watching him in this early movie role, especially since we mostly only know him as an 'old' man, every since his The Exorcist role. It was refreshing to see him as a very young man and as a beginning actor. Bengt Ekerot is also perfectly cast as the scary looking 'death' itself. His appearance is the best known element out of the movie and is even known to persons who've never watched this movie. This really says something about the impact his appearance makes in this movie.It's just a movie in which everything adds up; the cinematography, the music, the atmosphere, the directing, the acting, its themes. Everything is first class work and every little element of the movie enriches the movie and adds up to its total brilliance. The fact that such an 'old' European movie is so well known- and is still being watched all over the world should say enough about its quality and universal themes that are of all time that are handled in it. 10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"25 April 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Very rarely such a both great looking and thought provoking movie comes around that makes such a powerful and lasting impression.

And let's say that, for a first time, Tarantino knows how to draw the attention.Released about 15 years ago, Reservoir Dogs is looked up today as a classic, just like the other subsequent Tarantino movies would be, should I say it.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a group of gangsters recruited by an eccentric, but serious boss, in order to rob diamonds from a jewelry store. The film shows the before the operation and the after. But not the during. There are indeed some clues which allow to build a script in our mind, but that's precisely what Tarantino wants that the viewer let his imagination working.What's more, there is no straight line. The before and the after are alternated in such a random way that it becomes almost impossible to get all the scenes back in the actual order. The only thing we can know for sure is whether we're watching the before or the after. Generally, we can have a certain idea. But it would take several days of viewing and checking the scenes one by one in order to determinate where they go in the story's actual chronology.This strategy is reminiscent of older movies like Citizen Kane where we could see a young Orson Welles, then an old, younger, older&#133; We almost get lost.Anyway, whether it's the before or the after, one thing predominates throughout this movie the politically incorrect. Some would say that Tarantino's trademark is the extreme and aesthetic violence, while others would say that it's his characters' monologues. But one thing unites each of these elements they're all politically incorrect. And this is precisely Tarantino's real trademark the politically incorrect.Tarantino fills his movie with violence at one point we could believe that he's compressing several war movies at the same time, so they could get the same size as only one. There's as much blood in Reservoir Dogs as in a Red Cross collecting center. But Tarantino can't get satisfied by only showing violence.

Film criticism generally consists by far too much loose opinions, and this has led to an ignorant popular belief that Topaz was Hitchcock loosing touch or a film made by the senile Hitchcock. It seems that Hitchcock couldn't make any kind of film he wanted, since his name held him captive as the master of suspense - with demands and expectations from the thick crowd. Now, I won't deny that Topaz is flawed. But it is an interesting, nearly fascinating film, nonetheless. More importantly, the flaws are quite complex and makes no real sense. Let me try to explain further.Leonard Maltin claimed that the most difficult part of Topaz was it's lack of stars. I think that the lack of stars is completely unessential. On the contrary, the idea of a more natural hitch film freed from stars is a nice one in my mind. It's possible that the absence of an Ingrid Bergman made matters worse to the general public, but all in all it's not a problem.The problem lies in three things The Plot. The Intrigue. The Editing. These three things, usually perfected with ease by Hitch, aren't properly working as they should in Topaz. First it's the story, the very idea of the film. It's puzzling in it's vagueness. Stafford's eligible French spy goes to Cuba to infiltrate Russian commie business. The mission succeeds, upon which a Russian leek in France is detected. The leek is tracked down. The end.What?! There is no consistent story element that is anywhere near interesting in the film. Naturally, most Cold War-thrillers are bound to feel aged nowadays, but even when the Cold War was upon us this must have been a really thin plot. Now, if that wasn't enough, the intrigue is planned out with genuine dumb wit. First, we are led to believe that the story is about an espionage episode during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Diffusely we accept this plot and are gradually sucked into it with Hitch's talent to tell a story. Halfway through though, Cuba is abandoned for the trust-nobody-dramatics in France. The mood is suspenseful, but one must say that the story is genuinely uninteresting and more importantly out of cope with the pace of the film, which just started to get interesting. Another problem is that the first half of the film have some great characters As we are led to believe that the film is about this spy operation in Cuba, we are also led to believe that John Vernon is our antagonist as well as Karin Dor is our heroine next to Stafford. These are great characters, but they are executed and dismissed the moment Stafford returns home. Instead we get a bunch of French suits, of which Philippe Noiret turns out to be the real villain. On Cuba, the film has a dramatic, flamboyant tone with colorful characters - in France, the color scheme is gray. It's simply a letdown.It's no secret that Hitch had to re-cut Topaz, due to a catastrophe test screening. When you see some of the edited material, including the two endings where at least one (the duel between Stafford and Noiret) is a far better one than the bleak ending in the finished film. The biggest mistake in the editing process though is the reduction of the relations between the characters. Dany Robin's affair with Noiret makes no sense, but if you know how deep the story of Robin\/Noiret\/Stafford goes it's suddenly A LOT more interesting. The same goes for Stafford contra Noiret, who are longtime friends which doesn't come out clearly in the finished film. In this context, Vernon plays out as a great on-the-side-villain and Noiret's character is given a lot of strength.Unfortunately, these crucial elements are basically abandoned in the finished film, leaving a strange and very unfocused film. Now, this comment deals with the flaws and not the upsides. In short, Topaz is a well-made film with good actors and a lot of typical, visual Hitch-stuff.

That's where the feature-length version eventually fails at a certain point it runs out of clever ideas and just keeps on going, hoping the protagonist's antics will be entertaining enough. Shame, because the first half of the movie may not be a comedy classic, but it is nonetheless very funny.The premise of the whole thing is Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) has mysteriously managed to get a job at the National Gallery in London. His colleagues can't stand him (hardly surprising, considering he's essentially a five-year old trapped inside an adult body),and since firing the guy isn't an option (the boss doesn't agree), they decide to get rid of him by sending him to Los Angeles, claiming he's an art expert who will comment on the Grierson Gallery's latest acquisition the portrait of Whistler's mother. Naturally, Bean knows absolutely nothing about art, or any cultural item for that matter; instead, he's a master when it comes to causing disasters, and he will cause plenty of them, putting the marriage and career of his host (Peter MacNicol) at risk. As long as he is around, L.A. is no longer a safe place to go.Like many other comedies featuring stupid people, Bean The Movie has no hidden message or subtext for the audience to detect; its sole purpose is to entertain, and as long as it stays within the main storyline it succeeds. What Bean does in that context may appear excessively surreal to some, but thanks to Atkinson, who believes in the character and treats him like a normal person, making the performance transcend pantomime, the gags are consistently funny and, in their own way, believable. Once the film ventures elsewhere, however, it feels like most of the jokes were padded on just to increase the film's running time. The entire last section is like this, and even the main actor seems to be going on autopilot in those bits. As for the supporting cast, MacNicol does a decent job (although his character's belief that Bean might actually be able to do good things becomes less convincing as the story proceeds), while the only real big name, Burt Reynolds, is given a cameo that can have been great on paper, but sadly doesn't allow him to do much on screen.So, genius or rubbish? I'd say somewhere in between watching Bean won't affect the viewer's life in any significant way, but the film is fun enough to justify a look on a boring afternoon.

Naturally, Bean knows absolutely nothing about art, or any cultural item for that matter; instead, he's a master when it comes to causing disasters, and he will cause plenty of them, putting the marriage and career of his host (Peter MacNicol) at risk. As long as he is around, L.A. is no longer a safe place to go.Like many other comedies featuring stupid people, Bean The Movie has no hidden message or subtext for the audience to detect; its sole purpose is to entertain, and as long as it stays within the main storyline it succeeds. What Bean does in that context may appear excessively surreal to some, but thanks to Atkinson, who believes in the character and treats him like a normal person, making the performance transcend pantomime, the gags are consistently funny and, in their own way, believable. Once the film ventures elsewhere, however, it feels like most of the jokes were padded on just to increase the film's running time. The entire last section is like this, and even the main actor seems to be going on autopilot in those bits. As for the supporting cast, MacNicol does a decent job (although his character's belief that Bean might actually be able to do good things becomes less convincing as the story proceeds), while the only real big name, Burt Reynolds, is given a cameo that can have been great on paper, but sadly doesn't allow him to do much on screen.So, genius or rubbish? I'd say somewhere in between watching Bean won't affect the viewer's life in any significant way, but the film is fun enough to justify a look on a boring afternoon.

This review is about an issue I always think about - how horrific was Kane to his country, his associates, and his intimates?Kane's personality is that of a man desperate to try to hold onto the affections of everyone who encounters him. He has had little real family life (as his mother - Agnes Moorehead - makes the blunder of taking him away from a somewhat drunken father - Harry Shannon - and giving his upbringing to a cold banker - George Coulouris). Kane understands what love is, but he has no way of concentrating his idea of it - he is uncertain if he is going to lose the affections of everyone.If he had been brought up properly he would have been able to do things more stably. Instead he keeps switching personality depending on whom he meets. He is the breezy young newspaper owner who is determined to shake up the fusty paper he bought (to the delight of Joseph Cotton and Everett Sloan, but to the dismay of old time editor Erskine Sanford). He is the crusading liberal in the face of banker Coulouris (as a way of evening scores, and of reminding the banker of how most of the public saw the rich in 1898). He is the young lover to his first wife (Ruth Warwick), but they grow apart. Frequently it is suggested that his first wife Emily was harmless. What is ignored is she's an anti-Semitic bigot about his close associate Bernstein (Sloan). Hardly a harmless type. She also is not very supportive about his political hopes.The most interesting problems about Kane's personal choices for popularity and love is the Alexander problems. He meets Susan (Dorothy Comingore) by sheer accident, and the simplest things breaks the ice between them. But Susan does not stop the affair, and it becomes the Achilles' Heel of Kane's run for Governor of New York. Boss Gettys reveals the relations of Kane and Susan, destroying the former's political career and his marriage. But nobody ever notes the following1) Kane was committed to political reform - to end the power of a crooked Boss. Emily's selfishness or anger in not sticking to Charles helps this crook retain power. It's hardly edifying conduct. 2) The public willingly drops supporting Kane in the election - their amusement enhanced by the scandal. But they too are saying they support a crooked Boss and his system. 3) Getty does tell off Kane about his pig-handedness, but this does not explain away his own willingness to use partial extortion (he offered to sit on the story of the love affair if Kane discovered he was too sick to continue running for Governor - the election is only a few days off!). Actually, despite Ray Collins' splendid handling of the role, Gettys is not an admirable character.The scandal also affects Kane's friendship with Jed Leland (Cotton). Cotton has already been suspicious when the Enquirer hires away the staff of the Chronicle in 1897. Bernstein makes a cynical comment that these writers can change their opinions to match their new owner's. Leland is not sure (but they don't change Kane's political opinions). When Leland hears about Kane's affair, he becomes a drinker, and he insists on working in Chicago - away from Kane and New York City. Kane really wanted him to remain. Later, when Susan tries to be an opera singer Leland begins a negative review (that Kane finishes). Kane does fire Leland, but tries to give him a large severance check (which Leland rips up). Susan is a small harpy screaming about Leland's review, and refusing to consider Leland a friend of Kane's (Friends don't do that!!, she screams). Kane was ripped apart by these two. Keep in mind, he did not have to marry Susan after the scandal broke - but he did make her his wife. It does not satisfy her. As for Leland, his father died a bankrupt suicide when Kane helped him out. He is certainly an ingrate.Susan is always denying that she wanted to be an opera singer. Certainly she lacks the voice or talent. But that does not prevent her from continuing a singing career once she divorces Kane. Who's actually lying here?Gradually the attempts to be all things to all people to keep their love just fails. Kane (at the start) is labeled a Communist by Thatcher at a Congressional hearing, and some spokesman at Union Square (addressing a labor rally) calls him - after a moment of spaced, uncertain waiting, a Fascist. Everyone calls him or looks at him as what they want to look at him as. What did he do wrong? He revolutionized newspapers. He helped promote the Spanish American War, and the Panama Canal. He helped elect Teddy Roosevelt in 1904. He stood for reform of political government in New York State in 1916. He also stood against the entry into World War I (a point many people to this day feel we should have avoided). He built an opera house in Chicago. His empire shrunk a bit in the Depression, but most remained in tact. His art collecting was outlandish, but it saved many precious items from destruction in World War II. And while he did AT FIRST support the fascist and Nazi leadership (as many prominent leaders and social figures did through 1936 or so), he later denounced them. Actually, Kane turns out to be a pretty useful citizen of the U.S. for his times, not such an ogre.Can a case be made that this flawed man deserved to be respected? Yes.

It was an era in film of lushly photographed dramas of another time and place, popular perhaps because many of us yearned for a simpler life and a return to some basic manners and standards. But these films also pointed up how much better women have it now, given the repressive ways women in earlier times were forced to live, and how often true love had to give way to convention.Beautifully orchestrated with Puccini operatic music from Gianni Schicchi and La Rondine, A Room with a View is a story set in Victorian times and concerns a young woman named Lucy, the petite Helena Bonham-Carter, who, while in Italy with her chaperone (Maggie Smith), meets George Emerson (Julian Sands). He falls madly in love with her, but unaccustomed to such boldness, she snubs him. Back home in England, she becomes betrothed to the tiresome, proper and erudite Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis). Then George appears on the scene again. The passion only evidenced in Lucy's piano playing begins to surface, and it frightens her.The story is told with both lightness and humor, and this intimate film is buoyed by wonderful acting. With her petite figure, magnificent head of hair, and a face full of expression, Bonham Carter is perfect as a confused and resentful young woman who doesn't know what's happening to her emotionally. Maggie Smith is brilliant as a troublesome chaperone who lives life by strict rules; Judi Dench is equally good as a novelist who lives in the exact opposite way. As George, Sands is a subtle yet ardent swain, and both Denholm Elliott as George's caring father and Simon Callow as the good reverend create marvelous, full characters. The chameleon, though, is Daniel Day-Lewis as Cecil, Lucy's skinny, snobbish fiancé. Each performance he gives is so drastically different from the one before - he is truly an amazing actor.The film is an allegory in its way for the passage from Victorian England to the Edwardian period, and it's clear that E.M. Forester had no use for the repressions of the day and celebrated a boldness of spirit. Both the repressed and the rebellious are perfectly represented in A Room with a View, a true Valentine to love.

He falls madly in love with her, but unaccustomed to such boldness, she snubs him. Back home in England, she becomes betrothed to the tiresome, proper and erudite Cecil (Daniel Day-Lewis). Then George appears on the scene again. The passion only evidenced in Lucy's piano playing begins to surface, and it frightens her.The story is told with both lightness and humor, and this intimate film is buoyed by wonderful acting. With her petite figure, magnificent head of hair, and a face full of expression, Bonham Carter is perfect as a confused and resentful young woman who doesn't know what's happening to her emotionally. Maggie Smith is brilliant as a troublesome chaperone who lives life by strict rules; Judi Dench is equally good as a novelist who lives in the exact opposite way. As George, Sands is a subtle yet ardent swain, and both Denholm Elliott as George's caring father and Simon Callow as the good reverend create marvelous, full characters. The chameleon, though, is Daniel Day-Lewis as Cecil, Lucy's skinny, snobbish fiancé. Each performance he gives is so drastically different from the one before - he is truly an amazing actor.The film is an allegory in its way for the passage from Victorian England to the Edwardian period, and it's clear that E.M. Forester had no use for the repressions of the day and celebrated a boldness of spirit. Both the repressed and the rebellious are perfectly represented in A Room with a View, a true Valentine to love.
