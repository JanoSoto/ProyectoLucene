After the bra-and-slip clad Leigh does some final cuddling with her shirtless man (didn't I tell you, risqué?)we learn that she is tired of being his lover on the down-low, as we would say today, and is getting anxious for him to make an honest woman out of her (in other words, marriage). But Sam is in tight financial times due to his ex-wife and doesn't want to marry Marion when he can't offer her a very comfortable lifestyle.Shortly after returning to her office, Marion is trusted with $40,000.00 cash given to her boss by a client, which she is supposed to deposit at his bank for him. After getting permission to leave the office early . . . well, she has the money there in her car with her, she and her man need it to start a real life together . . . you see where this is going. Marion is by no means a thief by nature or a hardened person, but this is more temptation than she can withstand. She heads to Phoenix to her boyfriend, imagining all kinds of conversations in her mind Her man's reaction when he sees her unexpectedly, her boss's reaction when he realizes that both she and the money he had given her are missing, not to mention the irate client  . . . I'll track her down, never you doubt it. I'll get that money, and if any of it's missing, I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh. Yikes! But Marion is in for a change of plan. You see, she's pulled off onto a back road and ended up at the Bates Motel, where she meets its proprietor, Norman, and (sort of) his Mother . . . .What can I say? Simply one of the most genuinely scary films ever made and perhaps Hitchock's masterpiece. The shower scene is a classic example of what you don't see is scarier than what you do. And Bernard Hermann's music? Please. The man was brilliant.Perhaps what chilled me the most, though, is the final shot. The look on the great Anthony Perkins' face is absolute genius. And, as another reviewer pointed out, if you look carefully, you'll see Mother's skull superimposed over her son's face before the final shot of Marion's car being pulled from the swamp.With all due respect to the equally great Sir Anthony Hopkins and his brilliant performance as Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates should have been named the greatest villain of all time.A final note - AVOID the remake. Nothing is on par with the original movie and the director added a couple of unnecessary and gratuitous touches (in the motel scene, Sam is completely nude, and in the peeping scene, Norman masturbates as he secretly watches Marion get undressed before taking her fateful shower - did we need to see THAT to understand that Marion had become the object of his repressed desire? I don't think so). The original, however, is a MUST SEE, whether you are a horror aficionado or not. Best watched on Halloween night, but friggin' creepy any day of the year. Cheers.

Aside from a very brief nude scene, it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in Africa that you'll rarely find in other films. It does bear a superficial similarity to OUT OF Africa, but without all the romantic fluff. The White French people in Cameroon are fascinating because they don't even seem to regard the natives as people. The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question. However, unlike real servants, you only once hear any of the Whites say 'thank you' and no other regard is given these people. Again and again, it's like they are pets or slaves, as the feelings of the people are never even considered. The central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother, Aimée and her servant, Protée. Although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other, the White woman never considers Protée or the existence of his feelings. A good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has Protée lace up her dress and it's obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this. Apart from this relationship, while almost all the Whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the Africans are people, a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage.Also interesting is the relationship between Protée and the little girl (who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film). While they are very close, at times he's more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children.There is one bizarre White character who seems, at times, to regard the Blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing. One moment, he's doing hard work along side the Blacks or eating with them (something the other Whites would never have done) and the next he's trying to beat up Protée! I could only guess as to what motivated him--perhaps he was just a jerk, or was crazy or perhaps was a Communist agitator trying to stir up the Blacks against the Whites (who knows!). In fact, other than a few good scenes, this character seems pretty much wasted.While I really enjoyed the insight this movie gave, I wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life. The context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more. The film appeared to begin in the early 1980s (since she's wearing a Walkman-style headset) and when the film went back in time, it seems that it was set about 1960 (more or less), but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti-colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s. I am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and SHOULD have made the beginning of the film earlier (such as the 1970s) and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s--before the country experienced political change.Apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods, using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea. And I also appreciated the ending, as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride. But overall, it just feels like something is missing--there just isn't any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel.

Even though it is considered a classic and Stewart being dragged through a fire is one of the greatest and most memorable scenes in movie history, it is not my favorite. In fact, it has the lowest rating in my opinion out of all five Stewart-Mann westerns. Even though I do like it a lot, and I watch it often, it is just not as good or have such a greatness in plot and characters as the other four do. But it does have the usual themes of revenge, cowardice, love, pride, and violence like the other four do. The intriguing thing about these films is that in every one, it has the same themes, but, under Mann's direction, each theme was presented a different way in every film. Problems that I feel need to be solved are the dispute of who killed Chris Boldt? Was the Indian shopkeeper involved with the plot about selling rifles to the Apaches? Was he the leader of the Indians that, at the end, came to get the guns? First of all, the person who killed Chris Boldt was Vic. This is clearly stated in the scene when Lockhart, Canaday, and Ms. Waggoman are all waiting in the parlor for news on Alec after the accident that he had with the horse. The doctor comes out of the bedroom, and it is revealed that Alec is blind, he had no business to be on a horse, and Lockhart deduces that the person who pushed Alec off the horse was also the person who killed Dave and Chris Boldt. Vic killed Dave, and he pushed Alec off the horse, so that means, according to Lockhart, Vic killed Chris. If this seems untrue to you, go back to the scene where Lockhart is in town, he walks down the alley, Chris jumps off a roof, tackles Stewart, tries to kill him with a knife, and then runs away. Obviously, he was not able to overpower Stewart, so he got scared. Then, Lockhart goes into the church, talks to Ms. Waggoman and her friend, and Vic comes in LATE. This pulled up an immediate red flag for me the first time I watched this. It seems Chris ran down the other end of the alley, met Vic, told him of his failure in killing Stewart, and Vic killed him. Besides, Vic seemed suspicious to me not very long into his first scene. He just seemed too good to be true. As for John War Eagle being involved with the plot about the rifles, I don't think he was as much involved as Vic and Dave were, but I do think he at least supported it, and he did seem not too happy when Lockhart was curious about the rifle in the store. I do not think he was the leader of the Indians at the end of the movie that came to get their rifles. Anyways, back to my comments. Another thing is that every time, Stewart always plays a very similar character, but he has different troubles and trials. One thing that is always the same (except for this one and The Far Country) is that Stewart always gets the girl, but before he can do that, that girl's boyfriend gets killed, and she realizes that she has loved him all along. In this one, she likes him, he likes her, and her boyfriend is killed, but Stewart cannot stay with her, because he has to get back to his post. A coincidence between this one and Bend of the River is that in Bend of the River, her boyfriend is Arthur Kennedy, and in this, her boyfriend is also Arthur Kennedy. This coincidence just shows how a great actor like Kennedy could play two different roles, with the same star, but not have the two roles be copies of each other, but instead, be mostly contrasted.

The intriguing thing about these films is that in every one, it has the same themes, but, under Mann's direction, each theme was presented a different way in every film. Problems that I feel need to be solved are the dispute of who killed Chris Boldt? Was the Indian shopkeeper involved with the plot about selling rifles to the Apaches? Was he the leader of the Indians that, at the end, came to get the guns? First of all, the person who killed Chris Boldt was Vic. This is clearly stated in the scene when Lockhart, Canaday, and Ms. Waggoman are all waiting in the parlor for news on Alec after the accident that he had with the horse. The doctor comes out of the bedroom, and it is revealed that Alec is blind, he had no business to be on a horse, and Lockhart deduces that the person who pushed Alec off the horse was also the person who killed Dave and Chris Boldt. Vic killed Dave, and he pushed Alec off the horse, so that means, according to Lockhart, Vic killed Chris. If this seems untrue to you, go back to the scene where Lockhart is in town, he walks down the alley, Chris jumps off a roof, tackles Stewart, tries to kill him with a knife, and then runs away. Obviously, he was not able to overpower Stewart, so he got scared. Then, Lockhart goes into the church, talks to Ms. Waggoman and her friend, and Vic comes in LATE. This pulled up an immediate red flag for me the first time I watched this. It seems Chris ran down the other end of the alley, met Vic, told him of his failure in killing Stewart, and Vic killed him. Besides, Vic seemed suspicious to me not very long into his first scene. He just seemed too good to be true. As for John War Eagle being involved with the plot about the rifles, I don't think he was as much involved as Vic and Dave were, but I do think he at least supported it, and he did seem not too happy when Lockhart was curious about the rifle in the store. I do not think he was the leader of the Indians at the end of the movie that came to get their rifles. Anyways, back to my comments. Another thing is that every time, Stewart always plays a very similar character, but he has different troubles and trials. One thing that is always the same (except for this one and The Far Country) is that Stewart always gets the girl, but before he can do that, that girl's boyfriend gets killed, and she realizes that she has loved him all along. In this one, she likes him, he likes her, and her boyfriend is killed, but Stewart cannot stay with her, because he has to get back to his post. A coincidence between this one and Bend of the River is that in Bend of the River, her boyfriend is Arthur Kennedy, and in this, her boyfriend is also Arthur Kennedy. This coincidence just shows how a great actor like Kennedy could play two different roles, with the same star, but not have the two roles be copies of each other, but instead, be mostly contrasted.

There is certainly much to be admired about the film, but I never made that emotional connection with the characters and events, constantly feeling as though I was merely an outsider staring in at a movie.

Nonetheless, rather than putting me off the director, '8½' has rather whet my appetite to see more of his films.The partly-autobiographical plot revolves around an Italian film director, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), who is supposed to be producing an epic science-fiction film but is experiencing a debilitating bout of director's block. At the same time, Guido is also battling momentous marital problems, trying (and failing) to sustain a working relationship with both his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aimée), and his mistress, Carla (Sandra Milo). With nervous producers constantly pressuring him from all sides, Guido is unable to cope with everything in his life, frequently shifting between reality, fantasies and vivid childhood memories.There are certainly many things to love about '8½.' The autobiographical element of the film was fascinating, and perhaps even an accurate depiction of the psychological barriers faced by a celebrated director whose every picture is expected to be a masterpiece.

When Alex and a group of students are thrown off the plane, to their horror, the plane does in fact explode. Alex must not work out Death's plan, as each of the surviving students fall victim. Whilst preventing the worst from happening, Alex must also dodge the FBI, who believe Alex caused the explosion.Actors The movie is defiantly a thriller, and is important for them to cast the right stars for the job. They really need to portray characters which are easily recognisable and can make you become emotional towards them. The stars chosen for this film are a good choice for the characters. The look of the characters fit well with how they are supposed to be acting. Kerr Smith as Carter Horton is a perfect example of this. He is portrayed as the meaner character of the bunch, and his looks and cocky attitude adds to this character.Music Like most recent horror flicks, the soundtrack is very dark and brooding. With this film it works very well, with the suspense. The music isn't used in the wrong way, which can often take away the scare factor. The film is more fun and scary when actions happen in a split second, rather than the music building up to something.

At this start point we have no frame of reference with which to judge this man, no way of telling what his motivations are. Through longer and longer flashbacks we are able to piece together all the moments that define his life, and through those, get a feel for the man, to follow his triumphs and tribulations.As we do so, everything feels smooth and well considered in all aspects of the picture. The pacing is relaxed but never unnecessarily so, and when it does suddenly jolt and change it still feels right, never forced and contrived. We see the way people change and grow in the same way the city around them does. Simple, honest motivations of childhood wealth are traded for conniving betrayals as Noodles and his mobsters reach adulthood.

The local police track the killer to a specific part of town & decide to warn Professor Warren (George Brent) who lives in a large house with his stepbrother Steven (Gordon Oliver), their sick mother (Ethel Barrymore) & various servants including a young mute woman named Helen Capel (Dorothy McGuire) who hasn't spoken in years. The police feel that the killer is targeting women with 'imperfections' & that Helen may be their next victim, as a huge thunder storm rages outside the killer is indeed intent on Helen becoming their next victim...Directed by Robert Siodmak this was apparently a bit of a hit when originally released back in '45 but it's also a film which hasn't really been that well remembered or embraced, personally I think it's well overrated & didn't think it was anything special. The script by Mel Dinelli was based on the novel 'Some Must Watch' by Ethel Lina White & alternates between a creaky murder mystery & dull soap opera. Most of the running time is spent on building the character's up, unfortunately it all amounts to very little & the last twenty odd minutes feels like any generic slasher flick as a woman tries to evade the attention of a homicidal killer. It may have been one of the first horror\/thriller\/murder mystery films but that doesn't automatically make it any good, I just found the melodramatics far too dull & lifeless while the horror mystery side of things don't fare much better as I thought the final 'twist' revelation was far too predictable. On a basic level it's watchable & a few things in it are quite effective but overall I just didn't like that much & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Siodmak does OK, there's some wonderfully atmospheric shots of the house in the darkness of night while a thunder storms rages on but are a few nice black and white shots of a house really enough to make The Spiral Staircase a classic? Or even a good film? I don't think so, but that's just my opinion & just about the whole world & it's brother seem to rave about it so what do I know? When it's good it's good but when it's dull it's dull.Technically the film is pretty impressive, the technology & techniques of today obviously weren't available back in the early 40's but The Spiral Staircase still looks good with very effective black and white photography.

It's a perfect blend of comedy and thriller.The plot of mistaken identity is one that Hitchcock used repeatedly in his films. In this film, James Mason and his henchmen mistake Cary Grant for a secret agent. They abduct him, grill him and when he maintains his position that he doesn't know what they are talking about, they pour a bottle of scotch down him, put him behind the wheel of a stolen car and send him on his way down a winding cliff road assuming that he'll be killed when the car runs off the cliff. It doesn't and for the rest of the film Grant is forced to be on the run both from the police and Mason's gang.Along the way he meets Eva Marie Saint on a train. Always fond of beautiful blonds, Hitchcock picked a doozy in Saint. She's absolutely gorgeous. The dialog in the seduction scene on the train between Saint and Grant has to be one of the most direct ever filmed up to its time. Once again, Hitchcock pushed the envelope for what could be done on film.The film features the justly famous crop duster airplane scene where Grant is chased in an open field. This film was the inspiration for the helicopter chase in the James Bond film From Russia With Love.The end of the film takes place on Mount Rushmore. Not actually Mount Rushmore because the park would not consent to actual filming on the monument. So Hitchcock had a giant set built and used matte paintings. The effect was, for its time, astounding and it still is impressive today even against all the CGI effects.As usual, Hitchcock gives layer upon layer to this film. Notice the titles which are projected on the side of a skyscraper and the angles from which it is filmed so the everything is on the diagonal. This diagonal motif is repeated constantly throughout the film in virtually every scene. Once you notice it you will not be able to ignore it, from the direction people walk, to traffic, to the angle at which rooms are filmed. It is not accidental and it reinforces the visual idea of the film which is always supposed to be headed in the same direction.Cary Grant shows why he was a movies star with his looks, personality, acting and his ability for being able to deliver both comic and serious scenes. James Mason, one of the world's greatest actors, is terrific as the villain.North By Northwest is one of the handful of films that deserve to be called great and it's a film that can be seen many times with new enjoyment and understanding on each viewing.A must see.

Of course it was a devastating flop at the box office, so many people didn't know what it was, or what it was about. But when a local Israeli radio station first played Gary Jewel's melancholy adaptation of the pop hit Mad World (taken from the movie's excellent soundtrack), the announcer spoke of a forgotten American film about a kid who encounters a vision of a giant bunny rabbit that tells him that the world is about the end unless he takes some severe actions to prevent it. This all sounded surreal to me, and I decided to do whatever is necessary to put my hand on a copy of the film, and see what it's all about. And boy was I hooked. Jake Gyllenhall, in one of his earliest appearances (long before he started to become somewhat annoying), is Donnie Darko, the haunted teen who takes the impossible burden of fixing the world on his shoulders. Shortly after the film begins, a jet engine falls from a plane and crash lands into Donnie's bedroom. After eluding this freak accident, a sequence of bizarre occurrences revolving Darko begins to take place. Darko is led by his bunny-friend, Frank, to wreak havoc on his home town, supposedly in the interest of saving them (or something). Alas, it is not quite clear who this Frank bunny is, and why Darko is the only person to see him. This whole hallucinatory film takes place during the 1988 presidential election, but if you notice the voices in the background, you'll notice something went wrong with the alternate reality Darko is living in, and it is not the 1988 many of us would remember.

I've watched it twice or at least tried to watch it twice. It just plain sucks. 8==>, thats what I'm talking' about. The only David Lynch I really have appreciated so far has been The Elephant Man. That was well done. This is an incoherent story and its f'ed up in a big way. The oozing liquid that pours out of the chicken grossed me out the first time I tried watching. I went a little farther in the film and then when the mutant baby came up, that was the last straw. I turned it off. Returned the DVD and didn't think twice about it. Until recently, when I went to my local video store and rented a bad quality copy on VHS. I got a little farther, but not much. At least I got to the part with the lady in the furnace, that was well, interesting to say the least. I couldn't take the part with the sick mutant baby, so I turned it off. Thats it, I've had it, I don't want to watch this movie anymore. One person wrote that this film is tough to stomach through, I agree, don't watch while you are eating. The movie is repulsive in its nature, but I guess thats one of Lynch's talents and I'll respect him for that. But what I don't particularly respect him for in this film, is his lack of story telling. It has great technique and you can clearly tell that he was thinking. But it doesn't fit together, it feels like a mi-sh mash of boring imagery thrown at the viewer from an obscure angle. Let me add that I love the Black and White photography, I still prefer Black and White, done well that is, not just for the sake of it. I mean don't get me wrong because I love personal films, just not this one. I love indie features because rebel nature against the Hollywood system. This film clearly finds its cult following with the midnight crowd. It has all the right ingredients to fulfill that boundary, and it does so with style, just not substance. Yes they are two different things indeed. An example of a movie with all style and not substance is 300, and I hated 300 more than Eraserhead. To even say that I hated Eraserhead would be mean, but I do feel that it doesn't quite live up to all the hype. So, occasionally I enjoy the big Hollywood boom blockbusters and maybe thats what I was in the mood for while trying to watch Eraserhead, its clearly my fault. But I have the courage to write this review of the film, therefore I must have something to say about it. Right. Well yea, I stated what I liked and didn't like, more or less Eraserhead has redeeming qualities, just not enough to out weigh an incoherent story. Like I said it's great for the midnight crowd, I just don't want to be part of that crowd tonight.

The Scottish locations, some of which are meant to be England, such as the famous opening scene where St Andrews stands in for Broadstairs in Kent and the London restaurant which is actually the Cafe Royal in Edinburgh, add to its appeal to Scots. But some say it is a very English film, with its Oxbridge educated gentleman athletes taking on the world. It is a good film although a bit overrated. It has also said it was a film for Thatcher's Britain, whatever that may mean. It certainly is very much a film of its time. It came out at the time when just about every new TV drama series on the BBC and ITV was set in the 1920s and 30s and it features two stalwarts of these series in its cast, namely Cheryl Campbell and Nigel Havers. There are, however, some rather unpardonable anachronisms in it. 1980s cars can be seen in quite a few shots and the ship that takes the athletes over to France has a radar mast. If the film were made nowadays the ship would be a CGI effect and the whole film would look a lot more realistic with the help of some CGI. But on the whole it is good although not quite all that it is cracked up to be. When it was made there were not as many films being made for the cinema, in fact it looked possible that the big screen would die out altogether, and this was one reason why it stood out. Another reason it stood out was that it depicted two decent upright guys. Mind you, I don't agree with Liddell's sabbatarianism, and the film's writer, Colin Welland, said he didn't either. But Liddell is portrayed as a surprisingly kind and warm man for a sabbatarian although after telling the boy off for playing football on Sunday I think he would have great difficulty in convincing the boy that God wasn't a spoilsport. It was sad that Ian Charleson died young like two other members of the cast, Brad Davis and Jeremy Sinden. A good film but very much of its time.

It was some fun to come back to it 15 years later. At this point I can see that there's a lot of humor in there, whereas as a younger person I took it very seriously. Verhoeven is a very good director, and this is one of his better films -- he is able to give us a film that is complex but at the same time not obtrusively so. You can kind of take and leave what you want from Verhoeven's glossy satire. Schwarzenneger's performance is one of his best, one of the only times he played an actual human being with anything like believability. A lot of times his physical mass prevents him from passing as normal, but here his stature just adds to the sense that something is wrong in the first place with him being this peaceful construction worker, and adds some irony to the fact that this man is made so helpless by the mental tinkerers at Total Rekall, a place where you can buy the memory of a vacation if you don't have time to take an actual trip.The violence is so extreme that it's at times sickening, but I just find it all humorous because I don't really take the movie all that seriously. A lot of people laugh when they hear that Phil Dick wrote the source story, but this film actually sticks a lot closer to its source material than Blade Runner or Minority Report or any of the other more respected Dick adaptions that I've seen. It's worth pointing out that while the moments of extreme violence in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner sometimes feel like arbitrary concessions to the action movie audience and don't feel fully integrated into the film's somber tone, Verhoeven's film is consistently giddy, turbulent, and fast, making the violence seem more natural to his film's glossy aesthetic.I think Ron Cox did some good work here but basically Michael Ironside stole the show as far as villains go. He's the definition of a loose cannon, so jealous of Quaid's (Schwarzenneger) connection with his gal Lori (Sharon Stone, appropriately feral) that he becomes a figure who's both sympathetic and terrifying. Rachel Ticotin is merely serviceable, rather underwhelming considering she's given a meaty role for the love interest in an action film.Special notice should go to the great Rob Bottin and his company for some of his most impressive animatronic work &#150; which is saying a lot. Maybe the effects are a bit aged now, but they are quality effects, and I predict that they will stand the test of time better than most computer generated effects films. This was one of the last big effects films to use only actual photographic elements for all its shots. It features an impressive matte\/miniature shot that takes us from the inside of a train to the Martian landscape and ultimately soaring above Mars' domed cities &#150; a shot that is very close to one that was planned for the beginning of Blade Runner but abandoned for financial reasons.As a Phil Dick adaption, it's an interesting case because even though as stated above the film sticks somewhat closer to Dick's original than most adaptions have done (Minority Report deserves particular shame for introducing the exploitative element of the deceased child), it is also the furthest in tone and feeling from Dick's work in some ways. It captures his paranoia about identity and memory control with great accuracy. Simply for communicating such a complex idea &#150; that a person's identity could actually be changed by artificial intelligence technology &#150; to the popcorn-munching millions (like my own former 15-year-old self). And in the end we have a film that is essentially a top-notch action film that's crossed over into The Twilight Zone. Schwartzenneger, whose 2 other best films IMHO were the similarly sci-fi flavored Terminator and Predator, must have known this, as he reportedly took a personal interest in the project before production began. He put his heart in the film in a way he never had before and never did again. For his part, Verhoeven returned to a similar turf in Starship Troopers, which was also a fun movie but perhaps not quite as much fun as this one or Robocop. So this is also a career peak for him as well.

Verhoeven is a very good director, and this is one of his better films -- he is able to give us a film that is complex but at the same time not obtrusively so. You can kind of take and leave what you want from Verhoeven's glossy satire. Schwarzenneger's performance is one of his best, one of the only times he played an actual human being with anything like believability. A lot of times his physical mass prevents him from passing as normal, but here his stature just adds to the sense that something is wrong in the first place with him being this peaceful construction worker, and adds some irony to the fact that this man is made so helpless by the mental tinkerers at Total Rekall, a place where you can buy the memory of a vacation if you don't have time to take an actual trip.The violence is so extreme that it's at times sickening, but I just find it all humorous because I don't really take the movie all that seriously. A lot of people laugh when they hear that Phil Dick wrote the source story, but this film actually sticks a lot closer to its source material than Blade Runner or Minority Report or any of the other more respected Dick adaptions that I've seen. It's worth pointing out that while the moments of extreme violence in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner sometimes feel like arbitrary concessions to the action movie audience and don't feel fully integrated into the film's somber tone, Verhoeven's film is consistently giddy, turbulent, and fast, making the violence seem more natural to his film's glossy aesthetic.I think Ron Cox did some good work here but basically Michael Ironside stole the show as far as villains go. He's the definition of a loose cannon, so jealous of Quaid's (Schwarzenneger) connection with his gal Lori (Sharon Stone, appropriately feral) that he becomes a figure who's both sympathetic and terrifying. Rachel Ticotin is merely serviceable, rather underwhelming considering she's given a meaty role for the love interest in an action film.Special notice should go to the great Rob Bottin and his company for some of his most impressive animatronic work &#150; which is saying a lot. Maybe the effects are a bit aged now, but they are quality effects, and I predict that they will stand the test of time better than most computer generated effects films. This was one of the last big effects films to use only actual photographic elements for all its shots. It features an impressive matte\/miniature shot that takes us from the inside of a train to the Martian landscape and ultimately soaring above Mars' domed cities &#150; a shot that is very close to one that was planned for the beginning of Blade Runner but abandoned for financial reasons.As a Phil Dick adaption, it's an interesting case because even though as stated above the film sticks somewhat closer to Dick's original than most adaptions have done (Minority Report deserves particular shame for introducing the exploitative element of the deceased child), it is also the furthest in tone and feeling from Dick's work in some ways. It captures his paranoia about identity and memory control with great accuracy. Simply for communicating such a complex idea &#150; that a person's identity could actually be changed by artificial intelligence technology &#150; to the popcorn-munching millions (like my own former 15-year-old self). And in the end we have a film that is essentially a top-notch action film that's crossed over into The Twilight Zone. Schwartzenneger, whose 2 other best films IMHO were the similarly sci-fi flavored Terminator and Predator, must have known this, as he reportedly took a personal interest in the project before production began. He put his heart in the film in a way he never had before and never did again. For his part, Verhoeven returned to a similar turf in Starship Troopers, which was also a fun movie but perhaps not quite as much fun as this one or Robocop. So this is also a career peak for him as well.
