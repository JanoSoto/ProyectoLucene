It's a witty delight from start to finish, with Monroe doing a delightful impersonation of a near-sighted blonde ashamed to wear glasses and always walking into walls; Grable as a snappy charmer who gets hooked into a trip to Maine thinking she's going to a convention; and Bacall as the know-it-all sophisticate with the sharp tongue who's good at bossing others around.While Bacall is great in the role, it's really an alienating part and she can't always disguise the fact that her character--in real life--would be considered an annoying bitch. True, she has some of the best lines, but the sarcasm stings a little too much at times and her treatment of doormen and furniture movers is very condescending.So, it's up to Grable and Monroe to keep things light and breezy, and that they do. Also on hand for some sophisticated charm is WILLIAM POWELL in one of his last screen roles, RORY CALHOUN as a forest ranger who attracts Betty's eye, and CAMERON MITCHELL as a man who turns out to be someone Bacall should have treated with more respect.It's fun all the way, easy to take and easy on the eyes whenever the three stars cavort around the screen in assorted fashion ensembles.

Perhaps it is my religious upbringing, but the sight of the nuns being coached by Whoopi Goldberg to integrate do-wop and Motown into their choir music never fails to tickle my funny bone. So it was with great pleasure that I looked forward to the sequel. Unfortunately, there is nary a laugh to be found. The original mined the material of watching the unlikely combination of a sassy Las Vegas wannabe singer inspire the zany cloistered nuns to irreverence. The sequel brings Goldberg back to the fold in a highly unlikely development and in place of the singing nuns we get...singing teens in another stale 'let's put on a show and save the day' scenario. Wow! How original and clever! This story was threadbare in 1930 and there is nothing funny about the kids in question. In fact, they are about as funny as an amputation. Overlooking the fact that there is literally no credible reason for the Goldberg character to leave behind being a Las Vegas headliner to help at a floundering inner city school, one could easily see some comedy being mined from Goldberg tackling the disrespectful teens. Instead, she plays straight man to a gaggle of unfunny kids. There are no classic Whoopi moments and she looks terribly bored. Also, why is she required to go undercover to teach these kids and keep her real identity from the male members of the teaching staff? It makes no sense. Nor does the fact that the world in this film seems to have undergone collective amnesia. Despite her character being on the cover of magazines and having entertained the pope in a media event, not only do none of the teens recognize her, but neither do any of the adults nor the male contingencies of the teaching staff. The film does come briefly to life when the nuns from the first film do a cameo number, but the main returnees such as Maggie Smith (I hope she was paid well), Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena are irrelevant. Even worse, when the lame-brained singing competition caps the film, you know the show is in trouble when ALL of the competitors seem better than the group you are supposed to be rooting for to win. A total mess akin to having dental surgery without Novacaine.

I have seen a lot of romantic movies about teen love, but this is the one impressed me the most! It is not just about love, you can find many things much more than that in this movie. My mind was heavy after watching this movie, i never expect such a movie to touch me so much. I did not cry, oppositely, i am very happy, because they experienced true love once in there life, and this is enough. Jammy not only changed London, but also me. I started to reconsider what i am doing now, what are my dreams, what is my faith. Anyway, highly recommend this movie, every teenager should watch it!

This movie was set in early 1929 during the academy awards (March?). Wyatt died Jan. 13 1929 at the age of 80. You do the math. Tom Mix was still a force in Hollywood. Tom's career was sliding with the advent of talkies. Tom & Wyatt did know each other & Tom was a pallbearer at Wyatt Earp's funeral in 1929. So some truth and a lot of fiction. I liked the brothel as history does say that there was one that used girls that resembled Hollywood stars of the day. So there was some truth to that part. I think the movie deserves better than 2 1\/2 stars that it gets on the movie guide.

This is different to me in the way that I feel when I am watching this. The lines are smart and some are kind of crazy and or senseless, but nonetheless, it seems to be not like all else. Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) and his crew, are planning a large heist. A nephew, of his crime partner(s) is sent as a sort of weird chaperon. Mickey Bergman's(Danny DeVito) right hand kid, Jimmy (Sam Rockwell), Sam plays the puke thief part to a prime role. Only this kid seems more of a liability than a part of the crew, which Joe is having to deal with. Bobby Blane, (Delroy Lindo) is a great partner in that he is down with Joe in whatever and follows the program well. 'Pinky' Don Pincus(Ricky Jay) is the 'switch' man and he is very good at his job. Slide of hand, out of sight and out of mind, before you know whats happened! From the jewelry store situation, to the 'workmen' at the airport, on the isolated runway, they move like shadows in a dark place. Joe, is undoubtedly the man, in that when you are a master planner and executor, you're not generally as 'easily swayed' by your emotions and poor planning.A 6.4 on the user rating this movie is set at a sort of different pace but it works well! That's why I rate it high! 10-10>> Recommended.(***) ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2007","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" This trio, was on top when they were together in Elmore Leonards 'Get Shorty' and now again another different great threesome.
