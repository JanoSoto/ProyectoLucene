This has masterful music, the score is perfect and beautifully done.

I can imagine many viewers being deeply emotionally affected by this. The language is strong as it gets, and plentiful. While there is not a lot of violence in this, it's filled with disturbing content. There is also graphic sexuality. This is not something to watch if you aren't already relatively hardened. The DVD comes with trailers and TV spots, two of each, deleted scenes with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them, during them, a couple of featurettes, and lastly, a commentary track with the director, and one with Matthew Libatique.

Were we are told the story of gevauden village and the beast that terrorizes it. Although the true species of he beast is never explained to us it is suggested to be ether werewolf, dragon or even the devil. Gregoire de Fronsac and his insisted Mohawk Indian brother are sent to this small village of peril to solve the mystery and capture the beast for it to be displayed in a museum in Paris. After a few distracting side stories that don't really go anywhere or serve much purpose it is eventually revealed that the beast is the pet of a large underground gang. The under ground gang, played by a selection of Harley-Davidson riding extras from the film wild hogs, are apparently lead by an elderly man and his daughter whose characters are given unusually few lines. Gregoire de Fronsac is shown to be a peaceful character during the film and is said to be a philosopher, a scientist and even a doctor. Gregoire is the type of person that uses carefully chosen words to discuss confrontation if unable to avoid a confrontation in the first place. That is until his Indian brother is killed in a secret base, no really they have a secret base. Gregoire goes on a Rambo style mission and breaks into their secret base, OK so maybe its not that secret, and begins killing all in his path. Its as if the director realized he had killed the ninja karate skilled character and thought ah... how do I put more kungfu in my film now that he is dead? then, after watching a couple of violent tom and jerry episodes he constructed this ludicrous fight sequence that builds up and builds up until... he just levees. He just seemingly walks away as another group of the goons come round the corner, perhaps the directors mother had popped in and said it was too violent and he was told to stop it straight away.The director, Christophe Gans, makes it very clear to us that Gregoires Red Indian brother Mani has severe anger problems. It seems that every scene Mani is in he starts fighting. This is not only wrong for the 15 year old children allowed to watch due to the low certificate given to it but it is also a crime against all martial arts films. Christophe gets so caught up in his genre greed he brutally abuses each and every one. None of them more abused than period drama. Christophe naively takes the period drama genre for nothing more than its fancy costumes and posh houses he doesn't even account for the change in language that would have occurred between present day and the bazaar 18th century in which this film was apparently set.Which brings me to the beautiful dialogue. Stephane Cabel is easily noticeable as one of the best writers of all time. That is unless anyone smarter than a rock with a face painted on it with any history of an education manages to apply pen to paper before time ends. I can only assume she has attempted the short and powerful approach and hoped to bring us such remember able lines such as Jesus wept. In reality there is no impressive quote I can give or any remarkable sentence that I will remember forever, well not in a good way. The one piece of dialogue I will always remember from this film is during a slight dramatic peak where two characters engage in an aggressive confrontation. Boundaries are crossed and secrets are reveled. One of the characters looks at the woman to his side and with all the emotion the actor can squirt through his dirty little face he says, with true sincerity, Go away. A textbook example of an anti climax. Something I became very knowledgeable of while watching this film.Although the film is set only in 18th century France we still see some interesting sights throughout the film. We are treated to rolling hills with lush green grass and perfectly ornamental rocks, extravagant French palaces filled with the finest gold pearl and ivory, but then things change. Its as if the director had a strong blow to the head which killed of the imaginative part of his brain. He gives up on searching for awesome and breathtaking locations and instead just uses the sets from previous successful films with vague interest in keeping the authenticity of the 18th century. Remember this is all still in France and yet we visit the Amazon set of Indiana Jones, the Newzeland forests of lord of the rings, the wondrous bamboo traps of skull island used in the film king Kong and I'm pretty sure at some point they travel through a wardrobe into a snowy fantasy land were they are asked by a lion to fight the ice queen.Did Christophe Gans take a brutal blow to the head? Was Christophe Gans a tragic sufferer of A.D.D? Is Christophe Gans an easily influenced director that makes his films purely out of nice bits he has seen from other films cloaked with a translucent veil such as period drama? The answers? Yes, of course. Would anyone with half a functioning brain honestly put his name on the cover of this DVD? With the bazaar decision for explosion noises when puddles are splashed and the tortes style decisions when it came to using the ghosting effects during editing it is easy to see that Christophe Gans honestly struggles to make a film of acceptable standards. I could write a joke here connecting Christophe Gans to the mental hospital on the outskirts of my town, making you think I'm smart and witty whilst at the same time making a mockery of Christophe Gans. But, there is no need, such a joke exist. Its name? Brother hood of the Wolf.

Like their kin the dolphins, there was just something magical and awesome about them just in their very presence that displays their astounding intellect and friendliness. So the movie Free Willy was right up my alley as a kid. Now nearing adulthood, and still fascinated with orcas, the movie does not strike with the same impact, but most of it is still remains and thus, I still thoroughly enjoy Free Willy. For those not familiar with the story, mainly meaning those who did not grow up in the 1990s, the film is about a boy in foster care (Jason James Richter) who upon committing vandalism at a local aquatic park near the coast is given the task of cleaning up his act. And during his visits, he befriends a captured and neglected killer whale (Keiko), whom he soon realizes is planning to be destroyed as a failure attraction. And before long, the story unfolds into just what the title hints an effort to free Willy.Looking again on Free Willy years after I saw it for the first time, I can still see the charm and majesty that had fascinated me in my youth. Director Simon Wincer's major achievement in this film is not trying to make it spectacular, but trying to make it cute and harmless and magical and although my opinion is merely divided amongst the rest of the moviegoers, I say he succeeded in all regards. I thought it was a very moving and touching story about friendship between this boy and this whale, both of whom are troubled, and the way that they struggle to save not only themselves, but also each other. And it doesn't carry away to the point where it seems like Willy the whale has become super-intelligent, but bases all of his motives on instincts. And at the same time, we feel sympathy for this six-ton, sharp-toothed denizen of the sea especially when we compare his massive size to the relatively small container that he's placed in, the rough treatment he's given, and when he cries for companionship.In regards to Willy, it's quite an achievement. As many know, in a lot of scenes, the whale was represented by Keiko, a real-life orca who actually shared many of his character's situations during his lifetime, and this adds to the genuine realism and the touching moments of the film. In other scenes, such as the rescue, Willy is portrayed by a well-realized animatronic and the two blend so well together it's impossible to tell which one is which. There is only once lapse in the special effects and that regards to the CGI whale that was used for the final scene in the movie and people familiar with the film should know what I'm talking about. The computer graphics in that shot, which was thankfully brief, was detailed but not convincing. Nevertheless, that's a minor fault in an otherwise impeccable special effects effort for an entire motion picture.What's also commendable is how the whale does not become the only interesting character or aspect in the film. Free Willy also has a great human drama story subplot to boast, to keep us interested during the scenes where the boy and the whale do not share the same shot. I liked Jason James Richter as the boy, and I especially liked Michael Madsen as the foster parent trying to serve as a father figure and also August Schellenberg and Lori Petty as some of the few friends that the boy and his aquatic friend have around them.Again, looking back on Free Willy and having read some of the criticisms leveled against it, the movie does not fascinate me with the same power that it once did some years ago.

Director Mark Pellington does an okay job of making this movie creepy but the lack of real scares, suspense, and a steady pace is what weighed this film down at least to me. The movie is supposedly based on true events about a Washington Post journalist who suddenly finds himself in Point Pleasant, West Virginia where sights of a moth-man like creature has put fear into the townspeople have been reported. Richard Gere and Laura Linney are good as the two leads bringing believability to their characters but even they can't help the flaws in this movie. Will Patton is impressive as one of the troubled townspeople but his role gets cut rather short. The same can go for Debra Messing as Gere's wife who does well with her small part in the film but like Patton she lacks screen time and development. The rest of the cast are decent in their roles but none of them stand out. The film was creepy mainly because of the moth-man but as to who or what it was are never explained so those hoping for answers to the mysteries of this creature or about the events at Point Pleasant are going to be disappointed. The movie was atmospheric adding to the creep factor but it lacked real scares. The scenes in which some kind of creature are briefly show were well done but there aren't too many of them. The drawings some of the characters would draw made you wonder if some kind of entity like the one being seen in the movie could actually exist or are the minds of the townsfolk just playing tricks on them. As mentioned before the questions raised in this film are never answered like; What the creature is? Is it good or bad? How did Gere's character get to West Virginia that's 400 hundred miles away in less than two hours? And why is this moth-man in Point Pleasant?

This confirms my admiration of the under-seen Ulrich, who's the doubting, conscience-stricken brother. His uneasiness stands out against the tedious good-old-boy jollity of the others. That shtick is a little too easy to do, and I don't think it gets the Twenties quite right, really. Rosenbaum is a great film critic but his end of the year recommendations are not always to be trusted, which makes you wonder about how written-in-stone his 1000 films list is. He also said that since the expansive images were a big part of the pleasure of the movie he didn't know how good it would be on DVD.Gosh, was it really so easy to rob a bank in those days? The way some of the robberies go makes it look like it was all a cinch, but surely they'd be scared sometimes because you still stood to go to jail for it, maybe for a good long time. Actually it was easy to robe banks with square-doored safes, and it isn't so hard to hold up a little bank today.This is surprising from Linklater not only because of the step into genre, but because of his willingness to glorify and simplify his good-boy\/bad-boy crew. Where are the tormented and confused guys of his stoner movies? Matthew McConaughey certainly does rise to the challenge with a spirited and enthusiastic performance, but all his moments are still clichés. Hawke similarly grins and giggles in a quite shallow way. His character is not well defined and D'Onofiro, arguably the best actor of the bunch, is wasted. Statistically the Newton bank robbers were remarkable, but Ebert may be right that they are less famous than Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde because they were too respectable, i.e., dull. The screenplay lacks an angle, other than the glib one of boys on a lark, which fails to convince, and even when things go wrong, lacks a tragic dimension.The action is desultory, lacking a strong focus on character or action or any guiding principle. Hence comparison with 'Bonnie and Clyde,' or more dashing adventures in the same vein like 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' or 'The Sting,' simply isn't really possible. This isn't in the same league. It utterly pales in comparison to European robbery films like 'Rififi' or the recent 'Mesrine' gangster epic starring Vincent Cassel. Only the few moments with Dwight Yoakam as Brentwood Glasscock, the brothers' explosives expert, provide a welcome 'Rififi'-like hint of bank-robbing as a challenging activity requiring certain skills and techniques.This is not to say you can't have fun watching. These young actors are in their physical prime, and that includes the ladies, notably the handsome-looking Julianna Margulies as McConaughey's girlfriend. The period flavor is sometimes ripe and tasty. The production is very good-looking, and there is some nice cinematography a silhouetted image of the mail train the Newton brothers are about to rob is particularly cool. The whole cadre things are set in, including the jaunty music, is conventional, but it's undeniably fun. The movie's a little long, but the climactic later scenes are involving.

Watching it, I found it far from funny. Everything that occurs in it is predictable and cliché, and not particularly endearing. It pokes fun at the clergy by having a clergyman protest against the theatre and its morality. Then, the screenwriters decide it will be great fun if the same clergyman reacts enthusiastically at a performance. It does not emerge as such. I'm quite surprised that Tom Stoppard, a fantastic playwright, has his name attached to this.Shakespeare in Love starts promisingly a hilarious presentation by a debtor to those he owes money to of an early storyline of Romeo and Juliet. Soon after, however, the constant references to Shakespeare's oeuvre become stiff and un-amusing. For instance, a clergyman yells a plague o' both their houses! referring to two rival theatres, which becomes a line in Romeo and Juliet. Not too bad? Well consider the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet being inspired by a similar encounter between Will and Gwyneth (alas, foiled by the Nurse, whose persistent calling for Juliet also makes it into the scene). Comic relief is soon provided in limited, spaced-out bursts (between the numerous sex scenes of course).Perhaps my negative view of Shakespeare in Love is influenced by a vendetta I have against it. The film did not deserve 1999's Best Picture award, which should have gone to either Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beautiful, or The Thin Red Line. It practically swept the Oscars with 7 wins, which often it did not deserve. Gwyneth Paltrow won the Best Actress award. Apparently, perpetually flashing fleeting smiles and flaunting one's breasts (literally&#x97; her breasts are probably shown about 13 times) are Best Actress qualifications. Judi Dench won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress&#x97; for about 10 minutes of screen time, where she does what the Queen does best (i.e. save the day), but without making the performance particularly memorable or endearing.And now for the redeeming qualities Shakespeare in Love undoubtedly had some fine music. The music was purely opulent and made many of the scenes watch-able. The film's strongest scene would have to be when someone (whose name I completely forget, but at the same time, couldn't care less) goes into the theatre where a rehearsal is taking place and a duel ensues with Shakespeare. Comically, musically, dramatically, and directorially, it is the film's most solid scene, and I briefly had hopes (which were mercilessly dashed) that the film might become good.And now for some acting criticism Joseph Fiennes is one of the most amateur actors I have ever had to endure watching&#x97; one of the poorest choices available for Shakespeare. Paltrow was bad enough where fleeting smiles were concerned&#x97; Fiennes makes her look like a genius. Ben Affleck plays&#x85; well, an Elizabethan Ben Affleck.The Verdict A mediocre film at best, Shakespeare in Love was over-hyped, and definitely did not deserve all those Oscars it grabbed. Its Best Picture win is a direct slap in the face to two of the greatest masterpieces ever made (and The Thin Red Line, which should'vie won SOMETHING that year&#x97; it's a very good movie!). Cliché, stale, and uninteresting, I swear I thought my brains melted about 40 minutes into the movie. An agonizing experience for the most part. Geoffrey Rush is the best part of the movie.Overall Rating 2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2009","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Shakespeare in Love purports to be a comedy about Shakespeare suddenly inspired by a love interest (with Paltrow), and the words begin to flow like never before.

Watching it, I found it far from funny. Everything that occurs in it is predictable and cliché, and not particularly endearing. It pokes fun at the clergy by having a clergyman protest against the theatre and its morality. Then, the screenwriters decide it will be great fun if the same clergyman reacts enthusiastically at a performance. It does not emerge as such. I'm quite surprised that Tom Stoppard, a fantastic playwright, has his name attached to this.Shakespeare in Love starts promisingly a hilarious presentation by a debtor to those he owes money to of an early storyline of Romeo and Juliet. Soon after, however, the constant references to Shakespeare's oeuvre become stiff and un-amusing. For instance, a clergyman yells a plague o' both their houses! referring to two rival theatres, which becomes a line in Romeo and Juliet. Not too bad? Well consider the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet being inspired by a similar encounter between Will and Gwyneth (alas, foiled by the Nurse, whose persistent calling for Juliet also makes it into the scene). Comic relief is soon provided in limited, spaced-out bursts (between the numerous sex scenes of course).Perhaps my negative view of Shakespeare in Love is influenced by a vendetta I have against it. The film did not deserve 1999's Best Picture award, which should have gone to either Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beautiful, or The Thin Red Line. It practically swept the Oscars with 7 wins, which often it did not deserve. Gwyneth Paltrow won the Best Actress award. Apparently, perpetually flashing fleeting smiles and flaunting one's breasts (literally&#x97; her breasts are probably shown about 13 times) are Best Actress qualifications.

I don't think that means anything good about Gary Oldman's relationship with his father. However, the film in question is one of the best films of the 90s. The stark reality of this film comes off all too strong and not forced at all.Ray Winstone has a talent of making his lines sound unscripted and improvised. It's so strange to watch him in NIL BY MOUTH. His character is simply a monster of a man, constantly drunk or high, constantly beating up the people around him, and ridiculing and harming his wife in increasingly extreme ways. The Charlie Creed-Miles character is a sad sap of a man. He's a thief, a skank, and completely untrustworthy, yet he's one of the most likable characters in the film.

Too bad that none of his movies really ever reached the level of greatness, though he has done his share of well known and appreciated movies. He was once considered to be the next Spielberg but this never really pushed through. Still he is a director who knows how to make a movie entertaining to watch, like he also showed with movies such as Innerspace and Small Soldiers for instance.He also often worked with composer Jerry Goldsmith, who with his Gremlins movies scores delivered one of his iconic works.It's a pretty simple and over-the-top crazy movie but its all good fun and entertainment for the entire family!6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2009","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" No matter what you think of the quality of the Gremlin-movies, they are still the best horror comedies, suitable for the entire family, around.

I hadn't heard of the film before tonight's screening, which surprises me because with JLo and Juliette Lewis and Fred Ward I'd have expected a higher profile. Anyway a measure of the picture's effectiveness is that although the subject matter isn't to my taste as a rule - 'another bloody woman's picture...' - I found myself unexpectedly drawn into the plot and very quickly cheering on JLo and her cutie of a daughter.I do have one reservation with this type of picture. It's a dislike of violent scenes involving very young children. It's obvious that for a lot of the participants the terror is real. 'Enough' was no exception either. Grace looked scared stiff during the fight in the hallway between the parents, in which we saw her knocked to the ground while trying to protect her mother, and if anything more so during the high speed car chase. I remember 'Cathy Come Home', a television docu-drama about homelessness made here in England over forty years ago. The scene where social workers struggle to part the runaway mother from her children and the hysterical sobbing of the bewildered youngsters has never left me. I just don't think film makers should involve them at that age. I just don't.A good film that keeps the tension ticking along at a healthy rate and constitutes a nice addition to English director Michael Apted's curriculum vitae. Do take it as entertainment however. We all know the propaganda value of film and television, but we are reading to much into it if all we require is a narrow 'women good - men bad' point of view. Most cases of domestic abuse we hear about concern violent men. That's not surprising given the current political bias. But remember too that a man wouldn't be seen dead admitting he lived in fear of the missus, so those that put up with violent females tend to bite their lip and keep quiet. By contrast women complain at the drop of a hat and are encouraged to do so at every turn.If anyone's interested I recommend the books by Erin Pizzey on this subject (she opened the world's first women's refuge in England in 1971, joined the feminist movement then promptly left when she realized it has been taken over by men-hating lesbians and assorted Marxist political fanatics). They are fair-minded and something of an eye-opener. 'Prone to Violence' is brilliant. It may still be available in second hand stores.
