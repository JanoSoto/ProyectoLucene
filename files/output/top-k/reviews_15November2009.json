When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action\/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more.Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker\/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect.Dunst (Mary Jane MJ Watson) was just okay though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair &#x96; of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin\/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume &#x96; I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit\/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man\/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red\/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt\/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger.Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry &#x96; though he's got the Dr. Jekyll\/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain Bullseye. You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books.The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes.Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow.So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth.

Gosh, he's so darn reckless that Riggs! You'd think writer Jeffrey Boam (Lethal Weapon 2, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) would stop leaning so hard on blanket personality descriptors of the characters. Anyway, the two get demoted to street duty where as luck would have it, they witness criminals taking something in an armored truck. They end up getting wrapped up in a major LAPD case involving an ex-cop stealing tons of automatic guns and selling them to gangs and such.The story never captures the full scope of what's going on.

Rene Russo also joins as the martial arts-savvy Internal Affairs sergeant whom Riggs gets the hots for, naturally. Just the mere technique of throwing in a love interest cop for Riggs to get serious about (which he does to not believable effect) is offensive to those who have a sense of what effort a sequel needs to make to be any good.Apathy would be the best way to describe the way one receives Lethal Weapon 3. Whereas its predecessor was infinitely more imaginative and impressive as a sequel, the horse needed to complete this trifecta was too similar and just dressed up to look different.

Do we again put the onus of blame on Dino himself? The man whose probably brought us more high budget B-movie trash than American International?Err.. yes and no. Flash Gordon is an American creation. Created by Americans, for Americans, with an American mindset. A smart high society athlete, America's best, is pitted against the sinister mettle of Ming the Merciless, whose fiendish plot is domination (if not destruction) of the planet Earth.The original Flash Gordon was primitive where special effects were concerned, but the stories themselves really moved. They captured the thrill of true adventure, only instead of the darkest reaches of Africa, or some far off exotic Orient setting, we were taken to a different world (albeit with a somewhat Asian flavor). There was drama, daring- do, close shaves, feats of rescue, and even some hi-jinx. When the original Flash Gordon series ended, the Queen of Mars was introduced to revive the serial. Once again Doctor Zarkov and Dale Arden assisted Flash Gordon in thwarting the diabolical machinations of the would be ruler of the universe. Flash Gordon was popular for a reason. It captured the imaginations of the young theatre goers, and was truly a spirit of Americana.So why in the world would a third-string B-movie director try his hand at recreating the magic of Flash Gordon, and give the project to someone who had one-good film under his screen writing belt, with the rest being utter flops, no-names, or otherwise disasters? I speak of none-other than Lorenzo Simple Junior who, by HIS VERY OWN WORDS ON THE FEATURETTE on the collector's edition DVD, (and I kid you not if you haven't seen it), STATED that Flash Gordon was an Italian comic book creation.Oh my.Okay, let's set the way-back machine for the early-mid 70s, and George Lucas has come off a couple of successful films, and is looking to pitch another idea. Initially he wanted to update Flash Gordon, but King Features, the scourge of Intellectual Properties that they are (and always have been... and probably always will be) either denied him the opportunity, or asked for way too much money to get the project done.Ergo, Lucas's fertile imagination trumps both King Features and their Flash Gordon property by creating his own space opera saga. Now... what was it? Oh yeah... Star Wars... whatever happened with that? ;-)Meanwhile, King Features suffers the results of their own stupidity, and tries to revitalize their missed opportunity by letting the biggest B- movie mogul have a whack at Flash Gordon.Oh my... again.You know, I have to admit, I find the 1980 color version a guilty pleasure in kamp cinema. I really do. Max Von Sydow, ironically enough, is the perfect Ming the Merciless for an updated Flash Gordon feature, but the story telling, the SFX (even for a silly-respin) are just plain awful and insulting.In short, Lorenzo Simple and Laurentis did to Flash Gordon what the Salkinds did with the Superman sequels.

But these morons beat a broken horse neighing on the proverbial cobblestone road until it was dead.

What kind of sociopathic creature stoops that low to wantonly and ignorantly destroy beauty, and by this I mean Flash Gordon. Who? Simple Jr and de Laurentis, that's who. And I'll toss in the Salkinds in there as well for good measure.Flash Gordon, Italian?Huh?Well, Three Days of the Condor it ain't, and even then I'm sure Simple's contribution was probably to format the script pages and nothing more.In short, give this one a pass as a serious film.

Heck, everyone else has.

I'm not done with film. Luck willing, I'll be back in the business of making films and pitching a series.But enough about me. Let's talk about the travesty of the 1980 Dino de Laurentis B-movie sci-fi retelling of the old Flash Gordon serial. Who do we blame for this careless execution in abysmal styling of cinema? Do we again put the onus of blame on Dino himself? The man whose probably brought us more high budget B-movie trash than American International?Err.. yes and no. Flash Gordon is an American creation. Created by Americans, for Americans, with an American mindset. A smart high society athlete, America's best, is pitted against the sinister mettle of Ming the Merciless, whose fiendish plot is domination (if not destruction) of the planet Earth.The original Flash Gordon was primitive where special effects were concerned, but the stories themselves really moved. They captured the thrill of true adventure, only instead of the darkest reaches of Africa, or some far off exotic Orient setting, we were taken to a different world (albeit with a somewhat Asian flavor). There was drama, daring- do, close shaves, feats of rescue, and even some hi-jinx. When the original Flash Gordon series ended, the Queen of Mars was introduced to revive the serial. Once again Doctor Zarkov and Dale Arden assisted Flash Gordon in thwarting the diabolical machinations of the would be ruler of the universe. Flash Gordon was popular for a reason. It captured the imaginations of the young theatre goers, and was truly a spirit of Americana.So why in the world would a third-string B-movie director try his hand at recreating the magic of Flash Gordon, and give the project to someone who had one-good film under his screen writing belt, with the rest being utter flops, no-names, or otherwise disasters? I speak of none-other than Lorenzo Simple Junior who, by HIS VERY OWN WORDS ON THE FEATURETTE on the collector's edition DVD, (and I kid you not if you haven't seen it), STATED that Flash Gordon was an Italian comic book creation.Oh my.Okay, let's set the way-back machine for the early-mid 70s, and George Lucas has come off a couple of successful films, and is looking to pitch another idea. Initially he wanted to update Flash Gordon, but King Features, the scourge of Intellectual Properties that they are (and always have been... and probably always will be) either denied him the opportunity, or asked for way too much money to get the project done.Ergo, Lucas's fertile imagination trumps both King Features and their Flash Gordon property by creating his own space opera saga. Now... what was it? Oh yeah... Star Wars... whatever happened with that? ;-)Meanwhile, King Features suffers the results of their own stupidity, and tries to revitalize their missed opportunity by letting the biggest B- movie mogul have a whack at Flash Gordon.Oh my... again.You know, I have to admit, I find the 1980 color version a guilty pleasure in kamp cinema. I really do. Max Von Sydow, ironically enough, is the perfect Ming the Merciless for an updated Flash Gordon feature, but the story telling, the SFX (even for a silly-respin) are just plain awful and insulting.In short, Lorenzo Simple and Laurentis did to Flash Gordon what the Salkinds did with the Superman sequels. They trashed them until the properties became parodies of themselves.At some point money really needs to be thought of as an investment into a product that needs to thrive to create more money. But these morons beat a broken horse neighing on the proverbial cobblestone road until it was dead. What's worse is that they did it with a smile, and claimed utter success, EVEN AFTER TRASHING THE VERY THING THEY WERE TRYING TO HONOR.Wow. How low do you have to be?

Johnny Depp brought great character to the Burton movies. Ed Wood is one of them. This movie is Burton's vision on the life of, what people said to be, the worst director of all time. Ed Wood made some of the strangest films of the 1950's. These include Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and the one movie he was known for, Plan 9 from Outer Space. The cinematic shots in the film make one feel as if it is an old film. The movie is shown in black and white, so it really sets the mood in the time period. The casting in this film, aside from Johnny Depp, is superbly picked. Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi brings the character to life with his elderly enthusiasm. Half the time one forgets that he is not Bella Lugosi. Landau's performance as Bella Lugosi won him an academy award for best supporting actor. And he defiantly deserved it. The music in this movie is phenomenal. Some of the music was from some of the Ed Wood movies, and it replicates the quirkiness of an Ed Wood film. Jeffery Jones makes an appearance as Criswell, presenting the film in a host-like presence introducing the life of Edward D.

Even when one knows that he was the worst director of all time, one feels a sense of importance in Johnny Depp's character. He is eccentric but sympathetic. He felt his work was important, even though others did not. Whenever Ed Wood finished one of his movies, he felt that he was a true success. The relationship with Ed Wood and Bella Lugosi starts out with a meeting of two strangers, then their relationship grows as Ed Wood gives Lugosi a second chance at stardom. Ed Wood builds strong relationships with his fellow actors, a girlfriend respects his transvestitism, and his fetish for angora sweaters. The movie makes the characters human, that's why one feels great sympathy towards them. The editing in this film is fantastic.

I remember seeing the ads for this movie before it was released, and even a well-polished advertising campaign could not hide the schlockiness of it all.The dialogue is completely forgettable, the plot is thin and obvious, and even if you can suspend your beliefs and assume that an Apple laptop computer can do all of the stunts that Jeff Goldblum's character's computer can do and that a crop duster suffering from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (Randy Quaid) can learn how to fly late 20th century state-of-the-art military planes basically by instinct, there is one final piece of posturing that is too much to take. Never would the President of the United States both endanger himself and allow himself to become a spectacle by putting on a flight suit and piloting a plane in a time of war ... Oh, yeah, I almost forgot about that incident 7 years ago...oops...my bad.The reason I am even giving this film 4\/10 is for one, the special effects are impressive in a movie that has precious little else going for it. Secondly, and most of all, the only thing that makes this movie remotely watchable is Will Smith. Even with what the writers\/directors give him to work with he steals the show.

It's a privilege of youth I think this quote may best summarize Fandango, which gives much to think about, also in comparison to what is considered the first of all road pictures, Easy rider. The myth and the out of time fashion of these road trips along US highways, still today pulsing with sense of liberty, is an element of attraction for the public of every time, mainly if accompanied by some good and emotionally powerful music. Easy rider was set in the 60's, when the myth of liberty was at its height, it was the celebration of the hippie era, of an ideology and watching it after 40 years, conveys a sense of tenderness towards the ingenuity of these bikers going nowhere, believing in freedom from all constrictions but unconscious of what they were really looking for. Fandango is set in 1971 but shot in 1985, US and universal history have taught a lot of things, and what is evident there, mainly in contrast with Easy rider, is the deep consciousness of these mates, they perfectly know what they are looking for, they want to escape from what is hanging over their future lives, knowing that the myth of life on the road has lost all credibility. It is more a celebration of youth, of an age when you think that friendship and fun will last for ever, but you know that time must come to an end, and you need to do something, in this case an unforgettable road-trip, in order to postpone that end and escape from the forthcoming adulthood. Fandango, although extremely funny, almost irreverent, in situations and dialogues, leaves traces of deep nostalgia, and melancholia, pervaded as it is by such fear about life, in terms of responsibility, burdens, troubles. The skydiving adventure meant as the most extreme searching for life, and a desperate way to exorcise the coming of adulthood, is the most effective moment of the movie. Fandango shows some clichés, which however are part of this kind of movies, it is deeply American in the passionate way it celebrates life, freedom and the feeling of being born to be wild, through a strong visual impact. However, it is undoubtedly entertaining, moving, thought-provoking, and emotionally engaging really worth seeing, at least only for the wonderful locations, which frame very good performances, mainly a young and deserving Kevin Costner.

He witnesses the assassination of a prominent Dutch leader but then discovers this was a doppelganger, falls in love with Carol Fisher, a peace envoy, and traces the conspiracy back to Carol's father ! What's a poor guy to report ?This was Hitchcock's second Hollywood picture (after Rebecca) and he clearly relished in his newfound resources, turning in a film filled with action, humour, romance, suspense, intrigue and even some potent social commentary. The movie globetrots from New York to London and Holland, and we get a car chase through windmill country, a flight across a hotel rooftop, a love scene on a storm-tossed ocean liner, a failed assassination atop Westminster Cathedral and an astonishingly realistic plane crash in the ocean. These are all sequences which would be tough enough to shoot with today's technology never mind seventy years ago, but Hitchcock's camera is everywhere, documenting the action and generating whatever emotion the scene requires; there's one left-to-right tracking shot through the fuselage of the crashing plane which I think is one of the most staggering in all of Hitch's work. The cast are sensational, with the prolific McCrea at the top of his game, Day a fine romantic foil, Marshall (the star of Hitch's earlier Murder!) great in the quisling turncoat role and Sanders for once playing a good guy action hero. The film is almost stolen however by two supporting players - Gwenn as the cheerful elderly killer Rowley, and Benchley as Stebbins, the hack columnist with a tendency towards various vices. Benchley (father of children's author Nathanial and grandfather of Jaws novelist Peter) was a great writer\/performer and member of the noted Algonquin Round Table, and he contributed much of the amusing dialogue to the movie; when McCrea confesses his undying love to Day on the voyage back from Holland and she instantly reciprocates, he quips, Hmm &#x85; that cuts down our love scene down quite a bit, doesn't it ?. Hitch also had some powerful collaborators on this picture, notably independent producer Walter Wanger (Stagecoach, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers), cameraman\/director Rudolph Maté (Vampyr, D.O.A.) and designer\/director William Cameron Menzies (Gone With The Wind, Invaders From Mars), and the look of it is just sensational. Extremely well scripted by Charles Bennett and Joan Harrison, with almost every scene packing a punch - a great early Hitchcock thriller.

The film will cover so much ground in terms of the flicking between genres; grounded content; off-the-wall content and tacked on character development that it just all fuses together and comes away somewhat of a mess. With hindsight, we can all say that films like O Brother, Where Art Thou? represent one of two different sorts of films the Coen's have in them; some of their best pieces of work are restrained, looming, ominous and quite grim. However, they have this tendency to throw these sorts ingredients out the window from time to time, and just come up with 'stuff' (and I do mean 'stuff', in inverted commas) that's wacky; carefree; loud; trying too hard to be funny and just generally obnoxious.O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one of those films; a film that'll shoot all over the place with absolutely no shame whatsoever, encompassing musical numbers; bank heists; a general sense of chase as they run from authorities as well as an electoral campaign running on a separate equilibrium. Between the film beginning and ending, some pretty far reaching material will have unfolded within a pretty small proximity of area. The unfortunate thing is that we're never given a chance to take any of it in and we're never given much of a chance to pause and reflect. The film is in so much of a hurry to shift onto the next 'funny' or 'quirky' encounter with the next misfit that none of film's character's encounter hold any sort of dramatic weight, and thus, do not add up to anything. A little of O Brother, Where Art Thou?'s approach goes a long way.On paper, the film should've worked a lot better than it did a Coen Brothers film about three escaped convicts in 1930s deep south America running from the law in the hope to un-earth some self proclaimed 'treasure' hidden out there somewhere, only one prisoner of whom knows its whereabouts. The additional catch is that they only have a few days to find it because where it's buried will be flooded shortly. Yes, Yes, Yes - hand me that premise in the hands of these two guys and I'd lap it up anytime, any-day. But somewhat annoyingly, what we get is a hodge-podge of a piece, a stumbling and fumbling picture attempting to create comedy out of a young man's simplistic mindset; a film that uncomfortably straddles the line between realism and escapism with its all-too coincidental chance encounters and general outrageous content blended in with its sharp attention to the three guys throughout as they need to change clothes, find food, garner money, discover places they can safely rest and be able to maintain a consistent speed of travel in whatever capacity.The three men out and on the run are Tim Blake Nelson's Delmer; John Turturro's Pete and another individual named Everett (Clooney), whose authoritarian presence dwarfs the other two somewhat by being the one claiming to know where the loot from a raided armoured van is hidden. Their road-movie inspired journey is introduced somewhat obviously, and somewhat crudely, by a camera shot which begins on ground level by a railway track before shamelessly craning upwards to encompass a the rest of the single railway track going off into the distance, thus informing us of the singular line voyage these leads will go on. This occurs mere seconds after some kind of prophetic blind man lays out the long and spiritual journey the characters are to go on from here. It's all very self-aware, all-very post-modern and all very silly.But what of the journey? For a film to adopt that singular line strand narrative arc, what happens certainly unfolds in the crudest and elementary of fashions. I don't think there's much sense that these characters have progressed an awful lot from the point their journey begins to the point the film rounds everything off. The Coen's play a couple of wild-cards to create the illusion that the characters do so, one of which occurs very early on when a local Christian congregation are baptising people in a river and two of the stow-away prisoners take up the chance to supposedly rid themselves of sin. But this is a stark and jarring occurrence that takes the character from one extreme item to another; the film's in a rush, and rather than allow these guys to bond and figure things out for themselves in terms of who they are and what they ought to be doing in life, one scene very early on prematurely thrusts certain leads from criminal\/ex-prisoner to apparently reformed citizen.A lot of the quest can unfold in any order it likes; there's no flow or consistency to any of these guy's mis-adventures. An encounter with some sirens; a coming across a one-eyed conman; interactions with a bank robber; some altercations with the police &#x96; it's all loud, garbled nonsense and can unfold in any order you want it to while I found some of these wacky and outrageous encounters further pull me away from the focus of the leads and their supposed goal of finding the loot. Twinned with this is a somewhat disturbing overtone of gun-play, or gunfire made funny. Early on, a shotgun wielding kid will provoke a would-be humorous encounter with the criminals trying to get back on their feet; bank-robber Nelson's (Badalucco) eccentric attitude as he fires off Tommy Gun rounds I'm sure spawns a few laughs amongst others, while the exploding ammunition in the police truck probably does the same thing. But by the time a certain rug has been pulled from underneath us linked to the premise, and we've had a series of country and western warblings; I think we're just about ready for O Brother to end.

Early on, a shotgun wielding kid will provoke a would-be humorous encounter with the criminals trying to get back on their feet; bank-robber Nelson's (Badalucco) eccentric attitude as he fires off Tommy Gun rounds I'm sure spawns a few laughs amongst others, while the exploding ammunition in the police truck probably does the same thing. But by the time a certain rug has been pulled from underneath us linked to the premise, and we've had a series of country and western warblings; I think we're just about ready for O Brother to end.

While incognito, she falls in love with an American newspaperman, Joe Bradley. When Bradley learns of Ann's true identity, he finds himself torn between following his nose for news--and turning her into a big story--or the growing affections of his heart.ROMAN HOLIDAY, for me, is what I would call an ideal romantic comedy. Everything in here is utterly delectable and almost perfect with a few minor flaws here and there. I found the plot to be perfect for a romantic comedy. It's almost like a mix of THE LAST HOLIDAY and HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS but, in this case, the girl is naive on what's going on around her. I also like the story because it has the theme of do what you like before you won't ever do it at all. The film asks the question Would you sacrifice your reputation to do what you would love to do despite that you're not supposed to?I also found some of the clever lines very witty and the movie funny. Also, the location of the film is really great. You're being put right in the middle of Rome. The performance by Gregory Peck is weird to describe by me. I could never get PAST his serious role in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, which is one of his most well known roles in his acting career. In here, he plays a very charismatic and comedic role. He plays alongside Audrey Hepburn, who also does a great job as the naive princess who's blatantly unaware of the scheming plot going on around her, which I actually thought was sweet. Eddie Albert also did a pretty great job as Peck's companion.When the ending credits rolled, a huge smile spread across my face. I really wasn't expecting this great of a movie. I found very little things to complain about because almost everything in here, in my opinion, is irresistible. Peck and Hepburn have a great chemistry together, which you can especially see in the last few shots of the film. ROMAN HOLIDAY is actually one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in my life because it's my ideal romantic comedy. Funny, romantic, and with a bittersweet ending, you should give this at least one watch before you die. After all, it's a classic for a reason.

This woman, Joan Webster, played by Wendy Hiller, is off to Scotland to marry some guy she obviously doesn't know too well. We know this ourselves because she has dinner with her father the night before she's scheduled to leave for the Hebrides. Her father tries to tell her to slow down and think about it but she KNOWS WHERE SHE'S GOING. (She doesn't scream it, as implied by the caps. But she might as well have. The setup is movie perfection.) Joan has these directions to the island on which this guy has planned to marry her. She has to take the train from London to East Bumshoe, then another train from Bumshoe to Overloafen, a bus from Overloafen to Pudgydubby, a cab from Pudgyduddy to Shaddycrack, the ferry from there to some other weirdly named town, then the water taxi to yet another Scottish backwater, and finally a private skiff to the island. Unfortunately, when she gets there, it's thick of fog. Swirling, smoky, impenetrable fog. Fog like you won't believe, unless you live in Scotland or Great Britain or Maine, like I do. Or you own a Hollywood fog machine, or work in a Russian spa, or live next door to Sherlock Holmes. You get the point. So she can't get to the island. She has to stay at someone's house with a bunch of other people who are similarly stuck. At this point, we're only about five minutes into the film, which is just more of this movie's magic, because it's here she's dealt the classic Call to Adventure of the hero's journey. She meets a man, and not the one she's supposed to marry. The man is Torquil Macneil, played by Roger Livesey; he wears a kilt and speaks in a heavy Scottish brogue, and although he's not exactly the most handsome leading man you ever saw, he does wear a kilt and speak in a heavy Scottish brogue, which makes him, apparently, very hot. Don't get me wrong, he's always the perfect gentleman. It's 1945 for God's sake. Later that day, feeling rather threatened by this charming kilt-wearing Scotsman, she tries once again to get the boat to the island. She's told it's way to foggy but as soon as the wind comes around northwest, the fog will lift and they'll be able to go. That night, Joan, while lying in her bed at the Inn, prays for wind from the northwest. In the morning Joan wakes to find her prayers answered. The fog has cleared. Unfortunately, it's because of a full blown northwest gale, which ends up sticking around for more than a week. She never makes it to the island. This special gem of a movie is the product of one of the most creative collaborations in movie history, that of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. They had a gift for storytelling that is almost gone. Very often when you see a film today you're struck by inconsistencies, failures of logic, plot holes, gimmicks, etc. Or you're faced with a movie that just doesn't come together. Not the case with Powell and Pressburger films. Their movies have perfect structure; they engage you, keep moving toward a goal and wrap up all neat and tidy. If you ever see this one on the video rental shelf, grab it and take it home. I guarantee you won't be disappointed, especially if you're trying to score some points in the romance game.

Sometimes the synthesized voice in this movie captured that, but generally it was too heavy.

Tommy is seen by many music critics as their best album, an important concept album which influence future albums like The Dark Side of the Moon and American Idiot. It became a Rock Opera and that Rock Opera was turned into a film directed by Ken Russell.The film tells the story of Tommy (Barry Winch\/Roger Dalton) who as a young boy sees his mum and step-dad having sex which results with becoming blind, deaf and dumb. His mum (Ann-Margret) becomes extra devoted to her son. Tommy ends up showing that he has a talent for playing pinball, despite his disability. His step-dad (Oliver Reed) uses him to make the family rich. After Tommy miraculously regains his scenes he ends up becoming cult figure with people wanting to know his secret and help them.The album of Tommy is great and I recommend people to listen to it. It is very dark and a wonderful example of The Who's music. But as a film it doesn't translate well. They is a good beginning showing the love between Tommy's parents which is well handled and doesn't need dialogue. They is a basic plot, but a lot scenes in the film are just play like a bunch of music videos. Examples are the scenes involving the Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard and Sally Simpson. Even in musicals, such as Sweeney Todd, they are still scenes of normal dialogue, or play the song as a conversation. But this film basically played and song the songs for most of the time, making the audience feel devoid from the action on the screen. There were only small motions where the audience could engage. Some of the actors\/singers were poorly casted, Oliver Reed is the best example with his poor vocals. Tina Turner was another poor choice. The directional of Ken Russell also felt like he had been taking psychedelic drugs. There are some positives. Obviously the music is brilliant it is The Who. I also did enjoy Ken Russell's direction when it was more down to Earth and grim, so mainly in the beginning.But sadly this is really a random collection of bits rather then a real film.

I understand Walt however, Pinocchio and Fantasia were expensive and were not exactly box-office hits, so he had to keep it short and cheap, and anyway, it is great never the less.I can't believe my dad thinks this film is boring-It's just so sweet! It's sad in parts, yet there is humour, and parts just make you go 'Aww'.There's one scene I just can't stop laughing at-When Dumbo and his mouse friend, Timothy, get drunk. Really, it's too funny! But I won't spoil it, but I will say, wow, kids films back then could really get away with anything! So, Dumbo is a terrific Disney film. No doubt!

I've learned nothing but a simple lesson, You get busy living, or get busy dying. We all can be busy, but which one are we? Hope is the only weapon for us to reach the state of get busy living. Very great movie, and d most inspiring after all. I pray that all people who are facing the most toughest moments will have hope that God will guide to lift their state of busy dying (living in that moment) to...the wonderful Get busy Living!!It is about the lesson. Now talking about the film making; Mr. Robbins was cool, very well act his role. I don't want to discuss why he didn't get Oscar, because his partner Mr. Freeman (who got the Oscar) was doing very well too. My dad does't like drama actually, but when he saw this movie, he was moved and stand still on his chair to watch this incredible movie. If you don't believe that this movie is awesome and can inspire you to change your life, why don't you just give it a shot by borrowing or buying that movie?great thanks i deliver to Stephen King and all people who are making the story possible for me to watch. i have been changed so much.Last, just recommended for all people who are holding hope!
