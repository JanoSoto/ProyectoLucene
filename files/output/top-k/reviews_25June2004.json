But that's not to say it's a good movie. It's the story of four teenagers Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Ray (Freddie Prinze, Jr.), Barry (Ryan Phillippe), and Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar). On the 4th of July one year, they drunkenly hit a man crossing the road and dump his body in the lake so as to hide the evidence. But a year later, someone begins sending Julie threatening notes stating that they know what she did last summer. Whoever is sending these notes begins to stalk the four of them with one thing in mind--vengeance.Considering that the teen slasher genre is a rather simple and shallow one, calling I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER one of the best of the genre doesn't say much. The premise is a lot more clever than those of most of the genre, but it's not carried out very well. The majority of the movie is the four teens trying to solve the mystery of who is doing these things to them, while the actual slashing is only a feature of the movie. That's a good thing, but the actual detective work isn't very interesting in itself. And the slashing... well, let's just say that it's very predictable and timed just right, with only one or two scares\/surprises throughout the whole movie. The score lets you know exactly when and where the parts that are supposed to be scary come in. And the script is almost ridiculous.Almost everything is overacted and very melodramatic. Jennifer Love Hewitt is actually a good actress, but her role is very limited and doesn't require much. She seems to get the brunt of the corny lines and moments. Ryan Phillippe is actually pretty good as the arrogant and brash Barry, even though his role is very limited as well. Freddie Prinze, Jr., and Sarah Michelle Gellar deliver pretty wooden performances, though you can't really blame them as they're given very little to work with. Anne Heche does all right in an unnecessary cameo.I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER is a pretty ridiculous film, but if you're into the genre, you can't get much better. 5\/10.

Let's just have a peep at why we should have seen the warning signs before either a) spending our $8.50 on the admission price or b) spending our $3.50 to either rent or pay-per-view the film.Number one just look at the director. Here, you have GUS VAN SANT trying to match ALFRED HITCHCOCK. I mean, not to diss Gus entirely, but he probably wouldn't of been as hounded if he would have tried to put a fresh spin on the story. Alfred laid down the groundwork, now improve upon it if you can, not copy it. (Plus, I mean, it IS Gus, who in my opinion, is just a mediocre director who got lucky with Good Will Hunting.)Number two look at the actors. People who have seen the original Psycho have emotionally attached themselves almost to the actors who originally portrayed the characters we know. Let's take, for example, the most IMPORTANT character, Norman Bates. Everyone LOVES Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman. He was shy and innocent, yet was so tortured within and sad that he really made us believe he was a psycho. Now, let's look at the latter, Vince Vaughn. Now, I LOVE Vince Vaughn. I think he's an awesome actor and probably one of the most UNDERRATED around. Now looking at his work in the Psycho remake, did I think he did an AMAZING job? Not exactly. But in his defense (well, somewhat) how could he when the director he was working with was just copying the original film? (And another thing, if the actors had actually tried to copy their performances (which they didn't do, thank God!) wouldn't they be getting bashed like Gus because they too weren't original?) Not that I'm trying to apologize for them though. For the new actors trying to win the place in the original movie fans' hearts, they needed to do KNOCKOUT jobs in their roles, which, none of them really did. Sure, they DID try to be different, but they didn't really take their characters down routes most of us would of liked to have seen. And finally Number three the colorization. We all KNOW how creepy it was to see black and white images of violence in the original. Colorizing it seemed to take AWAY from the shock value actually. We see red blood every day in different movies, but we rarely see it colorless. To me, in black and white, the blood swirling in the shower was actually scarier because who knows how red that blood is running. (Morbid yes, but hopefully you catch my drift.)In the end, all of us original Psycho fans should of been able to take these three signs as warnings that this movie probably wasn't going to be as good as the original. But could this somewhat smarmy remake really even compete with Hitchcock's masterpiece in the first place?

Even upon my first viewing back in 1986, I found certain elements of the film over simplistic.  First is Maureen Stapleton's persona a LIFE FORCE.  Yes, Ms. Stapleton is more than fine in her performance.  She's so natural and nice, that you know that if you were stuck hanging around this rather creepy, morbid over intellectual family, you would be delighted to have her company.  But to overstate this fact by having her dress in bright red dresses and then to emphatically state things like how she thinks E.G. Marshall's house is `so pale' and then bring out a tray of hot dog franks and meat balls, everything about the role positively screams `FUN, LIFE AFFIRMING! VIBRANT!'.  Ok, ok&#133;we get it.  And to top it all off, SHE is the one who literally, LITERALLY breathes life back into Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) at the end.  Oye.  Couldn't Allen have given his audience the credit for being able to use their brains?  The second thing I found is not really over simplistic but rather underwritten.  It's the character of Flynn played by Kristin Griffith.  To say her role is underwritten is an understatement.  It's hard to determine exactly why her character is even in the movie to begin with.  She's not on screen much at all and her character really doesn't do much in terms of establishing anything related to how the family dynamic works (or doesn't work, actually) as the other two sisters, Joey and Renata, do.  And worst of all is the incomprehensible scene near the end where she's nearly raped by Frederick.  The whole scene is out of place.  Is this the reason why her character was created?  It's not a titillating scene or anything but it doesn't make much sense except to make the character of Frederick appear even more reprehensible than he already is.Despite these two flaws, overall, `Interiors' is a fine film.  It's not great but there are moments that have emotional power.  It doesn't really ever draw the viewer in enough for us to feel enough sympathy for most of the characters.  And though this chilliness is most likely intended, it's not necessary.  I don't think Allen's film would've suffered even the slightest if just one scene of comfort and `semi' joy was seen.  The closest we get is some tenderness between Hurt's Joey and Waterston's Mike in bed after she's told him she's pregnant.  There's a scene between Renata and Frederick after she's had a moment that can best be described as realization of her body and soul that I feel should've been played with more tenderness.  Instead the characters are forced apart by their dialogue and their supposed disdain for each other that is driving their marriage apart.The two elements that hold the film together are the performances of Mary Beth Hurt and, most especially, Geraldine Page.First Ms. Hurt.  You could feel how pitiful she was.  But more importantly, you could see how pitiful SHE thought she was.  This is a person who is all too aware of their faults and failings but feels helpless to change them.  As a character, Joey can be infuriating but I think most people have known someone like her the over intellectualized person who is brainy but incapable of making any choices at all for fear of making the `wrong' choice.  Ms. Hurt is very fine here because she doesn't try and make Joey easier to take.  There's no softening of the character and in the end, despite it all, you feel sympathy for her.  She's trapped and all too aware of it.Secondly, there is Ms. Page.  Possibly her performance is the sole reason to even see this film.  Her portrayal of the deeply troubled matron of the family is staggering.  Like Ms. Hurt's Joey, you  might feel some contempt for her but in the end, she has your sympathies.  This is a woman who through her troubled actions has kept her family in a state of turmoil for years.  There is nothing more heartbreaking than realizing that someone you love is also the reason (or at least part of the reason) why you are so miserable.  Ms. Pages and the film's finest moment comes in the pivotal scene where her husband, Arthur (E.G. Marshall, adequate and capable in another underwritten role) goes to a church with her and there, tells her of his desire to finalize their divorce.  Ms. Page slowly allows Eve's reaction to simmer and eventually boil up to the surface.  You can see her trying her best to control and conceal her emotions.  As she sits in pew and he's trying to gently explain the situation, Eve's eyes dart all over the place.  It's in the eyes where Ms. Page's performance lies.  Her eyes look dead but it's there where you can see everything she's feeling the hope when Arthur sends a dozen white roses on her birthday, the despair when he visits her and he gives her only a small kiss on her forehead or the torment in that church scene.  The scene in the church is so well played that I wished Allen hadn't cut it off when he did.  It would have been interesting to see how the whole scene played out.  But, this being a `tasteful' film, Allen ends it too soon.`Interiors' is far from perfect but it is memorable and does have moments of real power and emotion underneath all the more shallow trappings.

Marshall's house is `so pale' and then bring out a tray of hot dog franks and meat balls, everything about the role positively screams `FUN, LIFE AFFIRMING! VIBRANT!'.  Ok, ok&#133;we get it.  And to top it all off, SHE is the one who literally, LITERALLY breathes life back into Joey (Mary Beth Hurt) at the end.  Oye.  Couldn't Allen have given his audience the credit for being able to use their brains?  The second thing I found is not really over simplistic but rather underwritten.  It's the character of Flynn played by Kristin Griffith.  To say her role is underwritten is an understatement.  It's hard to determine exactly why her character is even in the movie to begin with.  She's not on screen much at all and her character really doesn't do much in terms of establishing anything related to how the family dynamic works (or doesn't work, actually) as the other two sisters, Joey and Renata, do.  And worst of all is the incomprehensible scene near the end where she's nearly raped by Frederick.  The whole scene is out of place.  Is this the reason why her character was created?  It's not a titillating scene or anything but it doesn't make much sense except to make the character of Frederick appear even more reprehensible than he already is.Despite these two flaws, overall, `Interiors' is a fine film.  It's not great but there are moments that have emotional power.  It doesn't really ever draw the viewer in enough for us to feel enough sympathy for most of the characters.  And though this chilliness is most likely intended, it's not necessary.  I don't think Allen's film would've suffered even the slightest if just one scene of comfort and `semi' joy was seen.  The closest we get is some tenderness between Hurt's Joey and Waterston's Mike in bed after she's told him she's pregnant.  There's a scene between Renata and Frederick after she's had a moment that can best be described as realization of her body and soul that I feel should've been played with more tenderness.  Instead the characters are forced apart by their dialogue and their supposed disdain for each other that is driving their marriage apart.The two elements that hold the film together are the performances of Mary Beth Hurt and, most especially, Geraldine Page.First Ms. Hurt.  You could feel how pitiful she was.  But more importantly, you could see how pitiful SHE thought she was.  This is a person who is all too aware of their faults and failings but feels helpless to change them.  As a character, Joey can be infuriating but I think most people have known someone like her the over intellectualized person who is brainy but incapable of making any choices at all for fear of making the `wrong' choice.  Ms. Hurt is very fine here because she doesn't try and make Joey easier to take.  There's no softening of the character and in the end, despite it all, you feel sympathy for her.  She's trapped and all too aware of it.Secondly, there is Ms. Page.  Possibly her performance is the sole reason to even see this film.  Her portrayal of the deeply troubled matron of the family is staggering.  Like Ms. Hurt's Joey, you  might feel some contempt for her but in the end, she has your sympathies.  This is a woman who through her troubled actions has kept her family in a state of turmoil for years.  There is nothing more heartbreaking than realizing that someone you love is also the reason (or at least part of the reason) why you are so miserable.  Ms. Pages and the film's finest moment comes in the pivotal scene where her husband, Arthur (E.G. Marshall, adequate and capable in another underwritten role) goes to a church with her and there, tells her of his desire to finalize their divorce.  Ms. Page slowly allows Eve's reaction to simmer and eventually boil up to the surface.  You can see her trying her best to control and conceal her emotions.  As she sits in pew and he's trying to gently explain the situation, Eve's eyes dart all over the place.  It's in the eyes where Ms. Page's performance lies.  Her eyes look dead but it's there where you can see everything she's feeling the hope when Arthur sends a dozen white roses on her birthday, the despair when he visits her and he gives her only a small kiss on her forehead or the torment in that church scene.  The scene in the church is so well played that I wished Allen hadn't cut it off when he did.  It would have been interesting to see how the whole scene played out.  But, this being a `tasteful' film, Allen ends it too soon.`Interiors' is far from perfect but it is memorable and does have moments of real power and emotion underneath all the more shallow trappings.

Some critics (the esteemed Roger Ebert included) understood both the direction and aim of this film, while others, and many movie goers completely missed the point.This film is meant to be a visualization of a 1930's pulp novel - that is, its point is to provide that stereotypical campy atmosphere of the old Shadow radio plays, novels, and even films of that era. This is in many ways the stereotypical super-hero film. We have a mad scientist, a fiendishly evil conquerer(there's some retro terminology) a super-hero who is not a perfect being, but a flawed man, and of course, an atomic bomb.People forget that it is the Shadow, and other early pulp-fiction characters that set these stereotypes in the first place - therefore how can one call this show a rip-off when it set the standards of this genre so long ago?

The dialogue is witty, the acting fits with the rolls very well, and the connection is genius.Pulp FIction has about 4 stories that all intertwine into one tale. The following is a very vague summary of the events in Pulp Fiction.The First centers on two hit men of Marcellus Wallace going to a drug dealers apartment to take care of some business. It ends as Vinvent Vega and Jules Winfield (the two mob hit men played by Travolta and Jackson) shoot the s*it out of one of the men. It then goes right into another story after a short interlude type thing. This time, Vega has to take Mia Wallace (Marcellus Wallace's wife played by Uma Thurman) out to dinner. After dinner and winning a twist contest, mia overdoses which evolves into another substory where they must get adrenaline to her before she dies. The following story is called the Gold Watch. This is where one of Wallace's men who is a boxer is paid to throw in a fight. He, however wins and is on the run from Marcellus when he runs into him. This then goes into another subplot where Marcellus and Butch have been taken in by a S&M store owner and Marcellus is raped while Butch escapes only to later come down and save Marcellus. The next story is called the Bonnie Situation where we are back with Vincent and Jules and as they take one of the drug dealers in their car and he is accidentally shot in the face by Vincent. This evolves into the story of how they have to clean up the car and dispose of the body before they get caught. After this they go to a diner where a holdup (the beginning we see in the start of the movie)takes place. This description was very vague and left a lot out but it is hard to fit everything into one paragraph.Anyway, what makes this movie great is the non-linear storytelling combined with the round-about way that the characters are indirectly characterized. Many argue that the hip conversations do nothing to further their personality, but they fail to see how it actually does. Vincent and Jules' conversation in the beginning about the royale with cheese seems pointless. But it shows how desensitized to the violent acts they commit. They don't really care at all. There are other examples however i am too lazy to write them all. The movie is reasonably mature in it's content. Upwards of 300 f*cks are used and many sexually implied. There is a lot of sexual content where they talk about oral sex and other things. The violence is not that bad. Not what you see anyway. Someone gets shot in the face and all we see is the blood spatter in the rear window and the blood\/brain all over Jules and Vincent. Don't let that, however, turn you off. It is a very good movie that should not be missed.

The budget went to hire such outside talent as Fred Astaire and Irving Berlin. And none of them disappoint.In the first of two films Astaire and Crosby did together the characters are remarkably the same. Astaire is the elegant and charming show business professional who's ambitious for success. Crosby is the talented, but lazy partner who just wants a life of ease and comfort and not to work more than he has to. Small wonder that their double act broke up. But now enter a complication. They both get interested in the same girl who in this film is Marjorie Reynolds.Crosby dreams up the idea of a nightclub\/hotel called Holiday Inn where they only work on holidays. He wants Reynolds to help with the shows there. Astaire wants her for his act after his other girl partner Virginia Dale runs off with a millionaire. And the fun starts. Now since this was Crosby's home studio and he's first billed, just who do you think gets Reynolds in the end? As maid Louise Beavers put it, don't sit and mope because some slicker stole your gal.Irving Berlin writes a majority of new songs to supplement a couple from his vast trunk of songs mostly about our holidays. By that time Berlin had extracted an agreement which became standard for all the films he wrote for. Not one note of non-Berlin music is ever heard in a score he writes. Just listen to this and just about any other film Berlin is associated with. Even music in the background is his.The hit song in this was supposed to be Be Careful It's My Heart, the Valentine's Day song, sung by Crosby and danced to by Astaire and Reynolds. It did have a good deal of success. But the success of White Christmas was exponentially phenomenal. It netted Irving Berlin his one and only Academy Award and for Bing Crosby his number one item on vinyl. In fact everyone's number one item on vinyl.I don't know if Bing Crosby ever set out to become the voice of Christmas, but if he did he was a marketing genius. If he's known and appreciated for anything with today's audience, it's for that. White Christmas became the first Yule song he was identified with although he had recorded some Christmas material before that. After this he started doing the holiday music in serious. Just think, along around Columbus Day, record companies even now reissue his Christmas stuff every year and his totals as largest selling recording artist in history grow once again. That's why the Beatles and Elvis, etc. don't have a prayer of overtaking him.In fact White Christmas's initial success was so great that Decca wore out the original master putting out records to meet the demand. So in 1945, Decca got Bing, the Ken Darby Singers and John Scott Trotter to re-record it almost note for note. The original 78 had White Christmas with the flipside of Let's Start the New Year Right also from Holiday Inn. The newer version which most people hear has as it's flipside God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.I don't want to ignore Fred Astaire's contribution here. He does a nice comic turn with I Can't Tell a Lie, the Washington's birthday number where Crosby keeps changing the tempo to upset him and Reynolds. The Fourth of July yields a number for each. Reynolds is kept from the show by Bing's machinations and Astaire has to improvise something. He improvises Firecrackers and anyone who knows anything about Astaire knows how hard he worked to get that spontaneous feeling in his dancing. Bing sings The Song of Freedom, reminiscent of James Cagney's Grand Old Flag number from Yankee Doodle Dandy also out in 1942 and Song of Freedom is also reminiscent of what Paramount could have given Bing in the 1930s had they hired someone like Busby Berkeley to give Bing some of the production numbers that Dick Powell had at Warner Brothers.So what more is there to say, but sit back and enjoy the fun.

We have previously been led to believe that all the flashbacks with his wife are true. Yet, he sports this tattoo with his wife, which has been established to be before this movie takes place. That same tattoo does not show up anywhere else during the movie, except in the picture Teddy shows him. How can this be?If you watch the DVD extras there are MANY medical\/psychological reports shown, which are inconsistent with the entire plot of this movie. In my opinion, people tend to think because this movie is incomprehensible, it is good. That which we can not understand must be of a higher thought plane than we are at, so therefore it is smarter, better, deeper??? When I watch a movie, I want to be able to understand what I watch and why I have watched it, not leave there going What in the world was that all about???

This epic is about some Jewish immigrants in America finding their way into the world of crime, told in flashbacks by an aging Jewish criminal named Noodles. The atmospheric scenes take the professional viewers to another level of satisfaction and understanding. If you're watching this masterpiece for the first time, the time-swapping moments can be aggravating, but this is a movie that should be watched couple of times for the sake of observation and more understanding of the plot. Rivalry that exists between the two main characters is beautifully shown and discussed in the three time zones. What Leone tries to show us here, is that rivalry with a taste of jealousy that exists between the so called friends (noodles and max) can become destructive and obsessive. The end cut is quite confusing. There are many theories about the end. According to the DVD-commentary, everything that happens in the first (when they're young&#133;) and the third time zone (where de niro is aged) is a dream. It's like a sort of justification to himself (Noodles) for what he had done to his friends. The starting and ending episodes take place in the second time zone, so the dream theory could be correct. Watching this film is just like an adventure. The acting and direction are completely harmonized in this movie. You can't get disappointed by this film. If you don't like the story, you can always get pleasure from the acting and vise versa. Choosing a right moment for watching this movie is very crucial. Because of the long duration, I recommend to watch this film in two separate parts (The DVD version consists of two discs) with a tea break in between. Your mind has to be clear for this confusing and sometimes shocking masterpiece. This is just another evidence that Robert De Niro's acting method is just masterful. He lived with a Jewish family for sometime to prepare himself for this role. Like De Niro, Leone is also very obsessive with his work. Here you have two geniuses working together and shining in the process. What more can you wish for?????

Those who enjoyed the film defended it as an excellent critique on the twentieth century while others claimed it to be slow and boring. Although, as the study of film progresses Safe is being viewed under a differently light and becoming more accepted amongst American movie goers, developing what looks like the beginnings of a cult following. I would side with those who agree that the film is an excellent critique of the twentieth century although that is not my focus of analysis for this commentary. The real focus of analysis involves one extremely short scene where Carol White comes home and stares at the new furniture after it has been brought into the house a second time, which was about half way through the film. The mise-en-scene in this short five to ten second shot is extraordinary in its capture of the mood or in Carol White's case the sickness behind suburban life.The new couch alone was the most powerful aspect of mise-en-scene. There it was, black in color, square in shape, perfectly spaced between the walls and lamps. The couch is empty and unused yet filling in space and suburban peace of mind. It is the focus of the entire shot, forcing the audience to stare on waiting for a reaction, some kind of acknowledgment from Carol White. The couch, to me, has essentially become a reflection of Carol White, fitting since her name is just as blank and lifeless as the couch. I also thought the lighting of the room was crucial in creating the setting for the couch. The low key lighting of the enclosed room shuts out all life, helping to create that dead environment which Carol White cannot seem to escape. The darker scene really blurs the edges of the couch and the corners of the walls, forming a cave like design. This particular aspect of light really adds to the frighteningly scary mood which is most commonly felt and scene by audience members, but never really thought about or understood. Sound and lack of it really set the tone for hidden narratives of suburban horror. The beginning of the short scene depicts Carol White walking in the darkened room to see the new couch, and only her light footsteps are heard. After this there is complete silence for at least five to ten seconds. Since the scene did not have any muffled background sounds I found it to be quite useful in describing the silence in which Carol White lives her life. Even the furniture is louder than she. The style of mise-en-scene in this scene is quite evident throughout the rest of the film, and really shows its importance as a tool in every cinematic genre. A film such as Safe demands attention to detail and a unique style when it comes to mise-en-scene.

It means that everyone sees it with his own eyes, and every one has his own reasons to like or dislike Black Hawk Down. Well, I most certainly liked it. To me, it's a major war movie, a worthy cousin of Saving Private Ryan. To me, both changed the genre forever.As many people pointed out, the most impressive aspect of Black Hawk Down is its realism. The war we see in that film is a bloody mess. We see scared men doing their duty, fighting for their lives. Of course, it's gory, noisy, but that's war, isn't it ? War isn't a pleasure cruise, it's not a picnic. It's about men being ripped apart, that you have to patch up the best you can (see the death scene of Cpl Jamie Smith). SPR was the first film to give us a taste of the kind of hell war is. BHD does it also. It has a visceral power. There are differences between the two movies. SPR had faded colors, and a documentary-style. BHD is very stylized, with a magnificent photography. Yet, both are equally effective. Once you've seen BHD, you don't forget it. Ridley Scott and his crew did a superb job in throwing us into the heart of the action. WWII movies like A Bridge too far, The longest day are great (because they're interesting and very well directed and I still love them), but they give a Hollywood-like vision of war. They cut out the pain, the blood and the mess. The street-fighting scenes of BHD are the best I've ever seen. They give of good idea of the merciless ordeal contemporary soldiers have to face.To me, BHD is also quite a clearsighted movie. The soldiers who were in Somalia fought because they were professionals, because they wanted to fulfill their mission, because they wanted to save their comrades. That's it. Eric Bana's character says it pretty well  You want to know what I think ? It don't matter what I think. Once the first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that s... go right out of the window. Or  It's all about the man next to you, that's it. There's a believable speech. It's a million years away from the silly propaganda of We were soldiers, where the private dies on the field saying how proud he is to die for his country. Films like We were soldiers or Pearl Harbor give a glorious image of war  to me, a big lie. I also felt watching BHD that the United States were not depicted as the saviors of the world (a nice change from Independence day, one of the worst Hollywood blockbusters). As I felt it, BHD tells about the naive aspects of the US foreign policy. The two scenes with the Somalis (Osman Atto talking with Maj-Gal Garrison and the man who talks with captured CWO Michael Durant) are well written. (Do you think that removing Gal Aidid will have us put down our weapons ? That we will adopt American democracy ?) Soldiers on the field are paying the price (in blood) for the mistakes of their political leaders. In Somalia, they fought bravely to get themselves out of the mess. BHD also shows that immense military power isn't always a good solution. An armed militia entrenched in a city, warned by observers with cell phones (a powerful image, when the helicopters are flying over a kid with his phone)  there's enough to put heavily-armed US soldiers in jeopardy. In the light of the US problems today in Iraq, BHD had a lot of insight.Of course, everything isn't perfect. I don't know if the reasons for US presence in Somalia are as simple as the opening captions. In the end credits, it's a bit annoying to see the names of the 19 KIA opposing a simple statement More than 1000 Somalis were killed. The US soldiers have their names, but the Somalis can die anonymously by the hundreds. Those are Hollywood-like flaws.Regarding the historical accuracy, I tracked down the articles by Mark Bowden. I was surprised to see how close to the facts the movie is. There are changes, of course (the main one is that Sgt Eversmann didn't spend the night in the city in the real fight), but those are only details. The spirit of the facts remains  we do understand what happened in Mogadishu.The more I watch BHD, the better I think of it. It's excellent film making (great music by Hans Zimmer, by the way). It's a gripping war movie. It's quite gut-wrenching (you need a strong stomach to watch it), but it's believable.
