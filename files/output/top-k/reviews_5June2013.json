For one, it's a highly entertaining film with revolutionary visual effects, path breaking action sequences and a captivating screenplay. (In that order) Now, Imagine a highly trained, highly secretive terrorist unit brainwashed by a know it all fortune teller. This unit, led by their charismatic leader tracks down a 'The One' - a god reincarnate and trains him to 'believe'. To believe and to beat an invisible system that's organized, ruthless and virtually unbeatable. To do this they hack into the system from their safe house and cause havoc in the name of the truth. This system owes some of its strength to strict a set of rules and regulations, but mostly to the blind faith of the general public. Needless to say, it controls everything and everyone within that system. Sounds like a usual anti America topic of conversation at an Al Qaida Sunday brunch. The similarities are uncanny. However this is a story of a rebellion. Man vs. Machine, albeit smarter, slicker and without Schwarzenegger saying 'ill be back' or 'hasta la vista' or any other clichéd catchphrases. The beauty of the movie is that it triggers that struggle for freedom within each of us. Our rebellious side roots for the underdogs and makes us believe in 'The One' just as he starts believing in himself. While watching the film you will be sold on their idea and find yourself investing hope into the rebels' cause. The key is the way Neo (Keanu Reeves) has been humanized. One day he's an average Joe and the next he's the chosen one, the ultimate superhero. One who can dodge bullets, defeat an army and isn't afraid of the emotional repercussions of killing his enemy. All this and he has a sense of style. Leather suits, sunglasses and no underpants on the outside. The protagonist, Keanu Reeves is a genius computer hacker who leads a dual life. One as Thomas Anderson, a software programmer for a 'very respectable' company &#x96; Metacortex. The other as Neo, the cyberspace outlaw whose suspicion of the matrix leads him to the great Morpheus. Morpheus opens his eyes to a truth previously unknown to him. He is told its closer to the year 2100 than 2000. The real world, is in fact a planet that is ruled by Machines, where the sun does not exist and only a handful of humans survive to fight the rebellion. In the war that was, the machines defeat the humans and enslave them in a virtual reality &#x96; The Matrix. Thus, reducing a human being into Battery. The slave trade of the future. This truth makes Neo realize that his life that was, was a lie &#x96; that none of it ever happened. That his perception of reality was projected onto him by a set of computer programmes. That he, was just another slave living in captivity. To add to this, he is also told that the future of the entire human race depends on him - The One. Neo, to his credit takes in all this information without too much drama. As the one he has to lead the surviving free humans, fight the machines, defeat the matrix and expose the truth. This is easier said than done. The odds are not in his favour. No man who has ever stood their ground against the machines has survived. However, he is the one and it's his destiny to do so. It has been prophesied. Some Pressure for someone who has developed atrophy living in a pod. After all this the big question is how to destroy this virtually unbeatable system and free mankind. The answer &#x96; love. At the end of the day The Matrix is a story of how a boy meets a girl and the girl makes the boy a man. It's a subtle love story within a complex plot. One with a very dramatic end that's right out of a Rajnikanth film. But there is a message, a moral of the story. It shows us how any man can rise and be a Neo. With the guidance of a mentor, a little help from his friends and the support of a loving woman all he needs is to believe. To believe in himself and be, The One. Keanu Reeves as Neo is convincing as the reluctant hero. His transformation from Mr. Andersen to Neo is smooth and personal. For the audience he is the protagonist, the hero and the guide that takes us through the Matrix. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn) is a treat. Without his commanding presence, striking dialogue and intriguing look the first half of the matrix would've fallen flat on its face. Laurence Fishburn nails it as a godfather in the future. Carrie Ann Moss plays Trinity. She's beautiful and does a good job of bringing out the layers of her character as a woman. Moss, apart from playing her part in the rebel group is a breath of fresh air from all the men in leather pants and suits. The cinematography and vfx is what takes this film to another level altogether. It covers the loopholes in the story and sets you up for a visual treat like never before. The Matrix deserves its 5\/5 rating for doing what a film is meant to do. Entertain an audience and leave them with something to think about. So what is the Matrix? Well, to borrow a phrase, no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. So, take the red pill and get ready to be blown away.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"5 June 2013","score":"","review":" Reservoir DogsDirected by Quentin Tarantino Written by Quentin Tarantino & Roger Avary (background radio dialogs)Quentin Tarantino's debut film Reservoir Dogs, released in 1992, marked the entry of one the most gifted writer-directors of our time. A project that took off with Tarantino's lucky break with Harvey Kietel. The result was a film, which despite a lukewarm response at the BO has gone on to become one of the classics of the 90's. It's better regarded today than when it was released, I suspect because people watched it with more intent later, recognizing a Tarantino film for what it is; thereby reading between the lines and appreciating the genius in the film-maker's first. Tarantino's first film serves as a blueprint for the rest of his films. He touches up on all things Tarantin-ian, tension, violence, jumping narrative, brilliant dialogs and most of all his unique (or not so unique) style of storytelling. Reservoir Dogs is about 7 'professional' criminals on a mid day heist in LA. It takes us from a comical coffee shop scene, where the characters are introduced, to the opening credits followed by a drive to a warehouse, where most of the real action takes place. The robbery takes place in the time span of the opening credits and while we see nothing, Tarantino makes you think you've seen more than he's shown. Most of the film deals with the jovial before and the bloody aftermath of the heist. To make a good film you have to make it personal but Quentin tends more towards self obsessed. It's an ever-present factor in all his films. He creates characters who are an extension of his personality, uses banter that's probably pulled out from his life and works his entire film around an idea which is far from the conventional yet inspired from other films. But that's absolutely fine, Tarantino is smart with his use of homages, their timing is perfect and although not completely necessary, seem like the best fit for the situation. After all good artists copy, great artists steal. Tarantino gets one thing bang on, the dimensions of male camaraderie, especially when the men in question have no knowledge of each others' identity. Each of them has a phony name given to them by the big fish, Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) as a safety measure. There's Mr. White (Harvey Kietel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buschemi), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) and Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker). When things are going well everyone's getting along, cracking jokes and sharing stories, all the while trying to get the last word in. With no set hierarchy everyone's out to prove they've got the biggest dick in the room but with more bite than bark. It's all casual and positive when there's a promise of a big loot hanging in their future. However, when things don't go according to plan, panic sets in and the half-good criminals lose the plot, they stop thinking straight and personal matters come in the way of professional calls. There's the magic in the film, when the characters with fake names are put in a situation that slowly brings forth their true identities.It seems as though apart from Joe and Mr. Blonde, the only two to have served time, none of the others have the mettle to keep their wits about in high pressure situations. In the end its Mr. Whites judgment that moves him to play the role of a guardian to the dying Mr. Orange. Tempers flare, voices are raised and the guns are readied. In a situation that resembles an old western the film draws the curtains on a note of twisted poetic justice. Tarantino's screenplay works on the prowess of its cast and their interactions. In a colorful cast it's hard to separate some from the rest but Tim Roth and Michael Madsen do a little more than the others. Tim Roth shows good range as he shifts between characters. For the most part he's delivering all his lines while bleeding out and in constant pain, its odd, but he's convincing enough. Madsen, follows James Cagney's principle &#x96;When playing a mean character, find a lighter side. It works well and Madsen plays the vicious Vic Vega to great effect. Steven Buschemi as Mr. Pink does a good job as well. Its difficult to put Reservoir Dogs in a genre, while there is a lot of action and violence, it's not really an action film. There are elements of mystery but it's not really a whodunit. It's got shades of a thriller and black comedy but it can't be classified as either one. It's all about the there and now and there's no telling what's going to happen. One critic said; it's an action movie that works entirely on words. Words are Tarantino's biggest strength and he sticks to it all the way and makes for a commendable first outing. Reservoir Dogs is a highly enjoyable ride that promises to thrill, shock and entertain any audience able to listen, pay attention and stomach its brutality. Moral of the story &#x96; Be professional.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"5 June 2013","score":"","review":" Crimes and Misdemeanors is a film about two men who are unhappy in their marriages and the different choices they make to change their situation. Judah is a rich, successful orthopedic doctor who began having an affair two years previous with a woman named Delores; it was not because he had a bad marriage, he was merely bored and wanted some hot new tail. Clifford is a nerdy, struggling filmmaker whose marriage has been on a steady decline for the past year; he begins work on a new project and meets his co-worker Nancy, who he immediately begins to fall for despite still being marred. Judah's lover Delores starts to become very emotionally unstable and begins to threaten and blackmail Judah because he won't tell his wife about his mistress. She makes attempts to contact the wife herself and starts calling his house all the time. Judah realizes what an ass he's been and how he's jeopardized his whole life and career by having this affair; he goes to his brother Jack for advise, and he suggests Judah have Delores murdered. Initially Judah is appalled by this notion and refuses the thought altogether; however, after some time of having Delores get bolder and more desperate, Judah seriously considers it and finally decides to go through with the murder. Meanwhile, Clifford continues courting his co-worker and begins to believe he is in love with her. He eventually tells her and ends up having a few sexual discrepancies. Not long after he tells Nancy his feelings for her, she tells Clifford that she has taken a job in Paris and will be gone for a few months. Clifford is shattered but decides to wait for her and get a divorce in the meantime. Around six months or so later Clifford sees Nancy at a party on the arm of a man he despises, and overhears that they got married while in Paris. He is devastated and is now single, miserable, and poor. The film ends with Judah and Clifford talking at the party, and Judah is telling Clifford how his life has totally turned around and he is incredibly happy now. He ends up with his wife in a better relationship than they had before and is still a successful doctor. Clifford mulls over the idea of murder and if he had killed the man before, Nancy would never have married him. Ultimately we see that Judah did the wrong thing and ended up happier than before, while Clifford made the better choices and ended up miserable and alone for the rest of his life.According to Mill and the Utilitarian viewpoint, Judah's choice to murder his mistress was the correct moral decision. Utilitarian's believe that the final consequences are all that matter, and that the moral decision brings about the happiness of the most people involved. They do not care that Delores had her life snuffed out for no real good reason, or that she was completely innocent of anything that would deserve such a harsh punishment. But by her death many other people remained happy; Judah was able to sweep his discrepancies under the rug, so to speak, and return to his old life as if nothing happened. He gained a deeper appreciation for his wife and family and thus was happier, by Delores' death the family remained in the dark about Judah's affair and they were all happy. None of his clients found out about his shady money transactions, and everyone in his life either remained as happy as before, or became happier.Kant would have said that Judah was immoral because of the categorical imperative, which states that one should not act in such a way that they would not want others to act and thus be a universal law. If Judah believed in the categorical imperative, then by killing Delores he would essentially be saying that it would be okay if someone killed him for being a nuisance or for unethically messing around with his clients' money. I believe it is pretty obvious that Judah would not have wanted this at all since he couldn't even bare the thought that he would have to suffer the consequences for his wrong actions; not to mention having to pay for them with his own life. Clifford's case is a little more difficult for me; I believe Mill and Kant would have said that Clifford was being moral by not following through with his murderous thoughts. Clifford divorced his wife and she met someone new, so she was happier; his lover Nancy ended up getting married to a man that she seemed to truly love, so both she and her new husband were happy also. Clifford was the only one who seemed to come out at a loss when everything was said and done, so Mill would have said the net gain was in happiness. Kant would have also said Clifford did the right thing, because he would not want it to be a universal law that people can kill each other out of jealousy. In total, this film had quite a few things going on and different themes underneath the surface. The ending seemed to suggest to the audience that the person who does what is immoral but can get away with it is happier than the person who does what is right. ","genre":null},{"date":"5 June 2013","score":"","review":" Crimes and Misdemeanors is a film about two men who are unhappy in their marriages and the different choices they make to change their situation. Judah is a rich, successful orthopedic doctor who began having an affair two years previous with a woman named Delores; it was not because he had a bad marriage, he was merely bored and wanted some hot new tail. Clifford is a nerdy, struggling filmmaker whose marriage has been on a steady decline for the past year; he begins work on a new project and meets his co-worker Nancy, who he immediately begins to fall for despite still being marred. Judah's lover Delores starts to become very emotionally unstable and begins to threaten and blackmail Judah because he won't tell his wife about his mistress. She makes attempts to contact the wife herself and starts calling his house all the time. Judah realizes what an ass he's been and how he's jeopardized his whole life and career by having this affair; he goes to his brother Jack for advise, and he suggests Judah have Delores murdered. Initially Judah is appalled by this notion and refuses the thought altogether; however, after some time of having Delores get bolder and more desperate, Judah seriously considers it and finally decides to go through with the murder. Meanwhile, Clifford continues courting his co-worker and begins to believe he is in love with her. He eventually tells her and ends up having a few sexual discrepancies. Not long after he tells Nancy his feelings for her, she tells Clifford that she has taken a job in Paris and will be gone for a few months. Clifford is shattered but decides to wait for her and get a divorce in the meantime. Around six months or so later Clifford sees Nancy at a party on the arm of a man he despises, and overhears that they got married while in Paris. He is devastated and is now single, miserable, and poor. The film ends with Judah and Clifford talking at the party, and Judah is telling Clifford how his life has totally turned around and he is incredibly happy now. He ends up with his wife in a better relationship than they had before and is still a successful doctor. Clifford mulls over the idea of murder and if he had killed the man before, Nancy would never have married him. Ultimately we see that Judah did the wrong thing and ended up happier than before, while Clifford made the better choices and ended up miserable and alone for the rest of his life.According to Mill and the Utilitarian viewpoint, Judah's choice to murder his mistress was the correct moral decision. Utilitarian's believe that the final consequences are all that matter, and that the moral decision brings about the happiness of the most people involved. They do not care that Delores had her life snuffed out for no real good reason, or that she was completely innocent of anything that would deserve such a harsh punishment. But by her death many other people remained happy; Judah was able to sweep his discrepancies under the rug, so to speak, and return to his old life as if nothing happened. He gained a deeper appreciation for his wife and family and thus was happier, by Delores' death the family remained in the dark about Judah's affair and they were all happy. None of his clients found out about his shady money transactions, and everyone in his life either remained as happy as before, or became happier.Kant would have said that Judah was immoral because of the categorical imperative, which states that one should not act in such a way that they would not want others to act and thus be a universal law. If Judah believed in the categorical imperative, then by killing Delores he would essentially be saying that it would be okay if someone killed him for being a nuisance or for unethically messing around with his clients' money. I believe it is pretty obvious that Judah would not have wanted this at all since he couldn't even bare the thought that he would have to suffer the consequences for his wrong actions; not to mention having to pay for them with his own life. Clifford's case is a little more difficult for me; I believe Mill and Kant would have said that Clifford was being moral by not following through with his murderous thoughts.

GROUNDHOG DAY appears to have become one of the biggest classics of the decade but I remember watching it in 1993 and not caring too much for it. This here was my first time revisiting the title and I'll admit that I liked it a tad bit more but at the same time I still don't see what everyone else sees in it. There's no question that there are some funny moments and there's no question that Murray does a fantastic job but at the same time the film just doesn't work for me. I think the biggest reason it just doesn't work is because I don't find it all that funny. This is especially true for various scenes that are constantly getting replayed over and over, although they're obviously done in different ways as Murray starts to realize what's going on. It's weird but I really like the concept here of the same thing being repeated but at the same time it's just not all that funny to me. I think what comedy does work is due to Murray's performance. I think what works so well with the performance is that we can believe him as the jerk as well as the transformation into the nice guy. Murray gets to play many different sides to this character and he really nails all of them. As the jerk you can't stand him but he slowly makes you care for the guy and especially towards the end. I think the character development here is actually a lot better than many dramas out there. Andie MacDowell makes for a good love interest and we get nice support from the likes of Chris Elliott and Brian Doyle-Murray. Again, I understand that this film is loved by many. To me it's a flawed film with one great performance and a few nice laughs.

Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.

The presence of a few humans on camels magnifies the grandeur of this spiritual place.So spectacular are the desert scenes, they almost swallow up the story, about an eccentric, quirky Englishman named T.E.

Although not entirely factual, the film at least offers viewers a sense of real-life historical figures including not only Lawrence but also Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness), among others. All of the major characters are interesting in their own ways. All convey a sense of intelligence and enlightened vision, even as their cultural or socioeconomic backgrounds clash.The script's dialogue is rendered potent due to its sparseness. Visuals carry the story effectively; minimal dialogue needed. And when it is present, it's sharp, crisp, striking. At one point a character asks Lawrence What is it ... that attracts you personally to the desert? To which Lawrence responds in two words It's clean. Yes indeed. And so is the film's plot simple, straightforward, bold, uncluttered.Costumes and prod design are detailed. The score is pleasantly haunting, though it does get repeated a bit too often. Casting and acting are acceptable. I especially liked the camels; they are fun to observe. Color cinematography is brilliant, especially outdoors. The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times.My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with Intermission.Lawrence Of Arabia was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

The use of day-for-night camera filters is obvious in some scenes, giving the production an antiquated look, at times.My major complaint is the runtime. I could have wished for a shorter film by about one hour. Some scenes are not really necessary; other scenes could have been shortened, all without losing character development or status as epic. It's a serious problem for this film, in that the resulting impression is one of pretension. I have no doubt that Lawrence and his Arab adventures are film worthy. But his story is hardly so earth-shaking as to merit nearly four hours, complete with Intermission.Lawrence Of Arabia was much better than I had expected, owing mostly to the visual grandeur. It's a very well put-together film, runtime notwithstanding. The film gives us historical and cultural perspective, and does so in a way that makes the desert landscape as much a character as the film's protagonist.

It has real guts and glory. Die Hard's well-structured all throughout and its foremost purpose is to deliver spectacular action in an innovative, raw approach, flipping the script on action movies forever. N.Y. cop John McClane is not your typical action star. Unlike most prior portrayals of action heroes (Rambo, RoboCop, Dirty Harry) John McClane doesn't stroll around with his machine gun killing off bad guys with some superhuman-like ability almost as if he's hitting targets popping out at a shooting range like the bad guys are trying to get shot. McClane methodically engages in combat using his entire equipped arsenal to emerge the victor, with the imminent threat of danger always lurking just around the bend. McClane manages to keep himself in constant peril, time and time over escaping certain death with an all too resourceful determination. Die Hard is incredible for it, for its realistic display of action. McClane matching against Hans and his band of terrorists is the weight and the overwhelming strength of Die Hard. Bruce Willis explodes onto the scene in the best role of his career. Alan Rickman is especially apt at playing a cold, calculating villain. It does a solid job of introducing the characters John McClane and Holly Gennaro, played by Bonnie Bedelia who is always fine to see, but the beginning seems uncertain of how to move through into the action. The beginning does do a good job though of setting the tone, giving you time to reflect and prepare for what mayhem lies ahead, time to get your popcorn ready. Once the terrorists enter the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper, Die Hard starts to elevate to a high level not only in its entertainment value but in critical regard as well.

Luckily, Sgt. Powell is there to save the day allowing Powell his moment of glory. This was an uncharacteristically tacky moment for this mostly masterful film, but Die Hard had already perfectly proved its worth by this point, so a little something for the kids doesn't hurt.

She refuses to stay quiet about their love, and demands that he marry her. When she threatens to expose Judah for embezzling money from his company, Judah's brother suggests murder to get rid of her and to keep his secret. After following through with the act, Judah struggles with the burden of the consequences of his actions and debates with himself over whether what he did as moral. In the closing of the movie, it is said, We define ourselves by the choices we have made. We are in fact the sum total of our choices. This poses the question, was Judah an immoral person for having his mistress murdered? Or was it valid since he didn't get caught? The question is more debatable than it first seems, as in the context of the movie, Judah was acting for his own self-preservation and because he felt threatened. Simultaneously, Cliff Stern is struggling to survive through both a failing marriage as well as a failing career, and finds solace in the friendship of a coworker (Halley) on the set of shooting his successful brother in-laws biographical video. When Lester finds himself falling in love with Halley, he seems to give no care to the fact that he is married, even though his brother in-law ends up winning over Halley's heart before Lester does. A question of morality is posed, was it justifiable for Lester to kiss\/love another woman since his wife was also cheating on him?John Stuart Mill is a utilitarianist that speaks of the happiness of all. According to his happiness principle, an action is moral and right as long as it results in the most happiness for the greatest number of people possible.

She refuses to stay quiet about their love, and demands that he marry her. When she threatens to expose Judah for embezzling money from his company, Judah's brother suggests murder to get rid of her and to keep his secret.

This poses the question, was Judah an immoral person for having his mistress murdered? Or was it valid since he didn't get caught? The question is more debatable than it first seems, as in the context of the movie, Judah was acting for his own self-preservation and because he felt threatened. Simultaneously, Cliff Stern is struggling to survive through both a failing marriage as well as a failing career, and finds solace in the friendship of a coworker (Halley) on the set of shooting his successful brother in-laws biographical video. When Lester finds himself falling in love with Halley, he seems to give no care to the fact that he is married, even though his brother in-law ends up winning over Halley's heart before Lester does.

Not only did it clean up at the Oscars and effectively launch the careers of William Friedkin, Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider but it also achieved a new level of realism which influenced so many of the crime thrillers that were made in its wake. The story of two tough New York City narcotics detectives who try to bring down an international drugs ring is also compelling because it's based on actual events and the way that they're portrayed looks so convincing.Extensive use of hand-held cameras and location shots contribute to the production's documentary style and the run down areas of the city that provide the backdrop for some of the action reinforce the movie's depressing bleakness and grittiness.One night, Detective Jimmy Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner Detective Buddy Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider) are at a nightclub when Doyle notices a group of known mobsters at one of the tables. Doyle doesn't know one of the characters and persuades Russo that they should tail the mystery man who turns out to be Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco). It soon becomes evident that Boca, who's a small businessman, enjoys a lifestyle which his legitimate activities could not support and their suspicions about him deepen further when he visits the residence of a drug financier called Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary).Shortly after, one of Doyle's informants tells him about a major shipment of heroin that's due to arrive at New York harbour and the two detectives arrange for Boca's telephone to be tapped.French mastermind Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) arranges for the huge quantity of top class heroin to be transported from Marseilles to New York in a car belonging to French TV personality Henri Devereaux (Frederic de Pasquale) and Charnier and his henchman Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) arrive in New York in time to watch Devereaux's car being lowered from the ship onto the wharf. Doyle and Russo keep the Frenchmen under surveillance and what follows soon develops into an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse which eventually comes to a conclusion when a meeting of all the participants in the drugs deal is gate-crashed by Doyle, Russo and a large number of other police officers and a couple of federal agents.Doyle's character fascinated audiences who, at that time, weren't used to seeing cops who were so foul mouthed, bigoted and unprincipled. This man was driven by an obsessive need to hunt down the criminals but in so doing, completely ignored the rules under which he was authorised to operate and showed no concern for innocent people who were hurt or killed directly or indirectly because of his actions. Gene Hackman is terrific as the incredibly cold and callous rogue cop whose methods and values are extremely troubling.The quality of the acting in this film is consistently good but the contribution of Fernando Rey merits a special mention because he brings a level of humour and sophistication to the drama which provides such a strong and welcome contrast to Doyle's behaviour.The most famous feature of The French Connection is the very tense and exciting car chase that follows when Nicoli tries to escape on an elevated train after attempting to shoot Doyle. Doyle commandeers a car from a member of the public and then chases the train at high speed. The whole sequence is brilliantly executed and predictably, there are numerous near misses and car damaging moments along the way.Overall, this groundbreaking classic is a movie that's not to be missed.

Bill Murray is genius, as always, and the animation scenes are obviously a work of love.
