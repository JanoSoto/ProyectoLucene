","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"3 April 2004","score":"","review":"  SPOILERS!!!!!Ghost World is the story of a girl searching for a place in the opposite end of often glamor possessed Los Angeles. The film is balanced between off the wall characters that surround Enid, Seymour, Rebecca and Enid's and Seymour's comically depressed view of the world.The film oscillates interestingly between absurdity and subtlety, creating a unique story that reveals the confusion of being human.I'm so glad Christina Ricci passed up this role, don't get wrong Christina is talented, but I doubt she could have played the part of Enid with such charm and comic timing as Thora did. This movie was very entertaining. It was funny and had great music.  Thora Birch really shines like she did in the Best Picture Oscar winning movie American Beauty. KEEP IT UP THORA.Enid is a troubled, somewhat lonely teenager, who realizes that she is in a world she doesn't fit into. Rather than change cities, she gives up and plays one practical joke on a man.People keep interrupting her attempts at practical joking and each attempt propels her into a different direction, and introduces different characters.This film is cynical and sad, but has a guilt ridden funny side that gets better as it goes along. I would definitely see it again! This a brilliantly written, acted and photographed flick about when classmates head for college, 2 girls, Enid and Rebecca focus their energies on tormenting those around them. From a goofy convenience store clerk to an eccentric art teacher, these two saboteurs wreak havoc on all those who cross their paths. But when they zero in on an oddball loner looking for Ms. Right, their seemingly innocent meddling threatens to shatter one of their hearts. not to mention their lifelong friendship from that point on. A terrific cautionary tale, with Oscar-caliber performance from Thora Birch. A soft-R, which can be viewed by anyone over 12 as long as they watch it with a parent. I found this film to be one of the best I have ever seen. Some will read this and think...well, she hasn't seen many movies. That fact is true. I found the movie very well written and acted. At some points during the movie, I wanted to rip my heart out and give it to the lead character Enid. The girl that played her did an incredible job. I read some reviews that said she over-acted and such. I never thought that...have you ever had a spat with a 18 year old girl? It's always overly dramatic and ends with her stomping to her room screaming. That's a teenager for you.The movie makes you think, and that's what I like about it. No, not every teen is doing what she is doing. No, not every teen is acting like she does. This movie portrays the state of mind of a teenager beautifully. Ghost World is a great movie and is a good laugh for everyone who sees it. I think that any teenager that has trouble with life who see this movie will definitely realize that there are other teens out there with way more problems! I think that Enid, is a great character. It is so funny!This is not a BAD thing!Would 2000 audiences have gone to see Birch in a period comedy set eighty years earlier? I doubt it. And had the story had been simply 'updated', would it have been truly faithful to the source, even in spirit? Unlikely, as so much has changed over the years. Ultimately, the film makers erred, I believe, in using the title of the earlier film, but not in the approach of making a teen-friendly dark comedy about a household of massive proportions.With Thora Birch, who has become Hollywood's quintessential troubled teen, as an unconventional teenager, a little bit (but still quite different), from Jane. She is, as always, a treasure!The other characters are really the stars of the film, though, and each is special, and individual, from Enid's friend, Rebecca, who, at 18, wants Enid to accept the guy she has a huge crush on, Josh. She is quite likable, and proves that she can take more than just kid roles in kid movies.Director Terry Zwigoff's previous film, Crumb, was a loud, unpleasant, cliched bore; in Ghost World, he redeems himself with a more enjoyable, richer film.While the movie will never earn the classic status, it stands very well on it's own merits!Ghost World combines entertainment, comedy, and emotions to make the a hell of an amazing movie. Definitely worth watching over and over again; Ghost World gets 8.5\/10 stars for a well written script and a great acting job by both Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi. I guess I am kinda biased because I love anything with Thora Birch in it, except for The Smokers (which I enjoyed her scenes in but hated the rest of the movie) and Dungeons & Dragons. This movie exceeds any limit or bounds of imaginative writing. I should say that whatever method of putting this on the silver screen where it belongs is well worth it. This film is truly breathtaking, and an Oscar caliber performance by both Buscemi and Birch as they struggle in a world where they are misunderstood and nothing seems to go right. This movie was terrific!Thora Birch does it again in another great movie.She has graced everyone in her movies ever since she was that little kid in Hocus Pocus. Thora has this wonderful artistic ability that just strikes all that see her.She could be given any role,and she could do it almost instantly,like someone with perfect pitch! I have never read the comic,so I can't compare the book to the movie,although a lot of people say that comics\/books are better.I agree,because sometimes a movie can't capture the spirit of a book\/comic.I like how movies are filmed in places you can easily go to and you can see the actual filming locations,and think that this is the place where someone was.Sometimes,you can recognize something from passing them on a highway,or seeing it in pictures or T.V. It gives me a feeling of wonder to think that here is something that happened and you're seeing it for yourself,instead of reading about it,seeing pictures,or watching a movie.As I said, Thora shines yet again in a great movie. I am looking forward to her future productions,such as the one where she is a woman behind a male rock-band on the verge of signing a major record deal. As you see Thora throughout her movies,you can see how she has matured from that little kid in All I Want for Christmas to now,both physically and personality wise.Keep up the good work Thora! The fantasy life of a teenage girl comes up against reality in this delightful dark comedy. The script doesn't sound like stock Hollywood screen-writing, which suggests that the spirit of the original comic has been preserved. And excellent performances from the supporting cast support Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi's adequate ones in the title roles.Enid is a confused teenager who likes to play jokes on people.  When she plays a joke on an old man playing around with the L.A. personal ads, she realizes that he is upset and disappointed because he WAS expecting a beautiful blond woman that he met on an airplane and Enid soon becomes his friend.Her and Seymour, her new friend then embark on a weirdly wonderful adventure (with a couple wacky characters on the way, like Ileana Douglas, as the madly inspired pottery teacher Roberta), only to have her world turn upside down when Rebecca develops a crush on Josh. The rest of the movie concerns her efforts, along with her rule-following, truth-telling friend Rebecca, she has a lot of fun finding her self-identification. Along the way she has to face her own lies and get a grip on reality.This is a somewhat fantasy, of course, but realistic in some ways. But that's small potatoes compared to the exuberant fun of this movie that every now and then actually says something true about teenage life after high school.Ghost World, all together, was a well-put film that truly entertained me (and just about everyone else in the theater). No, I'm not like Enid (OK maybe in some ways) , I'm a teen who appreciates well-written, well-cast, and well-acted films. This comedy had its moments that tickled my funny bone, and Steve Buscemi (Seymour) shined through brilliantly. While his performances constantly amaze me, I was baffled by how truly talented he was in this film; he captured his character like no other actor could. Besides being humorous, Ghost World also managed to make me tear a little bit, as Enid and Seymour's friendship was shown. The story develops perfectly, and the cast is presented just as well.I thought it would be hard to see Thora Birch as a mature actress; I remember films like 'Monkey Trouble' and wince at their childish nature. This film, even with its Zwigoff heritage, manages to overcome any immature shortcomings with the excellent Birch and the fine cast of supporting actors. The movie has many ups and downs, and the great plot and acting really lift this movie to become the blockbuster it is destined to be. The soundtrack is great, including both some contemporary hits as well. Birch is quickly becoming a star,  movies like 'Ghost World' will serve to elevate her and her work to the popularity it deserves. Go see this movie go feel good, bad, giddy, sad, and share in the delight and downfalls of the lovable Birch and Buscemi. I really enjoyed this film. It was one of those feel good, believe in yourself type of movie, and I left the theater feeling like I could go and do anything, even if someone wanted to shatter my dreams. I know a lot of people will think this movie is pointless and stupid, but they are just like a character in the film but I'm not telling who. They can't seem to enjoy anything unless they try to ruin it for anyone. This movie is realistic in a lot of ways, It shows that there are people who are full of hate in the world, It shows that if you believe in yourself you can achieve anything, and the most important, It shows that if you be yourself you will be happy. I know how Enid felt through most of the movie, being someone who wants to be found. She showed me that you can be in a big city and follow your dream, and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone, but yourself. All in all, I gave this movie a 8.5 out of 10......cynical and dark, at times their 'ghost world' seemed almost made up.The cinematography was captivating to say the least! If you like this movie, I would recommend the short film See Jane Run (2001), My First Mister (2001), the TV show Daria (1997), American Splendor (2003),American Girl (2002), Blue Car (2002) and possibly The Dangerous Lives of the Altar Boys (2002) ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2004","score":"","review":"  SPOILERS!!!!!Ghost World is the story of a girl searching for a place in the opposite end of often glamor possessed Los Angeles.

I know a lot of people will think this movie is pointless and stupid, but they are just like a character in the film but I'm not telling who. They can't seem to enjoy anything unless they try to ruin it for anyone. This movie is realistic in a lot of ways, It shows that there are people who are full of hate in the world, It shows that if you believe in yourself you can achieve anything, and the most important, It shows that if you be yourself you will be happy. I know how Enid felt through most of the movie, being someone who wants to be found. She showed me that you can be in a big city and follow your dream, and that you don't need to prove anything to anyone, but yourself. All in all, I gave this movie a 8.5 out of 10......cynical and dark, at times their 'ghost world' seemed almost made up.The cinematography was captivating to say the least! If you like this movie, I would recommend the short film See Jane Run (2001), My First Mister (2001), the TV show Daria (1997), American Splendor (2003),American Girl (2002), Blue Car (2002) and possibly The Dangerous Lives of the Altar Boys (2002) ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"3 April 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I absolutely LOVE this movie!

In this case, James dream was to go to New York City and see Empire State Building. It was actually both James parent's dreams and James dream. However, even though James parent's are long gone, James still wants to go to New York an accomplish the dream he and his parents set out to do. This is one impressive kid, he has a big heart and the kind of determination that almost no adults have nowadays. That's one lesson of the film right there , which is not to give up on one's dream, it's literally embodied in this great kid.So this special bag of magic combines with a small peach to grow into a gigantic peach which Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker capitalize for their own selfish profits!!!! Now if you think this made James's life any easier youd be wrong. Nope James's life continues as before, even worse as his rich selfish Aunt have become greedier and more manipulative and more vindictive. It's hard to believe that these aunts are the blood relative of James. Now before I go on, I couldn't help but think of James and Harry Potter. Sure Harry Potter was an orphan, but he and James are taken in by their slimy relatives who basically want to exploit and abuse them without any rights whatsover. Potter eventually escapes his vile relatives and so does James. Potter becomes one of the most loved characters at Hogwarts and James also near the end (without revealing too much) becomes one of the most loved kids in the world. Anyhow James interests in the peach grows huge to the point with the aid of the magic bad of tongues , James becomes magically converted to small size and invades the beach. Inside the beach, James discovers a group of zany characters all symbolizing common day insects who have now made James the center of attention. James meeting the characters of Mr. Grasshopper (Simon Callow), Mr. Centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), Ms. Ladybug (Jane Leeves from Frasier), Ms. Spider (Susan Sarandon), learns that they have been watching him as he is mistreated by his aunts and know that James dreams of going to New York City. Eventually James learns that the characters not only want to go with him but they are going to help him on his journey as well. This is a great movie about friendship as well. Let's face facts it's not likely James would have gone to New York on his own, but these group of wonderful friends give the help and encouragement to do it, when he needs it.When James and the group decide on a plan to go to New York City, they're journey is stalled by several dangerous adventures which include a metallic shark, dead caribbean pirates, and the hazardous condition which threaten to end their journey. However that isn't stopping anyone and James and his friends, as a group are determined to make it New York and James is determined to make his and his parents dream come true....As you can see you can describe the movie any better than better, and the movie itself is loaded with amazing special effects that elevate this entertaining fantasy world that James has now come into contact with. In fact when I first looked at the effects, I thought I was watching another classic fantasy film like in The Nightmare Before Christmas, and guess what both films were directed by the same great director, Henry Selick. I was success and an eye for greatness embodied in fantasy is a signature for Selick. He really outdoes himself here.Sony Imageworks and a trio of great animators provide the stop motion technology and animation that make the world of James and The Giant Peach so fantastic. Speaking of fantastic the voice talents in this film are all great with Sarandon, Dreyfuss , Leeves, and David Thewlis as Mr. Earthworm are great, you can tell that they captured the characters really well, but the person who outshines them is Paul Terry as James, he give's quite a performance and I couldn't think anyone better to do the role he did.So as you can see James and The Giant Peach is far from being just a kids flick, it's that kind of stupid attitude that shows the true ignorance of so called critics who we'll miss out on the many meanings of films like James and The Giant Peach. In fact one critic even mentioned that the film brings up ideas by Karl Marx for example the relationship of the slave, and master which are true in some regard, but above this a film that really does capture the spirit of having a dream and not quitting until he or she achieves that dream, because as you watch the ending, you can see in the ending, that James's dream really affects many people, not just himself.I could go and on about how great James and The Giant Peach but I think I've nailed everything good about it, all that's left now is to recommend the film to those who haven't seen it.DVD DetailsAh, the DVD is excellent coming up with several extra features*Commentary*Behind the scenes on the making of the movie* A special music video by Randy Newman who wrote several songs for the movie* A beautiful transfer of the movie shown in letterbox format.*Theatrical trailer* About 13 character sketches on the characters themselves giving a glimpseinto the artistic process of the film* Dolby Digital Surround sound.As you can see a good DVD definitely worth checking out especially if you want more details about the film.

In fact when I first looked at the effects, I thought I was watching another classic fantasy film like in The Nightmare Before Christmas, and guess what both films were directed by the same great director, Henry Selick. I was success and an eye for greatness embodied in fantasy is a signature for Selick. He really outdoes himself here.Sony Imageworks and a trio of great animators provide the stop motion technology and animation that make the world of James and The Giant Peach so fantastic. Speaking of fantastic the voice talents in this film are all great with Sarandon, Dreyfuss , Leeves, and David Thewlis as Mr. Earthworm are great, you can tell that they captured the characters really well, but the person who outshines them is Paul Terry as James, he give's quite a performance and I couldn't think anyone better to do the role he did.So as you can see James and The Giant Peach is far from being just a kids flick, it's that kind of stupid attitude that shows the true ignorance of so called critics who we'll miss out on the many meanings of films like James and The Giant Peach. In fact one critic even mentioned that the film brings up ideas by Karl Marx for example the relationship of the slave, and master which are true in some regard, but above this a film that really does capture the spirit of having a dream and not quitting until he or she achieves that dream, because as you watch the ending, you can see in the ending, that James's dream really affects many people, not just himself.I could go and on about how great James and The Giant Peach but I think I've nailed everything good about it, all that's left now is to recommend the film to those who haven't seen it.DVD DetailsAh, the DVD is excellent coming up with several extra features*Commentary*Behind the scenes on the making of the movie* A special music video by Randy Newman who wrote several songs for the movie* A beautiful transfer of the movie shown in letterbox format.*Theatrical trailer* About 13 character sketches on the characters themselves giving a glimpseinto the artistic process of the film* Dolby Digital Surround sound.As you can see a good DVD definitely worth checking out especially if you want more details about the film.

What really is there to 'get'?  Critics and moviegoers alike swore by this film, and their praises were supposedly justified by the Academy, as they gave it 5 Oscars, including Best Picture, Actor & Director. Let me say that this film was by no means worthy of the praise and awards it got.  Watching this movie today let me FURTHER know how useless and unreliable the Academy is in recognizing REAL films.  Just put AB on the long list of films unworthy of the awards & recognition it received.I just don't see the big deal with AB.  Everything I saw just came off as clichéd, worn out 'ideas', including crass overacting and a non-existent 'plot'.  What was the point of this movie?  Ok, it's a view of white middle class American suburbia; pretty obvious.  What else is there to grasp on here?  I'm actually surprised that the Academy\/media has accepted the movie as much as they did.  They're actually PROUD of what was shown here to endorse it as much as they did?  Hmph!  It goes to show you how pathetic and backwards American culture is.  It is laughable at how horrible the execution of this film is.  It's not hard to see what the makers were trying to do; they just failed to do it.  There's no direction with the film, just a bunch of tired ideas thrown together supposedly to show people just how crazy, pathetic, misguided and plain stupid white America is.  Quite frankly it made me laugh at America even more.  It'll be interesting how foreign people thought of this movie, whether they were able to even critique it without bursting out in uncontrollable laughter at the thought of an ounce of this being true.There wouldn't have been much of a movie if the characters kept their damn window blinds shut.  It is comical things like this that pull the film deeper and deeper into utter stupidity by its end.  Kevin Spacey was good in his role, but it's nothing he hasn't done before.  His performance definitely did NOT deserve an Oscar.  It's the same ol' dull, 'barely keep ya eyes open, slur your lines' Spacey we've all come to know pretty well; nothing special.  Seeing his performance only cements my belief that Denzel Washington should very well have won the Best Actor Oscar for Hurricane, a FAR more meaningful performance.  I wouldn't have minded if Russell Crowe won for his EXCELLENT performance in The Insider, his best performance to date and also way better than Spacey's performance.  Annette Bening was just pathetic to watch, way too much overacting; just a sad, poor excuse of a 'performance'.  No one else is worth mentioning acting wise.I don't see the beauty in this film.  The whole movie was just silly. Many people have already talked about it, but c'mon.. a plastic bag?  The makers just went out of their way to paint these suburban, middle-class whites as pathetic, stupid, meaningless and empty they really are.  A stalker weed head drug dealer who finds beauty in a plastic bag blowing in the wind and has a fetish for videotaping everything; a Marilyn Manson look-a-like daughter who likes getting naked in front of a window; her wannabe whorish friend who really hasn't 'done it' before and has a stupid, whorish opinion for everything; the most pathetic character of em all - the complete loser of a wife who's unfaithful and 'won't be a victim' when she actually causes, and deserves for that matter, everything that happens to her; and the ill-fated pedophile husband who feels he has to take control of his life by wacking off every morning in the shower and reliving his 'glory days' of the 60s - not limited to smoking weed, listening to Pink Floyd albums, and lifting weights to impress a 16 year old.  Can't forget the next door neighbor ex-Marine colonel who seems homophobic at first only to turn out to be gay himself; and the new male gay couple who just moved in trying to play like they're normal and make friends with everyone on the block.  I'm telling ya it doesn't get any better than this!  A world full of down-on-their-luck white so-called big wigs who don't know how to close their window blinds; and at the drop of a hat jump to complete lunacy and thoughts of suicide once things don't go their way.  All while that plastic bag blows in the wind.  'Look closer' they said.. for what?  You're not showing me anything I haven't seen before, not to mention you're showing it in the most illogical, far-fetched and utterly stupid fashion.  What a load of crap this 'movie' was.  There's a serious dogfight going on between AB and Titanic for the number 1 spot on my 'Most Overrated Films of All-Time' list.  AB is a terrible film; nothing but a big fraud - the likes I haven't seen since Titanic and Forrest Gump.  If this isn't a good case I don't know what would be but..DON'T believe the hype.  Number 29 on IMDb's Top 250..hell I won't even bother attempting to measure the credibility of that list anymore..now I've seen it all.  But why am I surprised?  LOTR ROTK is #4.

In the world of Williamson, life can follow the conventions of films, or it can completely dilineate from them. Young men in love can leap onto a table and sing to the object of their affection, and those around them will support this impromptu musical sequence.

Once Upon a Time in America is quite an unusual tale of Gangster's growing up.   It was one of it kind for it's narrative story being chopped up into different parts so we don't really get meaning of the plot till the very end.The story has to be one of the most beautiful stories I have ever heard and a depressing one at that.   It has everything you want in a story as it keeps you guessing and wondering throughout it's nearly 4 hour run but without it being that long it would have never have been that good.   This was different for Sergio Leone as we usually expect to see all his characters living in the west and wearing ponchos but what he brought to the screen in 1984 was probably the greatest gangster film of all time even beating the likes of The Godfather and Scarface.   I once said that Goodfellas was the greatest gangster film ever but that was before I saw Once Upon a Time in America.   Before this was released on DVD did anyone find it hard to find the original copy?  I couldn't find it and it was becoming incurably frustrating as I ran sacked all the Car Boot Sales to try and bag myself a copy and I then come across this man on a market stall and asked if he had a copy and he said he's got one at home and he'll bring it in for me next time he is there.   I agreed to this and asked him what his price was and he said £20 and this is for a VHS which in my opinion a classic or not is daylight robbery so I was back to square one.  The angels were listening though as a couple of weekends later they showed it on BBC 2 and I got to witness one of the greatest films ever made but it just astounds me that this movie was so rare to own after it was released in the mid eighties and even then it was a cut version so I had to rely on the TV to come up trumps with it's full version and lucky for me it did.There are some heartbreaking scenes here especially when Noodles rapesDeborah only because he knows he can't have her any other way but I think it's great how Leone let's us get to know Noodles for him to then turn his back on us and show us his evil side by raping her or attempting to I couldn't really tell if he did or not.   There is no future as far as love goes for Noodles as he doesn't know how to feel it after so much rejection.  He is a broken man and is desperate for Deborah to love him but she resists only for him to do that to her.Robert De Niro's performance is one of the best of his career especially when he is an older man because his eyes do all the talking as his age goes and his movements from place to place when reminiscing is just brilliant as the more he moves the more guilt runs through him.   He is a lost soul and doesn't see anyway of putting his past behind and getting one with the future.  His past haunts him and he won't let it rest as he grows more suspicious trying to find out why he was invited back to his hometown after being obsolete for the past 30 years and whilst that is happening he is trying to find out the truth and while this is going on we see how his life has come upon him in flashback.   De Niro is not the only reason we should watch this but James Woods also as he gives the performance of his career as Noodles best friend Max.   Once Upon a Time in America may come across slow in parts and when it's your first time it may not even make any sense to you anyway as it did me.  It took me at least three watches to get what happened and what was De Niro's smile all about but once you have got past all that and have really taken it in you will see that Leone didn't make a great film before he died but he made one of the greatest films ever made.

Most of the later movies played up on the camp value. Don't get me wrong, I love nothing more than the sometimes cheesy elements that were so prominent later in the Bond series. I mean, Moonraker is one of my favourites. I have to say, though, it's nice when watching From Russia With Love to see the sophistication and class showing through above one-liners and action. This is the most respectable Bond movie. It has a simple plot. Bond's life is the thing at stake here, not the world. Bond's mission is nothing more than an elaborate trap set up by SPECTRE, the criminal organization that would be the focus of most of the 60s movies. You get the introduction of Blofeld, in a very discreet form. Why is it that the image of a villain stroking a cat had so much more effect than actually seeing him? I will now go through my opinions on some of the standard 007 elements that make all the movies so great.BOND- Connery gives the best dramatic performance as Bond here. The humor is toned down, but Bond's confidence is what really sells in this movie. More so than in Dr. No, Connery is believable as a secret agent that can do anything, and never lose his cool.VILLAIN- Red Grant is an interesting villain, because his role is actually that of a henchman. He still remains the most intimidating villain there has been. Robert Shaw is also probably the best actor to ever play a villain in the Bond series. The scene on the train with Bond is an impressive moment for Shaw. It's more than 5 minutes long with nothing but dialogue, and it's the most exciting part of the movie. Shaw knew exactly how to play a villain well. He made him more intelligent than he was scary, thus making him scarier. Red Grant was also the only villain that I kind of wished would beat 007 in the end.FIGHT SCENE- It was made in 1963, and the fight scene between Bond and Grant has not been topped in any of the 18 movies since. It's fast and agressive. These guys fight dirty, and that's what makes it so much fun to watch. Peter Hunt has to be credited as the innovator of movie action. His editing style created the technique that is now almost a requirement of any action movie.FINAL ACTION SEQUENCE- It's Bond's life at stake here, not the fate of the world. That brings the climax to a level that's easier to relate to as a viewer. What I really like about the final action sequence of From Russia With Love is that it's totally different from what the Bond formula became. Almost all the other movies take place in one huge location. You get lots of explosions and the set is destroyed. In From Russia With Love it all takes place outdoors. There's more realism to it. And how can you not enjoy a chase scene with helicopters and boats?Final Comments. The theme song is one of my favourites. The only gadget used, the attache case, is cooler than any remote control, invisible, or underwater car. Tatiana is one of the best female characters the series has had. Rosa Klebb is maybe the most sadistic henchman\/woman, and she's sadistic while looking like a middle aged librarian from Omaha. And Terence Young did the best job ever as a Director in the Bond series. One and only flaw in the whole movie is the terrible rear projection shot, which is the last shot of the movie. Even in 1963 that would have looked poor. But who cares?

Several books followed the original along with board games and other children's merchandise.  It is also important to note that the Pollyanna character was much more glad (more on that later) and overly talkative in the book than in Disney's rendition.But Disney's telling of the story, choice in casting, and authentic 1900s period recreation could not be any better.  The film is set in the picturesque town of Harrington where all politics and decision-making are controlled by the wealthiest resident, Polly Harrington (Pollyanna's adopted aunt).  Until being adopted, the little girl Pollyanna did not live a silver-spoon lifestyle.  We soon find out that she was very poor while living with her missionary parents before they died.  This somewhat explained why she is overwhelmingly upbeat and glad.'  She plays The Glad Game with her new friends and neighbors and gradually wins over the entire town with her optimism and love.  What was so moving about this story is how this little girl made grownups realize that they should be happy to be healthy and alive.Director David Swift went through hundreds of girls to find the right Pollyanna.

Other notable characters that I loved were Jane Wyman as the prim and proper Aunt Polly, Karl Malden as the fire and brimstone Minister, Adolphe Menjou as the town hermit Mr. Pendergast, Reta Shaw as the cake-baking Mrs. Lagerlof and Agnes Moorehead as the hypochondriacal Mrs. Snow.  All of these characters had great moments of dialogue which made the story seem so real.The one thing I love about Walt-era Disney films is the attention-to-detail. And the detail in this film was incredible.  Costumes, buildings (Main Street USA, anyone?), songs, automobiles and the town bazaar are just some of the things that were authentic.  Even the preacher's (Karl Malden) passionate flamed sermons were something not uncommon in this time period.This film really showed Walt's sentimental side.  During the screening of the film, Walt wiped tears from his eyes because it was so touching.  And how could anyone not do the same?  I certainly do when I see the end.  A perfect mix of cute moments for children and meaningful points for adults, Pollyanna (like Mary Poppins) is also practically perfect in every way.

I watched that movie when I was pretty small, around 14, and I had no idea of the rating. Whenever I watch this movie, I do realise that the idea I had that it was one of the best movies ever made is not exactly true. Due to my age, I failed to notice faults, but now I can state where they are and how they spoil the movie. Firstly, I do not think Titanic deserved all those Oscars- and 14 nominations were just too much. So far, only three movies have had 11 Oscars and I think only one out of the three deserved more- ROTK. I think other movies such as Gone With the Wind, Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, My Fair Lady, FOTR, The Two Towers and a few other movies deserve to get so many Oscars.It is a pity that James Cameron had the chance to make this a brilliant movie. If he had omitted a few things and cut out some insignificant scenes (such as the spitting scenes, Jack being imprisoned in that small place when the ship is sinking, Rose's heroic role in rescuing him, all the other nameless scenes and a few other things), perhaps he would have been able to make a brilliant movie. However, he failed here and falls short of all those praises. Did anyone notice that Rose is supposed to be British and how her accent seems so put on American? Those were other flaws. I think the actors who made this movie a good one are the crew members. They made me cry. Bernard Hill, as the captain doesn't say much but he shows that sorrow so well.

I know he is a comedian and his job is to be humorous but he didn't seem like the La Motta we know in Raging Bull.  It was funny also when the documentary starts because its cuts to him and he says `When I came out of the theatre after seeing Raging Bull I felt depressed and I asked my Ex wife Vicky was I really like that, and she said no you were worse'.  To think that he couldn't get any worse than he was in the movie.   Raging Bull told the story not like the rise and fall of Jake La Motta but more the fall and fall of him.  Of course winning his heavy weight title was great but Scorsese looks more at his relationships with the people that love him like his brother Joey played Joe Pesci and his wife Vicky played by Cathy Moriaty.   The physical abuse which is given out in this film is more than you're usual take and it tells it so well.  It's nothing like Rocky or any other boxing Biopic as it shows the human side to a boxer not the just the fighting side.   It dwells in well with it's plots and has the greatest fighting scenes ever devised on film and without it being to bloody either as Scorsese shot it very artistically.

When you see someone do something but doesn't say anything, you can only speculate why that person did it. Even if the person tries to explain why, the explanation might be incomplete, might not capture the entire essence of the moment. In 2001 A Space Odyssey, Kubrick's thesis is that the events you're seeing on the screen are related to each other, and that Kubrick probably has a definite interpretation of them, but he's still not going to tell you his interpretation, because it would undermine the reality shown on the film.Some people say there is very little plot. Let's walk through the 'The Dawn of Man' sequence. We see some apes, presumably our evolutionary ancestors, barely subsisting on some barren wasteland (Africa?). We see that they're vegetarian and that they coexist with some pig creatures. We see them organized in clans and conducting yelling contests for control over a precious pond of water. Not only are the food\/water scarce, there are vicious predators to constantly worry about. Then one day they see a strange foreign object. They're at first afraid of it, but gradually they become drawn to it, as if it is subconsciously communicating to them. At the same time the sun and the moon become aligned, suggesting that the object is extraterrestrial. Shortly after this incident, one of the apes discovers that a leg bone can be used to kill the pig creatures, thereby affording a new source of food. This is quite a big mental leap for an ape, so presumably the extraterrestrial object somehow made the apes smarter. We see the apes turn from vegetarians to omnivores. They all have plenty to eat now and they've taught each other how to use bones as weapons. We now return to the two tribes bickering at the water hole again, but this time one tribe is equipped. The more powerful tribe decides to use their power to kill the leader of the weaker tribe. So while the weapons help the apes survive in this harsh environment, they also allow the possibility of war amongst themselves. And so this state of growing technology continues, to this day.Judging from the above paragraph, I don't know about you, but it seemed like Kubrick definitely had a story to tell. His way of telling it is to juxtapose related events, and it is not difficult to guess what the relationship could be (at least not for 2001A Space Odyssey). But it does require speculation, and to allow the viewer the time needed to become inspired to speculate, the film must run at a slower pace than is normally expected in other movies. Often if we watch a lot of a certain kind of movie, we tend to see their similarities and tend to expect to see these characteristics when we watch new movies. For example, the vast majority of movies contain lots of dialogue that directly reveal the plot, so we expect this sort of thing when we watch a new movie. In addition, we tend to compare the movies using these similarities as criteria; for example, we evaluate the quality of the dialogue and how cleverly it is used to drive the plot. But these evaluations are based on the assumption that our preconceived expectations are not only the norm, but in fact the way things *should* be. I disagree with this assumption, and my unqualified enjoyment of 2001 A Space Odyssey is proof of this.

Even funnier is Anita Mui, as his step-mother, who without doubt gets one of her finer roles in this movie. And the pair really works wonders on screen. The scenes involving these two are among the most hilarious I have ever seen in a movie, easily annihilating all those cheesy flicks Hollywood has unfortunately gotten us accustomed to. And the fine layer of drama is well done too, specially the tension between Wong Fei-hung and his father,  Kei-ying (played by none other than Lung Ti). You'll have guessed it Jui kuen 2 has a great cast.However, let us not forget the real asset in Jui kuen 2 because, while the humor is here and doesn't once let us down, this movie is most of all an ode to martial arts. Stunts abound in this movie, and that's what makes it so great. Every little bit of action is an excuse for Jackie Chan to amaze us with his acrobatic skills and his slightly suicidal ideas (okay, maybe &#145;Slightly' is not a big enough word!).Speaking of which, some of these stunts are extremely innovative and unique. They seem improbable, but all the actors accomplish feats. For once, all the actors are great, and each one knows what he was supposed to do, and does so SUPERBLY. This is not just Chan's movie; this is a whole team's movie. You really get the feeling that the crew had really fun during it, and this shows in the movie itself (which again reinforce my opinion that you can make a lot out of nothing with a dedicated team).The fighting is among the best you'll see in a movie. There are quite a few of them in Drunken Master 2, but the final one, against Ken Lo (a 7-time free fighting champion, and a former Muay Thai champion) is mind-blowing. Even recent movies, with all their CGI effects and wirework, fail miserably to deliver a good fight scene compared to what you will see as Chan battles Lo in the most memorable duel ever. You just have to see Lo raise his legs and keep delivering powerful kicks to believe such things are possible.I love this movie! It's an incredible feat, and without doubt the one that exposed Jackie Chan as a humoristic and martial art genius (as a choreographer anyway). The drunken style is well put forward throughout the movie, albeit a bit exaggerated, but it's all done in a way to make you actually want to keep watching the whole flick. And this is one of the very few movies that can be watched again and again &#150; I actually stopped counting after some time.Upon watching this movie, non-fans will perhaps finally realize why hardcore Jackie Chan fans keep claiming his Asian movies are vastly superior over his more recent, Hollywood flicks. Even Rush Hour, in all its glory, fails miserable compared to Jui kuen 2 (besides, there's no comparison between Chris Tucker and Anita Mui &#150; I mean, Tucker is great, but Mui is a real legend). Jui kuen 2 is of my favorite movies, and time has changed nothing to its sheer brilliance. On the contrary, it makes me yearn for more movies of this ilk.10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"3 April 2004","score":"","review":"  Behold the greatest martial art movie ever created.
