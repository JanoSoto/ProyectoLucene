Since Carrey was snubbed by the Academy the previous year for The Truman Show, Carrey's camp have been eagerly pushing this one as his second coming.  Man on the Moon is indeed a tribute to the late comedian who's comic style was not necessarily genius, but certainly off-beat.  In the movie we are treated to almost all of his best gags, most of which were meant to get a reaction from the audience, but not necessarily one of laughter.  As Kaufman experts note, often he was the only one laughing.  And even more often than not, we were never sure of what was real and what was fake. Jim Carrey does do an admiral job of imitating the comedian.  Carrey brings to life many of the old acts, including wrestling with women, portraying the vulgar Tony Clifton and appearing as Latka on Taxi.  We are also treated to the behind-the-scenes antics, as the film suggests what was true of Kaufman's stunts and what wasn't.  I remember watching Andy on Taxi and Saturday Night Live as a kid.  I also saw the Friday's episode where he started a fight and I saw the David Letterman episode where he sparred (again) with Jerry Lawler.  From that perspective, this film was well worth watching.  On the other hand, I saw this with someone who was not familiar with Andy, and they didn't seem to get it at all.  (I think that should tell you something.)So, lets change the subject, since this is not a movie so much about Andy Kaufman, as it is a vehicle to get Jim Carrey an Oscar nomination.  Should Carrey get nominated for this film?  Remember that I am writing this review well before the nominations have even been announced and the film has only been out for a week and a half.  Anyone reading after March 2000 will already know the whole sordid story.Jim Carrey is good as Andy Kaufman, there is no doubt about that.  And if we want to play true Oscar politics here, he does deserve the Oscar nod only because he was ignored for another good film, The Truman Show, last year.  A little snubbing goes a long way in Hollywood.  And let's take this a step further.  Carrey is a master comedian who had had some very funny moments in some pretty clever films (The Mask, Ace Ventura Pet Detective) that would never be nominated. The Academy likes to recognize people for their body of work.  Carrey has had an impressive decade.On the other hand, while Carrey is good, he isn't great.  From what I saw, Carrey is good at imitating Kaufman.  He does the bits just as well, and sometimes better.  He has the facial expressions and some of the vocal patterns down pat.  But when it comes time to really act Carrey doesn't seem to be all there.  When Kaufman finds out he has cancer, we see a little moaning  and crying, but not the kind of acting that Oscar nomination are made of.  Sorry, but to judge the performance on its own merits, and officially, that is what we should be doing, Carrey does not give the best performance of this year.  Man on the Moon is worth seeing.  It's a good movie with a good performance.  I don't think it's the film that Carrey should be remembered by.

However, comedy sequels rushed just to make money usually suck. This was the case with Ace Ventura 2 When Nature Calls. When I went to see Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me I expected the same disappointment and I got it.There is very little plot in this film. Dr. Evil goes back in time in order to steal the hero's mojo and rob him of his flawless and charming abilities. Austin Powers decides to follow him in order to steal his mojo back. Along the way he meets Felicity Shagwell, an American spy played by the hot Heather Graham. Together they try to defeat Dr. Evil and his henchmen.Let's take a look at what is wrong with this film. First of all, the nature of Austin Powers 2 is flawed. While the first Austin Powers movie mostly satirized James Bond, this one either makes fun of itself or nothing at all. Second, the characters in the sequel are very annoying. It seems that Dr. Evil has become the hero now. He is supposed to be cute, lovable, funny, and tough. He is everything and he probably has more screen time than Austin Powers himself. In reality, he is simply annoying. Mini-Me does not steal the show, Frau Farbissina screams every few minutes, and the jokes revolve around these annoying figures. Finally, the main thing that is wrong with this movie is the repetition of jokes from the previous Austin Powers. I counted about 20 jokes or joke sequences in Austin Powers 2 that were first in the original. In addition, they were often used more than once in the sequel. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil did the ol' zip it routine to Scott Evil (twice), because I've seen it before. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil quoted common things from the 90s as if no one knew what he was talking about, because I've seen that before as well. I didn't like it when Mustafa (Will Ferrell) fell down the cliff and complained about being hurt, but not dead, because I have seen that before. And how many times will Dr. Evil make mistakes with monetary values before it stops being funny. I think doing this twice in the original was enough. C'mon Mike Myers, you're a funny guy, let's get some new jokes.Now it's time to briefly talk about the good things in this movie. Between the annoying and repetitious jokes and the constant shameless product placements, there were a few decent moments. Although most of his dialogue is the same as before, Austin Powers has a some new funny lines. Heather Graham's acting is weak as she just can't seem to take that smirk off her face for a longer period. But on the good side, she is fun to look at. Fat Bastard is probably the funniest character, but he is just another costume Mike Myers got into. Finally, there are a few good jokes in the film. A montage of penis jokes stands out the most, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.This film is simply an expected disappointment. An annoying repetition of the elements that made the first Austin Powers film so good. This time they are not clever, surprising, or funny. I thought about giving this film a 6 out of 10 after I saw it in the movies because it had me laughing at times, but then I watched it again on tape and I don't think I laughed once. Watch the original one instead which does everything so much better and has you laughing each time you watch it. It is one of the best comedies of the 90s. Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me ruins everything. Overall, a 5 out of 10. ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2000","score":"","review":"  I like good films, but I also enjoy stupid comedies.

He is everything and he probably has more screen time than Austin Powers himself. In reality, he is simply annoying. Mini-Me does not steal the show, Frau Farbissina screams every few minutes, and the jokes revolve around these annoying figures. Finally, the main thing that is wrong with this movie is the repetition of jokes from the previous Austin Powers. I counted about 20 jokes or joke sequences in Austin Powers 2 that were first in the original. In addition, they were often used more than once in the sequel. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil did the ol' zip it routine to Scott Evil (twice), because I've seen it before. I didn't like it when Dr. Evil quoted common things from the 90s as if no one knew what he was talking about, because I've seen that before as well. I didn't like it when Mustafa (Will Ferrell) fell down the cliff and complained about being hurt, but not dead, because I have seen that before. And how many times will Dr. Evil make mistakes with monetary values before it stops being funny. I think doing this twice in the original was enough. C'mon Mike Myers, you're a funny guy, let's get some new jokes.Now it's time to briefly talk about the good things in this movie. Between the annoying and repetitious jokes and the constant shameless product placements, there were a few decent moments. Although most of his dialogue is the same as before, Austin Powers has a some new funny lines. Heather Graham's acting is weak as she just can't seem to take that smirk off her face for a longer period. But on the good side, she is fun to look at. Fat Bastard is probably the funniest character, but he is just another costume Mike Myers got into. Finally, there are a few good jokes in the film. A montage of penis jokes stands out the most, even though it has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.This film is simply an expected disappointment. An annoying repetition of the elements that made the first Austin Powers film so good. This time they are not clever, surprising, or funny. I thought about giving this film a 6 out of 10 after I saw it in the movies because it had me laughing at times, but then I watched it again on tape and I don't think I laughed once. Watch the original one instead which does everything so much better and has you laughing each time you watch it. It is one of the best comedies of the 90s. Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me ruins everything. Overall, a 5 out of 10.

However, comedy sequels rushed just to make money usually suck. This was the case with Ace Ventura 2 When Nature Calls. When I went to see Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me I expected the same disappointment and I got it.There is very little plot in this film. Dr. Evil goes back in time in order to steal the hero's mojo and rob him of his flawless and charming abilities. Austin Powers decides to follow him in order to steal his mojo back. Along the way he meets Felicity Shagwell, an American spy played by the hot Heather Graham. Together they try to defeat Dr. Evil and his henchmen.Let's take a look at what is wrong with this film.

Of course after the box office that this film grossed, (it made a lot) I am certain they don't see it that way. The script for this film was originally intended as a vehicle for Clint Eastwood with Diana Ross to star as the female lead.  I'm not too sure what happened over the years, but the script sat in limbo and the stars got too old to play those parts.  Kevin Costner got the script and originally wanted Madonna to play the female lead.  A bad mistake, to say the least, but suffice it to say, she turned it down.  In the end Whitney Houston, who was looking for something to launch her inevitable movie career took the part and history was made.The Bodyguard is the story of a former secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who can't forgive himself for the fact that he had the day off the day that Ronald Reagan was shot.  I'm sure Jim Brady would have some choice words for this guy.  (In the original script, Eastwood would have been agonizing over the Kennedy assassination.)   To console himself he works as a bodyguard for private citizens.His latest job offer is for pop diva, Rachael Marron.  She has a stalker after her and her people are keeping her in the dark as what is going on.  Even though Frank doesn't do celebrities, Rachael's people convince him to take the case.  And from here the story moves on its predictable course.  Naturally Frank and Rachael do not get along at first.  He's the serious type who puts all of his energy into his work.  She's the bitchy type who puts all of her energy into her work.  Frank finds fault in Rachael's current security and goes to great lengths to fix everything.  At the same time, a list of suspects start to come out of the wood work.  It seems that Rachael has a few enemies in her jealous sister, her over eager publicist, her macho bodyguard and some freaky looking albino guy who can't stop following her.  Some mayhem occurs, and of course Frank and Rachael start to fall for each other.  Kevin Costner is by far the most boring actor ever and this film simply serves to prove that, even though he over acts to the bitter end.  Whitney Houston is OK playing the disco queen from hell, however something tells me she didn't have to stretch too much for this one.  All in all the film follows along the typical Hollywood path of boy meets girl, boy hates girl, boy has sex with girl, boy and girl fight the bad guys and so on.  The Bodyguard is a movie that I suggest you pass on, particularly if you like some depth in your films. Whitney fans should stick to the sound track.

However, if I would throw in a second word to describe this film, it would probably be slow. This is a well made and good looking film taking place in boring Alaska. Not much happens there and everyone seems occupied with their businesses. The main character, Joe, is a mellow guy partially detached from the community. Years ago, he was involved in a boat accident where two of his friends drowned. He hasn't been the same since. He has no friends, but begins a relationship with the outgoing Donna, a singer. It turns out that her daughter Noelle, closer in character to Joe, has always had a crush on her mother's new boyfriend. One day, Joe's stepbrother comes into town and asks Joe for help. He needs Joe to sail with him to meet some customers. It is obvious that the stepbrother is in some sort of trouble, but keeps Joe in the dark about everything so Joe decides to bring Donna and Noelle along for the trip. One night, when Joe catches his stepbrother watching their surroundings nervously, he forces him to explain everything. As his nervous behavior and sudden need for Joe implied, the stepbrother has been involved in some illegal activities and owes a lot of money. He took Joe along for the trip to help him sort everything out. It turns out that the people the stepbrother was dealing with are not the reasonable type. Without revealing too much plot, the situation becomes serious as the group is forced to abandon ship and flee from those customers that Joe's stepbrother talked about.All the elements slowly led up to this interesting point in the film. As expected, there is some suspense. As Joe, Donna, and Noelle hide on a secluded island with no means of communication, they realize that their lives have been totally messed up, without them ever knowing of any danger. So they try to survive. But the film loses the suspense it built up. Instead it focuses more on character development. It dwells on the mother-daughter relationship and their problems. The movie brings out Joe's and Noelle's characters and contrasts them with Donna's. The personalities of the protagonists are an essential part of the movie, but it seems that the film abandons its tone at times to develop those personalities. When you think the suspense will pick up, Limbo slows down again to focus on its characters. It doesn't do it poorly, in fact it does it well most of the time, but after a while it seems too much and too slow. It all works well in the end, however, because the ending reflects the attitudes and behaviors that have been built up until that point. All the characters have been hurt in some way, but because of their history they have learned to look at things in a different way. The ending is very good and very interesting. It perfectly compliments the feelings of the characters, but the question is which characters are right. It addresses the issue of positive thinking vs. negative thinking. Who do you trust, and what will happen as a result? It also depends on the way the person watching the film thinks.This is a good film. The character development is done well to make this highly interesting ending work. The acting is not excellent, but good. Even though the point of the film is to focus on personalities rather than suspense, it lags at times. I felt it needed a little more life.

I really was hoping since it had a great cast (Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Jim Brown, James Woods, etc.) and Oliver Stone is a powerful director with such movies as JFK and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  Yet when I saw the movie I realized that Oliver Stone has changed since JFK.  Since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, Stone has taken the audience into a bizarre and twisted world.  A world that some will find brilliant, and others disturbed.ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is the in-depth look of professional football. Eariler this year we experienced high school football (VARSITY BLUES) and now it's time for the pro's.  Al Pacino stars as Tony D' Amato a aging coach who is struggling to get his team into a successful season.  His star quarterback, Jack Cap Rooney is thirty-nine years old, and isn't as healthy as he use to be.  The team owner and manager, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) keeps breathing down his neck on why isn't their team winning.  The team doctor, Dr. Harvey Mandrake (James Woods) is switching the medical exams of the players, so they can play.  Yet, Mandrake is endangering the lives of the players.  And to top it off, a young quarterback with a high ego is becomming the star player for the team, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). The trouble is that Beaman is doing his own plays and causing trouble among the team. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a strong look at the lives of the NFL players.  With money, fame, power, women, women, and more women, you would think that these guys have life made easy, yet they don't.  They have to face aging, younger and stronger players, teammates back-stabbing them, life threating injuries, and players who think that they are the only reason on why the team is doing good. I did enjoy the way the film looked into the lives of these men.  How the coach is under pressure with the team players and management, how the aging quarterback is trying to maintain his image, and how the young rookie is facing the negativity from his teammates.  The acting was very good.  Pacino as usual was great, but he gave a stronger and more passionate performance in THE INSIDER.  Dennis Quaid is always a delight to see, and he does a great job in this film as well. Cameron Diaz is a excellent actress, going from her ditzy role in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, to her witchy attitude in this film. Jim Brown is always a delight to see, since he was a professional football player. James Woods is always a great slimy and evil person to see, and Matthew Modine is fun to watch as a character who is the opposite of Woods character. And even L.L. Cool J was fun in this film, a lot better than his previous film, DEEP BLUE SEA. But if the film belongs to anyone, it's Jamie Foxx. The rap singer\/comedian does a great job and carries the film off well as the new popular quarterback who makes the team stand out.  I think that now, Foxx is going to be getting more juicy roles than he was before thanks to this film.  Foxx does a great job and shows a serious side to his character.  He doesn't overact or show off, he fits the role perfectly. So what did bother me with this film?  Well it was Oliver Stone's directing.  His extreme close ups on a person or a object, I will give him credit, it is original, and it has become a Oliver Stone trademark. But he's been doing it since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and even directors Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese change their visual style once in a while.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY would have been perfect had Stone direct the film more like his earlier films, SALVADOR and WALL STREET. Overall, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a great film, but it wasn't the classic that I was hoping for it to be.  I was hoping that this was the film that Stone would shock the critcs and tell them that he can still be a great director, like Speilberg did with SCHINDLER'S LIST.

I really was hoping since it had a great cast (Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Jim Brown, James Woods, etc.) and Oliver Stone is a powerful director with such movies as JFK and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  Yet when I saw the movie I realized that Oliver Stone has changed since JFK.  Since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, Stone has taken the audience into a bizarre and twisted world.  A world that some will find brilliant, and others disturbed.ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is the in-depth look of professional football. Eariler this year we experienced high school football (VARSITY BLUES) and now it's time for the pro's.  Al Pacino stars as Tony D' Amato a aging coach who is struggling to get his team into a successful season.  His star quarterback, Jack Cap Rooney is thirty-nine years old, and isn't as healthy as he use to be.  The team owner and manager, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) keeps breathing down his neck on why isn't their team winning.  The team doctor, Dr. Harvey Mandrake (James Woods) is switching the medical exams of the players, so they can play.  Yet, Mandrake is endangering the lives of the players.  And to top it off, a young quarterback with a high ego is becomming the star player for the team, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). The trouble is that Beaman is doing his own plays and causing trouble among the team. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a strong look at the lives of the NFL players.  With money, fame, power, women, women, and more women, you would think that these guys have life made easy, yet they don't.  They have to face aging, younger and stronger players, teammates back-stabbing them, life threating injuries, and players who think that they are the only reason on why the team is doing good. I did enjoy the way the film looked into the lives of these men.  How the coach is under pressure with the team players and management, how the aging quarterback is trying to maintain his image, and how the young rookie is facing the negativity from his teammates.  The acting was very good.  Pacino as usual was great, but he gave a stronger and more passionate performance in THE INSIDER.  Dennis Quaid is always a delight to see, and he does a great job in this film as well. Cameron Diaz is a excellent actress, going from her ditzy role in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, to her witchy attitude in this film. Jim Brown is always a delight to see, since he was a professional football player. James Woods is always a great slimy and evil person to see, and Matthew Modine is fun to watch as a character who is the opposite of Woods character. And even L.L.

Maybe this film was just too bizarre for me, but once I accepted the concept, it still did not make me walk out of the theater saying wow.  This doesn't make sense to me since it has much going for it.John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a brilliant puppeteer who just can't seem to make a living at a craft that he loves.  After his wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz, almost unrecognizable), suggests that he find some other means of work until the puppet thing takes off, Craig finds himself working for a filing company, LesterCorp, which is located on floor 7 ½ (a great concept in itself).  One day at the office, Craig finds a small hidden doorway behind a filing cabinet.  Naturally curious about it, he enters or should I say crawls through this space only to find out that it is a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich. This portal allows the traveler 15 minutes inside Mr. Malkovich as he goes about his everyday business until eventually spewing the person onto the New Jersey Turnpike roadside (another great concept).  Eager about the prospect, Craig informs his co-worker, the ice queen supremo Maxine (Catherine Keener) of his discovery and soon the two become partners in JM Inc., which provides the public 15 minutes of being John Malkovich for $200 a pop.  Once Craig's wife Lotte takes the Malkovich spin, she begins to question her sexual identity and her and Craig begin to battle for Maxine's affection through John Malkovich's conscience. (Yes, it sounds totally bizarre and it is, but it all makes sense somehow).  I just wished I had enjoyed it much more than I actually did, because it is not only original, but very cleaver. It just did not do much for me.Spike Jonze, who was one of the soldiers in the film, Three Kings does a great job in creating a highly conceptual film that has a lot to say about the public's fascination with celebrities, how we relate to people and how we force ourselves to fit into certain situations. Credit also goes to screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and also the acting here, which is very good. John Cusack and Cameron Diaz do fine work and both have their appearance altered from their usual norm, especially Diaz who downright looks like she need a big time scrub (and that hair, it's hysterical).  Cusack has captured the down and trodden performer who has to swallow his pride to take such a meaningless job.  His mannerisms are wonderful, all the right little tics. Diaz does a complete turnaround compared to her very strong-willed and tough as nails performance in Any Given Sunday.  She takes a role that could easily been a caricature and turns it into a complete and believable character.  John Malkovich does a good job as what else John Malkovich and he is definitely a good sport about the whole thing, but what the hell, you get to have a movie named after you.  But the standout here goes to the wonderful actress, Catherine Keener, who always does excellent work (Living in Oblivion, Your Friends & Neighbors).  To be able to make even such an ice-cold character as Maxine likable is an accomplishment.  It's a very good performance.So here is a picture that is original, imaginative, witty, well-directed, well acted, but yet I just was not crazy about it.  For me all the parts just did not add up to a very satisfying whole although I did enjoy the 2nd half of the film much better than the first and got more involved in it at that point.  Check it out though if you want to see something totally unique and original.

This spectacular, dark, funny film should be added to the best 100 films of all time.  This is filmmaking at its best and if you only see one movie this year, make it American Beauty, it doesn't get any better than this.Lester Burnhan (Kevin Spacey), 42 years old is in one hell of a major funk, even though he appears to have it all. A well paying job, a beautiful house along with a beautiful wife (Annette Bening) and a smart daughter (Thora Birch).  But deep down and really not that deep, Lester is dying inside with not much to look forward to.  Then two things happen in his life, he walks out of his soulless job and he becomes sexually fascinated with his daughter's high school friend (Mena Suvari).  Soon Lester is recapturing his youth and living life the way it should be lived.  He chucks his mundane existence for the happiness that he and all of us deserve, but of course like everything in life, there is a price to pay.  One of the characters in American Beauty says, You can't go around doing what you what, there are rules in life.   Well, Lester proves that statement is wrong and thus begins his self-odyssey in this very funny, intelligent and relevant film.  Lester is not the only character in the film to challenge that statement, but he is the only one who does it with such sheer determination, pleasure and joy.  Some critics have said that this is a film about suburbia and domestic life, but it only takes place in the suburbs and focuses on one particular family, this film go much deeper than that.  The heart of this film is about the walls and cages that we trap ourselves in that we think will bring us happiness, only to find out that they don't and that is the simple things in life, the beauty to speak of, that does it for us.Every once in a while a film clicks completely together with the writing, directing, acting characters the whole kit and kaboodle.  Well, American Beauty is complete perfection.  There is not a false note or move in this entire movie, not one small weakness or flaw.  Director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball have put together a masterpiece on life in the last part of the 20th century and some of the best performances on screen this or any other year.  The wonderful Kevin Spacey's smugness has never been put to better use than here.  Hands down, this is the best performance by an actor this year, an Oscar winning performance period (don't even mention Jim Carrey in the same sentence).  Annette Bening has never had a better role or been this good in her entire career.  Just maybe this will put her back on the map other than as Warren Beatty's wife.  It is such an honest heart-felt performance as the unhappy wife who is dead inside, but just can't come to terms with it.  A high price to pay for all the material things that she thinks brings her happiness.  Thora Birch as the their daughter Jane and Wes Bentley as the odd next door neighbor Ricky Fitts are excellent, especially Fitts who has some wonderful moments on screen.  I sure hope to see more of this young talent, rather than the damn Leo kid.I did say that the film had no flaws, but there is one tiny one I did not mention.  Eventually this movie had to end.  This year's best film, don't miss it or if you have already seen it, check it out again.

Films that take that issue and show it's seedy side are important because a lot of what you see in Hollywood simply glorifies drugs.  And I don't mean things like pot and weed and grass and such, those drugs, to me, are harmless if they are done moderately.  But what is harmful is something as potent as cocaine.  Less Than Zero is a film that takes that notion and runs with it.  There is nothing subliminal about it, nothing questionable and nothing really left to wonder what to think about heavy drugs and the affect they can have on a person.  Less Than Zero has been accused of glorifying drugs and making them look trendy and fun and popular.  But that is as far from the truth as saying that Angel Heart is a movie about a missing person.  Less Than Zero does not glorify drug use in here, it treats it like it is an abomination.There are three main characters in this film.  Andrew McCarthy plays Clay, Jami Gertz is Blair and Robert Downey Jr. plays Julian.  All three are incredibly wealthy kids.  So wealthy are they that upon graduation Julien's dad gets him into the recording indsutry and Clay goes to an Ivey League school in the east leaving behind his girlfriend.  By thanksgiving Blair and Julien are sleeping together and doing lots of cocaine and by Christmas Blair is calling Clay and begging him to come home and get Julien clean.

In this abrupt new film from director Neil Jordan (THE CRYING GAME), we see three people who want so intensely to live happily ever after, yet cannot truly have what their heart desires.It seems to be Jordan's talent to craft a film with parts greater than the whole. END OF THE AFFAIR starts out very slow, builds to an interesting conflict, then dissipates into something akin to an ending. Every film the man has directed has followed the same blueprints. Jordan is capable of amazing work (even in his loopy underrated thriller from last year IN DREAMS), but his gift certainly isn't control over the tone of his pictures. AFFAIR is set in the 1940's - during World War II - and Jordan has modeled the acting and screenwriting as if this 2000 picture was a long lost gem of the 1940's. The performances are very awkward, dialog is spat out between clenched teeth, and the character movement is more theatrical than practical. All the actors have trouble trying to convey anguish and yearning while trying to maintain the poker face needed for the era. This film needed more of the method acting approach, not a retro take on material that needs fire to come to life. And like a film of the time, the music by Michael Nyman (THE PIANO) harps endlessly trying to awaken the listless drama unfolding onscreen.Coming from two spectacular actors like Fiennes and Moore, I thought AFFAIR would have been more engaging. You never feel for these characters the way the film certainly does. The tragedy that occurs in the film is merely a tepid plot device, not one of those splendid hand-over-mouth-oh my!-type of kicks. I do give Jordan plenty of credit for this film's bile spewing rant on Catholicism (delivered with typical gusto from Fiennes). He also uses nudity with an unexpected bluntness that in the current wave of modern film, seems like true inspiration. In the end, AFFAIR comes up short.

And I really, really hate to say this, but I left the theater mildly disappointed.Was it the animation quality?  No way!  The animation was superb. Was it the IMAX presentation?  No, except for the poor transfer of The Sorcerer's Apprentice to the format.  I realize that Disney went to great lengths to restore the original print of this segment, and even processed it to remove a great deal of the graininess, but it still didn't cut it.  Perhaps it was simply asking far too much to transfer a sixty-year-old piece of film to IMAX.  Otherwise, seeing such images on such a gigantic screen was wonderful.Was it the IMAX sound?  Certainly not!  I would say that if you are unable to hear a live symphony perform these pieces live in an actual concert hall, then this would be the best alternative.Was it the interstitial segments where celebrities introduced each piece?  No.  I found nothing wrong with a little break between each musical segment.  And most of them were quite entertaining, in my opinion.So was it the music pieces themselves?  Well, the performances of the pieces were quite good (although Kathleen Battle's shrill soprano near the end of the Pomp and Circumstance segment was needless excess, and sounded awful), and the selection of music was wonderful.  But having listened to many of these pieces prior to this film, it really annoys me that they were severely cut in length and presentation.  Okay, I understand that you can't animate the entirety of The Firebird.  But when you have a piece such as Beethoven's 5th, 1st Movement, it simply seems ridiculous to me that a 5-minute music piece needed to be cut to 4 minutes.  How much more would it cost to present an animated segment that last the entire duration of this piece?So how about the segments themselves?  Well, going in orderBeethoven's 5th Terrible.  I would assume that the filmmakers wanted to begin this version of Fantasia in a manner similar to the original--an abstract interpretation of a piece of Absolute Music.  However, the images presented in the original made sense when matched to Bach's Toccata and Fugue, while the Beethoven segment made no sense whatsoever.Pines of Rome Absolutely incredible.  I would pay money to watch and listen to this segment alone.  The idea of whales flying might seem farfetched, but the way the story matched the music was phenomenal.Rhapsody in Blue  This segment underwhelmed me when I saw it, but now that I've thought about it, it's not bad.  It's incredible the way a story was created to match the highs and lows of the musical piece.  The animation style takes some getting used to, though.Steadfast Tin Soldier  I've heard this segment called Toy Story's ugly stepsister.  They're right.  I guess it's a decent story, but I wanted something spectacular and grand, and for me, it was just there, offering nothing special.Carnival of the Animals  I would compare this to the Dance of the Hours segment in the original, and it's Wonderful stuff!  Absolutely tremendous!  So why was it SO DAMN SHORT!  That's my only objection to this segment--it's TOO DAMN SHORT!The Sorcerer's Apprentice  In the original movie, this was a highlight among highlights.  But its inclusion here on an IMAX screen just destroyed it, no matter how much labor and love went into its restoration.Pomp and Circumstance  Great stuff.  Donald Duck gets to show off his unique personality and talent for physical comedy in the epic story of Noah's Ark.  SO WHY WAS IT SO DAMN SHORT!Firebird  Excellent work here, but the close of this phenomenal segment was just a bit flat.  This musical piece is widely regarded as a prime closing number for a concert, so it would seem that its place at the end of Fantasia 2000 would be a foregone conclusion.  But for some reason, the end of the piece just didn't have the emotional impact I was expecting, especially after the chills I experienced at the end of the Pines of Rome segment. So, I guess I was disappointed because two of the segments were absolute Turkeys, one should have been left alone in the original version, and two of the remaining 5 segments left me hungry for more, since they were too darn short.  Fantasia (1940) was two hours long, while Fantasia 2000 was a mere 75 minutes.  Why?  What would it have hurt to develop a few of the segments' stories a bit more, and increase the film's length just a bit?  I believe doing so would have enriched the experience.  But in examining the five new Good segments on their own, I would have to say that they were excellent.So, in short, I was disappointed because of the film's brevity, disappointed with at least 1\/3 of the movie, and disappointed that I had to pay nearly double the admission for a normal movie.  However, because I loved such a large part of the movie so much, I can't give it a bad review.

I rated this movie as excellent and I am going to explain why I rated it so darned highly.Isn't Joan Crawford the coolest? Some people jokingly call this movie Blanche's Revenge as Joan eschewed the wheelchair of Baby Jane and replaced it with an axe. (It would have been really nifty if she'd been an axe murderer and in a wheelchair. That would have kicked tail.) This movie was made in 1964, and William Castle was attempting to better his reputation--he was known for scaring people, but I think he really wanted an A-movie to his credit. After seeing Baby Jane he decided that using a bona-fide star might help him in his plan, and he pitched Robert Bloch's Strait-Jacket story to Joan Crawford. Lucky for him she agreed to do it, and he earned a little critical recognition for a change.The plot is simple enough--Joan Crawford plays Lucy Harbin, a young woman of 29 who witnesses her husband cheating on her with a former girlfriend. The shock of being thrown over drives her to madness, and she dispatches both her husband and the hussy while they sleep. The couple's three-year-old daughter Carol watches, horrified, and Castle cuts (get it?) to another shot of the daughter, now grown. She's telling her fiancée about her past because, as she abruptly puts it, My mother's coming home from an asylum. Today. That line kills me--she gave him so much time to prepare, huh? Once Lucy returns Carol begins going to great lengths to turn the present-day Lucy into the Lucy of twenty years earlier. Obviously, that isn't such a hot idea because Lucy was a murderess. Even more distressing, Lucy gives several indications that she isn't completely rehabilitated--when the asylum doctor shows up to say hello, she wigs out completely and runs screaming from the room. Eventually, anyone and everyone who discovers Lucy's imbalance gets offed. Is Lucy regressing or has she been usurped? That is the basis of the movie's surprise ending, which I of course didn't figure out. (My mother did, but she always does.) Okay, so why is this movie so entertaining? If you guessed Joan Crawford, you guessed right. William Castle's idea works wonderfully. He chose someone who would give her all to make sure a movie worked, and that's what happens. At the time, Joan was sixty years old, give or take a few, and she throws herself into the role of a 29-year-old with gusto. (She doesn't succeed, but she tries.) Her character starts out as a brunette, brazen floozy-type and ends up a gray-haired timid middle-aged woman. It doesn't seem like such a big difference on paper, but when you see the difference between Joan's first and second entrances it's quite effective. Also, who among us knew (besides Christina Crawford, apparently) that Joan could swing an axe like that? Move over Lizzie Borden, Joan's on the warpath! And the seduction scene with daughter Carol's fiancée? I don't think a movie has ever made me squirm so much. It's horrible, but you can't look away--Lucy goes through about fifteen emotions in less than fifteen minutes. Just thinking about it makes me feel icky, and nothing really happens. That's the weird part--nobody does much of anything, but it's so damn disgusting. (The DVD features a little making-of featurette, and one of the film historians says in a awed tone, She actually puts her finger in his mouth. I guess it bothered him too!) If I had to choose the one part of this movie that raises it over other movies of its ilk, it would be the first murder scene. The moment where Lucy, poisoned with anger and wielding an axe, wreaks havoc on her sleeping husband. I just feel that a jealousy-crazed woman brutally murdering her husband would have the same look on her face as Joan does in the scene. It's absolute blind rage and she has no control over it.

And the seduction scene with daughter Carol's fiancée? I don't think a movie has ever made me squirm so much. It's horrible, but you can't look away--Lucy goes through about fifteen emotions in less than fifteen minutes. Just thinking about it makes me feel icky, and nothing really happens. That's the weird part--nobody does much of anything, but it's so damn disgusting. (The DVD features a little making-of featurette, and one of the film historians says in a awed tone, She actually puts her finger in his mouth. I guess it bothered him too!) If I had to choose the one part of this movie that raises it over other movies of its ilk, it would be the first murder scene. The moment where Lucy, poisoned with anger and wielding an axe, wreaks havoc on her sleeping husband. I just feel that a jealousy-crazed woman brutally murdering her husband would have the same look on her face as Joan does in the scene. It's absolute blind rage and she has no control over it. To be blunt, she looks like an insane killer and she is more than a little creepy doing it. I just thought of another great part--at the end of the picture the Columbia Pictures lady has been beheaded. Cute little touch, huh?

I had a great time with my friends figuring out what would happen which we did halfway through the movie. They tried so hard to make it unusual it wound up being easy to guess.The plot is lame, the dialogue hackneyed and the car chases look like they were designed by a 14 year old - with every cool' gimmick in the Hollywood Car Chase Handbook. The sex scenes, gratuitous at best, must have been done by the same teen-age boy.We were screaming at the TV saying Oh please, do NOT show us Bruce's ... but alas, we were not to be spared.The overwhelming tragedy in the whole enterprise is that the supporting cast, as talented a bunch as you'll ever get in a group (with the exception of Jane March), must have needed work desperately to sign up for this mess. If the likes of Brad Dourif, Lance Henrickson, Kathleen Wilhoite, Leslie Ann Warren and Rubén Blades cannot rise above the material you know it's crap - though they do make a valiant effort. Eriq la Salle is mercifully spared a lot of exposure in this pre-ER effort and what there is for him is really hard to ruin. Scott Bakula's murder at the beginning was a mercy-killing for the likeable actor.Bruce Willis looks great - but he really has to avoid any films that completely lack humor - he is stilted and uncomfortable and you can see he is trying desperately to keep his trademark smirk from popping out.It does have the potential to become a cult semi-classic - I can imagine people screaming at the screen and the thing is worth watching if only for the nail-gun stuff.

It was just so flat! There was no tone, no point of view, nothing. I think Minghella was trying for the reserved, distanced style Hitchcock could do that would draw attention to the psychological depth of the character, but all he gets is reserve and distance, and even at the end we remain at a total distance from the character, just watching his actions. I could only guess what Hitchcock could do with this story.SPOILERS LIE AHEADAs far as the ending, I think what he was going for was to leave us with the sense that Ripley is going to improvise again... but it's dramatically dead since his improvisations up until that time haven't been really played up or made interesting. It could have been a good, mysterious and haunting ending... but since the rest of the movie doesn't really support it I think it fell much flatter than another ending would have, and I think that is in a large part responsible for audience's lackluster response to this movie. I think Minghella ought to think about taking some more creative chances to make scenes interesting and convey tension or emotion. This film is flat like the pancake. I don't think it deserves any oscars at all... not even nominations.And one last thing... isn't the phrase How far would you go to become someone else a QUESTION? And aren't questions usually followed by QUESTION MARKS? I don't think it was a mistake-- I think someone at Miramax actually thought it might be cool and disjointed and po-mo to exclude the punctuation... but it makes the tag line ABSOLUTELY DEAD and it makes everyone at Miramax and everyone involved in this film look ILLITERATE. Better luck next time.
