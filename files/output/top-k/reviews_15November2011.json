It's not the sort of the film that troubles award committees or quickens the heart-rate of critics. But audiences lap these sort of films up and especially guys who enjoy explosions and gun fights and various macho activities. Which I do but this effort never really steps it up and seems perfectly happy to remain in third gear without getting anywhere near top speed.Professional hit-man Robert Rath (Stallone) is looking to get out of the game as age starts to catch up with him. After he misses out on a contract thanks to rival Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), Rath is offered a shot at $2 million. The target is an anonymous electronics whiz (Julianne Moore) who's trying to arrange a deal with some shady Dutch types in Seattle. But Bain is never far behind and as Rath begins to question his orders, both of their lives are in danger.Stallone, looking much younger on the film's poster than he does in the movie, is a strangely monotone hero (if you can call someone who kills or money a hero) and at no point do you feel, support or root for him. Banderas is much more engaging but this is because he's an evil equivalent of El Mariachi from Desperado. Gun in each hand and hair in front of his face, you know the look. Anyway, the pair of them tear through the scenery with plenty of gusto and the action is satisfying enough even if it is a little old-school. The plot is pretty formulaic and predictable - in fact, the only real surprise is the lack of a sex scene. So far, so what? It couldn't be any more average if it wanted to be but Assassins does have a couple of interesting trivia points. The script, written and then disowned by the Wachowski brothers (creators of the first 21st century action movie The Matrix), isn't as bad as they reckon but it doesn't offer anything new or different. The director, Richard Donner, knows his stuff when it comes to the action genre but it doesn't feel like a quality product - all the guns sound silenced for some reason and there is an explosion which is badly imposed on the footage and gives the sense of a budget being ran dry. I also can't figure out why they paid Stallone such a vast sum of money for his performance because for $15 million, I'd at least expect a flicker of emotion or some facial movement. But the only things that move on Stallone's head are his eyes and lips and personally, I wonder if the Wachowski's disowned the script after they'd seen the movie.

While these four are clinging to their own feelings, remembering the past and all, the older couple (Lane's mother and her step dad) seems to be having a good time and making some plans for the future that might upset the eternally depressed Lane.With this crossed couples and their broken hearts, Allen touches us by saying that we shouldn't be attached to anything. We shouldn't be so attached to other people (because they disappoint you no matter the relations you had with them); we shouldn't be attached to things (as later is shown when Lane's mother wants to sell Lane's house and we have this huge argument about the good connection, the memories they had with the place); and most of all we shouldn't be so attached to our memories (perhaps the most dangerous of the ties).

Sorry that most just don't get De Palma. He doesn't make films for the Academy worshipping crowds. He makes actual works of art. De Palma doesn't make movies for critics either. Oh, sure, De Palma is 'flawed', but so are most, if not all, true artists. But, his 'flaws' mostly only show when he is working for major studio Hollywood films. But even then he is so far superior to anything general generic Hollywood can dish out, in my opinion. He is one of the last of a rare dying breed of filmmaker, in the same vein, style, and category of the likes of Godard, Felini, Antonioni, Lelouch, Kubrick, Hitchcock, Welles, Wilder, Bergman, and such. To truly get him and appreciate him, one must realize that his films go far beyond mere storytelling in the conventional sense, not making the typical plot-driven drivel, but visual feasts, that stun the senses, and tells stories visually, with his camera movement and style. And, Snake Eyes is one of those type of films, where the 'story' is in the camera movements, not necessarily the script. Keeping in check with so many common themes that have run consistently throughout De Palma's career (the trouble with the double, betrayal, conspiracy, etc), De Palma wastes no time taking viewers inside his noirish conspiracy thriller set in Atlantic City during a hurricane. His opening shot flows for over 15 minutes, uninterrupted, introducing every character you need to know in that short time frame. He interweaves between TV point of view to the actual casino in record breaking time, and in breathtaking fashion. Between the very first shot of the politician and his entourage, including two powerful characters in the film played by Gary Sinise as Kevin Dunne, a political figure played by John Heard, Nicolas Cage as Rick Santoro, perfectly cast as an over the top cop on the make, a sleazy news reporter (played by Kevin Dunn), a bookie that owes Santoro a dept (played by Louis Guzman), the boxer Lincoln Tyler (played by Stan Shaw), his promoter, and everybody else involved in the 'conspiracy', as well as everything you need to know about the story, whether seen or heard, are all shown to the viewer in that short time span.

From a mysterious redheaded woman to a blonde who is revealed to be a brunette with a wig on (played by Carla Gugino), from following a bloody hundred dollar bill to a ruby red ring, De Palma sets us on the coarse, working from a great script by David Koep (who scripted Mission Impossibe and Carlito's Way), putting things right before your very eyes, and\/or in your ears, just to have you questioning everything and everyone you see on screen.

Sorry that most just don't get De Palma. He doesn't make films for the Academy worshipping crowds. He makes actual works of art. De Palma doesn't make movies for critics either. Oh, sure, De Palma is 'flawed', but so are most, if not all, true artists. But, his 'flaws' mostly only show when he is working for major studio Hollywood films. But even then he is so far superior to anything general generic Hollywood can dish out, in my opinion. He is one of the last of a rare dying breed of filmmaker, in the same vein, style, and category of the likes of Godard, Felini, Antonioni, Lelouch, Kubrick, Hitchcock, Welles, Wilder, Bergman, and such. To truly get him and appreciate him, one must realize that his films go far beyond mere storytelling in the conventional sense, not making the typical plot-driven drivel, but visual feasts, that stun the senses, and tells stories visually, with his camera movement and style. And, Snake Eyes is one of those type of films, where the 'story' is in the camera movements, not necessarily the script. Keeping in check with so many common themes that have run consistently throughout De Palma's career (the trouble with the double, betrayal, conspiracy, etc), De Palma wastes no time taking viewers inside his noirish conspiracy thriller set in Atlantic City during a hurricane. His opening shot flows for over 15 minutes, uninterrupted, introducing every character you need to know in that short time frame. He interweaves between TV point of view to the actual casino in record breaking time, and in breathtaking fashion. Between the very first shot of the politician and his entourage, including two powerful characters in the film played by Gary Sinise as Kevin Dunne, a political figure played by John Heard, Nicolas Cage as Rick Santoro, perfectly cast as an over the top cop on the make, a sleazy news reporter (played by Kevin Dunn), a bookie that owes Santoro a dept (played by Louis Guzman), the boxer Lincoln Tyler (played by Stan Shaw), his promoter, and everybody else involved in the 'conspiracy', as well as everything you need to know about the story, whether seen or heard, are all shown to the viewer in that short time span.

It was with this in mind that my brother brought this movie around; another nostalgia piece we both saw at the time and one to compare the recent 'quake stuff with. The first thing you notice when the Big One hits is how long it goes on for. We had two (7.1 and 6.4 on the Richter scale), six months apart; both went on for well under a minute but they both left a hell of a mess. The one in 'Earthquake' is a cataclysmic eight-minute event, and frankly that wouldn't leave so much as a dog-house standing. Millions of people would have died. It took weeks before our city looked as good as LA does in 'Earthquake' but several characters go blithely motoring unimpeded through miraculously clean, level streets on their missions of mercy. No massive road-blocking piles of debris, no impassable upheavals, no road-clogging streams of abandoned cars and most oddly, no people. No dazed wanderers, prone injured, rubber-neckers, cops, soldiers, rescuers, medical teams, salvagers or looters; the streets are completely deserted. Having one of the official gathering-points situated in the basement of a large building is just insane. It's like trying to escape a flood by hiding down a sinkhole. Absolutely the last place anyone feels like going after a quake is into (or even worse, under) a large building, even if the authorities advised you to. Which they wouldn't because it's so monumentally stupid. Elsewhere there's the frankly laughable rickety-looking construction Richard Roundtree is supposed to ride a motorcycle through. It's so dodgy that not even the movie's stunt-rider could negotiate it, judging from the editing. What's worse is that the 'loop the loop crash' stunt footage is actually repeated, only the second time you're supposed to think it was successful. Early in the movie a state official balks at the logistics of evacuating four million people. Looks like somebody went ahead and did a great job anyway. Either that or everyone bar what seems to be a few hundred remaining victims took it into their minds to visit their uncle Bob and Auntie Susie that weekend. That makes it all the easier for Charlton Heston and George Kennedy to do pretty much all the rescue work in the 'red zone'. Also the ill-fitting 'psycho Jody' sub-plot was bizarre and jarred with the main plot. It was pointless except to subject an afro-wigged Victoria Principle (done up as Cleopatra Jones) to some short-lived menace. In real life, Jody would have been quickly relieved of command by being disarmed or killed by his men. Here they just kind of live with the triple murder and later on they even let him have a love-slave. In closing mention must be made of the shoddy special effects, not least of which is the infamous 'elevator crash' with its bright cartoon blood-splashes. Must have had Porky Pig aboard.

So low on everything just like Texas Chainsaw Massacre but still people believe to think that they saw gore and blood. But they were so wrong. It is the atmosphere and the way of filming that created this classic. Due the fact that there is a lot of talking in it still you are attracted to the screen because John Carpenter did an excellent job. But don't forget the cast in it who are all believable and giving the best of themselves. Halloween was low budget and started a new era in horror. The slasher genre. Friday the 13th was written soon after Halloween and they wanted to copy the story but on a location and look, another classic was born. Both had some kind of supernatural killer and a soundtrack that still sticks in your mind after all those years. Friday had K-K-K-Kill Ma-ma-ma-ma and Halloween had the well known riddle made by Carpenter. As I said before you also have to mention the way the camera was used. Extreme long shots and shots revealing things after a while. Funny was to see that on television The Thing(1951)was playing. John remade it 4 years after Halloween. But naturally Halloween had it's problems with releasing it on DVD. That's a strange thing because there's no gore or blood in it as I said before so in Europe it was released at 87 minutes, the US version was 93 minutes and the NBC extended version was 104 minutes. I have seen all versions in one day just to see where they have added something or had made some cuts. The difference between the US and European version lays in the fact that there were more cuts in the nudity. Okay, there wasn't that much nudity in it, only in the beginning and P.J.Soles making love with her friend. In the U.S; version there's more to see from her breasts then in the European version were they cut out the nipple shots. But it's the extended version that had a difference of 11 minutes. here in Europe it isn't that easy to find the extended version, it's available on a German limited release but it easy to get in the US. NBC bought the rights for 4 million dollar of Halloween to show it on television. But the Standards and Practice Department made a cut in the original movie so NBC didn't had a full feature anymore to broadcast. John Carpenter was asked to shoot some extra scene's to beef up the running time. John agreed and 11 minutes were shot in conjunction with the production of Halloween 2. Debra Hill brought John back for a 3 day shoot with stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. It was edited to the original feature ready for a NBC broadcast. For many people the extended version isn't a need to see but for Halloween buffs it's a must see. There were 4 separate scene's, the best being Loomis' talk with Michael when he was a child . The scene follows just after Michael has killed his sister, and it's the longest scene. We see Michael as a child, a part that was important in Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. Here you see Dr. Loomis talking to Michael at Smith's Grove but naturally he's not responding. Many had a problem with it stating it as taking the horror from Michael away because you can see his face and was wearing normal clothes. Another television scene involves Dr. Loomis discussing Michael's release with the hospital board. It didn't deliver an extra to the flick but it gets a bit deeper into the mind of Loomis. A third scene is of Loomis visiting Michael's room after his escape. The room is shattered and trashed with the word sister scratched into the back of the door. The final scene involves Laurie answering her door and finding her friend being followed by Michael via a station wagon. So in fact non of those scene's had any gore or red stuff in it.I have said it before, it hasn't any red stuff but it's the score and the eerie atmosphere that gives the creeps. Some things just take too long before things happens but it is that waiting that works. Just look at Michael waiting disguised as a ghost at a door before doing his killing. A creepy shot, or the way he looked when he pinned a boy at a door. You can see that he had no feelings or whatsoever. A must have in a horror collection just like Carpenter's other flick The Thing.

Leone's spaghetti westerns are most memorable for turning star Clint Eastwood into a western icon overseas, while he was a Hollywood reject here in the United States (he was also starring at the time in the popular American TV series Rawhide).For a Few Dollars More is a better film than its 1964 predecessor A Fistful of Dollars, largely because it has better acting, better direction, better pacing, better Ennio Morricone film score, and is also a much more brutal and violent film than A Fistful of Dollars.And Eastwood was certainly gaining speed as a movie star with his second outing as the anti-hero Man With No Name who does in fact have a name here, Manco. As the Man With No Name, this time out Eastwood's a bounty hunter trying to capture the recently escaped convict Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang of hardened gunslingers.But unfortunately for him, the Man With No Name is not the only bounty hunter in town gunning for Indio and his boys.

A Walk to Remember concerns itself with the uncompromising love of two teenagers Landon (Shane West) and Jamie (Mandy Moore). Because at that age all love was uncompromising. Landon, a preppy jock who hangs with the popular crowd gets in trouble with the law and as punishment has to join the drama club...cause that happens. There he struggles but is helped by the bland and boring Jamie who Landon and his friends used to make fun of. She confides in him and tells him she has a list of things she wants to do in life. From there blossoms a romance to the bereavement of Jamie's minister father (Peter Coyote).The book written by Nicholas Sparks set the story in the 50's but the film version tries to transplant the story into the 2000s. What results is a film whose values and aw-shucks-ness is dated upon arrival. The director and writer seem to have never set foot in a high school and as a result feel the need to populate the screen with as many pretty looking 20-year-olds as they possibly can. The ensemble is complete with Mandy Moore's unconvincing frumpyness, popular kids who have nothing better to do than belittle others, and a token black guy who calls everyone bro. Shane West can't act his way out of a paper bag and the eventual story resolution is just outlandish and silly. I wish everyone looked like Mandy Moore when diagnosed with leukemia. Shouldn't she be, I don't know, losing hair, losing weight, getting pale, throwing up etc.? It's one thing to embrace a socially conservative viewpoint like this film does, but its another thing entirely to gloss over or ignore certain realities. You seriously want the audience to believe pretty boy Landon rarely saw Jamie in a sexual light? Female audience members certainly saw Landon that way thus one of the few reasons this film has ever been popular.Had this unconscionably bland movie been forgotten as it should have been, I may have been more forgiving in my judgment of it. But with a perplexing rating of 7.1 and an enthusiastic following, I simply had to knock it down a peg or two.http\/\/theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A word to the wise; if you're going to make an emotionally manipulative film you should probably make the story, or at the very least the actors convincing.
