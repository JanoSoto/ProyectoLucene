Kenneth Branagh utterly excels as both an actor and a director. While I preferred his quieter moments as the erratic, unstable, melancholy Dane, he was never less than entirely engrossing in the role. I recently watched an interview with Eartha Kitt from the 1980s where she said that a problem with the arts at the time - one which has gotten worse since - is that there were too few artists and too many people who were simply entertainers, singling out Olivier, Orson Welles and Edith Piaf as being fantastic artists. As far as actor-directors go, I think that Branagh is the finest living artist. His frequent use of very long takes, something which is seen in many of his films, was magnificent. One of the best parts in the film is the scene in which Hamlet encounters his father's spirit (Act 1, Scene 5 of the play). I loved the fact that Branagh used extreme close-ups of both himself and BRIAN BLESSED as I felt that it added greatly to the scene's intensity. The cinematography is excellent, the sets and costumes are gorgeous and the beautiful Blenheim Palace was a great choice for Elsinore Castle. It was an interesting choice to set the film in the 19th Century and one which I thought worked incredibly well.Branagh assembled a fantastic cast for the film, particularly Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Julie Christie as Gertrude, Richard Briers as Polonius, Nicholas Farrell as Horatio (perhaps the least interesting major character in the play), Michael Maloney as Laertes (who previously played Rosencrantz in Franco Zeffirelli's 1990 version) and BRIAN BLESSED as Hamlet's father (who, against type, never speaks above a whisper!). Kate Winslet was good but I thought that her Ophelia paled in comparison to Jean Simmons' in Olivier's version. The film also has great cameos from the likes of Charlton Heston (who is brilliant as the Player King), John Mills, John Gielgud, Judi Dench and Richard Attenborough. When I think of Shakespearean films, Jack Lemmon, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams are not the first names that spring to mind but all of them do surprisingly well, with Williams as the foppish Osric getting the funniest scene in the entire film. Lemmon appears in the first scene and I have to admit that it took me a while to accept him in the film as all I could think of were all those hilarious films that he made with Walter Matthau! I don't think that he was entirely comfortable doing Shakespeare but he acquitted himself well.The film was deservedly nominated for four Oscars (Best Art Direction, Best Costume Direction, Best Original Score and Best Adapted Screenplay) but was ignored in the more major categories. If I had my way, it would have received nominations for Best Actor (Branagh), Best Supporting Actor (Jacobi), Best Supporting Actress (Christie) and Best Picture and won them all too. For my money, it's one of the very best films of the 1990s and one of the best ever made. At a whopping three hours and 58 minutes, this is the second longest film that I have ever seen, after the extended version of The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King which runs about four minutes longer. Both of them are also among my absolute favourite films, with The Return of the King being No. 12 and this film being No. 13. Richard Attenborough seems to be my good luck charm as he's the only actor to appear in three films in my Top 20, the other two being The Great Escape (No. 5) and A Matter of Life and Death (No. 15). Of course, the writing's not half bad either, is it?

Terry's brother Charlie is Friendly's right hand man and because of this, Terry happens to accidentally get involved in the murder of his friend Joey Doyle. Terry begins to become conflicted about testifying against Friendly once he is given the chance and overall questioning the entire nature of the union, all while falling in love with Doyle's younger sister Edie, played by Eva Marie Saint.The great Elia Kazan directs the film beautifully. Kazan is very well known for his films that discuss many social and political issues; he did so with Gentleman's Agreement in 1947, and later did so to a lesser extent with films such as A Streetcar Named Desire and East of Eden. However in many ways, On the Waterfront shows itself to discuss an issue that appears much more personal to Kazan than any other film he has ever done. The film, in a broad sense, discusses various themes of social corruption among a community. While this is not a literal issue that Kazan had went through, it is very representative of an issue Kazan had went through with the House Committee of Un-American Activities in 1952. Kazan was a former communist and once he left the communist party, he began to feel shame and also a bit cheated after he realized the nature of the party. Afterwards he was a pretty strict anti-communist, and when the committee asked him to identify fellow former communists, he did so. Kazan was highly criticized for this and it caused him to lose many friends in the film industry. The reason he was so hated by some for this was because this was the time of the Cold War and the United States was incredibly anti-communist and they were starting to blacklist certain people who identified with the Communist party, this included filmmakers. So not only did Kazan cause many of these people to be discriminated against because of their political beliefs, but many careers were also ruined because of this. On the Waterfront is widely regarded as being Kazan's response to this criticism and his feelings towards the Communist party, and this is what causes the film to be one of Kazan's most personal films.Given knowledge of the back-story, some scenes in the film feel like Kazan is directly talking to the audience and confessing his opinions on what he did. Towards the end of the film and after Terry has testified against Johnny Friendly in court, nobody on the waterfront besides Edie and Father Barry will talk to him as they all view him as a traitor. Later as he tries to go back to the docks to work, he is denied it. He then goes over to Friendly's dock and yells for him to come outside. When Friendly comes outside, the two begin to yell at each other in argument and Terry says You think you're God almighty, but you know what you are? You're a cheap, lousy, dirty, stinkin' mug! And I'm glad what I done to you! Ya hear that? I'm glad what I done. It is in these words that the viewer begins to get the feeling that Kazan is talking directly to the people who criticized him for his decision. Kazan directs the film with an incredible amount of passion for the subject matter, and this is very evident when you watch the piece itself.One of the strongest points of this film is one that is incredibly strong in all of Kazan's films, the performances by the actors. While it can be attached to being because of Kazan, the reason the performances in his films are so strong is because he actually does not give them an immense amount of directions and rather gives them freedom to do what they want. This is clear in many ways, from the way he casts his actor by not having a screen test but rather going out to dinner with them, getting to know them personally, and, what appears most in his films, the camera angles. Many directors will have a lot of complex camera angles during even the simplest dialogue scene, but Kazan does not do this, as doing too many angles leads to cutting too much and causing the actors to constantly break character. What Kazan does, and one scene in particular that stands out, is he simply places the camera in a certain spot and leaves it, giving the actors more freedom to control the scene. The one scene in the film that most stands out because of this is the scene where Terry and Edie are walking in the park after leaving the church. The camera is placed diagonally from them and simply pulls back as they walk. The scene goes on for many minutes and the camera does not break this entire time. Kazan does not control his actors or make them work by his standards, but he simply gives them the scene.The scenes between Marlon Brando and Eva Marie Saint are some of the most beautiful scenes between two characters in any film. The two appear to have very open and honest chemistry with each other. The way the two of them look at each other, talk to each other, and the mannerisms they have when talking, shows a sense of shyness towards the other in both of them that best communicates their feelings toward one another in a non verbal sense. The fact that Brando and Saint were in no way romantically involved during the making of this film just further demonstrates their incredible talents. These scenes are what show the true nature of their characters, and is an example of truly beautiful acting.

Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor\/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film.

Based off, Ken Kesey's novel of the same name and directed by Milos Forman, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest tells the story of Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convicted criminal admitted to a mental ward, when he pleads insanity, to escape labor duties in prison. Once there, the rebel, wild-man, McMurphy bump heads against the authority figure, and head administrative nurse, the oppressive Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher) on the way, she treats her patients. McMurphy believes that they should be treated like real men with more personal freedom, while Ratched couther his argument by stating that any more freedom, would lead to chaos, anarchy, and death. In my opinion, while she play as the villain, she's in fact, she was somewhat, right and correct by her judgment, but the way, she enforced order on the mentally disable in highly crude and inhuman. In fact, by egging McMurphy on, she made things much, much worst. One might view this movie as anti-institution, anti-religion or anti-government. One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the civil unrest. It deeply changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America, while also challenging, how government should treat its people. By the end of the 1960s, the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization has become, a real deal, while trust in government officials were in an all-time low. When 1975 came, most of the mentally ill found themselves, untreated and living in the streets and government being highly criticism for corruption and overused of power. The 1970's were bit anarchism at the time. It wasn't until later, that things became more balance and confinement. In a way, social institutions do serve a purpose; and the movie serves as allegory tale, showing how things like order vs chaos can become really off-balance. The movie really goes into deep detail on how different authorities, McMurphy and Ratched control individuals through subtle and coercive methods. A supporting character like the Chief (Will Sampson) talks about 'the Combine' in reference to the mechanistic way, both manipulate and process individuals. Nurse Ratched controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of emasculation and subtle shame. While, McMurphy controls his fellow men by encouraging them to be wild men and challenge conformism. It was no surprise that both Louise Fletcher and Jack Nicolson won Best Actor\/Actress at the Academy Awards that year, as both delivered such a gripping, gritty, and genuine performances. The movie has just as good, supporting cast with several unknown actors of the time, stars like Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, and Brad Dourif helping in. I like how the movie was shot. Forman's direction is dead-on, as he manages to capture the monotony of routine on the ward without allowing the film to drag. You get how eerily quiet it is. Order is impose on the patients with almost religious cult-like rigor. When the medicine is delivered. It's like communion. It's so zombie-like. The animal running along a man-made chain fence- representing wild vs civilize. The movie is full of hidden gem themes like those examples. Yet the movie was missing a few things from the novel such as the Fog which symbolize a lack of insight and an escape from reality and McMurphy's Moby Dick Boxer Shorts, which interpretation as a phallic symbol and blatant sexuality. It can also represents the pervasive evil that inspires Ahab's obsessive, futile pursuit. Both Ratched and McMurphy is trying to humiliation the other, by exposing the faults of each other's gender. A third interpretation is that Moby-Dick stands for the power of nature, signifying McMurphy's untamed nature that conflicts with the controlled institution. Although it's hard to find fault, it's certainly possible. Overpowering women are seem to evil by the writers and weak women are shown to act like sex object. It's somewhat noticeable that the movie is a bit misogyny. Another thing, is the movie's love letter message to society anarchy and black and white approach when it comes to, the hospital vs the patients. Another fault of the film is how the Chief was cut down as the narrator and put into a much smaller role. Much of his life prior to the hospital was not shown. You see a lot of Native-American themes throughout the film, despite that. The music by Jack Nitzsche, sounds something out of a western. It's represented the struggles of true freedom over confinement. Despite its dark and strong drama undertones, there were some comedic tendencies. It was a lot of fun to watch, as the drama slowly evolves into tragedy toward its conclusion. It's wasn't slow and painful. It was a very entertaining, well rounded film. The movie has aged well, with newer DVD copies, putting out the best quality for it. Overall The film is powerful, and moving. It's a must-watch. I recommended it.

In the early scenes we see Malcolm X (Denzel Washington) starting out as a criminal under his accomplice named West Indian Archie (Delroy Lindo). He starts by robbing houses along with his assistant Shorty (Spike Lee) and joining his for the ride is a hot young blond named Sophia (Kate Vernon) with whom he chooses as a love interest over a much well-behaved African-American girl named Laura (Theresa Randle). Later on, Malcolm ends up incarcerated and opposing the Biblical teachings from Chaplain Gill (Christopher Plummer) and seems more on the side of African-American Muslim convert Baines (Albert Hall). Once he's discharged, he become the top followers of the Nation of Islam under the influence of Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.) Malcolm X becomes a charismatic celebrity, which the white press so arbitrarily decided to lash out controversy towards this young radical. As his bravado increased proportionately, the Nation of Islam became very envious about it while the Nation of Islam becomes a part of a scandal involving Elijah's illegitimate children.Malcolm eventually married Dr. Betty Shabazz (Angela Bassett) and raise three wonderful daughters. He then makes a religious journey to Mecca and declares that not all Caucasians are not entirely evil. When he returns to America, he breaks ties with the Nation of Islam and establishes a rival church that fits the modern spirit at the time. The Nation of Islam did not take this very well and at the Audubon Hotel in Manhattan on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was beginning a speech when a disturbance takes shape, Malcolm tries to calm everybody down and was gunned down (one of the shooters was his former friend Baines). The movie itself was very high in terms of budget in spite of the very gargantuan production costs. Denzel was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor in a leading role, but sadly was ousted by Al Pacino for his role in Scent of a Woman. Washington had to wait several years before winning the Leading Actor Oscar in the film Training Day. The film itself was quite accurate in the time period clothes making it very authentic and the lingo spoken by the characters was very appropriate during the time period. The costume design was also in Oscar contention as well. The other high point was that many scenes were very well filmed, especially the uproar during Malcolm X's assassination.Sure it was praised by many including myself, there are still quite a few issues that didn't sit very well with me. Some of these were small nit-pickings while others were much more bigger that truly hindered the film from being anything but perfect. Where to start was the singing performance by Miki Howard, who was supposed to play the part of Billie Holiday, but her voice doesn't even come close to even sounding like her. Anybody who listens to jazz and Big Band music know Holiday's familiar voice. It wouldn't have hurt if she just lip-synched from a Holiday soundtrack and it would have been more convincing. Lee really should have known better. The more obvious falsifications come from the character Sophia. She's hanging out at an all black girls nightclub and just freely throws herself in Malcolm's arms with no indication as to he is. I'm sorry but that is very illogical. It's just a scene designed to get male viewers' attention. It would never happen to you even if you have Washington's looks.It seems strange that the Nation of Islam has a hostile attitude to Washington who at the time looked decent, well-caring family man who loved his wife and kids. Did he munch on pork rinds at the time? Who knows?Another unanswered question stems from the scene where he stands up the cops after they unmercifully beat the tar out of a black man. Malcolm brings in a group of identically dressed black men to await for his command. Where did he find them and how did they fall into his lead? And what's the purpose of them acting like soldiers? To me they're there to look cool behind the camera if nothing else. And finally I must wonder what does Malcolm X himself truly stand for? He transforms from a thief in his early years, to a radical Islamic radical and finally reconsiders his thoughts long enough and before you know it he's murdered. Sure his mission was to for equality, but his execution was more radical rather than peaceful. He was separated from most of his life and wanted his fellow people not to anticipate with anything the white majority did and joined a church who eventually turned against him by having him killed. These quibbles are what brought this movie down. I think some editing should have been greatly desired as this movie went on too long and many scenes needed further explanation. But other than that, the performances were excellent an Washington acted his heart here as the the other performers. But the illogical scenarios brought this film down from being an absolute masterpiece.

This movie fits under all of those genres and is one of the worst in each one of them.The Basic plot of Basic Instinct is that a powerful man was murdered during sex and the prime suspect is the manipulative crime author Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) who was at the time of his death, the victim's girlfriend. The case is assigned to Nick Curren (Michael Douglas), a detective that hasn't had sex in some time and is very suspicious of Catherine. While investigating Nick seems to fall for Catherine but will the case and his heart begin to be too much for him to handle?When you lay the plot out like that it seems pretty simple. Guy investigates girl and the two fall in love with each other and end of story. Well that's not quite the case with this story as it does expand a bit from the dense romantic storyline and tries to involve other characters in the stories plot. That being said if you're going to make the story more complicated you have to do it right and this movie doesn't. They steer away from the most interesting character in Catherine and make it a mystery between the only two characters that he knows. The entire investigation is the worst mystery I've seen in movies in some time. There is no depth in the story telling as it's all just shoved in your face.Speaking of shoved in your face there are many sex scenes in the movie. Now I'm not a prude but generally there is a meaning to sex scenes in movies. This film does have sex scenes that are useful to the overall plot but then there are a few that are less than useless as they detract from the story. They shouldn't have cut all the sex scenes as that is sort of the idea of the movie but they should have taken out about half of them as they didn't need to be there and just saturates the film with unnecessary scenes. A large part of having sex in movies is the shock value and if you have five or six sex scenes within the movie it loses that shock value.One of the great things about bad movies is that you can watch them and pick out the various plot holes and mistakes made within them. You can just about pick any scene in this film and there will be something wrong with it that is either a production fail or a hole in the plot that doesn't make sense. The entire movie's plot shouldn't be happening form the start as in the second scene there is a massive plot hole. The body was found after the victim had sex with the murderer and was killed. There were traces of semen on the bed so obviously the murderer didn't clean up so why didn't they find any of the murder's DNA? Also while you're watching the movie just pretend that alibi means something other than its actual meaning.The acting in this movie is well below par with not one person doing a good job. The role that you could stand out the most is Catherine the super smart manipulating and seductive possible murderer. This role is not fleshed out or acted well by Sharon Stone as she makes her a pretty one dimensional boring character when there was so much possibility. The chemistry between Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas is almost non-existent and is in no way believable which could have been almost believable except for the bad acting. The only real positive for the movie is the classic scene where Catherine flashes her vagina while being interviewed by police. Everything falls into place well in that one scene and it's a shame the rest of the movie wasn't as good as that scene. Don't see the movie just look it up on YouTube.Overall Basic Instinct was good idea that got lost in translation and wasn't executed well through a saturated plot line and bad acting. I recommend this film to all the mothers out there that like Fifty Shades of Grey. I you're looking for interesting characters and a good story you might want to look somewhere else.I rate this movie a 5\/10.

There is no depth in the story telling as it's all just shoved in your face.Speaking of shoved in your face there are many sex scenes in the movie. Now I'm not a prude but generally there is a meaning to sex scenes in movies. This film does have sex scenes that are useful to the overall plot but then there are a few that are less than useless as they detract from the story. They shouldn't have cut all the sex scenes as that is sort of the idea of the movie but they should have taken out about half of them as they didn't need to be there and just saturates the film with unnecessary scenes. A large part of having sex in movies is the shock value and if you have five or six sex scenes within the movie it loses that shock value.One of the great things about bad movies is that you can watch them and pick out the various plot holes and mistakes made within them. You can just about pick any scene in this film and there will be something wrong with it that is either a production fail or a hole in the plot that doesn't make sense. The entire movie's plot shouldn't be happening form the start as in the second scene there is a massive plot hole. The body was found after the victim had sex with the murderer and was killed. There were traces of semen on the bed so obviously the murderer didn't clean up so why didn't they find any of the murder's DNA? Also while you're watching the movie just pretend that alibi means something other than its actual meaning.The acting in this movie is well below par with not one person doing a good job. The role that you could stand out the most is Catherine the super smart manipulating and seductive possible murderer. This role is not fleshed out or acted well by Sharon Stone as she makes her a pretty one dimensional boring character when there was so much possibility. The chemistry between Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas is almost non-existent and is in no way believable which could have been almost believable except for the bad acting. The only real positive for the movie is the classic scene where Catherine flashes her vagina while being interviewed by police. Everything falls into place well in that one scene and it's a shame the rest of the movie wasn't as good as that scene. Don't see the movie just look it up on YouTube.Overall Basic Instinct was good idea that got lost in translation and wasn't executed well through a saturated plot line and bad acting. I recommend this film to all the mothers out there that like Fifty Shades of Grey. I you're looking for interesting characters and a good story you might want to look somewhere else.I rate this movie a 5\/10.

This movie fits under all of those genres and is one of the worst in each one of them.The Basic plot of Basic Instinct is that a powerful man was murdered during sex and the prime suspect is the manipulative crime author Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) who was at the time of his death, the victim's girlfriend. The case is assigned to Nick Curren (Michael Douglas), a detective that hasn't had sex in some time and is very suspicious of Catherine. While investigating Nick seems to fall for Catherine but will the case and his heart begin to be too much for him to handle?When you lay the plot out like that it seems pretty simple. Guy investigates girl and the two fall in love with each other and end of story. Well that's not quite the case with this story as it does expand a bit from the dense romantic storyline and tries to involve other characters in the stories plot. That being said if you're going to make the story more complicated you have to do it right and this movie doesn't.

This movie is not meant to be taken seriously and it is apparent that the entire cast were just having fun and goofing around while making this film.

I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's café. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his café started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's café.

KRAMER is a heartfelt film that explores the effect that divorce has on those involved, and the difficult choices that come along with it. The film starts off by introducing all of the principal characters. The mother, Joanna (Meryl Streep) is putting her child (Justin Henry) to bed, and Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is having a late-night talk with a co-worker. By the time he gets home, Joanna says she's leaving him and the plot is set up. What follows is a long series of scenes which show how Ted has to adjust to being a single parent, and culminates in a courtroom battle as Joanna, after a long period, fights for custody of her son. What I feel like the film does well is not paint everything as black or white. Ted isn't portrayed as a wholly perfect father, yet Joanna isn't portrayed as a villain. I will say, however, that not as much screen time is allotted to Meryl Streep so that her character's motivations come off as a bit selfish at first. Still, the meat of the story is in how her decision to leave affects her husband and child, and there was certainly a lot to process. There were plenty of ups and downs and the film is able to effectively show how the father's relationship with his son matures and develops over time. The performances were also top-notch, even from the child actor portraying the son. This is a very emotional film at times, and every such moment felt real and believable. You actually care what happens to these people. Overall, while certain surface aspects date this film a little bit, the emotional core is very strong and the performances only make things that much better.

Is it really the most daring film by filmdom's greatest director? Or is it a convoluted, disengaging mess?Actually, it's both, but what's bad outweighs what's good.A shape-shifting beauty named Marnie (Tippi Hedren) makes a peripatetic life for herself changing jobs and social security numbers to gain access to company safes and steal cash. Hers is not an easy life; her mother, the only person she cares about, withholds her love; but Marnie makes enough to support her two great passions horse-riding and keeping men at bay. Her luck runs out when her next job lands her with employer Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), who not only recognizes Marnie from one of her past crimes but is intrigued by her.To start with what's good, Marnie looks wonderful, with cinematographer Robert Burks framing every shot with meticulous care and taste and taking maximum advantage of the two attractive stars. Connery's usual suavity finds a fascinating vehicle in Rutland, a smooth operator who describes himself as an interested spectator in the passing parade but is really more of a predator who sees in Marnie both a challenge and a conquest. Diane Baker as Mark's sly sister-in-law Lil makes for a pleasantly distracting rival to Marnie.You can see in Marnie a lot of the sexual politics of the past 50 years playing out before you. Rutland wants Marnie in the form of a possession (I thought it might be interesting to keep you around). Marnie sees men as the enemy (Oh men!

The only suspense is whether Marnie will allow herself to be cured.Late in the film, there's some talk about whether Mark is nuttier than Marnie, which would make things interesting, but it is never developed. Instead, the film gets most of its suspense and mystery probing Marnie's psyche, which makes an already difficult film more so.

Is it really the most daring film by filmdom's greatest director? Or is it a convoluted, disengaging mess?Actually, it's both, but what's bad outweighs what's good.A shape-shifting beauty named Marnie (Tippi Hedren) makes a peripatetic life for herself changing jobs and social security numbers to gain access to company safes and steal cash. Hers is not an easy life; her mother, the only person she cares about, withholds her love; but Marnie makes enough to support her two great passions horse-riding and keeping men at bay. Her luck runs out when her next job lands her with employer Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), who not only recognizes Marnie from one of her past crimes but is intrigued by her.To start with what's good, Marnie looks wonderful, with cinematographer Robert Burks framing every shot with meticulous care and taste and taking maximum advantage of the two attractive stars. Connery's usual suavity finds a fascinating vehicle in Rutland, a smooth operator who describes himself as an interested spectator in the passing parade but is really more of a predator who sees in Marnie both a challenge and a conquest.

The film opens on a particular freshman year at the school and concludes four years later.Along the way we meet Montgomery McNeill (Paul McCrane), the neglected son of a famous actress who despite his lonely childhood, still finds the business enticing. Maureen Teefy is wonderful as Doris Finsecker, a painfully shy teen who has been pushed into the business by her mother, but does come out of her shell at the school and discovers a talent for acting. Irene Cara plays CoCo Hernandez, a triple-threat know-it-all, who learns that she doesn't know as much as she thinks she does. Lee Curreri plays Bruno, an electronic keyboard genius who loves sitting in front of a keyboard but is at a complete loss at how to act in the real world. Barry Miller is brilliant in an Oscar-worthy turn as Ralph Garcy, a bitter Latino teen who is trying to bury his resentment about his father deserting him as a child by being a stand-up comedian. The late Gene Anthony Ray also shines as a dancer who only came to the auditions to partner a friend who wants to get in the school, but he is the one who has the talent, a star in the dance studio, but not so much in the classroom who constantly butts heads with Miss Sherwood (Anne Meara), the school's hard-nosed English teacher.Just like a real-life school, students come and go as the years pass, most notably in the sophomore year, where we meet Hilary Van Dorn (Antonia Francheschi) a snooty rich dance major who comes between a budding romance between CoCo and Leroy and has her own career aspirations derailed in the process.This film is riveting from jump as we watch students going through the painful audition process and struggle to develop their talent while keeping up their academic studies as well. The actors are pretty much perfectly cast, with standout work from Miller and Meara.Alan Parker's direction is breezy and energetic, giving all of his very talented cast a little time in the sun and Christopher Gore's screenplay is surprisingly bold and uncompromising. The musical numbers leap off the screen, thanks to some inventive choreography and strong vocals, particularly Cara, whose rendition of the title tune won the Oscar for Best Original Song.A movie that will have you tapping your toes and wanting to watch over and over again.

Oscar winner Mira Sorvino stars as Susan Tyler, an entomologist. She comes up with a plan to eliminate cockroaches in NYC, which are now spreading a fatal disease dubbed Stricklers' to the city's children. Her solution is to contrive a new hybrid species of roach - the Judas - which will wipe out the roach population, while being supposedly unable to breed themselves. Three years later, the so-called solution is now the problem, and the Judas breed has done a lot of evolving - and has proved itself capable of breeding after all. (As Ian Malcolm of the Jurassic Park story would have said, Life found a way.) Now Susan and a select few others descend into the bowels of the city to try to put an end to things once and for all.After clashes with Bob Weinstein, Del Toro ultimately disowned the film, but at least in more recent years his original directors' vision has become available on Blu-ray. Over all, it's a richer, more satisfying experience than the theatrical release. Granted, at some points some of the characters start to grate on the nerves, but in the end they regain ones' sympathies and rooting interest. Donald A. Wollheims' story was adapted by Matthew Robbins and del Toro, and the filmmakers take full advantage of some very spooky concepts and settings. This directors' cut, running 112 minutes, is deliberately paced but quite suspenseful, and features striking digital effects and creature designs by (among others) the legendary Rob Bottin (The Howling, The Thing, Total Recall).Not all of the characters get fleshed out all that much, but the cast gives it their best effort. Josh Brolin and Oscar winning veteran F. Murray Abraham are kind of wasted, but their presence is still very welcome. The beautiful Sorvino is very credible and is playing a reasonably strong woman. Jeremy Northam plays her husband, Giancarlo Giannini is endearing as a middle aged shoe shine man with a young son (Alexander Goodwin), Charles S. Dutton is typically commanding as a subway cop, and Norman Reedus fans will thrill to see him in a small role.Mimic does require the viewer to pay attention, because key exposition is divulged in a very quick manner, but it rewards them in kind.

It stars Kitano, Kayoko Kishimoto, Ren Osugi and Susumu Terajima. Music is by Joe Hisaishi and cinematography by Hideo Yamamoto.Yoshikata Nishi (Kitano) is a loose cannon police detective who quits the force after a tragic incident results in his partner, Horibe (Osugi), being confined to a wheelchair. His retirement brings him the time to care more for his seriously ill wife Miyuki (Kishimoto). Nishi can find no peace, though, more so as he has borrowed money from the Yakuza to pay for his wife's needs, and they are growing impatient for the repayment...Very early in Kitano's superb slice of Japanese neo-noir there is a piece of graffiti on the wall, it says Drop Dead, while Hisaishi's music is a devilish accompaniment to the scene. It's ominous and foreboding, setting the tone for what is to follow. Pic is deliberately paced, beautifully so, with the opening nonlinear approach and scattergun shifts in time adding a sort of psychological maelstrom to the impending narrative darkness.Yet to suggest it as a perpetually bleak picture is doing it a small disservice, for Kitano (himself working from a damaged psyche that occurred in real life) has this adroit eye for poetic beauty and human tenderness that marries up with bursts of violence and emotionally shattering passages of play. And it works brilliantly, with stabs of humour also filtering in via the outer frames. Nishi the character is a force of nature and a walking - brooding - contradiction, a man pained behind his sunglasses, his expressionless visage amazingly still saying so much. When he explodes the impact is doubly strong, mainly because dialogue is so sparse, but the interwoven visuals - very much a Kitano speciality - strike an almighty chord for the story. To which we edge towards the finale, which unsurprisingly brings beauty and infinite sadness.Unfussy camera work, sabre sharp editing (Kitano & Yoshinori Oota), elegiacal musical arrangements, art, kites and Kitano's intense performance, this rounds out as film making greatness. In fact, a masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 March 2015","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Hana-bi (AKA Fireworks) is written and directed by Takeshi Kitano.

His retirement brings him the time to care more for his seriously ill wife Miyuki (Kishimoto). Nishi can find no peace, though, more so as he has borrowed money from the Yakuza to pay for his wife's needs, and they are growing impatient for the repayment...Very early in Kitano's superb slice of Japanese neo-noir there is a piece of graffiti on the wall, it says Drop Dead, while Hisaishi's music is a devilish accompaniment to the scene. It's ominous and foreboding, setting the tone for what is to follow. Pic is deliberately paced, beautifully so, with the opening nonlinear approach and scattergun shifts in time adding a sort of psychological maelstrom to the impending narrative darkness.Yet to suggest it as a perpetually bleak picture is doing it a small disservice, for Kitano (himself working from a damaged psyche that occurred in real life) has this adroit eye for poetic beauty and human tenderness that marries up with bursts of violence and emotionally shattering passages of play. And it works brilliantly, with stabs of humour also filtering in via the outer frames. Nishi the character is a force of nature and a walking - brooding - contradiction, a man pained behind his sunglasses, his expressionless visage amazingly still saying so much. When he explodes the impact is doubly strong, mainly because dialogue is so sparse, but the interwoven visuals - very much a Kitano speciality - strike an almighty chord for the story. To which we edge towards the finale, which unsurprisingly brings beauty and infinite sadness.Unfussy camera work, sabre sharp editing (Kitano & Yoshinori Oota), elegiacal musical arrangements, art, kites and Kitano's intense performance, this rounds out as film making greatness. In fact, a masterpiece. 10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 March 2015","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Hana-bi (AKA Fireworks) is written and directed by Takeshi Kitano.

The whole movie was funny and continued to be funny. Godfrey stayed serious throughout the whole movie and had a great personality. Even though he was living on the streets, you could tell he was a straight up intelligent man. Irene is a nutty girl who fell for Godfrey. She did everything she could to be with Godfrey. Throughout the movie, Irene would talk really fast when she was talking to Godfrey. She wouldn't let him get a word in showing her dominance. Powell was great during the movie. He was a man pulled off of the streets to butler for a wealthy family. It was a joke to the family, but he didn't see that. He was serious while Irene was acting ditsy to him every moment.
