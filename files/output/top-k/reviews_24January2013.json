This film is an Underrated Classic and has a Cult following that is well-deserved.King Of New York tells the story of a gangster and drug lord named Frank White(Christopher Walken)who has just been released from prison and reunites with his former crew to wipe out his rivals and take back control of the drug game. While Frank is doing that,a group of New York cops want to take down Frank by any means necessary and try to stop Frank's rein as the King Of New York.King Of New York while a Great film and Cult Classic now,suffered from bad timing and unfortunately came out right around the same time as another Great New York set Gangster film Martin Scorsese's classic GoodFellas so KONY was basically ignored and overlooked by audiences as a result,but thankfully KONY was rediscovered through home video and was immortalized by the late great Hip-Hop icon The Notorious B.I.G who called himself The Black Frank White. One of the reasons I love KONY is the way it shows New York City a few years before the Big Apple was cleaned-up by Mayor Rudy Guiliani,the film shows New York as this dark and gritty place where drugs and crime have affected New York City,giving the film a sense of danger and gloomy atmosphere and a world where gangsters rule the streets.The screenplay by Nicholas St. John is well-written and memorable,giving the character great,realistic dialog,speaking in the tone and toughness of the streets. I also love the moral ambiguity of Frank White and the rest of the characters. Frank White is one of the best characters I've ever seen in a gangster film and in my opinion should be alongside Michael Coleone and Tony Montana as a gangster icon. Frank White is a character where one of the rare times in a gangster film you can relate to the main character because even though Frank is out of prison and back with his old crew,you feel that Frank is isolated and alone and lost too much time when he was in prison. And with Frank you may not always like his actions or the things he always or sometimes does but you like the character because one minute he's dealing with his rivals and drugs,while at the same time wanting to keep a hospital open. There's good and bad in Frank White and that is one of the things that makes Frank White a great character and so iconic. There's also a moral ambiguity with the other characters as well such as Frank's crew and the cops. Where in most Crime Dramas it's easy to figure out who's the good guys and the bad guys,it's not that easy with this film because you don't know who to root for and you don't who to root against. It would be easy to label Frank's crew the Bad Guys because they're dealing drugs and killing people and label cops as the Good Guys because the cops represent the law,but there is big a gray area that is in the film because you will love Frank's crew because of the things they do or hate the cops because of what they do or vice versa. That's one of the things I love about KONY is that nothing is what it seems and there is no easy answer. The Action and violence in the film is dark,gritty and violent and not for the faint of heart and it truly fits and matches the dark tone of the film showing viewers how the gangster lifestyle and drug dealing can be violent and horrible and the film doesn't glamorize the violence. The ending of this film is excellent and unlike most gangster film,this movie doesn't end with a bang,but in a sad,quiet way and one of the reasons KONY is a classic.The whole cast in the film is excellent. Christopher Walken gives one of his best and most iconic performances as Frank White,with Walken bringing an intensity,cool and calm demeanor to the role. Excellent performance by Walken. Laurence Fishburne gives a great,stand-out performance as Jimmy Jump,Frank's gun blazing right hand man. Fishburne is funny in the film and has great lines. David Caruso and Wesley Snipes are wonderful as Dennis and Tommy,two cops who want to nail Frank. Victor Argo is great as Roy,Dennis and Tommy's partner. Paul Calderon(Joey Dalesio),Janet Julian(Jennifer),Giancarlo Esposito(Lance),Steve Buscemi(Test Tube),Theresa Randle(Raye),Carrie Nygren(Melanie),Leonard L. Thomas(Blood),Roger Guenveur Smith(Tanner),Joey Chin(Larry Wong)and Frank Gio(Arty Clay) give good performances as well.The direction by Abel Ferrara is excellent,stylish and visually stunning,giving the film a great dark and gritty tone,while using different colors and always moving the camera. Great direction from Ferrara.The score by Joe Delia is wonderful,sad,energetic and melodic and adds to film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great Hip-Hop tracks by Schooly-D like Am I Black Enough For You and Saturday Night. Great tracks.In final word,if you love Abel Ferrara,Christopher Walken,Gangster Films,Crime Dramas or films in general I suggest you see King Of New York,a true Gangster classic that will stay with you after watching it and a film that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

You can now find my reviews on Cinemasickness.com\/Teamsickness.I take it upon myself to re-watch movies to see if they are worse or better than I remember. I reviewed this film as my 200th review. Consider this a rewrite. Since then I saw reviews saying that this was a film to see and it was some peoples favorite film, which is weird but I am not one to judge people. I am here to judge this film. Is it better or worse than when I reviewed i?. Well believe it or not, it somehow manages to be worse than before. There is no other film that has made me more disgusted and has made me angrier than Meet The Feebles. This movie is so bad that I could analyze and nitpick every single thing wrong about this film but I'll spare you the time. When I revisited this film I saw at least 15 things that I left out of my original review. So let's get started.Heidi The Hippo is upset because, during rehearsal, Trevor The Rat insults her. Heidi Runs to her lover Bletch The Walrus (Which provokes interesting thoughts) and Bletch comforts her. Beltch is secretly having an affair with Samantha The Siamese Cat (and shows you all of their Interactions). We also have Harry The Hare who gets sick after Little Bunny Froo Froo went hopping through the forest. Also a hedgehog who is in love with a poodle, a chicken married to an elephant, a drug addicted frog and the walrus doing drug deals. This I can not make up.Well the story is a good place to start. The main story itself is buried under so many ridiculous subplots it's awful. Also the movie does not know which story to go to because the film keeps jumping around like I just opened a can of Jumping Beans. The stories are terrible, every single one of them. Now all of the plots I mentioned are only half of what is in the film. The rest are either not worth mentioning, or I can't put them in this review or else the wonderful folks over at IMDb Would kick me off forever. We wouldn't want that now would we? The characters... are the most disgusting and vile creatures I have ever seen. The Hippo is star hungry, The walrus is money hungry, The frog is a drug addicted wreck, The rabbit likes to go hopping without protection, The rat is an adult film director and plus there is an Indian running around with his head up his own Rectum! What the hell is going on here? I feel like someone was taking a ride on the LSD train while writing this. These Characters Are Mean-Spirited and soulless. You want investing characters? HA! Don't be ridiculous! There are no characters that you can invest in. Well there are 2 but to be honest they only have 4 minutes of screen time each. Thats not Good.This movie also tries to pass itself off as a musical. I find that hard to believe because there is not a single song in this worthless piece of trash that you can remember, and if you do remember the songs, they stick in your head until you want to put a gun to your head and pull the trigger. The soundtrack includes such classics like, I got one leg missing, The S***** Song and the always classic Garden Of Love. Meet The Feebles does not pass as a musical. A comedy that does pass as a musical is the 1999 film, South Park Bigger Longer & Uncut. That movie was also a satire, and it worked. This does not. Oh, and by the way, Just what the hell is this movie trying to be a satire of, because I'm not seeing it. Apparently, My intelligence is no match for this film.The Ending. This movie features, without a doubt, the worst ending in a feature-length motion picture I have ever seen. There will be spoilers but in all honesty you should stay away from this film. The ending starts with Heidi Trying to commit suicide by hanging herself but due to her being fat(Ha-Ha), she falls down to the basement. She then grabs a gun and decides to go on a shooting rampage. By this point in the film I wanted strangle myself, but I pushed on because there was less than 10 minutes left. She literally kills everybody but 6 people. The Hedgehog and the Poodle have kids(I'm Not sure how that would work), The Elephant and his son live a quiet life, And the worm retires. The next moment made me so mad I wanted to punch the screen I was watching. The Hippo gets only 10 years and then goes to work in a supermarket. Are you kidding me?!!? Have you had any criminal history. Oh nothing big, just that I went on a big shooting rampage and killed over 50 people. Your Hired!.

It is not schlock, the violence and suspense are gripping and plausible, there's no 'silliness'. You commit to what is on screen almost immediately. M. Night Shyamalan (who has a small but pivotal role as well as writing and directing) is a genius of creativity. He doesn't spell the plot out for you as if you were stupid, as much American film\/TV tends to, but a lot of background is outlined in the opening sequence before anyone has spoken a single word, just by paying attention. Informational conversation is realistic and whilst it informs the viewer it still makes sense in terms of the characters, so the viewer has to piece it together rather than being presented with it. Brilliant writing - can't praise that enough.Over all the film is fantastic, there's nothing that I can fault really. All performances are perfectly gaged; Mel Gibson is great, Joaquin Phoenix in perhaps my favourite role and he looks amazing ;-) and the two child actors Rory Culkin and the adorable Abigail Breslin were played naturally and just right. There are no massive bells and whistles in terms of big budget SFX, sets and contrivances, the film offers its 'kicks' on suspense and the less-is-more, almost for-the-stage, attitude to filming. It was filmed, by appearances, simply and often in the dark, using limited light to add tension. The musical score adds tremendous amounts of depth, drama and spook-factor and silence is used cleverly too. What builds a crescendo of dread is the narration given by television news reels, often on in the background, and that reporting adds realism to the plot- You get a view of the outside world, and imagine what it would be like if anything like this happened. Some of the worst bits of the film are things you barely see but have you on the edge of your seat, just like Merrill (Phoenix) watching the TV, and you need to keep your wits about you if you are going to see all the connections as nothing is superfluous in this film it seems.The title, Signs, refers to the crop circles but also in the context of faith and belief, and the emotional roller-coaster in this film is based around Graham Hess' crisis of personal Faith and the element of predetermination or lack of coincidence in our everyday lives. It is both touching but also challenging, and as the film keeps you intimate with the action using up close shots and unusual focus on eyes, to draw you in, so you are brought to think about how you feel too as another onion layer. Whilst a very tense film, there are delightful smiles and laughs dotted throughout, and some moments of comedic laugh out loud genius (Phoenix has some great timing) and even having seen it before, it still doesn't fail to please, entertain and thrill on every level.

This movie hasn't aged that well.When you look at other timeless classics such as Star Wars, Spielberg's Indiana Jones, Alien, E.T and so on, they certainly have aged very well and still are certainly watchable and can either be feared or called epic Unfortunately, the same cannot go for Jaws, at least in my belief.As I was watching this movie, I was so impressed with the first half of the movie, the build up where a few people get killed and they attempt to close all beaches that I couldn't wait for the final part of the movie. The first half contained everything a movie needs; great buildup to a movie. Remember, the Empire Strikes Back. We watched 90 minutes of build up before the Luke vs Vader duel. Remember Helm's Deep from Lord of the Rings? We had a lot of build up to the final battle. Same went for Return of the King; the first half of the movie was all build up to the epic conclusion. The problem with Jaws for me is that the first half gets me so excited to see how everything will conclude that once it did, it was thoroughly disappointing.What I meant with It hasn't aged well is that by now, the shark really looks pretty bad and unrealistic. However, we can appreciate all the trouble Spielberg went to get the shark to come onto the big screen back in '75. Also, the acting is good and the story is good but another little issue is that John Williams' soundtrack to the movie doesn't add much tone anymore.Maybe I over hyped the movie but the ending seemed so sudden. When Hooper finally goes underwater to see the shark, there was only 10 minutes of the movie left. Also, back then, this movie may have been an absolute masterpiece and true horror but now, the story of a shark killing people is kind of stupid. That isn't to necessarily say I found it stupid. I didn't. But its another example of why this movie hasn't aged all that well. Whilst Hooper and Brody are good characters, Quint isn't necessarily the same.Jaws may be regarded as a cult classic but whilst this movie is great in its first half the final half of the movie to me is a massive let down and extremely slow.

When I first heard that Stevens was making the story of Christ, I was baffled. My first question was why? It may be the greatest story ever told but it is also the oldest. Is there a single person on this planet who does not know the story? Then when I saw that Stevens was casting every star in the world for the film I was truly incredulous. How could any film with all those stars not collapse just because of the sheer weight of so much star power? Mike Todd succeeded with Around the World in Eighty Days but that film was nothing like Jesus' story and in fact lent itself to so many stars each one of which was perfectly cast and it was fun to look for them as the mammoth production unrolled. But Jesus' story is hardly the kind of vehicle to lend itself to such theatrics and ultimately the ploy simply becomes part of the overall problem with the film. It ends up being just too ponderous in too many ways to be enjoyable. It's way too long and has way too many scenes that just do not make any sense. The script departs from scripture in a most annoying way, for example, when an apostle's coat is stolen and Jesus lectures him on giving everything he owns away.

I think A Place in the Sun is one of the great films of all time. What he did with the close-up in Sun is nothing short of miraculous - he literally reinvented the close-up and in the process elevated Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift to stellar status. When I first heard that Stevens was making the story of Christ, I was baffled. My first question was why? It may be the greatest story ever told but it is also the oldest. Is there a single person on this planet who does not know the story? Then when I saw that Stevens was casting every star in the world for the film I was truly incredulous. How could any film with all those stars not collapse just because of the sheer weight of so much star power? Mike Todd succeeded with Around the World in Eighty Days but that film was nothing like Jesus' story and in fact lent itself to so many stars each one of which was perfectly cast and it was fun to look for them as the mammoth production unrolled. But Jesus' story is hardly the kind of vehicle to lend itself to such theatrics and ultimately the ploy simply becomes part of the overall problem with the film. It ends up being just too ponderous in too many ways to be enjoyable. It's way too long and has way too many scenes that just do not make any sense. The script departs from scripture in a most annoying way, for example, when an apostle's coat is stolen and Jesus lectures him on giving everything he owns away. Just does not work and it's not even according to scripture.

It's amazing that Penny Marshall was able to make one of the better movies about baseball. Really compelling characters by almost everyone on the team where they're all real characters and not just a handful of main characters and the rest being just glorified extras like how it normally goes.While the movie has a very ensemble feel to it, it still mostly focuses on Geena Davis and Lori Petty playing sisters. Tom Hanks is great as the washed up former MLB star who's now forced to manage the womens team. Even Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell do good in their supporting roles.

But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness.I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed.
