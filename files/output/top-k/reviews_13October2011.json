It might be hard to sit through it all, but by the time it ends the film gives you an unexplainable emotional feeling to it, it definitely was relaxing and beautiful ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2011","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I rate it 5 out of 10 because the cinematography was great, the acting was great, and surprisingly it kept me intrigued until the end to see what was going to happen, but thats about it.My problem with this film like many others say is that its LONG, 3 DAMN HOURS LONG, and im actually VERY surprised that I was able to sit through all of it, but as I got to the second part I just wanted it to end, and the only reason I watched it until the end was because it had such a high rating I thought the ending part was going to pick up and be amazing...But too bad, it turns out that I watched a 3 hour long film, and really didn't understand it to much and realize now that all that waiting was for nothing, I'll admit it, maybe I don't see the amazement to this because I really don't understand the story to much, but either way, it was way to long..Remember, its a 5 because I thought everything else was amazing, still check it out its an interesting experience either way.

Its the total impression of the film that satisfies me in a way most deep (or trying hard) movies do not. This is intellectual in its own way, and although its a action flick, it really gives out the message that there is hope and good out there. Combined with a extremely tight script, and Arnold in one of his best performances (god knows, he played a in a lot of *beep* flicks as well) makes up for an unique movie experience. The setting, the mood, the cast, the cinematography, sound editing, action sequences.... its all done to a T. And it grossed HUGHELY as well, and although this shouldn't be a criteria for a film to be good, the people behind movies try to make money of it, and one of the aspects of a good film is hitting a huge audience spread. I am a film student myself, and i would say that if a film doesn't even its budget there is something wrong (maybe marketing) but now Im way out of topic.The reason this works so well is so many, and many things i cant even put my finger on it. Its one of those movies that just makes you feel something, either awe, sorrow, empathy, anger, excitement, and this is from a ACTION movie. I am not a huge fan of films with only action in its genre, although this is sci-fi as well, I always look at the sci-fi just as a back layer in which the real story takes place. A story about people and hope. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2011","score":"","review":" Favourite movie of all time.
