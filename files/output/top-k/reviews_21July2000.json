For some strange and obscure reason they all gave top marks to junk like this, American Beauty and Being John Malkovich. Although I understand why they did this for the latter there is no excuse and no denying that The Insider is quite possibly the most over-rated and over-hyped film ever that was unfortunate enough to be seen only by totally biased audience. Except me of course. The story is about Jeff Wigand, who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and wants to do an interview with 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. At first he does not want to do it but thanks to pressure increasingly mounted on him he decides to do it out of spite and retaliation it seems. You see the tobacco companies do not want Wigand to let the whole world know that cigarettes are addictive. But everyone knows that anyway so what's the big deal? It's hardly big screen material. It may make an 85-minute long TV movie but it certainly cannot stretch over 2 and a half hours even with the talents of Al Pacino and Russell Crowe to support it.Let me just say that Heat was cool. Long, but still a very good film. I do admit that Michael Mann is a good director, but every director coughs up a severe dud once in a while. For Steven Spielberg there was Amistad and for Kubrick there was Eyes Wide Shut. Both of these films received excellent reviews for one reason only the reputation of the director. This is why so many people lied to themselves that The Insider is a good film (snigger). No way! Out of sheer respect to Michael Mann the whole world has given false review of this film but I'm about to give you the truth. The rest of mankind has been so brainwashed that The Insider is Oscar-worthy so they might try to hurt me for telling you this, but because I'm such a humanitarian I'm willing to risk it. THE INSIDER IS GARBAGE! There I said it.A Shocking amount of characters appear for a few seconds or maybe even longer and then disappear for the whole movie without them even being introduced to us or at least telling us their purpose to the story. This makes a series of confusing and drama-free events even more blurred and low in any kind of narrative. Mann also goes as far to not even give us reasons for events taking place. Like those men in black suits who just enter Jeff Wigand's (Russell Crowe) home and take his hard drive. Who were they? Who sent them? Why didn't Wigand do anything about it? Like call the police or even tell Bergman (Pacino). This scene is embarrassing to watch because Wigand is such a wimp. He does nothing! If someone came into my home I wouldn't just let them take my computer without doing anything.The only thing that is decent in this travesty is Dante Spinoti's widescreen photography, which is stunning. The scene with Bergman knee-deep in the ocean is a great example of wonderful cinematography. But that isn't enough. Sadly The Insider is as bloated as it is self-important and boring as it is confusing. A huge big mess. At the end you feel so bum-numbed and exhilarated that you just want to lie down. Maybe some people confused this sensation as the result of seeing a good movie. Which it certainly is NOT!

Once Upon a Time in America is yet another typical Leone operatic masterpiece. 224 minutes of Italian artistry that has to be marveled at, unlike some distributors who didn't have the patience to sit through 4 hours of art, but instead excised about 120 minutes out of it and then foisted it upon a rather confused audience - is it any wonder it didn't do well at the box office so brutely edited!Critics & perhaps some audiences just don't seem to have the time, the patience, or dare I say it the depth of intelligence to really unravel the mind of a master like Leone.

I knew it would be great looking, with great effects, and it certainly was. But I didn't know what to expect after that. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is one of the first action movies in a while that has actually had a point to it. In some parts of the movie, it was closer to a drama. It gives us a message of how prejudice affects our world. Although mutants are the target of prejudice in the movie, the message can be applied to any group of people that has ever been in the same situation. Hopefully people who see X-Men will get that message, instead of concentrating solely on the visual appeal, which there is a lot of.The two main mutants in the film are Wolverine and Rogue (Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, both do incredible jobs). Instead of just showing them killing the bad guys like typical summer action movie fare, Brian Singer (the director...another amazing job) focuses on their pasts, showing us how they ended up like they were. He does a great job at this, he can really make you feel emotion for the characters (another uncommon thing in action movies).The rest of the cast is good as well. Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier...leader of the X-Men) and Ian McKellan (Magneto, leader of the bad group of mutants) are especially good. I was surprised by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' performance as Mystique (another bad one). Although she didn't have many lines, I still thought she did a very good job. Surprising, considering how most models do in movies. I'd like to see more from her, provided she can stay out of typical model roles (i.e. Bond girl). The one weak spot is Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, but it's a pretty small part, so it doesn't really matter.You don't have to be a comic book fan to enjoy this movie.

Although mutants are the target of prejudice in the movie, the message can be applied to any group of people that has ever been in the same situation.

Instead of just showing them killing the bad guys like typical summer action movie fare, Brian Singer (the director...another amazing job) focuses on their pasts, showing us how they ended up like they were. He does a great job at this, he can really make you feel emotion for the characters (another uncommon thing in action movies).The rest of the cast is good as well. Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier...leader of the X-Men) and Ian McKellan (Magneto, leader of the bad group of mutants) are especially good. I was surprised by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' performance as Mystique (another bad one). Although she didn't have many lines, I still thought she did a very good job. Surprising, considering how most models do in movies. I'd like to see more from her, provided she can stay out of typical model roles (i.e. Bond girl).

This is no exaggeration. Hailing back to the days of yore, when Wizard was but a young magazine, posting a fantasy Casting Call for the then-impossible X-Movie (a cast which I believe included Alan Rickman as Magneto), fans have been chomping at the bit for any sliver of information that was in existence. For years, the loyal waited in the wings, watching in silent horror as the project was scrapped not once, but twice.Thankfully, the film has indeed arrived, poised to satiate the literally millions of fans out there. What was the end result? We'll get to that in a minute.The superhero genre has experienced a bit of a quagmire as of late, with wretched entries like Steel and Batman and Robin (Note Joel Schumacher should be publicly whipped). Ever since the release of Batman Forever, the genre has been on a general down swing. I'm not saying that they were all that good to begin with, but let's face the facts. Since the release of said Batman film, the awful PG-13 rated Spawn, and terribly acted Blade have been the high points in the superhero world. Batman and Robin was simply the final straw. The superhero genre was dying. It needed a hero of it's own to save it.Enter X-Men. No adulation, no zealotry to mask this opinion X-Men is amazing. Finally, someone figured out that it is not special effects and one-liners that make for good film. The secret lies in ACTING. X-Men, while remaining letter perfect to the mannerisms and behavior patterns of the characters, removes the painfully unbelievable aspects of the comic, while retaining the same overall feeling.Patrick Stewart, the man born to play Charles Xavier, delivers a predictably wonderful performance as the old Prof, displaying all the aspects necessary to his character. Ian McKellen, who I admit would not have been my first choice (although it is now), plays the PERFECT Magneto. Cyclops (James Mardsen) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) fit in to the puzzle naturally, and play their roles to a tee. Ray Park (martial arts master best known as Darth Maul) is actually given a chance to act as Toad, and through his limited lines, he does very well, adding a bit of wicked comedy to the script. The most improved character is definitely Rogue, who always annoyed me in any other incarnation. Anna Paquin shows off some of that Oscar winning charm as a young Rogue, and displays the hopelessness of her situation in an almost heart-wrenching way (not quite your typical superhero scenario, eh?).But (here it comes), no one stands out more than Hugh Jackman.

He was cast as the MOST DIFFICULT ROLE in the MOST POPULAR COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION EVER. Fanboys were screaming for blood when they saw the first publicity shots. Where are they now? Shelling out eight bucks to see him in action again.In closing, X-Men, while admittedly imperfect, is the model by which all superhero films should be made.

It's very good all the same.  Admittedly it would have been nicer if Petersen had made a four-hour film covering the entire book, but Part I's story is complete enough and works on the screen.  Besides, there's always the possibility of a sequel.Which makes it all the odder that the sequel, when it came, did NOT continue the story in the way that Ende had.  Oh, Miller and his writers mine what's left of the novel for ideas; what emerges is a gross caricature of Ende's work, a hideous, twisted, traducement.  Making the witch Xayide into too big a villain is the central mistake.  In the book Bastian's problem is a deep one wishes take away his memories not because of the contrived plotting of some super-villain, but because of the very nature of the world Bastian finds himself in; because of the nature of wishing, really.  Xayide EXPLOITS this fact; she does not create it.  (Note that in Petersen's film the central villain also exploits rather than creates strife.)  Quite apart from this Xayide is much more chilling in the book.  In the film she's a cackling, cretinous vamp who wears ludicrous bird-of-paradise gowns.  She's a stage villain of the flattest kind.One small change is more damaging than you might at first think in Ende's book, Bastian doesn't leave Fantasia (Fantastica in the translation I read) until the very end.  This makes more credible his chances of being trapped there.  Bringing him back to our world for the start of the next film is enough to make the entire subsequent story silly and enervating.  It feels as if we have entered a sitcom at the start of the next episode, everything is as it was before.  In today's episode Bastian must learn a Valuable Lesson About Life - coincidentally, the same one he learned yesterday (and will probably have to learn again in the next sequel, the dullard).  The first scenes of Part II are almost unbelievably bad.  I almost admire Miller's willingness to ADVERTISE how bad his film will be.  We open with one of the cheesiest sequence of allegedly humorous pratfalls I think I've ever seen; in a matter of MINUTES, I lost faith in the film, as had everyone I was watching it with.And so much of the original talent is missing as to make the whole exercise pointless.  The crew is almost entirely different; the cast - apart from Thomas Hill as Cornelius, who puts in an appearance even though he now has no role to play in the story - is different and vastly inferior, and all the beauty and fantasy that infused Petersen's production design is missing.

It's very good all the same.  Admittedly it would have been nicer if Petersen had made a four-hour film covering the entire book, but Part I's story is complete enough and works on the screen.  Besides, there's always the possibility of a sequel.Which makes it all the odder that the sequel, when it came, did NOT continue the story in the way that Ende had.  Oh, Miller and his writers mine what's left of the novel for ideas; what emerges is a gross caricature of Ende's work, a hideous, twisted, traducement.  Making the witch Xayide into too big a villain is the central mistake.  In the book Bastian's problem is a deep one wishes take away his memories not because of the contrived plotting of some super-villain, but because of the very nature of the world Bastian finds himself in; because of the nature of wishing, really.  Xayide EXPLOITS this fact; she does not create it.  (Note that in Petersen's film the central villain also exploits rather than creates strife.)  Quite apart from this Xayide is much more chilling in the book.  In the film she's a cackling, cretinous vamp who wears ludicrous bird-of-paradise gowns.  She's a stage villain of the flattest kind.One small change is more damaging than you might at first think in Ende's book, Bastian doesn't leave Fantasia (Fantastica in the translation I read) until the very end.  This makes more credible his chances of being trapped there.  Bringing him back to our world for the start of the next film is enough to make the entire subsequent story silly and enervating.  It feels as if we have entered a sitcom at the start of the next episode, everything is as it was before.  In today's episode Bastian must learn a Valuable Lesson About Life - coincidentally, the same one he learned yesterday (and will probably have to learn again in the next sequel, the dullard).  The first scenes of Part II are almost unbelievably bad.  I almost admire Miller's willingness to ADVERTISE how bad his film will be.  We open with one of the cheesiest sequence of allegedly humorous pratfalls I think I've ever seen; in a matter of MINUTES, I lost faith in the film, as had everyone I was watching it with.And so much of the original talent is missing as to make the whole exercise pointless.  The crew is almost entirely different; the cast - apart from Thomas Hill as Cornelius, who puts in an appearance even though he now has no role to play in the story - is different and vastly inferior, and all the beauty and fantasy that infused Petersen's production design is missing.

It has two problems, both of them related to the lead female character, Carrie (played by Andie MacDowell).The first is that the character is not written to be at all likeable.  She is engaged to a rich older man she clearly doesn't really love (I think we're supposed to infer that she's a golddigger) and cheats on him with someone she doesn't really care about either (Hugh Grant).  Later we learn that she's a slut and a homewrecker (see her appearance at wedding #4--don't tell me it wasn't conniving!).  What would make us want this woman to win our beloved Charlie (Hugh Grant) (who is also something of a cad, but a loveable one)?Carrie might not have been so unpalatable if they'd found an actress who could actually ACT to play her, but instead, they hired Andie MacDowell, who may be pretty, but is as stiff and lifeless as the scenery.  Maybe she thinks that's what's called for in a British movie.  I wonder that the people casting movies haven't realized that Andie MacDowell simply plays the same character in every movie she's in.  By the end of this film, you're incredibly frustrated.  You want to adore this movie, because everything about it is so perfect, except for the fact that you hate Andie MacDowell' s character with a passion and wish that she would die so that Charlie could find happiness with a woman who can act.

But THE FACULTY is still terrific - a proper horror with proper scares and restrained, justified self-referentiality; an excellent teen-pic centring on recurrent fears about conformity, independence, authority figures and sexual awakening.Just because you keep referencing INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (love the switch to 'books', Kev!), doesn't mean you're not INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS.  For better or worse, society and cinema has become less political, so instead of panic about reds or McCarthy, we have more general fears (task-force modernisation etc.).  But these are still valid.  The thing about this conformity is that in a way it is collective, erasing class, racial and generational boundaries; it sees itself as a force for good, a way of making the alienated, the abused, the geeky fit in with the nice people.  The film's whole conflict centres on a verbal pun, aliens versus the alienated.  The conformity is only quelled when the disparate outsiders form a group, a sort of conformity in itself (it's no surprise that an ultra-conformist is the first to be revealed as bogus).The film gives an alarming picture of life in American high schools, which doesn't seem that far-fetched to me now, having seem some documenataries exposing this metonymic environment.  As you would expect, there is the usual, horribly violent, bullying of the clever; the cruel taunting of the different; the apotheosis and corruption-enabling of the football team. Even within this latter unit, there is rupture and doubt, as one star-player sees the system's fraud for what it is, sees how it makes a mockery of his own self-worth.But the students aren't the only dissatisfied ones.  The teachers are so disillusioned by the favouritism of the football gods at the expense of their own subjects, that they turn to drink, 'medication', arid sarcasm, and general indifference.  This is perhaps an indictment of a system that fails its hypersmart kids, but we rarely get to see the teachers' side.  So when the alien horrors begin, it's not just an allegory, like BODY SNATCHERS, for a cruel conformity that already exists, but shows up the failure of a certain kind of current conformity.One could say that the film is just a catch-all expression of a certain, rather smug, alienated adolescent mindset; that the whole world is out to get you, from your peers, the girls you fancy, to teachers, parents, police. The profusion of narcotics strengthens this interpretation, the idea that all events are one big bad trip (there is a delightfully subversive subtext here which seems to contradict Richard Ashcroft).  This would explain the lumping of every enemy figure together.  The fundamental misogyny would be typical of teenage boys still at the episcopal-bashing stage.  There are some excellent rites revealing tensions within the group, where the individualism of mistrust threatens to explode the resistance.  But resistance to what?  What is the coda bitterly suggesting?What is most enjoyable about FACULTY is its rejection of current accepted horror practice, based on the slashers of the 80s, where the emphasis is very much on editing.  There are, of course, some jolting cuts here (Rodriguez is, after all, the best editor in the business), but the best scenes are a result of careful compositon, striking, haunting images and an intelligent use of space (the almost army-camp restriction to campus reminds one of Ferrera's BODY SNATCHERS), which owes more to the Universal horrors of the 1930s, the B-movies of the 1950s and Romero's allegories - the LIVING DEAD-like scenes of faceless mob attack are truly frightening yet very funny.

Baby Jane is a rotten cookie, a faded star. She has no friends, no future, and is full of bitterness and envy.  This film is much more effective than Sunset Boulevard. I like its everyday atmosphere, its trivial aspects  a trip to the bank, the maid getting a day off, the fat piano teacher, icecream at the beach.  The nightmare and the beautiful dream mingle. The writing is very fine, unpretentious and unobtrusive.  There is no standard theatricality. Money figures prominently. In today's world, it is the life-blood without which nothing can be accomplished.  Everything and everybody must be purchased.  Smiles and compliments require hard cash. There are no loyalties, no affections. Pure alienation.  Yet we don't get sociology, we get art.  What makes the film beautiful is its freedom from agenda or comment.  It just invites you to stare at life's gargoyles, and challenges you to find the beauty in it.  Yes, there is beauty even here.  This is one of the most beautiful films ever made, visually ravishing. The black and white is very effective. The film's surprise ending reverses the moral situation. Thus moral parity is achieved, and a beautiful transcendence.  I have no idea how far writer and director intended this deeper meaning, but intentions don't matter. The film is far from flawless. It has plenty of scenes one is tempted to cut, particularly the first half hour showing baby Jane as a child and young woman.  I would also cut the scene in which the pathetic pianist talks with his mother. It is irrelevant to the plot, though highly comical. And the violence could also be removed as gratuitous.
