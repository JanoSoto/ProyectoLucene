I walk away critiquing , then hating the film (because I love film and television, my standards are through the roof). However, I have come to learn that there are times I need this process...the process of dissecting and critiquing a film\/TV series to death...as it is what allows me to fully appreciate the work later. I find that I have to dissect what I don't like about it and I have to get all of those notions out of my mind. It's a cleansing process really, It's where expectation and reality meet in my mind. They battle each other... try to scratch each others eyes out, Then they sit down and have a feast together. That allows me to dispense with my expectations, all of my preconceived imaginary notions about what the film is going to be ....and then enables me to accept what the film actually is.The reason I start my review this way is to explain the following comment;I hated FIGHT CLUB club when I first saw it. My buddy and I saw the film the Saturday after it was released in the morning. He was surprised that I didn't like it, saying this movie is amazing and it's your kind of movie...I'm surprised you didn't like it.I remember my initial take on the film was that it existed only to show off the trick ending. I felt this because a year prior in 1998, The Sixth Sense had come out and that ending man. It floored people. Then it was imitated, poorly, for the next 5 years. It seemed like every film HAD to have the trick ending. I didn't realize that this ending was in the book, I should also probably explain that I had taken a tranquilizer or 2 before the film and missed 2\/3 of it. Therefore, waking up here and there, then coming to and catching the ending....I didn't know what the hell I was talking about. So...I learn that the films ending is from the Novel by Chuck Palahniuk... I take my friends words to heart & I return to the theater two weeks later to re-watch (watch) the film.My love affair with Fight Club began immediately. The photography, the dialogue, the violence, the pacing, that Fincher cinematic style...introduced to many of us in the 80's & early 90's via epic game changing music videos (MADONNA VOGUE), to refined with the film SE7EN ...then driven into the skull of the film industry with a jack hammer in FIGHT CLUB. This was the film that would define the Fincher style from that moment on.The message. The message. The message. From the amazing cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth, the iconic performance Brad Pitt gives in the film. Knowing how it ends, dissecting how well this single fact is woven and hidden throughout the film...it was masterful. Also the scale of the movie. A film with this type of content, this message...to be presented as grandly as Fight Club is...that's a feat. It's an anomaly. It doesn't happen often. Hollywood filters what gets through to us, they guard their reputations closely. It's a billion dollar institution that doesn't normally invest $70 million dollars into an anti-establishment piece. And yet...there it was, clear as day (well, not really day as Fincher's is the master of nighttime photography) on a movie screen. You are not your job. You are not the contents of your wallet. The things you own, end up owning you. I wanted to destroy something beautiful. I don't want to die without any scars. Did you know if you mix equal parts of saw dust and frozen orange juice concentrate you can make napalm?And now, accepting the movie as a whole, I saw it for what it truly was...genius. A masterpiece. This movie took a lot of beatings when it came out. It cost a ton of money, reviewers who didn't get it or were scared of it and the message it sent gave it poor reviews. Rosie O'Donnel complained about it on her talk show then spoiled the ending for everybody in the audience a week before the movie came out. No mechanized member of the Hollywood machine would have green-lit this picture for $70 million nowadays. Can't recall the name of the man responsible for championing the film that 20th Century Fox , but I believe he was fired after the films release. The filmmakers got away with murder honestly. It was a gift. To us, the audience, the film lovers, the truth seekers. A brilliant story, masterfully realized on the screen. Fight Club is not a safe movie. The fact that the film exists is a miracle. That it is ranked number 10 movie on the Internet Movie Database Top 250 Films Of All Time list is a testament to its power and the respect it has earned, despite the initial misgivings...my own included...with the film. Certain films changed my life. JFK changed my life, Malcolm X changed My life...FIGHT CLUB changed my life.I would never be the same after that film. I have since read the book and seen the film repeatedly...maybe 25 times.... And it's one of the best films I've ever seen. You know nothing about be, but for me...that is saying a lot. I encourage you to open your mind and see this film promptly.Then watch it again. It's extremely important to celebrate the accomplishment that Fight Club is. Celebrate that it exists at all.

It is based on Stephen King's novel with the same name as the movie. The film's real running time is almost 2 1\/2 hours, unless you are thinking about the 25 minute shortened European version. More about it later in this review.Plot Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) drives to an isolated hotel called Overview Hotel, together with his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and his son Danny (Danny Lloyd). There he is supposed to work with some writing project. Meanwhile Danny is seeing disturbing stuff like blood flooding from the elevator and two scary little girls who wants him to play with them, while talking to his imaginary friend Toby. While time passes, Jack becomes more and more psycho while surrounded by the ghosts of the former hotel guests...I can't tell you anymore of the plot, mainly to avoid spoilers. But this film is really a great masterpiece, if not one of the BETTER Hollywood Horror movie i have seen in a while. Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros, who also made the highly controversial A Clockwork Orange, made a good effort with this film. Referring to the longer American cut I saw in a week earlier, Mr. Kubrick also managed to make a somewhat good character development, which many of these scenes have been reported as missing from the two hours long European cut. The music is the thing which made the many of the intense scenes creepy. I sat through this film as if my eyes were glued into the screen.My favorite scenes must be the surreal elevator blood sequence, and the climatic sequence beginning with the iconic axe-through-the-door scene.Different versions The ending of this film was originally around two minutes longer when released theatrically for the first time, but Stanley Kubrick and Warner Bros decided this ending to be cut, making this film to run for 144 minutes, not 146. For the European release, Kubrick cut off further around 25 minutes of stuff mostly involving character development and scenes taking place far away from the film's iconic hotel. As good as 99% of the intense scenes are intact in this version. If you don't mind the cuts, the European version is also a good choice.This film is rated 18 in Norway. It's Norwegian title is Ondskapens Hotell, which would have been literally translated into English as The Hotel of Evil.Conclusion Unless you can't stand scary movies, I will highly recommend you to watch this film at least once. Some other great masterpieces from Stanley Kubrick include 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968) and A Clockwork Orange (1971).

It was produced with a budget of $7000, starring a cast of amateurs, and directed by a then amateur Robert Rodriguez. Now I'm gonna make it clear, I'm not a Robert Rodriguez fan. I've only seen like a handful of his films(The Adventures of Sharkboy & Lavagirl, Spy Kids, Spy Kids 4D, and Machete) and none of them have particularly impressed me. But I have to say, I actually really enjoyed this film!The thing that makes this film work against the budget is the simplicity and tension. The film tells a very simple story about a mariachi who gets mistaken for a gangster so now, the gang that the gangster is going on a vendetta on now mistakens the mariachi for him because of his clothing and guitar case and now, he's on the run from them. It's very simple but that's what makes it work. It feels a lot like an Alfred Hitchcock plot with the regular, normal guy who gets himself into a wild goose chase. And it works because you connect and relate with him well rather than if he was like a cop, or an assassin, or something. The decisions he makes in this film are what a regular human being would make, he never decides to get revenge on them or anything like that which makes it feel all the more real and makes you feel like you are on this journey with him.The film also has a lot of tension and suspense. While El Mariachi is classified as an action film, our protagonist never becomes an action hero during the entire film. He shoots a few guys here and there but the main reason why he manages to survive these chases is just because of luck. So we have a lot of scenes in this film where he has to protect himself from the gangsters and it's very suspenseful because he's just a regular guy who uses nothing but his own wit. And even when there's no action on screen, the film has a lot of tension going on because you don't always know what the characters are up to. For example, there's a scene in the film where Domino makes a call and while she's an ally in the film and the only real ally for El Mariachi, we don't see her make the call, it's all offscreen and it works because it makes you question her alleigance.But there are problems with this film, as I stated before it's a very cheap film and it shows with the cinematography because it just looks really cheap and gritty. I know that it's an action movie but it looks gritty in an ugly sense rather in a beautiful sense like Licence to Kill(1989). There's also some shots in this film that look out of focus and awkward. It's hard to describe but if you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean.There's practically no score in this film. All we hear the entire time is this 80's movie score that sounds like The Terminator and it's just generic and cheap.The film could also use a little more gore. There's some small shootouts in this film and sometimes there's a blood squib and other times, they just fall down. It's really inconsistent.Oh, and there's one line in this film I find ridiculously stupid. After he murders four guys, he goes to the bar looking really frustrated and then the bartender asks him What's wrong? Had too much soda? and he replies with I just killed four guys. Who the hell would say that? I know that he's a really nice guy who doesn't like to kill but why would you say that? Next thing you know, he's gonna ask her How's your sex life?, lol.But overall, it's a nice little independent film that has a nice, simple plot but also a lot of suspense and tension so I'll give it a 7\/10.

For example, there's a scene in the film where Domino makes a call and while she's an ally in the film and the only real ally for El Mariachi, we don't see her make the call, it's all offscreen and it works because it makes you question her alleigance.But there are problems with this film, as I stated before it's a very cheap film and it shows with the cinematography because it just looks really cheap and gritty. I know that it's an action movie but it looks gritty in an ugly sense rather in a beautiful sense like Licence to Kill(1989). There's also some shots in this film that look out of focus and awkward. It's hard to describe but if you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean.There's practically no score in this film. All we hear the entire time is this 80's movie score that sounds like The Terminator and it's just generic and cheap.The film could also use a little more gore. There's some small shootouts in this film and sometimes there's a blood squib and other times, they just fall down. It's really inconsistent.Oh, and there's one line in this film I find ridiculously stupid. After he murders four guys, he goes to the bar looking really frustrated and then the bartender asks him What's wrong? Had too much soda? and he replies with I just killed four guys. Who the hell would say that? I know that he's a really nice guy who doesn't like to kill but why would you say that? Next thing you know, he's gonna ask her How's your sex life?, lol.But overall, it's a nice little independent film that has a nice, simple plot but also a lot of suspense and tension so I'll give it a 7\/10.

But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed.The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him.For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so.

The film feels exactly like a character who belongs in skits roughly five to eight minutes long, who will occasionally say something funny in those five to eight minutes, and then end on a comic-bang before the screenwriter decides to cut over to another sketch. The sad thing about The Ladies Man is it focuses on its title character (played by a clearly inspired Tim Meadows) for eighty long, often tedious minutes, completely deluding the character's comic effect because it must be referenced with almost every line he says.I've discussed how tedious and often frustratingly unfunny Saturday Night Live films can often be (I wrote a whole blog on it three years back, so that should give an idea of how opinionated I was). Their main complaint links most of their films (with notable exceptions of the Wayne's World titles) in that they have difficultly giving their character's antics enough to do for a film's runtime. The Ladies Man character already has enough energy to be in a eighty minute film, but does he have the humor, plot, and charisma capabilities of carrying such precious minutes? How far does a sexist, afro-rockin' radio host go? The answer is not very far, but the film is at least buoyed by the competence and appeal of Tim Meadows, who can do no wrong in films as far as I'm concerned. His presence is casual and his attitude often laidback, even when he's playing a character as tiresome as this one. He plays Leon The Ladies Man Phelps, a studly black radio host who is known for his outspoken sexism on air during his nighttime show where he gives female callers shallow advice about relationships. The first thirty minutes of the film show his attitude and serve as nothing but a showcase for redundant jokes akin to that of modern Saturday Night Life sketches.When the story finally does get going, it's lame and serves more as filler than as a significant plot. It follows a man who finds his wife cheating on him, only to spot a naked black man running outside his home with a smiley face tattooed on his rear. Turns out, there is a website dedicated to finding this man and a group of angry husbands meet up to try and track down the man who pleasures their wives. The result is a tiresome array of unfunny marital jokes and a predictable but slightly catchy song and dance number.Tim Meadows (who serves as co-write on this film) is clearly inspired when playing The Ladies Man. His personality is always energetic and here he plays a character he completely created and perfected himself. There is a genuine sense of fun and comfortableness when playing this role. The issue is that The Ladies Man is so thin and uninteresting as a character that he's more of an idea. In that regard, Meadows does a great job at playing an idea.I return full circle to my point that I made in the beginning that stated that the films focuses on a character that feels exactly like he belongs in concise skits on Television. It's no surprise that after about fifteen minutes of laughing with and at the character, I began to be burdened with feelings of tedium. This only influences my point that a character with this personality belongs in shorts seventy-five minutes shorter than the film The Ladies Man.Starring Tim Meadows, Karyn Parsons, Billy Dee Williams, John Witherspoon, Will Ferrell, and Eugene Levy.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"30 August 2013","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The fact that The Ladies Man originated from a skit on Saturday Night Live should surprise no one who has seen and disliked the film. The film feels exactly like a character who belongs in skits roughly five to eight minutes long, who will occasionally say something funny in those five to eight minutes, and then end on a comic-bang before the screenwriter decides to cut over to another sketch. The sad thing about The Ladies Man is it focuses on its title character (played by a clearly inspired Tim Meadows) for eighty long, often tedious minutes, completely deluding the character's comic effect because it must be referenced with almost every line he says.I've discussed how tedious and often frustratingly unfunny Saturday Night Live films can often be (I wrote a whole blog on it three years back, so that should give an idea of how opinionated I was). Their main complaint links most of their films (with notable exceptions of the Wayne's World titles) in that they have difficultly giving their character's antics enough to do for a film's runtime. The Ladies Man character already has enough energy to be in a eighty minute film, but does he have the humor, plot, and charisma capabilities of carrying such precious minutes? How far does a sexist, afro-rockin' radio host go? The answer is not very far, but the film is at least buoyed by the competence and appeal of Tim Meadows, who can do no wrong in films as far as I'm concerned. His presence is casual and his attitude often laidback, even when he's playing a character as tiresome as this one. He plays Leon The Ladies Man Phelps, a studly black radio host who is known for his outspoken sexism on air during his nighttime show where he gives female callers shallow advice about relationships. The first thirty minutes of the film show his attitude and serve as nothing but a showcase for redundant jokes akin to that of modern Saturday Night Life sketches.When the story finally does get going, it's lame and serves more as filler than as a significant plot. It follows a man who finds his wife cheating on him, only to spot a naked black man running outside his home with a smiley face tattooed on his rear. Turns out, there is a website dedicated to finding this man and a group of angry husbands meet up to try and track down the man who pleasures their wives. The result is a tiresome array of unfunny marital jokes and a predictable but slightly catchy song and dance number.Tim Meadows (who serves as co-write on this film) is clearly inspired when playing The Ladies Man. His personality is always energetic and here he plays a character he completely created and perfected himself. There is a genuine sense of fun and comfortableness when playing this role. The issue is that The Ladies Man is so thin and uninteresting as a character that he's more of an idea. In that regard, Meadows does a great job at playing an idea.I return full circle to my point that I made in the beginning that stated that the films focuses on a character that feels exactly like he belongs in concise skits on Television. It's no surprise that after about fifteen minutes of laughing with and at the character, I began to be burdened with feelings of tedium. This only influences my point that a character with this personality belongs in shorts seventy-five minutes shorter than the film The Ladies Man.Starring Tim Meadows, Karyn Parsons, Billy Dee Williams, John Witherspoon, Will Ferrell, and Eugene Levy.

But they end of the sixties his films were not receiving the same critical and commercial success and his 1969 thriller Topaz was considered one of his weakest films. Hitchcock changed course for his follow-up, making a murder-thriller in London, his British film since Stage Fright in 1950.The city of London is suffering from the terror of a serial killer known as the neck-tie killer, a man who rapes women before strangling them with a neck-tie. Richard Blancy (Jon Finch) is a barman and a former RAF man who enjoys a drink and suffers a violence temper. When his ex-wife Brenda (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) the police suspect Richard is the killer; but the police is after the wrong man.Frenzy is a bold film for time with Hitchcock being more graphic with violence and nudity without the need to overuse the then new techniques and less strict limits. There is a tense, graphic rape scene in the first 30 minutes with Barry Foster giving a really creepy and terrifying performance. Hitchcock was able to much darker and more brutal film to much of his previous work, including a sequence where the killer tries to receive evidence from a body in the back of a truck which contents a lot of Hitchcock's trademark tension.Hitchcock does get you to feel the hustle and bustle of London with its crowded streets, roads, pubs and markets and much more focused on the worker and low middle classes compared to many of Hitchcock's films focusing on upper class and wealthier people. Frenzy felt very British and that London was a character and provided an atmosphere and it felt little a dirtier a place. The Covent Garden has changed a lot from the area it was to the affluence it has now.Frenzy does have an excellent cast with the likes of Finch and Foster giving instance performances. When I first saw Foster I originally thought it was Michael Caine and guess who was offered the role first? Finch was convincing as a man who is quick to anger and not exactly a sympathetic character; but he is still an innocent man and some of moments of anger are understandable. This film also features Clive Swift which is a pleasant site.There are some criticism to be had. The first is there are moments of comedy which are hit and miss. Sometimes the humour breaks the tension and works because of personality of the actors, but other bits like the Police Detective having to eat his wife's ghastly food which was old fashioned and out of place. The other problem is not so much how the film but more how it aged since we now know more about how the police function and how serial killers really act. There were times I was thinking that the police should be checking for fingerprints on the ties and should be wearing gloves.Frenzy is a fine entrance in Hitchcock's filmography as a murder film where the story revolves around whether the people with catch the right man then a whodunit.

So prepare for a powerful experience rather than a mere movie, because you are in for precisely that.

The script was written by Waldo Salt, directed by John Schlesinger, and stars Jon Voight in the title role alongside Dustin Hoffman. The film won three Academy Awards Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. To date, it is the only X-rated film ever to win Best Picture. It has since been labeled as one of the greatest American movies of all time.The plot of the film deals with Joe Buck (Jon Voight), a young Texan who works as a dishwasher. As the film opens, Joe dresses in new cowboy clothing, packs a suitcase, and quits his job. He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute. Joe's naïveté is quickly evident. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Sylvia Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money. Joe then meets Enrico Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a crippled, street con man who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp, who turns out to be a Bible thumper (John McGiver). Joe flees the encounter in pursuit of Rizzo.Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and most of his belongings are confiscated. He tries to make money by agreeing to receive oral sex from a young man (Bob Balaban) in a movie theater. When Joe learns that he has no money, Joe threatens him. The following day, Joe spots Rizzo and angrily shakes him down. Rizzo offers to share his apartment in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a business relationship, hustling. The two loners develop a true bond. Rizzo's health, which has never been good, steadily worsens.Joe's story is told through flashbacks. His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, though his grandmother frequently neglects him as well. He and his girlfriend, Crazy Annie are raped, after drawing the ire of local townspeople. She is institutionalized, and Joe joins the army. Rizzo's back story comes through stories he tells Joe. His father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoe-shiner who worked down in a subway station, developed a bad back, and coughed his lungs out from breathin' in that wax all day. Rizzo learned shining from his father but wont stoop to it. He dreams of moving one day to Miami.An unusual couple approach Joe and Ratso in a diner and hand Joe a flyer, inviting him to a party. They enter a Warhol-esque party scene (with Warhol superstars in cameos). Naive Joe smokes a joint, thinking it's a cigarette, and, after taking a pill someone offered, begins to hallucinate. He leaves the party with a socialite (Brenda Vaccaro), who agrees to pay $20 for spending the night with her, but Joe cannot perform. They play Scribbage together, and Joe shows his limited academic prowess. She teasingly suggests that Joe may be gay, and he is suddenly able to perform. The two enjoy lively, aggressive sex. In the morning, the socialite sets up her friend as Joe's next customer, and it appears that his career is on its way.When Joe returns home, Rizzo is bedridden and feverish. Rizzo refuses medical help and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in a gay bar (Barnard Hughes), and when things go wrong, robs the man when he tries to pay with a religious medallion, instead of cash. With the cash, Joe buys bus tickets. On the journey, Rizzo's frail physical condition further deteriorates. At a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Rizzo and himself, discarding his cowboy outfit. As they near Miami, Joe talks of getting a regular job, only to realize Rizzo has died. The driver tells Joe there is nothing else to do but continue on to Miami. The film closes with Joe seated with his arm around his dead friend.The chemistry between Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman is why this film works. Jon Voight plays his role to perfection. His dreams of making it big are foiled at every step of his adventure. In the end he gives up and is back to where he began. The loss of his good friend Rizzo will weigh very heavily on his soul. This film was rated X, but there is nothing here than than the occasional bare butt and breasts shown. In fact today's film show more trashy scenes than this film. For persons seeking to make a career as a male escort, this is a film you should see before you embark on your adventure.
