First off there was Halloween, that introduced us to Michael Myers. Secondly was Friday the 13th which gave birth to Jason Voorhees. Next came A Nightmare On Elm Street which unleashed a demon into our dreams in Freddy Kruger. Looking back on this film now, after having Freddy Kruger being a huge horror villain as I grew up, I see that in the very first film he is nothing like he is interpreted today. The sequels seem to have ruined the character slightly as in the first film he is frightening, unpredictable and kept in the dark for most of the film, leaving you anticipating his next move. There are none of the wise cracks that he is resembled with today, and he is nothing like the version we saw in the 2010 remake.For those who don't know, the film follows a girl called Nancy (Langenkamp) and her group of friends. One by one they begin to have nightmares, each involving the same man, Fred Kruger. This man is heavily scared, wears a hooped red and green jumper, a tatty hat, and has knives for fingers. As the group begin to realise they are dreaming of the same guy one of the girls is killed in her dream by Fred Kruger, which kills her in real life. Shown in a fantastic scene where this poor girl is dragged across the ceiling, blood spilling from her but no other person in sight. Once this girl is killed her boyfriend becomes the main suspect and he has no way to prove his innocence. The only one that believes him is Nancy, who has now started to have these nightmares more frequently, and finds herself attempting to stay awake for days on end in order to avoid her nightmare. Once the truth about Freddy is revealed she devises a way to finally bring a stop to her nightmare and sets up a trap involving her boyfriend (Depp) to finish Kruger once and for all.What makes this stand out from other horror films of its time is that it explores the notion of dream against reality. At times during the film you are unaware of which reality we are in and this really adds to the visuals of the film, especially when we see Freddy's destruction in reality and he isn't even there. We are also introduced to another horror icon who doesn't remain silent throughout, and walk like a machine hell bent on death. We have a killer insistent on laughing at the poor children he is tormenting, and one that also looks feeble in comparison to other icons. He may not be as scary as Michael Myers but something about Freddy Kruger really sends a shiver down your spine.Considering the film was made nearly thirty years ago, it is still pretty scary. Scenes that show a blood soaked girl calling out from inside a body bag is chilling, and when she is dragged around the room is incredibly disturbing and one you won't be able to shift from you minds.Other scenes however aren't as scary and can look a little comedic, but I think that is due to the low budget and standard of film making back then. Robert Englund, who plays Freddy, is brilliant in this film. He brings the character to life and I'm sure would scare children if they watch this film. The make up for him is brilliant and his costume is now very iconic. Langenkamp unfortunately is not great in her role as Nancy, and it is her kind of performance that stereotypes today's horror female leads as poor actors. Her delivery of lines at times is amateurish which makes you struggle to route for her. Really all you want to see when you get into the film is Kruger. Depp is average in his performance, and it is hard to see the Depp of today in his performance here.The film is full of clich√©s but you can over look these as horror in the eighties was designed like this. To watch it now you would cringe or roll your eyes at the character decisions to venture into the dark due to a noise, but when this was made that was brand new and wasn't as frowned upon. There are some scenes which are bad though and can't use the excuse of when it was made. One scene Nancy manages to set up a house full of booby traps in ten minutes, which includes setting a sledge hammer up above a door. There would not be enough time to set this up and certainly not if she had to find the items to use as well. Also she lives alone with her mother, what use would they have for a sledge hammer. It is parts like that in movies which is really frustrating. Also the ending disappointed me. I know it was supposed to be a twist but it didn't really make sense with the rest of the film. This ending also shows the worst piece of special effects on show.All in all I can see why this is a classic. We are introduced to a new villain, and asked to believe in the notion of dreams being real. To look at it now it isn't as good as it would have been thirty years ago, but it is still better than the poor remake. The poor effects of this film really do add to the suspense of it all. Halloween this is not, but an influential horror film it certainly is. 3 \/ 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"25 April 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Towards the end of the seventies and beginning of the eighties, we were blessed with some great horror films that have become cult classics today.

However, JURASSIC PARK, despite containing an overload of sentimentality, manages to be a simply great movie, a classic in fact, thanks to an overwhelming amount of elements that work.Michael Crichton's story is fresh (if you overlook the fact that it's Westworld with dinosaurs) and inventive. Okay, I wish Spielberg had made this film for adults rather than kids &#x96; complete with the graphic bloodshed of the original novel &#x96; but then I guess I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema at the age of 12 and been hugely influenced by it. The cast is splendid, particularly Sam Neill, one of those rarely-seen character actors who really deserved the big time success he enjoyed with his role here. Goldblum is even better, although much underutilised in favour of the redundant Laura Dern character. Watch out for Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson in memorable bit parts and try to avoid the annoyingly precocious brats played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards. Bob Peck's big game hunter, straight out of the pages of a H. Rider Haggard novel, is a complete scene stealer.Of course, this is one of those rare movies where the actors come second to the special effects, and the mixture of CGI and animatronic models is still breathtaking to this day. The scene where the T-Rex escapes is hands down one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema, ever. Okay, what follows is occasionally ridiculous (the car dropping down the tree scene) and involves kids running around too much, but it's still the kind of breathlessly exciting movie that there aren't all that many of.I still remember feeling a little bit jealous of how this movie popularised dinosaurs in the mainstream. As a kid, I'd always loved the creatures and owned loads of books about them, but after JURASSIC PARK every kid in the world fell in love with them and it was never the same.

This is William James' distinction between the tough minded and the tender minded. I must be one of the former because I found it a nonpareil of sentimental and inelegant pap. Pardon me while I light an expensive cigar and stomp the cat.Sheesh, how triumph follows tragedy and vice versa. Freddy Bartholomew is a nine-year-old boy living in genteel poverty with his loving mother (Dearest) in a crummy neighborhood in Brooklyn. But not the real Brooklyn of the 1880s. This is a fairyland Brooklyn where there is no garbage or horse manure on the streets, and where Freddy's pal, Mickey Rooney, only betrays his lack of breeding by saying erl instead of oil and never busts Freddy in the snot locker. Freddy loves his pals, who include the greengrocer, and everybody loves Freddy, just as love loves to love love.I almost burst into sobs when a lawyer arrives from England and informs Freddy that, since he is the only surviving grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt, he's invited to come to England, join his grandfather in the family mansion, and be inculcated into the aristoi. The present Earl is a bilious and bushy old man who knows no pity except for himself. He hates Freddy's mother and she must live elsewhere, not in the mansion. He treats his tenant farmers the way they treat their dirt.Freddy, though, is a winsome little lad, naive and generous. To a fault, one might say. And before you know it, Freddy has the crotchety old curmudgeon learning how to be generous and kind -- in an old fashioned way, of course. He's not going to give the family silverware to the poor. He's just not going to berate the servants quite as much.Then tragedy strikes, and just when it seems things are going so well. Another woman shows up with a lollipop-sucking son who is older than Freddy, and SHE claims to be the first wife of the son of the current Earl. And, believe me, this babe is a real wasp. She laughs and taunts the white-haired old man who has grown to love Freddy, just as everyone else loves Freddy.Do things turn out all right? Is there a happy ending? Doesn't it prompt you to weep when you hear Auld Lang Syne played adagio? On a solo violin? Well, Freddy Bartholomew is unquestionably cute in appearance, speech, and demeanor although, to be sure, a little fist fight in the schoolyard might have done him a power of good. Actually, the illustrations in Hodgson's book started a sartorial fad and kids began to dress like Little Lord Fauntleroy in outfits that resembled little sailor suits with lace collars. The fad lasted for years. I believe there's a photo of young Ernest Hemingway floating around out there somewhere in the ether. The character of Little Lord Fauntleroy is winning, precisely because it's so improbable. The whole movie is as fantastic as The Wizard of Oz. C. Aubrey Smith is great as the grumbling old Earl, only reluctantly won over by his new grandson. Dolores Costello as Dearest always looks as if she's wearing a brave smile to keep from breaking into sobs of some sort, grief or gratitude -- it doesn't matter.Like so much sentimental material it has its charm. But that's about all it has, sentiment and charm. There's not a laugh in it, and there's no edginess to it. We know at once that the mistaken people will realize their errors, that the bad people will be punished or thwarted, and that the good people will be rewarded. A bit of edge might not have hurt. Have Freddy sneak a few puffs on a corn silk cigarette or something.

","genre":"Drama, Family"},{"date":"25 April 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The book by Frances Hodgson Burnett was published in the 1880s and carried a simple message humanitarianism is better than arrogance. This is William James' distinction between the tough minded and the tender minded. I must be one of the former because I found it a nonpareil of sentimental and inelegant pap. Pardon me while I light an expensive cigar and stomp the cat.Sheesh, how triumph follows tragedy and vice versa. Freddy Bartholomew is a nine-year-old boy living in genteel poverty with his loving mother (Dearest) in a crummy neighborhood in Brooklyn. But not the real Brooklyn of the 1880s. This is a fairyland Brooklyn where there is no garbage or horse manure on the streets, and where Freddy's pal, Mickey Rooney, only betrays his lack of breeding by saying erl instead of oil and never busts Freddy in the snot locker. Freddy loves his pals, who include the greengrocer, and everybody loves Freddy, just as love loves to love love.I almost burst into sobs when a lawyer arrives from England and informs Freddy that, since he is the only surviving grandson of the Earl of Dorincourt, he's invited to come to England, join his grandfather in the family mansion, and be inculcated into the aristoi. The present Earl is a bilious and bushy old man who knows no pity except for himself. He hates Freddy's mother and she must live elsewhere, not in the mansion. He treats his tenant farmers the way they treat their dirt.Freddy, though, is a winsome little lad, naive and generous. To a fault, one might say. And before you know it, Freddy has the crotchety old curmudgeon learning how to be generous and kind -- in an old fashioned way, of course. He's not going to give the family silverware to the poor. He's just not going to berate the servants quite as much.Then tragedy strikes, and just when it seems things are going so well. Another woman shows up with a lollipop-sucking son who is older than Freddy, and SHE claims to be the first wife of the son of the current Earl. And, believe me, this babe is a real wasp. She laughs and taunts the white-haired old man who has grown to love Freddy, just as everyone else loves Freddy.Do things turn out all right? Is there a happy ending? Doesn't it prompt you to weep when you hear Auld Lang Syne played adagio? On a solo violin? Well, Freddy Bartholomew is unquestionably cute in appearance, speech, and demeanor although, to be sure, a little fist fight in the schoolyard might have done him a power of good. Actually, the illustrations in Hodgson's book started a sartorial fad and kids began to dress like Little Lord Fauntleroy in outfits that resembled little sailor suits with lace collars. The fad lasted for years. I believe there's a photo of young Ernest Hemingway floating around out there somewhere in the ether. The character of Little Lord Fauntleroy is winning, precisely because it's so improbable. The whole movie is as fantastic as The Wizard of Oz. C. Aubrey Smith is great as the grumbling old Earl, only reluctantly won over by his new grandson. Dolores Costello as Dearest always looks as if she's wearing a brave smile to keep from breaking into sobs of some sort, grief or gratitude -- it doesn't matter.Like so much sentimental material it has its charm. But that's about all it has, sentiment and charm. There's not a laugh in it, and there's no edginess to it.

It has become one of the defining iconic pieces of film that is heralded as a holy grail. What I admire about it is it's simplicity and the audacity it has to create a bizarre character like Norman Bates. I can only imagine what audiences must have thought going into that film because the implications of such a character for an audience coming out of the conservative fifties must have been truly unsettling. What makes Norman such a great character is how clear the divide is between Mother and Norman. Norman is a likable guy. Anthony Perkins does not scream psychopath, he could just as easily be your friend or neighbor. There is a large chunk of Psycho were we even are encouraged to identify with Norman and I imagine that is what made the film so endearing to 60's audiences. Flash forward twenty years to 'Psycho II'. Norman's secret is out of the bag and you don't even need to see 'Psycho' to know it. 'Psycho II' was released in the sea of Freddy Krueger wanna be's and going into 'Psycho II' I expected something along those lines. I put off seeing it as sort of an exercise in film snobbery as I thought the attempt to do a sequel should be shunned. I feared Norman Bates would be turned into a Freddy Krueger. That isn't to say I don't like Freddy Krueger I just saw 'Psycho' as above it. This may have been my great mistake in looking at the film. Hitchcock probably wasn't setting out to make a Holy Grail with 'Psycho' and Robert Bloch's initial novel was nothing more than a dime story scandal novel. It makes perfect sense taking Norman Bates and putting him in the culture he created. I expected Norman to wield a knife with no motive other than shock value and going in with little knowledge of the film I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film does not take this approach, in fact it violently rejects it as it's main arc. Norman Bates wants to be cured and turn over a new leaf and surprisingly the audience wants him to too. Norman is our hero here. Anthony Perkins gives an absolutely wonderful performance as Norman Bates. The character is multi-dimensional and has grown since the last film. Perkins plays up all of Norman's good qualities, he is a polite and kind man with a horrible alter ego. We see that the last thing Norman wants in the world is to become Mother again. In a way 'Psycho II' is kind of a tragic film. With Norman we see an addict whose addiction completely dominated his life. In 'Psycho II' he starts off clean and sober but slowly he begins to relapse and we can't help but feel sorry for him. Perkins brings Norman to low points. He becomes absolutely pathetic and powerless by the climax of the film and we feel for him because Perkins shows that Norman has genuinely tried to overcome the demons in his closet.There are grisly killings in 'Psycho II' and I expected them. 'Psycho II' feels like an 80's slasher when the bodies start littering the screen. Frankly, this is the least interesting aspect of the film. 'Psycho II' is a character study and the murders merely serve to mess with Norman's sanity. It doesn't matter who the killer really ends up being in 'Psycho II' because we know it is not Norman. One thing that really strikes me about the original 'Psycho' and indeed any good horror film is that it is not the monster that we fear but the presence around the monster. 'Psycho II' is all about presence. 'Mother' is an entity. I would be perfectly fine with 'Psycho II' if all the killings took place in Norman's imagination because the weight of the violence is so strong. Stylistically, the killings have more in common with a Friday the 13th film than Hitchcock but what matters is this isn't a film with a body count for the sake of having one.The film isn't really completely about Norman however. 'Psycho II' does a very good job in showing how the community and Norman's victims were affected by what he did. The plot involved Lila Loomis and her daughter Mary is pitch perfect. Bringing back Vera Miles was a wonderful choice as her character has become just as disturbed as Norman. And really what reaction does someone have to such grisly events? No one has any faith in Norman to come back from the depths of insanity and it really is symbolical of 'Psycho' and it's slasher clones. By the end of 'Psycho II' Norman is back for good and it is satisfying to see the cost it has on the character and the fruitless battle he put up to save himself from this fate.

I've watched some pretty violent, gory films before but this was the first one where I actually felt sick. Not because it was so unnecessary, or because it was overdone, but because it was so damn real. The opening scene was so intense and realistic, it explains everything about war that can't be learned just through reading books, studying history or ever looking at old photos. The way the sound muffles to show the audience shell shock, and people lying in the background screaming for their mothers. It's a bit overwhelming, but better that than completely fake. What I really want to point out is that in order for the audience to want the main characters to succeed, there needs to be some purpose to the film, hence the storyline of a small group of soldiers searching for the last of four sons. Otherwise it wouldn't have the emotion or engagement of the audience that was intended. Also, when people complain about it being unrealistic, yes the story is fiction, but how do you know something like that never did happen? Maybe there was one German they let live, who returned later to kill their comrades. Maybe they did send a tank through a small alley. I'd like to point out that the film is in the eyes of American soldiers. It's meant to portray how they saw the war, how the enemy looked in their eyes. Basically, if you didn't want to see any of the slight exaggerations or sympathy to the Americans, go watch a documentary on war, not an incredibly realistic movie.

Who would've thought that Nicolsen got his start working with 3 of the best (horror) icons in cinema history? Karloff's eerie presence just had me at the edge of my seat.

This movie could even be a prequel of sorts to X-men 1st class where the powers of the key protagonists rival that of Jean Gray\/Phoenix and Prof X. I expected more from the ending though. It seems to end very abruptly. I guess its the director's way of saying - She's in control now - 'nuff said! this movie has many parallels with the Xmen franchise. Either the author of the book the movie's based on was inspired by Stan Lee's xmen or vice versa.If you haven't guessed what the movie's about, let me make it more clear - its about a girl who's struggling to come to terms with her superior psychic\/telepathic and telekinetic abilities and how these abilities terrify her - when she unconsciously causes grievous harm to people by simply touching them - similar to the effect Rogue (Xmen) has - but in a different way. Her abilities are quickly discovered by a secret government agency that 'doesn't exist' - Men In Black - if you will. But there's nothing funny about them. They are down right sinister - who want to manipulate her brain and fashion her into a weapon (think Logan\/Wolverine - Xmen).One of the movie downers is that the son doesn't recognize the father when the father finally (literally against all odds) finds him and meets him face to face. The father realizes that the young man in front of him is a completely different being from the one he parted ways with earlier (beginning of movie - beach scene) and he is forced to 'not' save him at the very end.

The movie is made realistically (and very well) outside the boxing ring, but inside the ring ? Oh come on !! The fight scenes are the theater of the absurd. Real boxing is NOTHING like this. Its a science --a craft--not a street fight. This is typical Scorsese....over-cooking the violent scenes once again. Its really quite sad----because the film is pretty good. However, people tend to over rate Robert De Niros performance. I think its because he gallantly gained 60lbs. (27 kg) in weight to play the horrible Jake Lamotta (a guy with LOADS of personality defects) in his post boxing career. Putting that weight on was heroic----but forget that and judge his acting. Its nowhere near the heights he reached in Taxi Driver. (Still his finest hour). Martin Scorsese showed great promise in the 1970s--but he has since been disappointing. (Apart from Goodfellas). Scorsese has never made a 10 \/ 10 movie. He is a flawed movie director......good.......but certainly not very good , and nowhere near great. Its a great shame really-----he could have been a contender !!

Not only because it endorses the pure magnificence of the noir genre, but also presents a strikingly deep insight into the mind of a depressed aging man. It is in a few aspects similar to his one year older masterpiece The Woman in the Window, but the personal drama and shocking rupture of a certain relationship is still much more powerful. What amazed me the most is the previously mentioned emphasis on the characteristics of Christopher Cross, the protagonist, who is married to a woman he does not love one bit, and in the meantime is desperately trying to charm and 'seduce' the beautiful and utterly deceitful Kitty. He lies to please her, begs for her love, asks her to marry him (it happened so many times that I actually stopped counting) and in the end what did he get? Well, you have to find for yourselves, but I can tell you for sure - It really was not worth the sacrifice. Yet, in the end, I was not truly sorry for what had happened to the old man. If you blindly trust a pretty lady (running around with a strange fellow), you simply deserve what is coming to you.
