Add in a few two-dimensional stock characters to back up our young lovers and you've got the modern Hollywood version of the historical epic.

He may not have made a really great film since The Terminator or maybe Aliens, but he's never made a boring one to my knowledge.

We see her, in that moment, taking the first steps towards becoming the bold, confident older woman charmingly portrayed by Gloria Stuart in the modern-day sequences. Cameron's very good at showing female characters finding previously untapped depths of character and strength, and he successfully goes back to that well in Titanic.

In the opening scenes after Vasili's initial flashbacks they really build sympathy for the plight of the Russian soldier. With the NKVD with orders to shoot anyone retreating, the common soldier's issued only one rifle for every two troops, while the NKVD has the SMG's and MG's with orders to shoot Russian troops caught running back, you wonder how we backed a regime that would do this to their own men. The film made me feel there was potential for CGI in these films, it was not perfect, but it must have been easier then trying to get the real things when it came to planes and tanks. someone commented on the use of T-34\/85's which were not available till around, or just after Kursk in '43, well maybe those were the only T-34's they could get, granted there are companies that specialize in making mock-ups of all sorts of vehicles as well.With the Germans, I thought they could have varied the tanks and armored vehicles a little more, it seemed all the Germans had were Panzer III's and Sdkfz 251 series half tracks. Enough technical crap, I thought the acting was decent, the story alright save for the love triangle. One thing they tried to convey with Koenig was that, despite his aristocratic baring, and almost callous nature to the plight of the common soldier, a common trait of the German Officer Corp, especially the Wehrmacht, I got the notion he did feel he had a score to settle, having lost his son during the first week of the battle, and how he looked out for the kid, giving him warnings and what not. (Warning Spoiler) Having Ed Harris kill the kid was a ploy I think to kill what residual amount of sympathy you might have had for Ed Harris's character. It seems as always Hollywood likes to have situations broken down to purely black and white morality. The film had its problems but was still entertianing, a 6, possibly 7 out of 10.

Like many of you, I grew up with Tolkien's trilogy and it is now a deeply ingrained part of my brain's story lexicon. It's a classic tale and anyone who has read it will tell you that it's scope is probably unfilmable due to the density of the text. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is arguably the toughest book in the trilogy to make it through; it is very slow-paced for the first half of the book, and the whole story is filled with exposition that is absolutely vital in establishing the world and situations that Tolkien conjures up. In fact, his world is put forth in such exhaustive detail that the reader actually feels like they are in Middle Earth. Plus the history of this world is recounted in voluminous detail from many speakers with equally diverse agendas. This density would be impossible to get across on the screen without about seven hours of screen time. Every single character is fully rounded, and it takes many, many pages to establish their personalities.The movie, which clocks in at just under three hours, does a laudable job of trying to squeeze in as much of the book as is humanly possible within the time allotted. The problem is, if you've read the book there are things that you will know are missing, some important and some not so important, yet it moves just as slowly as the book does until the Fellowship's mission actually begins. Since you really need to see every bit of the story, I don't recommend ingesting anything that will make you need to use the can, because you might miss something cool. The people whom I know who have not read the book seem to really love the movie, but the film comes off at times like a video game. It has a mission set up in detail, and once the adventure begins the characters move from one special-effects-laden cliffhanger to another with nary a moment to catch their breath.I could go on like this, but instead I'll make notes of specific bits of interest (which are admittedly skewed toward those of you who have read this stuff)1. The film is simply the most visually sumptuous fantasy story ever committed to celluloid. If you're going to do RINGS for the screen, you have to make the world of Middle Earth absolutely, 100% believable. They succeeded at this resoundingly. The varying sizes of the humans, dwarves, elves and hobbits is pulled off with no trace whatsoever of special effects gimmickry, and short of going location shooting in an imaginary place, it gets no better than this. 2. Notable omissions from the story Tom Bombadil is completely written out (no surprise there), and as a result the adventures in the forest with Old Man Willow and the Barrow Wight are likewise out the window. Bill the pony's role is greatly reduced, and Sam's sorrowful parting with him in the film consequently makes no sense. Radagast the Brown is nowhere to found. Glorfindel has been excised completely and his role in getting Frodo safely to Rivendell now falls to Arwen. 3. Let me quell your fears about Arwen right now. She's onscreen for literally about five minutes, and Liv Tyler's weird looks work toward making her look convincingly Elf-like. She allegedly has a larger role in the next two installments, but she really doesn't have much to do with FELLOWSHIP. 4. Boromir's motivation is given only the slightest bit of mention, so when he suffers his crisis and redeems himself in a suicidal attempt to help his comrades, you won't give a shit. 5. Several of the more famous set pieces are executed brilliantly, and they made me feel like I felt when I read those scenes for the first time. Worth the price of admission the history of the One Ring, the Mines of Moria, The Fellowship's battle with Saruman's new and improved Orcs. 6. Back to the Mines of Moria for a sec. This sequence alone was so good that I would have paid thirty dollars to see just it! This gets my vote as the greatest fantasy-movie battle scene of all time, and when the Balrog enters the fray you truly realize that all bets are off. And the Balrog. If I saw that thing coming at me in real life, I would die of primal terror, spontaneously re-incarnate and die again. DO NOT GET UP AND GOT TO THE BATHROOM DURING THIS SCENE. 7. For the ladies the Fellowship is a parade of manly eye-candy, and from the reaction of the hetero females in the audience, Strider is the hands-down winner. 8. For you elf fans out there, Legolas is a triumph. A quiet, precise badass who will surgically remove you with his bow, he looks a bit like a wussy Jethro Tull refugee (which is entirely appropriate), but his inhuman skill is something to behold. 9. Everything that you've heard about Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood is true; they are Gandalf and Frodo. 10. Due to his love of the Hobbits' pipeweed and his perceived memory loss as a result, Gandalf can be seen as a pothead wizard. 11. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White. It's always a pleasure to see Christopher Lee, but this is the villain role that he was born to play. A subtle menace hangs over him, and when he finally reveals his true intentions, he is a guy who you simply do not want to mess with. 12. They (mercifully) did away with the songs.So, my bottom line is this if you go expecting the depth of the book, you are in for a bit of a disappointment, but if you go in with no preconceptions (and bear in mind that it is a three hour assnumbathon), you will see a beautifully crafted fantasy epic. Do not buy the claim that it is the best movie of the year though! That would be POOTIE TANG.

Like many of you, I grew up with Tolkien's trilogy and it is now a deeply ingrained part of my brain's story lexicon. It's a classic tale and anyone who has read it will tell you that it's scope is probably unfilmable due to the density of the text. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is arguably the toughest book in the trilogy to make it through; it is very slow-paced for the first half of the book, and the whole story is filled with exposition that is absolutely vital in establishing the world and situations that Tolkien conjures up. In fact, his world is put forth in such exhaustive detail that the reader actually feels like they are in Middle Earth. Plus the history of this world is recounted in voluminous detail from many speakers with equally diverse agendas. This density would be impossible to get across on the screen without about seven hours of screen time. Every single character is fully rounded, and it takes many, many pages to establish their personalities.The movie, which clocks in at just under three hours, does a laudable job of trying to squeeze in as much of the book as is humanly possible within the time allotted. The problem is, if you've read the book there are things that you will know are missing, some important and some not so important, yet it moves just as slowly as the book does until the Fellowship's mission actually begins. Since you really need to see every bit of the story, I don't recommend ingesting anything that will make you need to use the can, because you might miss something cool. The people whom I know who have not read the book seem to really love the movie, but the film comes off at times like a video game. It has a mission set up in detail, and once the adventure begins the characters move from one special-effects-laden cliffhanger to another with nary a moment to catch their breath.I could go on like this, but instead I'll make notes of specific bits of interest (which are admittedly skewed toward those of you who have read this stuff)1. The film is simply the most visually sumptuous fantasy story ever committed to celluloid. If you're going to do RINGS for the screen, you have to make the world of Middle Earth absolutely, 100% believable. They succeeded at this resoundingly. The varying sizes of the humans, dwarves, elves and hobbits is pulled off with no trace whatsoever of special effects gimmickry, and short of going location shooting in an imaginary place, it gets no better than this. 2. Notable omissions from the story Tom Bombadil is completely written out (no surprise there), and as a result the adventures in the forest with Old Man Willow and the Barrow Wight are likewise out the window. Bill the pony's role is greatly reduced, and Sam's sorrowful parting with him in the film consequently makes no sense. Radagast the Brown is nowhere to found. Glorfindel has been excised completely and his role in getting Frodo safely to Rivendell now falls to Arwen. 3. Let me quell your fears about Arwen right now. She's onscreen for literally about five minutes, and Liv Tyler's weird looks work toward making her look convincingly Elf-like. She allegedly has a larger role in the next two installments, but she really doesn't have much to do with FELLOWSHIP. 4. Boromir's motivation is given only the slightest bit of mention, so when he suffers his crisis and redeems himself in a suicidal attempt to help his comrades, you won't give a shit. 5. Several of the more famous set pieces are executed brilliantly, and they made me feel like I felt when I read those scenes for the first time. Worth the price of admission the history of the One Ring, the Mines of Moria, The Fellowship's battle with Saruman's new and improved Orcs. 6. Back to the Mines of Moria for a sec. This sequence alone was so good that I would have paid thirty dollars to see just it! This gets my vote as the greatest fantasy-movie battle scene of all time, and when the Balrog enters the fray you truly realize that all bets are off. And the Balrog. If I saw that thing coming at me in real life, I would die of primal terror, spontaneously re-incarnate and die again. DO NOT GET UP AND GOT TO THE BATHROOM DURING THIS SCENE. 7. For the ladies the Fellowship is a parade of manly eye-candy, and from the reaction of the hetero females in the audience, Strider is the hands-down winner. 8. For you elf fans out there, Legolas is a triumph. A quiet, precise badass who will surgically remove you with his bow, he looks a bit like a wussy Jethro Tull refugee (which is entirely appropriate), but his inhuman skill is something to behold. 9. Everything that you've heard about Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood is true; they are Gandalf and Frodo. 10. Due to his love of the Hobbits' pipeweed and his perceived memory loss as a result, Gandalf can be seen as a pothead wizard. 11. Christopher Lee as Saruman the White. It's always a pleasure to see Christopher Lee, but this is the villain role that he was born to play. A subtle menace hangs over him, and when he finally reveals his true intentions, he is a guy who you simply do not want to mess with. 12. They (mercifully) did away with the songs.So, my bottom line is this if you go expecting the depth of the book, you are in for a bit of a disappointment, but if you go in with no preconceptions (and bear in mind that it is a three hour assnumbathon), you will see a beautifully crafted fantasy epic. Do not buy the claim that it is the best movie of the year though! That would be POOTIE TANG.

Towards the end of the movie (just before the one girl gets thrown out the 2nd floor cabin window, if you look hard enough you can see a camera man's shadow in the background.)3. I might be right, but at the end of Jason Lives wasn't part of his mask broken off when the boat broke his neck, I think that his mask in this one does not have that part of his mask broken off.4. Right before he guts the guy raiding the fridge you can see Jason's shadow in one shot that looks like a cardboard cutout, but a few seconds later you see him moving with out any problems at all.Really this is a good Jason movie, but I couldn't help noticing these things in the movie. It's funny how some of these minor things were overlooked by the staff. I only hope they release part 7 on DVD, I've heard that there was a lot of gore cut out of this one, and it would be included in a possible DVD version. Anyways if you like the other Jason flicks you'll like this one too.

That's why I found myself stranded in the business sector of Chatswood during peak hour traffic. I just finished a brain dead job that pays for my nasty habits and decided to pull over into a cinema while the traffic died down. Nothing like a good old suburban meat market cinema on a Tuesday Scab Night, (tickets are $7 compare to any other night of $12), where the rustling of chip packets and the whispering giggles of the Inner-North Shore school girls accompany the film's soundtrack. That all died down eventually as the plot sucks you in for the end thrills. It all starts with three men finding a crashed aeroplane camouflaged in the thick snow. In the plane is a bag load of money. The three men decide to keep it, allowing a brutal chain of events to take over their quiet peaceful lives. With the cliches that money is the root.... and evil is in all of us thrown upon the audience, there lurks another mystery to life rarely seen in main stream cinema. That is the conscience after the brutal act.Jacob, (great performance from Billy Bob), has doubts about his own existence when faced with the evils of life. Will he be able to live with the pain of memory. He may be a simpleton but his guilt eats him away. As for his mentally well off brother, Eddie, (Bill Paxton), he discovers the evil in himself with support by the love of his wife, Sarah, (Bridget Fonda). The film plays with you, not going where you think it may head, always taking a different road to disaster. Only drawback comes with Sam Raimi controlling his manic style of directing that made EVIL DEAD a horror classic and saved THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. Maybe he knew the story was strong enough to carry itself. With something as this long, a few of Raimi's visual flares wouldn't have caused any harm. Even Alfred Hitchcock threw in a few visual treats to heighten the thrills.

Unfortunately, the structure is so amorphous that nothing at all registers. There are a ton of promising vignettes, but none of them are developed.

What about the teacher whom the boys saw naked? Allen drops it like a hotcake. The actors are all good, but their characters aren't developed enough to really care about.
