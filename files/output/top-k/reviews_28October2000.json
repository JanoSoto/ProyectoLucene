It is instead a deceptively simple, yet busy, multi-layered, character study of a Truffaut-like character (the Man who Loved Women) who has nearly become a martyr to the women that surround him.Dr T. loves his wife too much, he's successful and looks like Richard Gere. He's remained faithful to the wife who has become more and more spoiled and selfish and now suffers from a fictional malady which causes her to regress to childhood behavior- which includes jumping into a fountain in a crowded mall, and stripping off all her clothes and giving up sex entirely because it's too naughty.  One of his spoiled daughters is about to get married, and about to become a famous cheerleader, the other spoiled daughter works at the Dallas Conspiracy Museum fretting about mom, her sister and just about everything.   There's a spoiled sister-in-law who's separated, drinks too much and has moved into his house with her three kids.  And there's also dozens of rich, pampered Dallas society women he treats.  You see, Dr. T is a gynecologist.Dr. T. eventually explains that to him women are saints.  When they go wrong or go bad it's a man's fault.  He's about to learn a hard lesson, that his belief is a little bit lopsided, a little bit too much of a good thing. Nobody is perfect, not even women.  And Men ... not even him, should ever be so presumptuous to believe they have the ultimate control.Now there's some critics and writers who have apparently already decided the film is more than a little misogynistic.  They need to watch the film a few more times.    There are others that have decided the film is a lighter than latte foam.  They also need to watch the film a few more times.It's far from a perfect film, and it isn't an important film with a message or one that ends with a powerful emotional wallop that sucker punches you at it's conclusion.No, this is a wonderfully written, masterfully directed, perfectly cast, brilliantly acted gem of a film.  It's almost a modern screwball comedy, the way a Sturges may have delivered one, if he had been Altman.I suspect there are several scenes the film critics are identifying or complaining about as being slightly off mark.  For me there were two.  And they were minor.  One involves a scene in which a women patient is allowed to smoke.  The smoking is over-exaggerated... like the women is actually an actresses pretending to smoke.. too quickly, too desperately.  It's one of the few phony, overly deliberate scenes in the film.      The other is when Dr. T is told a secret about his about to wed daughter Dee Dee, by his other daughter.   It plays false, because the revelation should not throw his character for quite the loop it does, in quite the way it does.The film quickly recovers from both of these brief stumbles however.A casual film-goer might take a lot of what Altman does for granted.   So permit me this obvious to many, explanation.In real life, when we are in a crowded room we can hear several conversations at once, and tune in and out of the ones we want to over-hear. However, to duplicate this on film is quite a difficult technical feat.  To wire the room properly for sound, to get everyone talking at the right volume, to get the mixing of volumes in post production and  make sure all of the conversations can be heard, to decide how they are blended in and around one another, to create believable movement... well it's a remarkable achievement.  Altman perfected this technique, and few do it as well or as successfully.  Few create entire scenes that drip with layers of texture and detail like an Altman scene often can.  Few give a feeling of depth to both foreground and background characters within the same scene.  Few give so many actors a moment here and a moment there to react or do just the right thing.  Few let us glimpse at both sides of a situation the way Altman lets us.  It can be confusing, and it isn't necessary to the plot of the film. It just adds a layer of authenticity to every shot.  Minor characters and extras may have a bit of business which is so perfectly done, such a rightly captured human moment it makes us smile with its truth.The danger of course is by making sure to get so many details right, it forces us to closely inspect every other detail of the film.  Sometimes some details aren't right.  Sometimes some details ring false, or are missed or passed over.We forgive Altman for these things in many of his films, because the stumbles are going to happen when you push so hard, to be so precise, yet remain loose enough to give your actors the room they need to act, to improvise, to find their moments.   When you trust people, be they art directors or actors, not all their decisions are going to be good ones.  But you let them make their mistakes.  You let them have their moments, good, and not so good.  You hope the not so good moments give the film a shaggy dog feel.  It's imperfections transform into making the film oh so much more precious and endearing because it isn't perfect.Altman paints as he goes.  It's a technique that is like a high wire artist in a circus working without a net.  Altman has fallen many times in the past.  But he's lived through his falls.And now with Dr T and the Women he dazzles us with a lifetime of his experience behind the camera, constructing scenes, working with actors, and proves himself a master.  He's taken for granted these days and when his films are less than they should be, critics will take to calling him a traffic manager, yet when it does work the way it's supposed to-- few call him a genius.He's not really a genius....  He's Altman.  He's been doing things the way he pleases for nearly 40 years now.  Ever since he refused to direct his third Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode in the 60's and got himself fired. Ever since he followed his smash hit Mash, with the quirky and bizarre Brewster McCloud. Ever since he directed such brilliant films as McCabe and Mrs. Miller, The Long Goodbye, Thieves Like Us, and of course Nashville.  He falls right on his face with things like Quintet and Beyond Therapy. He can direct a disappointment  like  Popeye and  then  turn his back completely on Hollywood and the studios for nearly ten years to concentrate on directing little known and quirky plays like Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, Streamers, and Secret Honor.This is the guy capable of directing one of the greatest political satires ever made -- Tanner &#145;88  (For HBO) and then make a triumphant critical return to Hollywood with   The Player, follow that up with the masterpiece Short Cuts only to let nearly everyone down with Ready to Wear and Kansas City.

The film was not thought of as a success.Then there was Cookie's Fortune, a fine quirky little ensemble piece and now a bigger quirker ensemble piece; Dr T and the Women.Altman is a film-maker who continues to do things exactly as he pleases. Even at 75, he's making controversial films which will inspire film-makers to reach beyond formulas and focus groups and create something which defies labels and perhaps even genres.  They are also tough films to market to an audience.Just look at what he does at the end of Dr. T and the Women.  He could have chosen to let the film wind down, but instead he takes a giant leap and I believe scores a huge victory for doing so.Altman is the undisputed master of creating moments that will frustrate some, exhilarate others but ultimately be precisely the type of ending the material demanded all along.The last line of the film ties into the film in a surprising, spiritual manner that couldn't be more perfect, couldn't be more simple and yet is an extreme risk which I suspect many critics will consider it a flaw.  Some may even read it incorrectly.Not everyone is going to like or even accept what Altman does.  But if you have been paying attention to the film, I trust you will respect what he does.Altman has not stunt casted, or forced any of his actors to stretch beyond what they are capable of.  Even Helen Hunt who I find to be an appealing but extremely limited actress , turns in a performance that uses her few strengths so well, you don't notice her weaknesses.Richard Gere has never been better, and probably never will be this good again.Dr. T & The Women is a quirky character study of a man who believes he understands women better than he understands himself.  He discovers he doesn't understand himself very well at all and consequently doesn't know women all that well either.There are several witty, satirical, clever and funny observations being made about a great many things in the film, but there are also some keenly made ones that speak directly to the heart and soul of the human psyche.

'Lucky Numbers' isn't what it wants to be, but it's funny nonetheless. In order to make an official black comedy you have to start with a foundation in reality. From there you go a little off-center then you pull back to your realistic roots. You again go a little crazy later on, but just a little, then pull back again. In order for black comedy to be as humorously unsettling as it should be, it has to be handled by a professional; someone who knows what they're doing. M*A*S*H did it right, but Altman's a pro. Even Scorcese was slightly off with 'After Hours,' but it was pretty close. 'Very Bad Things' was a complete failure, but who's Peter Berg to try something so difficult?Nora Ephron, one of my favorite directors of the past ten years, has a great script with 'Lucky Numbers.' I hate the title, though. (Lately, it seems the people making movies name their projects the first thing that comes to mind.) A better title here would have been 'Balls.' This would be referring to Lisa Kudrow's character, though, and not John Travolta's. She is the strongest character here, and the best-looking, even though she's merely playing Phoebe yet again with some curse words thrown in. But Phoebe never said BL** ME! to her boss on 'Friends'. I wonder if the public would buy her in a more serious role a la 'The Opposite of Sex.' The supporting cast is underused, but great, especially Chris Kattan from SNL, playing Travolta's young wide-eyed protégé. His excerpts from his treatise on Evel Knievel are hilarious.This is a very appealing story that everyone who has ever wanted to win the lottery can enjoy. And who hasn't? For those paying attention, there are some great throw-away lines & asides and the look of the film is striking. For the life of me, though, I can't understand why this story takes place in 1988 instead of the here and now. Except for one Microsoft joke that was stolen from 'Forrest Gump' there is no reason turn the calendar back twelve years, unless it has something to do with the weather in Harrisburg, PA at the time. Oh well, even though it fails as a black comedy, it works as escapist comedy. Go see it and dream of walking away richer than before.

From there you go a little off-center then you pull back to your realistic roots. You again go a little crazy later on, but just a little, then pull back again. In order for black comedy to be as humorously unsettling as it should be, it has to be handled by a professional; someone who knows what they're doing. M*A*S*H did it right, but Altman's a pro. Even Scorcese was slightly off with 'After Hours,' but it was pretty close. 'Very Bad Things' was a complete failure, but who's Peter Berg to try something so difficult?Nora Ephron, one of my favorite directors of the past ten years, has a great script with 'Lucky Numbers.' I hate the title, though. (Lately, it seems the people making movies name their projects the first thing that comes to mind.) A better title here would have been 'Balls.' This would be referring to Lisa Kudrow's character, though, and not John Travolta's. She is the strongest character here, and the best-looking, even though she's merely playing Phoebe yet again with some curse words thrown in. But Phoebe never said BL** ME! to her boss on 'Friends'. I wonder if the public would buy her in a more serious role a la 'The Opposite of Sex.' The supporting cast is underused, but great, especially Chris Kattan from SNL, playing Travolta's young wide-eyed protégé. His excerpts from his treatise on Evel Knievel are hilarious.This is a very appealing story that everyone who has ever wanted to win the lottery can enjoy. And who hasn't? For those paying attention, there are some great throw-away lines & asides and the look of the film is striking. For the life of me, though, I can't understand why this story takes place in 1988 instead of the here and now. Except for one Microsoft joke that was stolen from 'Forrest Gump' there is no reason turn the calendar back twelve years, unless it has something to do with the weather in Harrisburg, PA at the time. Oh well, even though it fails as a black comedy, it works as escapist comedy. Go see it and dream of walking away richer than before.

Well, cut yourself a piece of Book Of Shadows pie, because this is a terrible, terrible movie.I don't know where to begin, so ill just talk at random about the sheer wretchedness of it all. (Warning, some plot revealers here!)- The opening credits are done to the music of a new Marilyn Manson song, that sounds a lot like beautiful people, one of his other singles.  Nothing wrong with the song, but it should have a proper place at least!  The camera flies over the top of the forest and the names of people involved with this monstrosity are named.  Every 15 seconds or so, a very brief clip of someone being brutally slaughtered pops up.  Then back to trees again.  All the while, even during the whole death thing, and upbeat metal song blares. Where the hell is the creepy composed music?!? If the intent was to shock viewers, use some slightly mood enhancing music here!-The drinking scene.  Ok, this is sad and pathetic.  Here we see for about 5-10 minutes, people getting drunk, high, and talking about their upbringings.  This is very boring.  The dialog is lame, and very hopefully came up with on the spot.  There's not much I can say that will describe why this scene is bad, other than the useless, useless blather that the characters seem to feel like talking about, like what Wicca people are really about, whether the witch is real, etc, etc, etc.-Stereotypes.  Ok, there are lots of crazy stereotypes here, and they all remind me of how bad this film is. -The Cajun sheriff, a big guy who says a lot of dukes of hazzard style lines Listen to me you little punk, ill git you!, Don't make break this door down! etc. -The Wicca girl.  I'm a child of the earth!.  She always acts so peaceful, close to nature, and so completely engrossed in the beauty of the natural world.  Performing spells must be great fun for her, since she seems to do them so darn often. -The Goth girl.  Dressed as a Goth, anyone can gain a sixth sense!  Because of her dark looking ways, for some reason she has the ability to know certain things without knowing why, and gets upset when she is asked about it.  She guesses the locations of certain things, facts about people's pasts, and knowledge of things to come. How did you know the tapes were there? I don't know, just shut up and leave me alone!.  Also, she seems to need to be constantly drunk and high, again showing that goths are really just interested in the hedonistic lifestyle (I don't think this way.)What else?  Oh, I could go on for days.  There's the whole ghost girl issue. Some girl keeps popping up in everyone's vision.  Now, the director COULD have made the scenes with this randomly appearing girl really scary with subliminal effects like in the exorcist, but instead he has to show her walking away, backwards, with extremely jerky 70's style stop motion animation.  Just what the hell was he thinking?Then there's the stupid ideas that are meant to creep you out, but fall flat a mile short.  There's a huge tree growing out of the remains of the old rustin parr house where the kids are murdered.  The camera guy wants to know how an old tree could be growing there, because who would want a giant tree in their living room?  Then later on, on videotape, the tree is just a small sappling.  Oooh, scareeeyy!  Then there's the great amounts of things being there one moment, then not being there the next.  We have a broken bridge, then we have a repaired bridge.  We have an owl on a branch, then we have just a branch.  We have barking dogs, then no barking dogs.Then there's the unexplained plots.  Why does every character see something other than what's really happening?  Why is everyone involved in a big orgy that they don't know about?  Why can't cameras capture dancing naked women at normal speed?  Why the hell is it even mentioned that one of the characters used to be a psycho?  Why? Why? Why?!?

The skeletons were done exactly the same decades earlier in Jason and the Aragnaughts. Alas, it was not a bad movie.

Charlie Sheen's cameo of a guy in police station was absolutely funny.6. This is John Hugh's BEST flick ever. 7. Mia Sara was sweet, she played Ferris's pretty girlfriend.8.

I can honestly say that  this movie had some of the biggest plot holes and that I can only hope it was some editing screw up do to with pacing, if not, the writter of this movie should be banned from ever being allowed to do a script again, if it was editings fault, then I hope they add the missing story line back onto the DVD edition when it comes out.  There was so much left unexplained in this movie. SPOILER ALERT now onto the spoilers\/plot holes -- Was Kolsen's mother part of the Evil (with a capital E) church or was she raped by her brother?- Was Kolsen's Father\/Uncle the one who killed Kolsen's parents?- Who the hell has a digital clock in their car that is actually  set at the correct time, with out being off by a couple minutes, I thought only mercury clocks were that precise and who set his clock?  And wouldn't that clock then have to be set at the same time with the hospitals clock he was born in?- The uncle\/father tell's Kolsen he's going to be all powerful, but it only takes a bullet to the head to do the job, AFTER his designated time (455pm).  I always figured Satan to be a little more powerfull than that.- What exactly was Wynona job's during the Excorcism?- If Excorcism's are so rarely okayed by the church (per a statement Wynona made in the movie) how come she knew exactly how to prep the room like a seasoned pro?- The priest's possession, was it from the Exorcism they did earlier in the film? If it was, how could both the Priest and the Serial Killer both be possessed at the same time, wouldn't the Demon only be able to possess one body at a time?These are a few things that just popped into my head while I wrote this, I'm sure there's a ton more that I've over looked, but hey, who cares, not like the movie folks did when they wrote it!  On an upside, this move had really kewl camera work, like the kind in Saving Private Ryan, the really grainy type you get when you remove 60% of the color in the film.  So if your really into neato tricks you can do with film but found Private Ryan to intense of a story, go see Lost Souls, you'll be thrilled an find it as about as deep as the children's book Run Spot Run.

Brooks, the creator of Terms of Endearment and Broadcast News. The great Jack Nicholson, who won his second Oscar as Best Supporting Actor for Terms, won his third Oscar as Best Actor for his hilarious performance here as Melvin Udall, a mean-spirited writer who is hated by everyone and has a tendency to act weird and unusual (for example, when he walks down a street he avoids stepping in cracks by stepping over them). Then he begins to show off a nice side of himself thanks in part to two other people his favorite waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear). He also becomes attached to Simon's adorable little dog Verdell when Simon's art dealer pal (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to watch the dog after Simon is injured in a beating and hospitalized. Most movies simply don't get as good as this. As Good As It Gets is very well-written and directed by Brooks who sure knows how to make good movies. He's only directed four feature films in his career and three of them have been excellent (only his 1994 film I'll Do Anything was a dud). As Good As It Gets is also beautifully acted by the entire cast. Nicholson is perfect here and so are Hunt and Kinnear. Hunt has proven that she can be a great actress both on the small screen (as on her long-running TV show Mad About You which won her four Emmys) and on the big screen (she deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance here and she's very good in the current release Pay It Forward). Kinnear is also very good in this movie too (he was nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar). The rest of the supporting cast from Cuba Gooding Jr. to Shirley Knight to former Ghostbuster Harold Ramis are cast to perfection in As Good As It Gets.

The gang leader just happens to have Samurai skills as well, and later takes on our hero in a scene of gobsmacking inanity. Do I smell co-production here? Chinese director, Chinese gang? Grlscz has other problems, such as forgetting to breathe sometimes. Perhaps that's why he was squatting on the beach, he decided to go to the toilet but forgot to remove his trousers which could prove quite a sticky problem. Jack Davenport shows up as a cop. Is he the same one as in 'Ultraviolet'? No wonder you can't find a copper when you need one, they're all working nights. Timothy Spall plays his partner and is the one bright spark in this pretentious art-house cobblers. See 'Razor Blade Smile' instead, it's more fun. So what is the wisdom of crocodiles? You'll have to find out for yourself but don't be surprised if afterwards you find yourself writing a cheque and sketching the shop assistant at the same time.

I never got bored and felt that after the film was over that I knew these people inside and out. It's one of the only films to really hit the head of the nail about what the late 70's were like when sex  was still safe, drugs were in, and people danced all night at the local disco. And to go from this to the downfall of the early 80's and still hold me took me by surprise. And dissagree or agree, this isn't just a film about porno and the people who make them, this is a film about who you make and call your family when you can't seem to find one. This, along with L.A. Confidential, Braveheart, Fargo, Pulp Fiction, Silence of the Lambs, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption, and P.T's Magnolia (love it or hate it, it's the last great film of the century) are the ten best films of the 90's.

If they had stuck with just the two central stories (the pay-it-forward idea and the romance), it would have been a tighter film. This would be a good rental if you wanted to watch something while you puttered around the house. You don't have to pay much attention to the movie to get the idea. The way the story flashes from the past to the present is handled in a somewhat confusing way. There was no need to tell this story in such a fashion. The only reason you can follow along is because, as human beings, we can figure out which events happened when. (I thought maybe the film was shown a little out of sequence at this particular preview screening. That happens sometimes, but this was not the case.)I keep hearing Oscar-related talk about this movie. This is a nice little story but if this is Oscar material, we are in trouble. This movie travels ground we've seen repeatedly in better films. The abused soul. The alcoholic mother. Homeless people. The pay-it-forward idea is the only twist. It's an enjoyable fantasy, but nothing more. Let's hear no more Oscar talk, 'kay?The ending was manipulative and completely unnecessary. This really brings down my recommendation for 'Pay It Forward.' If you see this, please leave ten minutes early. You'll like it better that way.

I've been keenly anticipating this film for a long time and rushed out to see it on opening night, but it just didn't seem to make the grade.There was a lot of good about the film. It started well.  It had that 'soft touch' of a master-director.  The costumes and background of 60s Hong Kong was superb.  And the acting, especially Maggie's was great.  There was some superb cinematography and mise-en-scene - the quick pans, crossing the line and other great touches, but the film just lacked something.OK, this is the part where my criticism is weak. I can't put my finger on what it lacked.  I'm tempted to suggest something to do with the story or the plot, but just look at my favourite Wang Kar Wai film, Days of Being Wild, and that criticism doesn't hold up.  Maybe it was character.  Maybe the romance just didn't quite seem to spark - no Tianmimi\/Comrades this. Sorry, but to say what was wrong I'd have to go watch all his movies again then this one for comparison.

How can you top a movie as good as that? Well, the answer is, you can't! But still, this '90's rendition of one of the most beloved horror films of all time still isn't quite as bad as one would suspect. That's mainly because little has been changed. Joseph Stefano's original script was used and director Gus Van Sant, perhaps sensing what a stir there would be, hasn't strayed too far from it. Naturally, the shower scene is slightly more graphic this time around, and there's an unnecessary masturbation scene, but although it doesn't add anything new to Hitch's most famous film and the most famous horror movie of all-time, one can't help but feel that Van Sant's film could have turned out worse, much worse. Vince Vaughn, a good actor, wouldn't have been my first choice for the Tony Perkins role, but he comes off surprisingly well, that is to say, better than Anne Heche who is severely miscast in the Janet Leigh role. There's not much praise to give the 1998 PSYCHO other than to say it could have been worse. The '98 PSYCHO is a film that should be seen once just to satisfy the curiosity, after that, do yourself a favor and go back to the original. My personal advice to Mr. Van Sant is don't tamper with perfection.
