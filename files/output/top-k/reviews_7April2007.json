But what he didn't expect was to meet Sera, a prostitute with problems of her own.This film is pretty highly acclaimed and Nicolas Cage received an Oscar for his role as the drunk. Personally, I don't know that Cage deserved the award for this one. Later on in the film his acting gets better, but the first half just seems like Cage being himself more than anything. The opening scene of him loading a shopping cart with booze is more comedic than serious. And drinking a bottle of booze as a cop drives past? Better roles he's played Weather Man, Lord of War and Adaptation. This was more akin to Trapped in Paradise, hardly a notable role.Elizabeth Shue, likewise, was questionable. I thought she did a much better job than Cage, but was still not a break-out role by all means. I think any number of actresses could easily have handled her role as well or better.I was also disappointed because the film has a strong anti-drinking message, but I have to say the movie really made me want to drink. I have no doubt many people have played a drinking game to this one. So, mission not accomplished.Criticisms aside, it was a good movie. I really enjoyed watching it even if I didn't think it was outstanding. The story was interesting, the characters fun, the camera-work was quite good and the Vegas scenery was spectacular. So it wasn't like it was a punishment to sit through. Cage is entertaining and Shue is quite attractive in her own way (though her most attractive role will always be in The Saint).I suppose I'd say you should see this movie, but I'd ask you to decide for yourself is this deserved awards. I just didn't see it. Which, I guess, is more a complaint about the Academy than the film itself. But it put me in the wrong mindset -- expecting some mind-blowing drama and just getting a film not unlike which I've seen many times before.

Leoni is also very good - she's just developing into a wonderful actress and will probably get an Oscar very soon. I do not also categorize this film as pure fantasy as for me this is of course all Jack's dream and we all know that dreams are in some way part of the reality. It has to be said though that the director (by the way he's a future of Hollywood) draws a clear line between the dream world and the actual one - there is a feeling of urgency when Jack is coming to the airport in the final scene and I could certainly relate to that myself as most of us have to choose in our lives between career and relationships and sometimes there are moments when you're not so sure about your past choices.

You know there's no way out for these characters, and as the film progresses, you learn more about their situation, and more about the different characters.I like to think I know a lot about films, although I often get the feeling that the reasons why I think I like them are wrong, and someones going to laugh at me and tell me I got the completely wrong idea about the film. Nevertheless, I am going to say why I liked reservoir dogs so much. The film begins with a very calm, friendly atmosphere, introducing the characters as if it were a day like any other. It then jumps to a very dramatic scene, one of my favourites in the film, showing that, and all the characters involved knew this, this day was definitely not normal. I love this scene so much because the acting seems so realistic, and the dying Mr.orange seems so convincing as a dying man, it really cut straight through to my emotions. I like how it isn't made to seem graceful, or sudden, as many films do, and this writhing agony seems a lot more realistic to me. Mr white reacts in a way i also love, speaking to him almost in a way you would to a panicking child, with a slightly tuneful side. This discreetly introduces the characters of Mr. orange as vulnerable, perhaps new to these situations, like a child, and Mr. white as more experienced, more focused on the situation, although a note of panic can be detected in his own voice, showing that this situation is also distressing for him.As the film progresses more characters are introduced, and we learn how their human side corrupts their professional side I find this more realistic, as a film such as mission impossible may show people within the profession easily cutting out any human emotions from their job, whereas this shows how realistically that is a lot more difficult for them. The more caring side to these characters, or the side of them that we could understand most of, is the side that destroys them all in the end. The character who at the beginning it is easy to despise, Mr. Pink, the person who seems most heartless and selfish, is in that way the most professional, and I find it distressing to find at the end that this character I hated the most is the only surviving character. I think it more true to real life that the good guys don't always win. It is also more true to life that who is good and who is bad is less clear. Mr. Orange is the legally decent character, although the way that he is introduced in the middle of the film makes him appear to have betrayed us in what we as the viewers have first thought of him as, and also betrayed the gangsters who have put their trust in him, especially Mr White, the man who put his life on the line for him. Mr White, although a criminal and morally bad person, still has some caring characteristics, such as defending Mr. Orange.This is just what I think of the film, its probably either completely wrong or completely obvious to everyone else to the extent that they want to beat me repeatedly round the head, but I just thought I'd put it anyway.

However, he soon discovers a link between a recent murder in the city and a murder outside of the city, which leads him to the trail of a revenge killer.As an entry in the Dirty Harry franchise the film starts with some very promising moments, including the legendary Go ahead, make my day line that Eastwood delivers wonderfully through clenched teeth before single handedly foiling a robbery. Very badass and it just what fans can expect from him. However, the film soon shifts gears and focuses on the mysterious revenge killer. The problem is that this killer isn't all that mysterious as she is characterized as much as Harry is. This really detracts from the presence of the main character who ruled all of his previous film appearances with, pardon the pun, Magnum Force.On the bright side this new storyline does draw several parallels to Harry's own unorthodox methods and gives his character dramatic depth that was not there before, but fans that were looking for another badass Harry outing will more than likely be somewhat disappointed. However, a tense climax ends the film on an exciting note so if you don't mind something a little different, it is a good movie for fans. --- 7\/10Rated R for violence and a rape scene ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"7 April 2007","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I did enjoy this movie I guess.

I found myself confused by what the director was trying to get across at times with the different sounds from inside the house. This is simply a technical problem in my eyes as the characters would fill in the gaps where I was unsure, but the fact that the sounds, the driving force behind the suspense and horror, had a very hazy role was upsetting. This problem alone however is off set by good acting, good camera work and a great setting (all relative for the time).What this movie does suffer from however is a feeling of emptiness and missed opportunity. The history of the house, the haunting itself, and the role of the characters is never flushed out very well. In fact it becomes evident that this glaring omission was heavily focused on for the remake years later (which fails in and of itself for a number of reasons). This problem leads to the characters not being important at all to the viewer and more of an annoyance than anything else. No amount of good acting can save a character that is never explained.As for the suspense of the film there simply isn't enough to sustain the length of the film and there is just simply nothing to be frightened of. The movie never shows you the ghosts which is fine, however it does a poor job of giving you anything to be really scared of in any fashion. To relate back to what I said above about the sound quality, this is the biggest selling point for the film (which is a missed opportunity) and then there is little else.It's very sad to watch this movie and to know that it was limited by the era in which it was produced. There is much potential in it and one can understand how a remake SHOULD have been able to produce one of the most frightening movies in recent memory. I give this movie a very average rating because it really doesn't do anything very well yet at the same time has a good foundation.

So, there are a lot of elements to bring together, or attempt to, into a cohesive whole - a challenge that was probably next to impossible. This is, largely, a wish fulfillment dream for the Trek fans, namely an answer to the proposition 'what if Kirk teamed up with Picard?' The film represents the differences between this film series and others, in that much of the plot and themes are essentially dictated by the fans. The writers were given certain plot points that were mandated to be part of the story and their job was to somehow write around these Kirk meets Picard; Data gets emotional; Enterprise crashes; Kirk...meets his end? The writing is adequate, but due to the constraints, there were quite a few clumsy aspects to the overall story. There is an unusual scope to the film the first 18 minutes take place in the 23rd century, with Kirk, Scotty and Chekov (the last appearances for them) on the new Enterprise-B. This is a nice section, almost like a mini-movie or episode within the film, with our old guard crew definitely retired (tho I always felt Chekov had a good 10 years left in him). Then it transits to the 24th century, to Picard, Riker, Data and the rest of the crew of Enterprise-D.This transition in itself is not bad, but the writers had to come up with a way for Kirk to go forward and team up with his 24th century counterpart and using the by-now-stale method of traditional time travel was out. So they came up with the Nexus ribbon, an intriguing space\/time phenomenon which mirrors the concept of the film a wish-fulfillment dimension where\/when anything goes, anything can happen. It addressed the problem of how to get Kirk and Picard together, but is sufficiently vague and even hazy in its conception that it comes off as simply hasty writing, not the cleverness we hoped for. The threat faced by Picard and crew is the somewhat grandly villainous Soran (McDowell, fiendishly gleeful as is usual for him, but not entirely suitable for the tragic aspects of his character), whose plan to enter the Nexus involves destroying an entire solar system. Soran is teamed up with a couple of Klingon sisters from the TNG series and these actresses actually give the better performances in the film. The pace is pretty good, with enough action to offset the lengthy subplot about Picard's personal tragedy, which mirrors Soran's - parallels abound. The key battle scenes in space here echo those of the 3rd Trek film, in which a smaller Bird of Prey Klingon ship once again gains the upper hand over a more powerful Starfleet vessel - I suppose being a sneaky dastardly alien race has its advantages in both the 23rd and 24th centuries.But, it actually works to the film's favor, establishing a darkly ironic tone for the usually level, sometimes bland Trek universe. After seven years of evading destruction from all manner of cosmic menaces on the TNG series, the great ship is laid low by these cloaked skulkers, plotting their deeds from an outmoded vessel (the Enterprise-D's downfall was an edict from higher powers at Paramount, in reality). Likewise, after even more years of eluding all manner of death, Kirk appears to have used up all his good fortune. It seemed to me that, after exiting the safety of the Nexus, Kirk was doomed to fall, no matter what; he would've misstepped somewhere on those mountains even without Soran attacking him - all his cards had been played. Of course, as a longtime fan, I would've preferred Kirk survived and gone off into legend in the same way Scotty did on the TNG episode Relics. But no, the filmmakers were hampered by rules and lack of imagination, a bad combo for such a series. Rules were created for the Nexus, for example, which sweeps over the planet and takes Soran & Picard along with it, but leaves the Enterprise crew to die with the planet; so it only swept over that small part of the planet - convenient. Wild science fiction with loopholes.Kirk and Picard interact in much the way we would expect and it's a great exercise for the two seasoned actors, Shatner and Stewart. If only the setting wasn't so mundane - cooking eggs in a kitchen. The budget limitations, rushed quality and not thinking things out enough shows in these sections by rights, no one should be able to leave the Nexus. The audience has to make allowances to feel better about it all starship captains are made of different stuff. They'll get out. But, if you can get out, would you go back to the moments to just before everything goes to hell? Why not give yourself a day? If Kirk had to die, couldn't it have been on the bridge of an exploding starship or even an exploding planet, to give it some grandness, maybe even some greatness? You can drive yourself crazy with all the what ifs. Some of the themes, related to old age, the brevity of human life and making a difference, though having a 'tacked on' feel, do emerge by the end. And, it's interesting that the antagonist, who rebels against these declared virtues, is himself nearly immortal (Guinan's race is very long-lived); that may be why he instigated this conflict, not knowing the preciousness of a brief life. But, this is what happens when you put together a film as modified by fans - you get a fan film - exciting in many ways, quite illogical in others.

The movie exams the fact that although one can change for the better, at some point your past mistakes will catch up with you. Karma 101. The movie moves at a medium clip and at some points can slow down but all and all it's one of the best.

This is not the usual shamus movie. I was left with the impression that John Huston's character, although wounded and hurt, would get off legally because the last scene plays in Chinatown, where anyone with money and influence can beat any legal rap. However as someone who believes that if you live long enough, your own misdeeds will eventually punish you more than the corrupt law.As for life art imitating life, you have Roman Polanski, the convicted rapist of a 13 year old, and Jack Nicholson growing up not knowing who his father and mother was. This fact of life plays a central theme in this film, and J.J. Gittes had figured everything out but the true connection between Dunaway's character and Huston's, but too late to be the hero. Instead he is like most of us, a guy who hasn't got all the answers, and thats what separates this from your average cop film.As for the film, the only thing I didn't like, and don't like in general, is the tint used to give us the impression that the time frame is the 1930's and not 1974 when the movie was shot.

It's not for everyone (most every frame is saturated with high-octane testosterone), but if you've ever had that feeling of dissatisfaction in your life... the sense that you held back and\/or wished you pushed yourself further- Fight Club will likely hit a chord.Like most of David Fincher's films, it's a very dark, violent and dreamlike movie, but Fight Club also has quite a lot of humor in it. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfect in their mirrored characters as is Helena Carter as the edgy girlfriend\/sex object. Amazingly, with all the darkness, blood and grittiness- it's somehow extremely refreshing to watch... mainly because of the very primal way it addresses human behavior.Going into the theater, I didn't expect to like Fight Club all that much, but it quite simply blew me away.

A Kubrick film can't be recognized by its style. Kubrick never made two films alike but there is something that, unquestionable, makes them stand out. In Lolita's case the mere idea of touching the controversial novel with its taboo subject at its very core seem like a provocation from the word go. Pornography for the thinking man in which the only explicit act is the intention written in the character's eyes. Nothing is excessive and nothing is pulled back. James Mason - villain or victim - is monumental, mo-nu-men-tal! The unspeakable truth never leaves his brow. He is the most civilized man trapped in the lowest echelon of his own psyche. So aware, that it is painful to watch. Shelley Winters goes for it, taking her Mrs Hayes for all its worth and dives into the void of a desperate housewife, craving for sex. It is one of the most entertaining, shattering human spectacles, I've ever seen. But unlike Mason, she's not aware of it. There is a horrible innocence attached to her sickness. Peter Sellers's character from hell, the torturer comes in three riveting characterizations and Sue Lyon's temptress, the child, is the devil incarnate in a performance that defies description. None of them were nominated for Oscars and the film was condemned by every moral group in America and beyond. As film experiences go, this is one of the most provocative, enthralling, disgusting, entertaining and satisfying I've ever been through. Yep, I really mean that.

James Mason - villain or victim - is monumental, mo-nu-men-tal! The unspeakable truth never leaves his brow. He is the most civilized man trapped in the lowest echelon of his own psyche. So aware, that it is painful to watch. Shelley Winters goes for it, taking her Mrs Hayes for all its worth and dives into the void of a desperate housewife, craving for sex. It is one of the most entertaining, shattering human spectacles, I've ever seen. But unlike Mason, she's not aware of it. There is a horrible innocence attached to her sickness. Peter Sellers's character from hell, the torturer comes in three riveting characterizations and Sue Lyon's temptress, the child, is the devil incarnate in a performance that defies description. None of them were nominated for Oscars and the film was condemned by every moral group in America and beyond. As film experiences go, this is one of the most provocative, enthralling, disgusting, entertaining and satisfying I've ever been through. Yep, I really mean that.

The accomplices are two giants in both fields. Nabokov adapts his own infamous novel for the screen and Kubrick, no less, translates it into images in a way that makes it unique, unforgettable and transcendental without ever putting himself in front of the camera. A Kubrick film can't be recognized by its style. Kubrick never made two films alike but there is something that, unquestionable, makes them stand out.

The Godfather, Sound of Music, Life of Brian, Lord of the Rings, Cassablanca, James Bond, Trainspotting, Star Wars, The Italian Job and Titanic. Now not everyone will love these movies - I know that they're not all my favourites, but they will never be forgotten.For every movie, I can see reasons why people might not like that movie, but in this movie I can see no reason why someone would dislike this movie. It really annoys me when people say that they don't like this movie, because it is a superb movie with no weak points and the only reason why people say they don't like it is to try and be different, as when this movie was released ten years ago, everyone loved it, but when people keep on singing its praises, people want to not like it, so they watch it and try to not like it.The acting is superb, the director is superb and I don't think that it's possible for anyone to watch it without crying. It is the perfect love story combined with one of the greatest disasters of all times and they combine brilliantly to give one of the greatest movies of all time.The story moves at the perfect pace for this movie and shows times back then and the excitement at this brand new top class ship, which makes you even more upset when the corridoors are being filled with water.Of course there is that classic scene when Leo and Kate (who give flawless performances) are holding their hands outstretched at the end of the ship, which will be remembered forever as a classic scene in movie history.Summing up, this is an unbelievably good film, which is perfect in all places.
