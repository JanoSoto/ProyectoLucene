If all those who voted over the years had an opportunity (or the patience or the time) to watch all four episodes back to back, I think this rating thing would fare differently.Is there anyone who can honestly say the scene 2 of this movie, where Tom Cruise is free solo climbing in The Grand Canyon, jumping from one escarpment to another, slipping to an almost certain death and hanging from one hand like even Alex Honnold would not dare to try (Google that guy), is not an absolutely stunning piece of action footage. For good measure, the music playing in the background of that scene, the song 'Iko Iko', was, for those who know the story or origin of the song, a brilliant choice. The cinematography in that movie was superior to the original movie, in my not all that humble opinion, and certainly as good as the following two sequels. Critics, including music critics, all agree the OST (original sound track) in M I-2 is the best; I could not reproduce, at home, the sound I heard at the cinema, at least not without my neighbors getting very upset. I remember, twelve years after the fact, the excitement I felt walking out of the cinema; the others were also exciting, just not quite as much for me. The franchise does so well because many other 'moviegoers' walk out of the cinema with that very same excitement.I must acknowledge that, as with all big Hollywood action features, the story as well as the stunts defy reality and it's mostly fantasy, so the 'M.I.' films are aimed at thrill seekers and who isn't one from time to time. Anyone trying to judge these movies, comparing them to classics or award winning novel based dramas, is farting downwind.The first three 'M.I.' had renowned directors, but John Woo was unquestionably the best at action sequences, which abound in M I-2. The motorcycle chase scene is one hell of a superbly choreographed and edited action scene. Dougray Scott is the best villain of all the four M.I.; argue that one if you can. The best female co-star of all four 'M.I.', for my liking, is Thandie Newton. I know I am completely counter majority opinion here, but I maintain that back to back viewing of the four movies, or viewing in the same year would generate far different results.

Phantasm is one such classic that was neither recognised by the mainstream nor accepted as a B-Movie because it was simply too well made to really be loved as a cheap and tacky horror.Young director Don Coscarelli directed this family affair of a small but well made and enjoyable horror aimed at the ghosts and ghouls genre made so memorable by the Hammer House Of Horror label in the 60's, this time based in leafy green small town America.Mikey is just a lonely kid with no other boys to play with. Saddened by the loss of his parents, he lives with his older brother Jody, who is conflicted by his need to leave town and find his own peace. So Mikey spends his time drifting around town, following his young curiosity wherever it leads him.When one of his older brothers is found dead, he comes across the ancient and undead looking mortician after the funeral and witnesses something he shouldn't. As Jody and his friend Reggie go about their lives, Mikey finds his curiosity getting the better of him again and finds himself not only pursued by The Tall Man, but by the creatures of the night under his very command. It isn't long before Jody and Reggie are drawn into the strange goings on and discover that the whole town is in danger of becoming premature residents of the local mausoleum.What works so well in this film is what I call the Goonies Factor! The typical childhood adventure in quiet and what most city dwellers would call idyllic small town America, fraught with danger and all the inventive ways kids will create to get out of trouble. It's all here. Mikey's got his own motorbike already, his brother's a loner musician who drives a black Plymouth Hemi-Cuda. Then Reggie's a guitarist\/ice cream man whose reaction to everything is either absurdly dim or just comical. You can't not like or even love the characters.The Tall Man, played by Angus Scrimm who became a legend for this role although he's a well respected classical actor, is one of the freakiest horror film villains to never need a mask of any sort. Referring to Hammer Horror again, he has that unique charm and gift for character acting the same Christopher Lee has. It's refreshing even now to see an American film pull off an English formula successfully and few horrors have followed in Phantasm's success as a perfect all round horror. hell, not even the sequels until number four pulled that off.Fred Myrow created an amazing theme tune for Phantasm that resonated chimes of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells and gave the film more of an anthem than just a theme. The music's success alone went on to influence others such as John Carpenter and even death metal outfit Entombed recreated it as a song of their own titled The Left Hand Path.Other than the typical achievements of the film's production such as first time actors being able to act, the film counted on good old fashioned special effects tricks you can laugh at and then some that seemed revolutionary such as the flying silver spheres that drill holes in your skull and blend your brains and squirt them out all over the floor.If you want a classic horror film night for Halloween or just a regular Saturday night at home, get this and settle down for one of the more enjoyable rather than disturbing horrors!

What I got was completely unexpected, and nearly eleven years later, I'm still utterly obsessed with this wonderful and pretty much unique film. I saw it four times in the cinema, and have seen it several times since - and every time, it delights me and something new strikes me.It's an adaptation from a Daniel Clowes comic of the same name, and follows school friends Enid and Rebecca as they graduate from high school and attempt to find their way in the world. The comic is a masterpiece of observational dark comedy, and the film adaptation is different in some ways, adding a couple of elements to connect together some rather disjointed aspects of the comic. Enid's art class and the character of Seymour are absent in the comic, but their presence works well in the film and does give it more of a narrative structure, something that is needed with a film.Let me just say that I fell in love with Enid right from the start, even though she isn't a sympathetic character in a lot of ways. She can be snide, sarcastic, rude, inconsistent, unreliable and flaky, and is all these things in various quantities throughout the film. Still, there's something intelligent and independent about her, despite her struggles with alienation, insecurity, depression and loneliness. All the way through the film, she struggles to find something authentic and real in a rather fake and shallow world. Whilst at school, she was close friends with Rebecca, but after they leave, they gradually drift apart, and Rebecca seems content to take a conventional path. Enid's world rather painfully falls apart, which is touching, sad and poignant to watch.Enid and Rebecca are played to perfection by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson, but Enid IS this film - Thora's performance is just perfect and she gets everything right. The script is amazing as well. Enid and Rebecca's world is populated by a wonderful selection of freaks and misfits who are all both funny and tragic at the same time, and some of my favourites include the awesomely pretentious art teacher (mirror, father, mirror), Doug at the convenience store (you have to buy me dinner first!) and Melorra, the girl who desperately tries to befriend Enid and Rebecca but fails dismally.The cinematography is spot-on and the film is bursting with colour, which works really well despite the bleak tone some of it takes. The pace is slow and at times it's hard to feel that much is actually happening, and some people intensely dislike the film for this reason, but if you keep your eyes open, you'll observe a huge amount of fantastic detail in the film, which is all a razor-sharp observation on alienation and the nature of the world we live in. The sets are very convincing and Enid's bedroom in particular is done to perfection, closely resembling the rooms of many of my friends when I was in my teens.You'll either like Enid or hate her, and if you can't sympathise or empathise with her, there's not much in this film for you and you'll be better off elsewhere. It's one of the film's awesome strengths that the characters are so complex - I've always really disliked films where the goodies and baddies are very obvious right from the start, and where everything is neat and tidy. It's left to the viewer to decide who the heroes and villains of the piece are, and that's enough to provoke endless discussion. It's a film that's full of ambiguity, and the end is far from neat and tidy, but that is, I feel, very much what the book and film set out to do - show us that life is often ambiguous, vague and not how we expect it to be. The ending, in particular, diverges enormously from typical teen movies and there's no romantic end where Enid gets her man, and there's no place at college or dream job. In fact, the ending has been the source of constant debate since the film was released, as it could be viewed in a number of ways.(WARNING - SPOILERS) I won't go into too much detail, as you should see the ending for yourself without me giving too much away, but Enid effectively leaves town for an uncertain future. That's the literal interpretation. A commonly-held view is that the ending is a metaphor for suicide, and that Enid kills herself. I don't think this is the view of the author or director, and it's certainly not a view I hold myself, as that would be too awful and ghastly to contemplate. I see the ending as an attempt at a new start, and my own feeling is that there *is* a place in this world for Enid somewhere, and that she's going to find it, after a long struggle. The comic alludes to this more than the film does. However you choose to view it, though, the ending is challenging and can be hard to deal with, but finishes off this clever, funny and thought-provoking film in fine style.Possibly one of the greatest films about adolescence we will ever see.

Still, there's something intelligent and independent about her, despite her struggles with alienation, insecurity, depression and loneliness. All the way through the film, she struggles to find something authentic and real in a rather fake and shallow world. Whilst at school, she was close friends with Rebecca, but after they leave, they gradually drift apart, and Rebecca seems content to take a conventional path. Enid's world rather painfully falls apart, which is touching, sad and poignant to watch.Enid and Rebecca are played to perfection by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson, but Enid IS this film - Thora's performance is just perfect and she gets everything right. The script is amazing as well. Enid and Rebecca's world is populated by a wonderful selection of freaks and misfits who are all both funny and tragic at the same time, and some of my favourites include the awesomely pretentious art teacher (mirror, father, mirror), Doug at the convenience store (you have to buy me dinner first!) and Melorra, the girl who desperately tries to befriend Enid and Rebecca but fails dismally.The cinematography is spot-on and the film is bursting with colour, which works really well despite the bleak tone some of it takes. The pace is slow and at times it's hard to feel that much is actually happening, and some people intensely dislike the film for this reason, but if you keep your eyes open, you'll observe a huge amount of fantastic detail in the film, which is all a razor-sharp observation on alienation and the nature of the world we live in. The sets are very convincing and Enid's bedroom in particular is done to perfection, closely resembling the rooms of many of my friends when I was in my teens.You'll either like Enid or hate her, and if you can't sympathise or empathise with her, there's not much in this film for you and you'll be better off elsewhere. It's one of the film's awesome strengths that the characters are so complex - I've always really disliked films where the goodies and baddies are very obvious right from the start, and where everything is neat and tidy. It's left to the viewer to decide who the heroes and villains of the piece are, and that's enough to provoke endless discussion. It's a film that's full of ambiguity, and the end is far from neat and tidy, but that is, I feel, very much what the book and film set out to do - show us that life is often ambiguous, vague and not how we expect it to be. The ending, in particular, diverges enormously from typical teen movies and there's no romantic end where Enid gets her man, and there's no place at college or dream job. In fact, the ending has been the source of constant debate since the film was released, as it could be viewed in a number of ways.(WARNING - SPOILERS) I won't go into too much detail, as you should see the ending for yourself without me giving too much away, but Enid effectively leaves town for an uncertain future. That's the literal interpretation. A commonly-held view is that the ending is a metaphor for suicide, and that Enid kills herself. I don't think this is the view of the author or director, and it's certainly not a view I hold myself, as that would be too awful and ghastly to contemplate. I see the ending as an attempt at a new start, and my own feeling is that there *is* a place in this world for Enid somewhere, and that she's going to find it, after a long struggle. The comic alludes to this more than the film does. However you choose to view it, though, the ending is challenging and can be hard to deal with, but finishes off this clever, funny and thought-provoking film in fine style.Possibly one of the greatest films about adolescence we will ever see.

According to IMDb, Philip Eisner hasn't worked since The Mutant Chronicles and I'm not surprised. It was awful.

He assumes control with ease and just gets the job done like every plain and ordinary working man's boss does, rather than try to shine.Sam Neill as Dr Weir takes the reins of the troubled genius like a true theatre legend, showing why he has been one of the industry's consistently best actors since his re-emergence as a mature actor in psycho thriller Dead Calm. Here he really busts out the dramatic and hams it up to good effect when necessary, making him very much the main event, which I suppose he was meant to be.The backing cast also consisted of some very admirable talent including fellow Brits Joely Richardson as the cold hearted and sensible Ripley-alike second in command, Jason Isaacs as the ship's medic and psychologist and genre legend Sean Pertwee as the typically English grease monkey mechanic.

Wallace (portrayed by Mel Gibson) is a heroic figure in this. As a viewer you have no choice but to admire him for his courage and his fierce devotion to Scotland, and for his ability to rally the Scots around him. He certainly comes across as more consistently devoted to Scotland's freedom than, for example, Robert the Bruce (Angus MacFadyen) - which, in truth, he was. The title misleads, however. Braveheart was the name applied to Robert and not to William, and Robert, generally speaking, has received far greater acclaim in Scottish history.There's a lot to like about this movie. The sets and costumes are wonderful, and there are some spectacular shots of beautiful Scottish scenery throughout. The battle scenes between the Scots and the English are marvellously choreographed, and Gibson's portrayal of Wallace is compelling. The last half hour or so, which revolves around Wallace's capture, torture and finally his execution at the hands of the English is fascinating for its look at some of the torture techniques of the day, and for the same reason, it's disturbing. One gains a sense of the conundrum faced by the Scots, with divided loyalties and shifting alliances among themselves.There are also some things not to like in this, however. One could go on in great detail about the historical inaccuracies - and many have done just that. I have no desire to rehash them - but I will mention the one that really stood out for me the depiction of the relationship between Wallace and Isabella. Let's first point out that Isabella was about 10 years old when Wallace was executed - making their relationship as depicted here quite unlikely, made moreso by the fact that the two never met, and that Edward I would have been unlikely to have entrusted a diplomatic mission (which is where the two are depicted as meeting for the first time) into the hands of a young female child. There's also the fact that Isabella didn't marry Edward II until 3 years after Wallace's death. For all those reasons, it was ridiculous to suggest near the end that Isabella implied to Edward I on his deathbed that she was carrying a child who was actually the son of Wallace. That portrayal mystified me and bothered me, and really detracts from the overall credibility of the story. It's dealing with a Scottish hero, so one expects dramatic licence and a bit of playing loose with history - but why this, which is so bizarre and so inaccurate? All it does is give a soap-ish feel to the story, while it adds nothing of any real significance.That's my main criticism of this movie - and for me at least, it's a big criticism. It detracts a lot because of its extreme inaccuracy, and because of the amount of unnecessary time the faked relationship takes up in the film. And it adds exactly nothing to the story. So this is a good tribute to William Wallace, definitely portraying him in deservedly heroic terms, but that detour into mere fable is a huge problem.

With a plethora of tremendously hilarious performances and one of the most jaw-droppingly mischievous premises you'll ever see, this film would have been the highlight of any other writer\/director's career. Of course, Mel Brooks went on to do Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, proving that there must be a God because only He could make someone that smart and talented.Not that Brooks did it all on his own. I mean, just take that opening scene between fallen-from-grace theater producer Max Bialystock and timid accountant Leo Bloom. It is astonishingly long, covers an unbelievable amount of dramatic ground and is stuffed with enough gags and shtick to choke elephant. No matter how great a director you might be, you can't pull off a scene like that with just any old actors. As wonderful as Gene Wilder is at soaring between the almost bi-polar extremes of Bloom, you can maybe imagine another guy in that role. If Peter Sellers had taken it, Leo would have certainly been different but potentially just as funny. But the number of men who could have pulled off the character of Bialystock besides Zero Mostel can probably be counted on the fingers of one hand after you've had a terrible accident with an industrial slicer. That Mostel is sporting one of the most catastrophic combovers in human history, yet reduces that by force of personality to just a little detail of the humanistic grandeur that is Max Bialystock, gets more amazing the more I think about it.

The way Brooks carefully builds this story, with one scene leading to the next and to the next, gives away the secret of his genius. Brooks is known for his broad and standard-changing subversive humor, but that's only the surface. Brooks is so good because he works so hard at getting the underlying dynamic right. The sequence where Bialystock is squiring Bloom about town, slowly seducing him into the life of a huckster and fraud, is so incredible because where the characters are and what they're doing is both rooted in and reflecting their individual natures. When Bloom gives in to temptation and goes running around that fountain, it's not just a great visual. It represents Bloom breaking through the boundaries of his old life and surging into something new. You don't even notice after that how the character isn't nearly as neurotic or brittle, because it makes perfect sense and feels absolutely right.And I'm not sure any other comedy has ever has three brilliantly over-the-top supporting performances like Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars and Christopher Hewett. Even after so many decades and the roles being unmoored from their cultural milieu, you still can't help but laugh at them. You don't have to know anything about hippies or post-war Nazis or New York theater folk to enjoy such enthusiastic oddity.I will say, The Producers is one of those movies that makes you wish you had a time machine.

City Lights tells the story of a tramp who by sheer luck befriends a drunken millionaire and falls in love with a blind young flower-girl. Both the people have different perceptions about the tramp &#x96; the millionaire only recognizes him when he is intoxicated while the girl mistakes him for a millionaire. In an effort to win the girl's heart and lighten her financial troubles, the tramp assumes the role of a millionaire, a street-sweeper and a boxer, but is mistaken by the others for a thief. The most striking part is that in one of the scenes, another desperate boxer flees from the restroom realizing that the cops are after him. But the tramp, who is the most honest and magnanimous person, is sent to jail. When the two lovers meet again, the girl, who has acquired sight with the money given by the tramp, offers him a nickel. Recall their first meeting when the tramp is the one who offers her a coin and we that the story has completed its cycle. The moment is so poignant that if one just looks at the tramp's eyes, he\/she can see the various emotions experienced by him at that point.There are a few movies of Charlie Chaplin that will not work today because of the excessive slapstick in them. I remember being enervated by the abundance of butt-kicks in one of his old films that was close to unbearable. City Lights is not one of them, and here Charlie has blended slapstick, comedy, romance and drama seamlessly. The initial scenes when the tramp parties with the millionaire evokes not just humor but also pity for the tramp because we realize what may happen once the millionaire comes to his senses. We come to terms with the fact that there will be a moment when the tramp will not be aided by the millionaire and he would have to confess this to the blind girl. We still are in fits when the tramp, in fine clothes, cannot walk without slipping on those slippery floors, or when he begins eating spaghetti and takes the long strand of confetti in his mouth or the opening scene, where the tramp stomps on the private part of the statue and hangs by the sword while the anthem is going on. In the later scenes, we root for the clumsy, straggly man because we know how desperate he is. Every person, including the millionaire, the girl, her grandmother, the butler, the rich people and the tramp himself, have the human touch to them that is usually compromised in slapstick comedies.Charlie Chaplin was the producer, director, actor, editor and music director of the film and everything is done by him immaculately. The loose body movements, the eccentric gait, the wide, expressive eyes and the sparkling comic timing are applaud worthy but what is most treasured is his ability to make the audience cry. Virginia Cherrill has terrific screen presence and can emote so well I was surprised to hear she wasn't in good terms with Charlie. Harry Myers gives us two sides of his personality in very believable terms; after his drinking bouts, when he gets up and sees Charlie, he has that perfect expression of confusion and weariness. Florence Lee is touching in her short role; Al Ernest Garcia as the butler who shows contempt towards the tramp shines. The two impish kids who sell newspapers, the prizefighter, the rich people, the two robbers etc are equally memorable.The Tramp gave everything, got nothing but did get his most cherished desire in the end.

The soundtrack (which is beautiful) fits perfectly with Alex's evil mind, but to him seems just a way of life which he enjoys thoroughly and the music isn't dark and evil as what you see on screen. The futuristic slang is slightly confusing but at the same time very clever. Anyone who wants to enjoy this film thoroughly i definitely recommend watching more than once. I started off hating Alex at the beginning but by the end found him rather addictive and feeling sorry for him. After the Ludovico treatment, Alex cannot do any bad without feeling sick and is left with no moral choice. Hence the name 'A Clockwork Orange'. He is merely a man under complete control by the government and is stripped of all the qualities which somehow make him charming.

After the Ludovico treatment, Alex cannot do any bad without feeling sick and is left with no moral choice. Hence the name 'A Clockwork Orange'.

The movie begins with Eastwood (Thunderbolt) posing as a preacher in a small Montana town. When an assassin enters the church and starts shooting at him, he flees on foot and is rescued by Lightfoot (Jeff Bridges), a carefree drifter who has just stolen a car. The experienced, level-headed Thunderbolt and the young, impulsive Lightfoot form a partnership of sorts as they wander aimlessly throughout the countryside.We find out that Eastwood's character robbed a bank years earlier using an anti-tank gun to blast a hole in the wall. His former confederates, the violent Red Leary (George Kennedy) and his none-too-bright sidekick Goody (Geoffrey Lewis), mistakenly think Eastwood took and hid the money for himself when Leary went to prison following the robbery. When cornered, Thunderbolt beats up Leary and convinces him of the truth- the money was never stolen It was hidden behind the chalkboard of a one room schoolhouse in town which has since been replaced by a modern school. Thinking the money is gone forever, the four decide to pull off a similar caper.Their partnership is an unholy alliance, made so by the hostile Leary, who detests Lightfoot and regards him as an incapable smart ass unworthy of inclusion. Only his grudging respect for Thunderbolt- an old war buddy and the brains of the operation- prevents bloodshed. Nonetheless, they meticulously plan the caper- getting legitimate jobs in town while casing the bank and determining the alarm set up and the time needed for escape. Eventually, they pull off the robbery but dumb luck gets them spotted afterwards- with tragic results for all involved.This is a wonderful movie for several reasons. The first is the interplay between Eastwood and Bridges. Their contrasting characters create great on-screen magnetism. The second is the implementation of the plot itself, both precise and dramatic in its execution. Character actors George Kennedy and Geoffrey Lewis add immeasurably to the film; Lewis' mannerisms as the simpleton Goody are amusing while Kennedy shines as the temperamental Leary. He has a hilarious response to a little kid who chides him as he and Goody pose as ice cream men while staking out the bank. And Eastwood company player Bill McKinney makes a memorable if brief appearance as a drug-crazed nut with a shotgun and a trunk full of rabbits.Perhaps the most revealing reason for this movie's allure is that it brings us back to a time when America still had its innocence in much of the country. Carefree living was the norm- there were no terror alerts, 9\/11, or airport screenings. Drifters didn't automatically conjure images of people up to no good or out to do someone harm. At one point in the movie, Eastwood buys an extra ice cream cone and gives it to a random little kid- a harmless act that today that would sadly raise suspicions.Thunderbolt and Lightfoot is a lot of fun- and highly recommended.

He wrote a 45 page story and presented it to Fox and he was giving a deadline and minimal budget of 18 million to meet a release date of 1986.After ten months of production, Cameron finally did it and met the production date after having to deal with issues with filming methods in England where the movie was filmed.Also the issue that Fox wanted to go ahead and do the movie without Sigourney Weaver, who wanted to be paid $ 1 million dollars for the role, in which she played 7 years before for 30 times less. After a lot of dispute Fox caved and paid her the sum, and Cameron adjusted to filming in England, the movie Alien II was made and was a commercial success and a wonderful movie.The difference between Alien and Aliens (Alien II) is the genre, while the former was more of horror with some action; Cameron opted for a more action movie (taking cue from The Terminator which was a success). The actions in the movie kicks off from the get go, after some introductions and setup towards the flight back to LV-426, the planet where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew first encountered the Alien eggs from the moment they land things started to happen.Ripley was called on as a consultant, to escort a crew of marines to LV-426 which was now home to a terraforming colony, a colony that has not been heard from for a while.As usual the same way Alien by Ridley Scott went so did this one, there was mayhem, there were killings, there was betrayal and of cause there was action far more action than the predecessor.Aliens is a film I recommend, and it is going to keep you glued to your sit.

While watching, I had a thought for my Grand-father who, had he crossed over only 2 years later, might have very well gone down with the Titanic and I wouldn't be here to tell the story. Finally, I don't particularly enjoy Céline Dion's choice of songs but I have to admit to a guilty tear when I hear the Titanic song.

Even after the time travel happened, he just walks around most of the time smiling. The storyline seemed to have wanted to present us a real modern moral dilemma but instead gave us some silly 1980's made for TV drama. The scene where they put an dangerous POW to interrogate right next to a civilian and the Americans they did rescue, was one of the dumbest movie scenes ever. Talk about a lack of any common sense.

There's no two ways about it, this film is great and always will be for many decades to come.The casting is perfect and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are just brilliant. The film also has a message which all viewers will relate to in one way or another and the last half an hour is probably the best period in the film.However, the plot of Shawshank is entirely predictable and the movie is way too long with periods where absolutely nothing is happening.All in all, Shawshank Redemption is a great film, if not the best of the last century. It has many things going for a bit but is let down by a few dull scenes and a predictable story line.
