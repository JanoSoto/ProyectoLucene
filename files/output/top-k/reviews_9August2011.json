[{"date":"9 August 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For the first time in years, Disney finally managed to create a new masterpiece in traditional animation. For me Fantasia\/2000, is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It brings such talent and magnificence to screen with its lavish animation and segments. This will be reviewed by each segment.Symphony No. 5 in C minor-I. Allegro con brio by Ludwig van BeethovenThe first Fantasia 2000 segment starts off to the musical note of Beethoven's Symphony No.5 with some abstract shapes and colours which take the shape of butterflies trying to escape a multitude of bats in spectacular splashes of light. This segment's surrealism gives the film a grand opening and makes it an accomplished segment because the musical number fills in very well with this segment and gives it a different and unknown kind of animation for viewers to see which is surreal art. Surreal art is one of my favourite kinds of art and I was very pleased to see it in brilliant form.Pines of Rome by Ottorino RespighiFor the second segment of Fantasia 2000, The Pines of Rome by Ottorino Respighi was chosen to be played along with the animated story of a group of whales who are able to fly due to a supernova occurring in the water they live in. They are then able to fly into the clouds to another nesting grounds of water. This segment is a grand spectacle of Computer animation as well as traditional animation. The Computer animation which is used in the whales is brilliant because for a time like 1999, this was groundbreaking technology and it is wonderful to see it in animation because it gives animators inspiration to go to new grounds of animation. This segment is my favourite because it has grand tune towards it and the story of it is brilliantly put forward to this animated tale of magnificence. Rhapsody in Blue by George GershwinThe third segment of Fantasia 2000 takes us to the streets of New York during the Great Depression. The musical number is the famous Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin which gives the segment a jazzy and tuneful theme upon itself. This segment's animation was inspired by the animation of Al Hirschfeld whose animated productions have delighted audiences around the world and certainly when it was used here. This segment remains a complete success because it is terrific at relating the perils of the Great Depression with children as well as adults and if anyone could relate trauma and perils in a colourful and charming way then they would become great tellers of harsh times. The whole layout of this segment is brilliant and it deserves a standing ovation. I did not think it was one the best segments but it was not a bad one.Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Major-I. Allegro by Dmitri ShostakovichOur fourth segment is based upon the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale, The Story of the Steadfast Tin Soldier. This segment is drawn upon traditional animation in classic fairy tale fashion of music and art. I don't have much to say about this particular segment apart from that I thought the music went very well with this tale of animation and I think that is what remains is that the animation is very similar to animated films like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King and that makes it very well known to modern audiences and children. The musical number which comes from Dimitri Shostakovich's Piano Concerto No.2, creates a connection with this fairy tale in the sense that it becomes almost as similar as the segment itself making it perfect for the task.The Carnival of the Animals, Finale by Camille Saint-SaënsThe fifth act of the film takes place among a bunch of flamingos who go by their boring routines until another flamingo comes along with a yo-yo to ruin it all for them in comical fashion. This brilliantly built along to the musical tune of Camille Saint Saens' The Carnival of the Animals. Although this segment is short, it does provide a lot of fun for different types of audiences and is created to be very funny as well as being brilliantly constructed to provide a great new segment.Pomp and Circumstance &#x96; Marches 1, 2, 3 and 4 by Edward ElgarTo start our final two acts, we have Donald Duck appearing in a story based on Noah's Ark with Donald as Noah's First Mate. This is combined with Sir Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches to create grand march between the animation and the music. It successfully attains that goal by making traditional animation fun to watch as we see Donald Duck messing about with the animals while also being reunited with his wife towards the end after believing that she might have died when the flood came. If there was ever going to be a third Fantasia, I believe this one would be chosen as it contains Donald Duck in an unforgettable cartoon.Firebird Suite &#x96; 1919 Version by Igor StravinskyOur final piece is taken from Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite. The animated story is that of a woodland sprite who is accompanied by a deer to bring happiness toward the forest they live in by having the sprite make everything shiny and wonderful until we come to a nearby volcano where inside a Firebird lives. As we might expect the sprite gets destroyed by the Firebird but is resurrected by her companion to remake what happened earlier but this the sprite manages to spread grass and trees and shiny stuff around the volcano and the forest surrounding it. It manages to gives us one final grand animated tale which combines macabre and fantasy in one huge spectacle of light and destruction.I listed it as the fifth best film of 1999.

By the time one has had a go on the dodgems and the ghost train, one has been there long enough and built up enough verve for the huge trademark roller-coaster ride; after that experience, we bring ourselves back down with a shooting range or some spinning tea-cups. There are some terrific scenes of terror, chase and thrills in Jurassic Park that essentially act as the park's leaner, meaner rides, and they are dotted around some other sequences that effectively act as a prelude to those leaner, meaner rides &#x96; the fun of the fair before we're strapped in proper for the big one.There is one instance, at a heightened moment of distress, in which a character must sprint for her life toward a small building located out in the dinosaur infested jungle. In running for the door, Spielberg shoots her jog from an Evil Dead-inspired low angle alluding to something small and monstrous being right there and then on her heels. Of course, there isn't actually anything there and the angle rings false in this sense; the sequence, like most theme park rides, runs on prolonged adrenaline built out of the thrills and spills on offer the placing of one in a predicament of peril and fear that is out of the ordinary, but without with the intense risk of injury or death, thats' somehow pleasurable for the onlooker, even if it perhaps shouldn't be.Spielberg will begin the film in the mould of his 1975 monster-movie Jaws; here, rather than focus on a teen-aged girl mangled to death by an unseen beast, we observe a middle-aged employee caught up in a botched operation by a creature the film's poster, like Jaws, tells us is a dinosaur. It is arguably more striking here, everything is organised and not as spontaneous as it was in Jaws; there are several professional-looking personnel armed and trained to deal with something which still gets the better of them. The death brings about a law-suit from the family of the deceased, lawyer Donald Gennaro (Ferrero) arrives at an amber mine owned by the employer of the deceased, whom it's established cannot turn up for such a sombre occasion out of business, such is his nature. By way of his dress, Gennaro looks out of sorts where he is and struggles to negate the terrain; alluding to a wider extent of being unable to deal with what he's getting into. Things develop and the owner, a certain John Hammond (Attenborough) whose wealth might exceed that of anyone else's in movie history, enlists three experts in archaeological doctors Grant (Neill) and Sadler (Dern), as well as doctor of mathematician Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), to tour certain facilities before they go public so as to give it a proverbial nod.Those facilities form the titular Jurassic Park, a place in which dinosaurs come to life and strut around like zoo creatures as the paying customers gawk on; a bit different to that of travelling to Finkley Down Farm, a family spot located in the South of England, where your biggest risk was having the crude paper bag of 'feed' you were given snatched from your very hands if you took your eye off the goats. Spielberg has fun with his monsters and his sequences of peril, but deserves credit for not rendering the presence of his humans as not much more than action figures in a children's fantasy game. Sadler and Grant are in a relationship, their archaeological digs are crude but sweetly old fashioned; they drink champagne, but only on the special occasions. Grant cannot fathom modern technology, but through the wonder of Hammond's innovations, he will come to face his fears of what it is he studies brought to life via technology, as well as doing well to banish his dislike of children. There is some fun to be had out of his rapport with Malcolm, who's always looking out for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm; his eyes are on Sadler, he loves children and she wants some &#x96; when he tries to explain Chaos theory to her, we wonder if it is a genuine discussion or whether it's a bogus exercise that provides him with an opportunity to flirt and stroke her wrist.There is great energy and craft in most of what constitutes antagonism with the dinosaurs, let loose by a fun sub-plot to do with a corrupt employee looking to steal DNA. The rendez-vous with the T-Rex, as it breaks out of his paddock with everyone beside it, is a superb exercise in sound and fear; the audience allowing a good look at the automobiles the characters travel in prior to departure via a long tracking shot capturing the pristine nature of the things and their advanced touch-screen technology and roomy qualities later reduced to that of the equivalent of a T-Rex chewy-toy as the beasties run amok. There is talk of the Rex prior to this engagement as a threat; its skeleton in the main entrance brings us aware of its size, a similar trait Spielberg implements unto that of the Velociraptor, whose methods are verbally reiterated by Grant early on and whose claw Grant carries around with him as a novelty charm shows us their weapon. From its character driven beginnings to its calm; peaceful and exhausted ride home akin to that of the driving back from a theme park experience with the kids, Jurassic Park combines meaty thrills with enjoyable film-making substance capitalising on some wondrous special effects for the time and studious direction from a man capable of delivering on as many fronts as possible.

There is some fun to be had out of his rapport with Malcolm, who's always looking out for the next ex-Mrs. Malcolm; his eyes are on Sadler, he loves children and she wants some &#x96; when he tries to explain Chaos theory to her, we wonder if it is a genuine discussion or whether it's a bogus exercise that provides him with an opportunity to flirt and stroke her wrist.There is great energy and craft in most of what constitutes antagonism with the dinosaurs, let loose by a fun sub-plot to do with a corrupt employee looking to steal DNA. The rendez-vous with the T-Rex, as it breaks out of his paddock with everyone beside it, is a superb exercise in sound and fear; the audience allowing a good look at the automobiles the characters travel in prior to departure via a long tracking shot capturing the pristine nature of the things and their advanced touch-screen technology and roomy qualities later reduced to that of the equivalent of a T-Rex chewy-toy as the beasties run amok. There is talk of the Rex prior to this engagement as a threat; its skeleton in the main entrance brings us aware of its size, a similar trait Spielberg implements unto that of the Velociraptor, whose methods are verbally reiterated by Grant early on and whose claw Grant carries around with him as a novelty charm shows us their weapon. From its character driven beginnings to its calm; peaceful and exhausted ride home akin to that of the driving back from a theme park experience with the kids, Jurassic Park combines meaty thrills with enjoyable film-making substance capitalising on some wondrous special effects for the time and studious direction from a man capable of delivering on as many fronts as possible.

Over the course of the 2 hours and 50 minute epic, you will see the best drama, characters and atmosphere to ever grace the screen.It starts with the Godfather Waltz theme, an iconic piece. Just like that, the stage is set for the most Italian film ever. I believe it was the producer who wanted Coppola to direct because he was Italian. He wanted audiences to smell the spaghetti watching this film. Anyway, we then cut to a man's face, talking to an unseen figure, pleading to him for justice. Emotion drips off every word. Every scene in the Godfather has purpose, every line of dialogue has meaning. The camera switches to the other side of the table- Marlon Brando sits, hair slicked, moustache, rose in suit, cat on lap, in all of his glory as Don Vito Corleone, one of the most iconic characters ever.Have I said 'iconic' a lot? Much of the Godfather is. The Don himself, Michael's rise, Sonny's temper, the offer you can't refuse.The setting is very important to the Godfather. 1946 New York is wonderfully put together, as well as the hills of Sicily and for a short period of time, Las Vegas. Every scene is full, no scene is filler. Inside of each scene is dialogue- lots of it. But you'll hang on to every word, because of the content and the flawless delivery. Action in the Godfather is sparse, but like the hits shown, short and brutal. You'll be kept on your toes. Anyone can die at any moment, and they do. The pacing is perfect.The characters are some of the greatest compiled in a film, and any of the major characters could carry a film on their own. The Don's mumble, appearance and honour are perfected by Brando. Pacino convincingly, slowly shows what being in a mafia family can do to even a kind boy who isn't a part of it. Tom Hagen is the logic and calm in the sea of guns and violence.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The cannibal toys were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how The Claw was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid.

It's a very cute movie, mainly for kids, but it has a few chuckles thrown in for adults. The human characters in the movie didn't seem very realistic; their happy-go-lucky, suburban lifestyle just made them very flat and barely likable, especially if you grew up in a family unable to afford multiple toys. The voice actors were delightful, and their moods were directed very well, even for the plastic Army-men who don't show much emotion. The cannibal toys were very imaginative and creepy, so they served their purpose well. I thought the idea of the claw machine that housed the little green aliens was cute, how The Claw was their Messiah of sorts. The coloring in the film was vivid and incorporated some awesome day-glow tones that I had forgotten about over time. The ultimate reason to watch the movie is to witness Pixar's astounding use of 3D imagery, especially when they incorporate real-life effects onto the screen (i.e. The magnifying lens over Woody's face). There were some aspects of the film I didn't care for. The movie is only 77 minutes long without the prefaced, short 3D movie before it, making the story suffer and seem a little lacking. I found the music to be over-the-top schmaltzy and generic, but it is primarily for kids and the Disney crowd, so I guess it belongs here. Again, the character of Andy isn't very likable, other than the fact that he owns a lot of older toys that we made have seen commercials of as a kid.

I wonder how many people would have foreseen the greatness of this movie, just from the script? Part of the problem would have been the simplicity and unpretentiousness of the concept A semi-decrepit couple going down a river in a thoroughly decrepit boat to destroy a German warship. Nearly the entire movie consists of the interactions of this most improbable couple in 1914 cooped up on a steam-powered boat built around 1885.But the modern viewer would more likely recognize the script's potential, for what we have here is a prototype of the Indiana Jones quests, which included a chance pairing with an improbable female, travel that required overcoming insurmountable obstacles, natural and man-made, and a seemingly impossible goal. Add to that excitement and just the right dose of humor and romance, not taking yourself too seriously, but not going over the top into farce. If Steven Spielberg didn't deliberately use The African Queen as a model, I'll eat my hat. Heck, Harrison Ford would seem the best modern actor to fill Bogart's shoes in a remake because you can imagine him as an unshaven sop who cleans up into a hero and lover. But can anyone match Bogart's and Hepburn's acting? This is 90 percent of the picture's greatness. The movie's charm is the personal transformation of the two characters the reserved, repressed missionary into a thrill-seeking military tactician and romantic lover; and the lazy, louche Bogart brought into line by the woman he needs to give him strength. Neither has a great deal of confidence in themselves at the start, especially in romance, yet all this changes by the seemingly impossible conclusion. So the adventure quest is also a personal, spiritual quest, not unlike the Indy films.The adventure\/spiritual quest of course predates Indy and Hollywood, going back to Ancient Greece, so it is an immortal formula, if done right. We see a variation in Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and an element even in North by Northwest. If done wrong, if the formula is misused, the result can be preposterous, like Rooster Cogburn, a pointless, pathetic attempt to exploit the success of The African Queen by pairing Hepburn with an aging John Wayne. In African Queen, Hepburn's most potent weapon against Bogie is to refuse to talk to him; in Rooster, Hepburn bludgeons the Duke into submission by chattering him into near insanity with one of the worst scripts every written. It is the sheer improbability of the plot that makes the story so delicious. One reviewer here said, you expect me to believe this? Well, yes and no. This is Hollywood, so it's not supposed to be entirely reality based. A movie creates an alternate universe with certain rules and assumptions, and if it is good, it is internally consistent, but at odds with reality, which is what you want to escape from. Hepburn sets down the challenge early on Blow up the Louisa. The secondary implied challenge is to do this without Bogie and Kate tearing each other's eyes out. Since Hepburn is a righteous Christian, the movie allows for a certain amount of divine intervention. The movie carries you along, step by step, without unduly straining your credulity, if you accept the divine grace part.

It seems an absurd idea, but one we got no way to disproof, as we are hopelessly anchored in the present, prisoners of the now instant. I don't know if Proyas was aware of Borges' work when writing his script--but this proves anyway that he was aware of the same paradox. (BTW, I don't think memories have anything to do with our essential beings. I'm a firm believer in ours existences being--deep down--absolute, unchangeable, unaffected by any contingency).I watched DC once and I dismissed it like just another pretentious cartoon. But then I read some reviews here, which made me take a 2nd, and then a 3rd look at it and what do you know it started looking like something of a classic. But to conclusively recognize it as such we first have to submit it to a rigorous test to verify if it fills up the requirements. So let me get hold of my Masterpiece Measuring Tape (MPMT) now...there. Now, the 1st condition a MP must fulfill is that of coming in a tight package--it must show great internal coherence and consistency--and be also top loaded with metaphors, symbolism; and be fully contained in its first scene. DC fulfills these requirements but only if we see it in a totally different way from which some reviewers have been seen it. This isn't about a super hero, see, but about a man who is unconscious, dying, or maybe dead. (Sorry, but you asked for it).There are only two things, we know, submerged in perennial darkness the Earth's interior and, metaphorically, the subconscious mind. Now, it amazes me how so many reviewers have missed the point that this story couldn't be possibly happening in the physical world. All this is happening in John's SM, people! Or rather in the twilight region where his SM rejoins the collective, Jungian, SM. All happens in reverse here. When everyone sleeps, they are really awake, minding heir daily businesses, while the bald ones set the stage for their dreams of the ensuing night--so a couple will dream of being slobs one night and rich the next; one guy will be a hotel clerk and then a newspaper vendor. When you see things this way everything makes sense. It explains also why the strangers are inconsistent in the use of their powers, weapons, and why these vary so. Freud would have enjoyed DC, he who declared that dreams don't create, provoke, emotions--fear, sadness--but that the opposite is truth our SM uses dreams to let out preexisting emotions. That's why the balance of power John\/Strangers varies so much, as it's expressing the emotional undercurrents in his own SM rather than material conflicts with his environment. Ex. if he's able to build a whole planet, why didn't he simply melt the knife in Anna's throat instead of meekly surrendering? Ans because he had to go through that final showdown, which was part of what he had to live. (as the baldies are there mainly to make him act out his fears, phobias, beliefs).All DC is happening in a collective dream state, from the POV of one of the dreamers, who is dwelling now permanently there. So we may assume that John is, either unconscious, dying, or even dead as he can't sleep--i.e. wake up to the physical world. He seems installed now for good in what the esoteric call Astral Plan, which we visit each night in our dreams and to which we'll go when dying. All this is suggested in the beginning. The first shots show a naked John, exhibiting his intimate parts. Then, the most telling metaphor the crashing fishbowl and he taking the fish to the bath tube, meaning he himself has suffered a serious, maybe mortal accident and that his SM is using the occasion to open new doors; doors that may lead to a greater, more vast, reality, the spiritual world. That's wasn't just an artsy license, the crashed bowl as with I'm dying, John encapsulates the entire plot.Maybe Freud would have called the Strangers the many faces of the Id, as they appear just like multiple reflections in a mirror, of a single entity. They are not John's enemies but his own dark undercurrents; his animal, primal side if you will, desperately struggling for survival. That's why I'm dying is crucial. Everybody may interpret the ending their own way. To an esoteric mind, John's final victory means he has purified his soul, let perish his own beastly part. But a clinical view could be that he uses his last energies to build a love story with a mental creation of his won--Emma--so he may leave this world happy. Or you may assume he has recuperated and that hell be happy in the real world, with a real Anne (maybe the right one, as it's his love for her what makes him finally sleep--or wake up.) Take your pick.If all this is true, where it leaves the cops? They are the only ones keeping their identities, besides Anna. Are they mental creations? Real people dreaming? They are likely the first, as their only job here seems to be to bring out the anguish, face to death, in John's psyche & soul.A likely classic, if interpreted this way or some other alike.

That's wasn't just an artsy license, the crashed bowl as with I'm dying, John encapsulates the entire plot.Maybe Freud would have called the Strangers the many faces of the Id, as they appear just like multiple reflections in a mirror, of a single entity. They are not John's enemies but his own dark undercurrents; his animal, primal side if you will, desperately struggling for survival. That's why I'm dying is crucial. Everybody may interpret the ending their own way. To an esoteric mind, John's final victory means he has purified his soul, let perish his own beastly part. But a clinical view could be that he uses his last energies to build a love story with a mental creation of his won--Emma--so he may leave this world happy. Or you may assume he has recuperated and that hell be happy in the real world, with a real Anne (maybe the right one, as it's his love for her what makes him finally sleep--or wake up.) Take your pick.If all this is true, where it leaves the cops? They are the only ones keeping their identities, besides Anna. Are they mental creations? Real people dreaming? They are likely the first, as their only job here seems to be to bring out the anguish, face to death, in John's psyche & soul.A likely classic, if interpreted this way or some other alike. A 8\/10 with special mention for the superb visuals and the uber gorgeous--Mmmm--lounge singer.Oh, and I would much appreciate people refraining from making imbecile comments, such as those of jeroen-106.

I mean, here I am riding in a car with a professor, educated at Columbia and Harvard, from a distinguished family, brother-in-law to a former Secretary of State, and he's carrying on about the talent of Sergio Leone, making me feel like a proletarian dummy, the kind of guy who says things like, I don't know anything about art but I know what I like. I thought A Fistful of Dollars was ludicrous, Once Upon a Time in the West mistakenly made a bad man out of President Henry Fonda, and Once Upon a Time in America dealt with Jewish gangsters who looked mighty Italian to me.There's something else too. Unlike American-made Westerns, the spaghetti Westerns, drenched in atmosphere though they may be, are devoid of any history or any back story at all. Look at Shane. Cattlemen versus squatters. Or The Wild Bunch. Day of the outlaw draws to a close. But there's none of this in Leone's Westerns. The town is in the middle of nowhere. Nobody has a wife and kids to worry about. There has been no Civil War. There's nothing but moral nihilism. It's completely abstract in all of its elements.I wasn't able to get all the way through For A Few Dollars More but, to tell the truth, it wasn't as painful as I'd expected. I nodded out, not because of the movie but because of the demands of my reticular activating system.The story was ritualized junk, to be sure, and the titles seem to have been done by a high school kid for a class in graphics, but -- I don't know -- in the opening scenes Lee Van Cleef's face in close up is the color of teak and has a fine sheen to it, as of a thin coat of lard. In these swarthy faces teeth seem to glow in the dark.Van Cleef is a cool bounty hunter and shoots bad guys for a living. Clint Eastwood is a bounty hunter too but of a different stripe. Where Van Cleef is dressed in an estimable suit and cape of black, riding a horse of the same color, like an undertaker, Eastwood is raggedy in his poncho. They both shoot and kill like lightning. And they're both after the same no-goodnik, Gian Maria Volonte.Volonte is Italian, not Mexican, and his voice is dubbed by an American, but that doesn't matter because everybody's voice was dubbed in later and, except for Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Kinski, all the actors seem to be Italian too. All the sounds are foleyed in -- the PTEW gun shots, the crunch of gravel beneath the silver-spurred black boot, the sharp clatter of horse hooves on wooden planks. Ennio Morricone, who could write good music, must have chuckled as he scored the whistling theme here.Anyway, I was sort of getting into it but finally felt myself nodding out and went to bed instead. I imagine Volonte wound up a corpse, among so many corpses, and that there was some sort of confrontation between the impeccable Van Cleef and the peccable Eastwood. If it's on again, I might watch it.

Just when he thought he has found well-deserved peace, a crooked police cop (Brain Dennehy) who has the pleasure in despising this former Congressional Medal winning Green Beret decides to lock him in jail for no apparent purpose whatsoever. But this fighter turns out to be more than just the typical veteran. This man is a high ranking expert with a vast knowledge in warfare tactics and when he has a weapon in hand he has the instincts like a raging bear. The small town eventually discover that they have bitten more than they can chew as they are on an engaging hunt against a man who's never short of ammunition and is potentially dangerous. The sad thing about First Blood is that this action thriller has been overlooked by fans and critics alike or has dismissed it by poor ratings, but I thought that this movie was one of the best action films of the 1980's. The movie truly has all the perfect tools for the classic action film. The pace was excitingly fast, the action scenes were was virtually sublime and we have a character like John Rambo (Stallone) who we can sympathize with even if his character very limited dialogue. Brian Dennehy is spectacular as Mr. Rambo's arch nemesis the kind of villain you'd love to despise. But this movie has some realism added to this excitement as it gives a compelling overview of former Vietnam fighters and the post-traumatic stress that never goes away after the wars they faced. For those just starting out as an action film film, this might be one you should take note on. The movie succeeds on holding up in the plot and it never once meanders in its intentions. Of course it exceeds above all action movies that are on today. There's no cheap, fabricated CGI, just natural stunt work it does look like a cheap reject from a video game or adapted from a graphic novel. Director Ted Kotcheff is quite a skilled director and his methodology goes beyond anything Stephen Sommers and Michael Bay can only dream about. The film depends entirely on directorial merits and not too dependent on technology. Just a classic iconic movie of the 1980's in all its simplicity. Sure the action films from toady's movies like G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra are fun to watch, but lots of the scenes are pretty hokey and too much dependent on special effects making them in the long run very unsatisfying. The film relies on the running pace and the thrilling suspense and not counting on how much profit they're going to make on their audience. The natural ability of First Blood comes across as though it never feels scripted and the actions that come across are something you would expect from them, making this movie as one of the more believable action films in cinema history.
