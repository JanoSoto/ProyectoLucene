T2 Judgement day has all the makings of a classic film. It not only incorporates wonderful special effects, but some great acting and clever scenes. As a sequel to the classic 'The Terminator' this goes beyond all barriers and delivers us a memorable sequel.With the amount of films out today that include supposed Extreme special effects and ground breaking realism, we feel we should be in for a treat. I guarantee you, that nearly 90% of the films we see nowadays have at least a little bit of CGI. The problem - It just isn't real. Terminator 2, a film made over 12 years ago, could easily pass in the cinemas today being presented as a new film. Why? Because its so realistic. Robert Patrick plays this films villain, a new terminator called a T-1000, with shape shifting and liquid metal capabilities. Patrick doesn't an outstanding job acting as a cyborg. He is able to become a non-stopping killing machine, that just doesn't give up and also has the glamour of being able to become very human. A humorous small scene(only available only ULTIMATE EDTION) see's Patrick walk up to Policeman on his bike and say Say, thats a nice bike. We obviously know what happens next, as we see Patrick on the bike later on.Patrick is also capable of meeting the demands of receiving shotgun wounds from the (spoiler), now, good guy Arnie! Arnie has been set out by John Connor in the future war to protect the young John from the deadly T-1000. Arnie plays an important role in this film, as we see him become the good guy, a total contrast from the first film.he delivers a good performance, and acts well to show that he doesn't understand human emotions. There's a cracking scene on the ULTIMATE EDITION were we see Arnie trying to impersonate a man smiling. He fails at it, and puts on his firm hard-looking face.But with all the film being good so far, surely their must be a downer? Well, the only downer I guess is the way Sarah Connors character has transformed from the first film. She is no longer the woman in distress, but she is now a tough cookie, ready for some action after working out in her cell in the Mental Asylum. Her 'hard knock' attitude does get a bit annoying and disappointing, but it can't be helped because her character is simply developing.Stan Winston helps develop this excellent performance. He had designed and help produce the endoskeletons in the new future war scene, designed the bullet impact effects for the T-1000, which were cleverly done using spring loaded foam. His cleverness has helped to make this film great. His crafty hands were also needed to help produce the nuclear blast scene. This is a very disturbing scene, which I prefer to skip when watching the DVD. Its disturbing as (spoiler) its shows how Sarah Connor is burnt to death during an imagined nuclear blast, along small children in a playground. Realistic, but disturbing.The sounds are also great! Makes the bullet impacts on the T-1000 so realistic is the sound effect. The main title score for the film is the same tune, excepted extended and made using slighty more modern synthersisers. The best us of music is probably at the end, where you'll be on the edge of your seat, amazed at the excellent use of CGI!If you've seen the first film, or are looking for an entertaining film, choose Terminator 2 - Judgement day and you won't be disappointed.

Surviving this changes Sissi and she sets out to find her saviour but, when she does, she is met with only a door slammed in her face. She learns that he is a troubled man with a gland problem that makes his eyes water all the time, a tragic and painful past and a criminal future but she keeps trying and gradually their fates intertwine.I don't know; maybe it is me; maybe I'm totally, totally stupid (it's a possibility) and have no taste in good films but I have yet to see what others seem to see in Tom Tykwer. I have been bashed for not liking Run Lola Run, yet I have tried some of his other films to get a better feel for his work rather than just dismissing him on the basis of that one film. So it was that I finally got around to watching this film and I was glad that the visual trickery seemed to have toned down and the material aiming for a more mature, emotional tone. It is a shame then that the material totally misses the mark no matter how hard Tykwer tries to set the tone. The plot is based on coincidences and the idea of strangers having eternal bonds by saving each other lives and so on. Now, in a well-written film I can buy into that idea as easily as anyone else but in a poorly developed and scripted film it is much harder and, without a firm base, it mostly comes off as sentimental nonsense.The basic relationship between Sissi and Bodo didn't convince or engage me, although individually they had some interesting aspects within their characters (which the film didn't follow). Of course compared to the hospital patients, the two leads look as detailed as they could possibly have been written &#150; but that is only because the patients are so poorly used. In fact used is the perfect word, because they are just there as objects to do things within the story, but never to be real people. Tykwer's direction is much better here and his toned down style may not be good enough to raise the material but it is a positive influence in the film compared to the tiresomely flashy style of Lola. The acting is also quite good considering the limited material they had to work with. Potente is good looking and easy to watch but she never seems totally comfortable with her character &#150; only occasionally getting it spot on with her more emotional scenes; she is still good, but the direction and writing of her character didn't seem to help her. Furmann tries hard but his crying criminal is a silly character who is overly tortured and aggressive &#150; but yet still has a flair for the poetic etc. He has presence at least but cannot save a poor character. Support is so-so, with some actors doing well while others are used to, well, chew glass and make us go ugh or ahhh but never to care about them as people or have any interest in them.Overall this is not as terrible a film as I have made out &#150; but it is a very weak one that tries to be a mature, emotional film but only manages it in the areas of direction and a great little score. Sadly the material (and hence, the performances) is weak, not well developed at all and far too quick to avoid the hard work and just throw in supposedly deep emotional gestures that didn't convince me and just came across as rather sentimental nonsense that only happens in films.

Leaving school sees them trying to keep going down the same anti-society route despite the call of employment, college and real life. When they set up a middle aged geek from a lonely ads column, Enid gets interested and they then meet Seymour later. Getting to know him, Enid tries to help Seymour get a job while at the same time she drifts away from Rebecca, who has gotten a job.Not having any knowledge of the comic on which this is based, I approached it a little unsure of whether or not it was meant to be a comedy or a drama, but early on I caught on that this would be a light drama with some comedy value. For me the chance to see a teen movie (sort of!) that takes a nicely comic look at a quirky side of the coin is one I will always take on the off chance that it is interesting; it was that here. The plot is a little rambling and slow at times but it is well developed and it is more the characters than the story that you care about. In this way it is nicely done without being totally in the real world (sometimes social outsiders are not interesting &#150; sometimes they are outsiders for reasons!) but still doing enough to keep us interested. Those being sold this film as an indie comedy will be upset to hear it doesn't really come off, but the drama is still good without ever being too serious.The cast are good but it is the lead two that give the best performances. Buscemi can do awkward standing on his head and he gives a good performance here, with little confidence and the quirks of a normal person. Birch is almost as good and is able to demonstrate her character's growing awareness of reality without making it heavy or obvious. Johansson is always fun to watch and it is easy to dismiss her performance because it slips away into normal life and she gets worn down rather than being given more showy or kooky material to work with. These three pretty much run the film and do well with their characters, managing to make them more than just a collection of quirks etc, but support is also good from Renfro, Douglas and Balaban.Overall this is nothing amazing &#150; it is a simple story that is delivered in the manner of many independent films but it still works because it develops characters than are more than just quirky pigeonholes. The performances reflect this and the cast understand their characters well enough to bring out feelings and gradual change in them. It is imperfect then, and some viewers will be put off by its rambling feel but I quite liked it for what it was, even if I am unlikely to return to it again in the near future.

For me the chance to see a teen movie (sort of!) that takes a nicely comic look at a quirky side of the coin is one I will always take on the off chance that it is interesting; it was that here. The plot is a little rambling and slow at times but it is well developed and it is more the characters than the story that you care about. In this way it is nicely done without being totally in the real world (sometimes social outsiders are not interesting &#150; sometimes they are outsiders for reasons!) but still doing enough to keep us interested. Those being sold this film as an indie comedy will be upset to hear it doesn't really come off, but the drama is still good without ever being too serious.The cast are good but it is the lead two that give the best performances. Buscemi can do awkward standing on his head and he gives a good performance here, with little confidence and the quirks of a normal person. Birch is almost as good and is able to demonstrate her character's growing awareness of reality without making it heavy or obvious. Johansson is always fun to watch and it is easy to dismiss her performance because it slips away into normal life and she gets worn down rather than being given more showy or kooky material to work with. These three pretty much run the film and do well with their characters, managing to make them more than just a collection of quirks etc, but support is also good from Renfro, Douglas and Balaban.Overall this is nothing amazing &#150; it is a simple story that is delivered in the manner of many independent films but it still works because it develops characters than are more than just quirky pigeonholes. The performances reflect this and the cast understand their characters well enough to bring out feelings and gradual change in them. It is imperfect then, and some viewers will be put off by its rambling feel but I quite liked it for what it was, even if I am unlikely to return to it again in the near future.

She decides to make a short horror film where a killer offs his victims in the style of urban myths. Despite the fact that a major Hollywood had been done on this subject less than two years before, her teachers give her the go ahead, compare her to Hitchcock and her friends are all enthusiastic. However as she attempts to shoot her various scenes, somebody is really killing people in that style and hiding their bodies; but can Amy stay alive long enough to convince other people that it's really happening? Given that the first film just gave up on its connections to urban myths I suppose I should at least praise this film for having a script that works out how to keep the material at least semi-related to the title\/concept. However that is pretty much the only praise I will give to it because it is just a standard slasher movie &#150; they all have a hook (a gimmick or, in the case of I know What You Did etc, literally a hook), sexy girls, buff boys, red herrings and lots of gore. So if that is all you want then this average film should just about do you. The plot isn't much cop and it is pretty much a case of counting the cast members alive to work out how long is left, but it is passable for this sort of film. Of course it is only OK if you ignore what it could have done. It could have said so much and taken a sly look at violence in movies; for example the bit where they watch a film of a girl getting killed and enjoy it; that could have been a clever question to the audience but it didn't do anything of the sort. Of course what I did like were some clever in-jokes and confused film realities that served to provide another level to distract me from the poor main &#150; this is occasionally subtle but also works when it is blunt (ie Gayheart's cameo).Some of the stuff is actually quite thrilling and the film has a good atmosphere considering it is just a slasher movie. It does have some good ideas as well and I did thing the Mexican standoff at the end was a nice touch. The cast are par for the course at best. Morrison is a typically bland blonde and didn't do anything special with her lead role &#150; she isn't awful but she is nothing special. The rest of the cast just go through the motions, acting suspicious, scared or sexy as required &#150; the sight of Anderson terrified me but happily he had little time, however it is simply cruel to cast Eva Mendes as a flirtatious lesbian but then only give her a small amount of screen time! Overall this is a standard slasher movie but it works better than the original film because it actually sticks to the concept as well as having some nice self-awareness and film within a film sort of stuff that is distracting from what is really a red-herring laden, twisty plot that could have come from any slasher film.

She has come to stay with her sister, Stella and her husband Stanley Kowalski in their serviceable little apartment. The aggressive and animalistic Stanley immediately marks himself as the opposite of the feminine and refined Blanche and Stella finds herself pulled between the two of them. Stanley suspects all is not as it seems and begins to pry into Blanche's colourful past, even as Blanche spots a way out in the arms of the Mitch, a man captivated by her. However it doesn't take long before the cracks begin to show in the relationships and in Blanche herself.It almost goes without saying that the writing here is of top-notch quality. The story is a relatively simple character piece that can be summed up in a couple of sentences, however this would do a great injustice to the depth of development and the convincing manner in which the characters are all written and the story told. It is not so much the depth that some of the characters go to, but the complexity that is effortlessly written into them &#150; we can see it writ large on them, but not to the point where it seems obvious or uninteresting. Blanche is of course the focus and she is a mess of neurosis barely hidden behind a front of respectability that clearly doesn't convince her anymore than it does Stanley. Mitch is also really well written &#150; at first it is comic that he tries to be such a gentleman while having the brute just under the surface, but later his frustration is heavy on his face along with his anger. The overall story is surprisingly, well, seedy is the best word that comes to mind. It is in the gutter and no matter what Blanche wants to believe, that is where it stays and the film is right there the whole time.How Kazan managed it in the early fifties is beyond me, because even now the film is pretty graphic in its violence to women, subject matter and rippling sexuality across pictures and characters. It is a compelling story due to the characters and the manner in which they are delivered &#150; Kazan's atmospheric direction really helps; the films feels humid and close, and he has done it all with a basic set and a camera. The lighting throughout is wonderful both in the general atmosphere but also specific touches such as the way Blanche manages to visibly age due to lighting changes when the film has slight chances of tone.Of course the main reason I keep coming back to this wonderful film is the actors, who take the opportunity and, in many cases, make it so that it is hard to see anyone else playing their roles. Leigh is perfect for the role and gets everything absolutely spot on; she is vulnerable yet self-seeking, confident yet needy, proper yet unstable. Even visually Leigh is convincing in terms of body language but also the fact that she looks the right mix of ages, looking beautiful one moment but worn and defeated the next &#150; totally, totally deserved her Oscar. Brando made his name here and even now his performance is electrifying and memorable. He has his big scenes where he gets to play to the back row but he also has moments where he does nothing other than be a presence on screen; no matter what is going on we are watching him because we are as in awe and yet as afraid of his power as Blanche is herself. Together Leigh and Brando dominate the screen and whenever either of them are on screen it is hard to look away. As a result, Kim Hunter sort of gets lost in the background although her performance is still good. Karl Madden is great but again only holds a supporting role and deserved his Oscar for a convincing performance of a well-written character. Of course it is easier to give good performances with great material than with bad material but there have been enough versions of this play around for us to see how lesser actors can fail where this cast soared.Overall this is a great film that sees so many critical aspects all coming together as one final product. A superb play has undergone a great adaptation that has been seized upon a great cast who deliver a collection of performances that deserve all the praise heaped on them, all directed with a real sense of atmosphere that really delivers a seedy and erotic film both for its time and today.

Beautiful photography, a beautiful musical score, fine editing, excellent dialog, natural character development and exquisite settings. And last but not least a marvelous cast of actors at the top their collective form. Anthony Hopkins has done nothing better. His restrained portrait of the Butler, Stevens, is one of the finest attempts at the portrayal of true servitude, without suffering, that I have ever seen. I say, without suffering, because I don't think Stevens suffers. I think he is very aware of what others experience, as far as close emotional attachments and self-expression, but does not particularly covet those things. He is something we don't understand anymore, someone who lives to serve, in the best sense of the word. I also do not think Stevens is a naive person; though perhaps sheltered by the circumstances of his career, he fully knows HOW to find out what's going on the outside world, if he wanted to. Emma Thompson's housekeeper, Miss Kenton, is from that outside world and attempts to broaden Mr Stevens' horizons by forcing him to face what she thinks are his own self-imposed limitations. She is right, or course, in that Stevens does indeed impose limitations on himself, but she also has a hidden agenda. She is in love with him. Perhaps he loves her but that is something he has sacrificed, willingly, to perform his job to the best of his abilities. We might not understand this attitude now but those were different times when the feudal spirit was still flickering in its last days of existence in England. All gone now.I found 'Remains of the Day' to be a fascinating glimpse into the day to day activities in a great house run along the lines of ancient traditions, and it is also an attempt to portray our struggle with ourselves and our consciences; cowardice resulting from fear, breaking the bounds of tradition, love vs. duty and honor and all that self-help sort of thing.The only truly false and ridiculous note in the film is when Lord Darlington asks his butler to explain the facts of life to Darlington's God-son, Hugh Grant, a young man in his twenties. This was totally absurd and I doubt if the most empty-headed, negligent peer ever known to man, whoever he might have been, would have given the facts of life a second thought. Most schoolboys learned about sex at a very early age within the English public school system and by other more sophisticated means at their disposal. I suggest reading books by Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene for the real skinny on that topic.I also found Congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve) to be a highly fictional creation. America did not give a damn about World War 2 until well into the fighting action, and France and most of the Continent had fallen to Hitler's army, only then did F.D.R. come to the aid of England. In the mid 1930s when this film takes place, America was not concerned with German aggression. In fact our Ambassador to the court of St James, Joseph Kennedy Sr, was an admirer of Hitler, resulting in F.D.R. calling him back to Washington and giving him other work to do. He was an embarrassment but still America did not act in the interests of England to cut Germany off at the pass BEFORE a war was started. Reeves' speech, therefore, at the great dinner is completely bogus and the creation of a modern author looking back and using his creative imagination to put forth an anti-aristocracy diatribe out of the mouth of Congressman Lewis.The other historical figure shown in this film is Sir Oswald Mosley, though under the name of Sir Geoffrey something or other. He is portrayed as a grim-lipped monster, quite unlike the true personality of Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, aka Black Shirts. Mosley had a large following among average British citizens of the day and it wasn't until the press and the communists put him in their sights that he was arrested and imprisoned for the balance of the war. Prior to the formation of the B.U.F. Mosley was widely considered one of the most brilliant politicians in Parliament and was often considered as a possible Prime Minister. This aspect of the truth was entirely ignored in the portrayal of Sir Geoffrey who was simply shown as a nasty little vegetarian bully spouting Hitlarian epithets, something Oswald Mosley never did.

His restrained portrait of the Butler, Stevens, is one of the finest attempts at the portrayal of true servitude, without suffering, that I have ever seen. I say, without suffering, because I don't think Stevens suffers. I think he is very aware of what others experience, as far as close emotional attachments and self-expression, but does not particularly covet those things. He is something we don't understand anymore, someone who lives to serve, in the best sense of the word. I also do not think Stevens is a naive person; though perhaps sheltered by the circumstances of his career, he fully knows HOW to find out what's going on the outside world, if he wanted to. Emma Thompson's housekeeper, Miss Kenton, is from that outside world and attempts to broaden Mr Stevens' horizons by forcing him to face what she thinks are his own self-imposed limitations. She is right, or course, in that Stevens does indeed impose limitations on himself, but she also has a hidden agenda. She is in love with him. Perhaps he loves her but that is something he has sacrificed, willingly, to perform his job to the best of his abilities. We might not understand this attitude now but those were different times when the feudal spirit was still flickering in its last days of existence in England. All gone now.I found 'Remains of the Day' to be a fascinating glimpse into the day to day activities in a great house run along the lines of ancient traditions, and it is also an attempt to portray our struggle with ourselves and our consciences; cowardice resulting from fear, breaking the bounds of tradition, love vs. duty and honor and all that self-help sort of thing.The only truly false and ridiculous note in the film is when Lord Darlington asks his butler to explain the facts of life to Darlington's God-son, Hugh Grant, a young man in his twenties. This was totally absurd and I doubt if the most empty-headed, negligent peer ever known to man, whoever he might have been, would have given the facts of life a second thought. Most schoolboys learned about sex at a very early age within the English public school system and by other more sophisticated means at their disposal. I suggest reading books by Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene for the real skinny on that topic.I also found Congressman Lewis (Christopher Reeve) to be a highly fictional creation. America did not give a damn about World War 2 until well into the fighting action, and France and most of the Continent had fallen to Hitler's army, only then did F.D.R. come to the aid of England. In the mid 1930s when this film takes place, America was not concerned with German aggression. In fact our Ambassador to the court of St James, Joseph Kennedy Sr, was an admirer of Hitler, resulting in F.D.R. calling him back to Washington and giving him other work to do. He was an embarrassment but still America did not act in the interests of England to cut Germany off at the pass BEFORE a war was started. Reeves' speech, therefore, at the great dinner is completely bogus and the creation of a modern author looking back and using his creative imagination to put forth an anti-aristocracy diatribe out of the mouth of Congressman Lewis.The other historical figure shown in this film is Sir Oswald Mosley, though under the name of Sir Geoffrey something or other. He is portrayed as a grim-lipped monster, quite unlike the true personality of Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, aka Black Shirts. Mosley had a large following among average British citizens of the day and it wasn't until the press and the communists put him in their sights that he was arrested and imprisoned for the balance of the war. Prior to the formation of the B.U.F. Mosley was widely considered one of the most brilliant politicians in Parliament and was often considered as a possible Prime Minister. This aspect of the truth was entirely ignored in the portrayal of Sir Geoffrey who was simply shown as a nasty little vegetarian bully spouting Hitlarian epithets, something Oswald Mosley never did.

His characters talked like nobody we've ever heard before (though there are strong echoes in the works of Hartley and Lynch). And unlike every Hollywood movie ever made, Ed ripped open his heart and poured it out on the screen. Never more so than in Glen Or Glenda, his original avant-garde masterpiece.Avant-garde? You heard me. What is the definition of avant-garde film? Some attributes are unconventional narrative, unique visual style, radical rejection of artistic or social norms, an often willful disregard for reality. Gloria Floren said Avant-garde films are often iconoclastic, mocking conventional morality and traditional values; the filmmaker's intense interest in eccentricities and extremes may shock viewers.  Indeed, the avant-garde film maker's purpose may be to wake or shake up the audience from the stupor of ordinary consciousness or the doldrums of conventional perspective.Imagine if people viewed Un Chien Andalou or Meshes Of The Afternoon or Eraserhead with fratboy derision instead of holy reverence. They'd be viewed as unwatchable nonsense too. Everybody'd have a good snark watching for continuity errors and bad camera moves. Does Glen or Glenda rise to the level of those classics? Time will tell, but try this experiment watch it as if it were, and see. The results may surprise you.Here are some hints. Lugosi is not a mad scientist--he's God, looking down upon twisted human morality and pulling the strings. The green eyed monster that eats little boys? Envy. Envy of women and in this case, their clothes. That envy has eaten vast amounts of Glen's life, it's been a torture to him. There are numerous references to that torture and misery. There's also an entire section devoted to judgment--human judgment versus that reserved to God. The nonsensical stock footage of buffaloes and the army? It signifies the rush of adrenaline, fear and anxiety as Glen tries to confront his identity and come out to his girlfriend. Far from random, it's actually used with ingenuity and skill. The symbology of scenes in which Glen battles his female self and resists the devil should be obvious. But then again, a generous viewing of Glen or Glenda, rather than a beer-fueled let's watch a crap movie viewing, would reveal a great deal. Even the campy scene at the end, when Dolores Fuller relents and gives Glen her sweater, comes with the always-missed segment where God absolves Glen of his misery. There are a dozen moments like this. Sure, there are a dozen technical flubs and random nonsense too, but all good art is organic. There's a guy wearing a Timex in Ben-Hur, for god's sake.The narrator seems comical and dated to us, but in 1953 he was standard-issue, and the lines we now take as campy were then revolutionary, almost treasonous. A plea for tolerance for sexual and gender differences? Condemning the police for arresting gays and transvestites just for existing? During the McCarthy era, when all homosexuals were presumed to be communists? A film like that is bound to make some enemies. Especially a film that featured, not actors playing deviants, but the deviants themselves, in their own words. It's telling that the extreme-religious-conservative Medved brothers were the ones who named Ed Wood worst director of all time. They must have thought they were really sticking it to Ed Wood for making all those subversively weird films involving crossdressing and homosexuals and society's outcasts.

This is a sci-fi thriller with some memorable moments.Director Ridley Scott is already showing us how spooky space can be just from the opening cast list. Indeed no-one can here you scream, and this silent filming method prepares us for many of our characters to (spoiler) be killed by the deadly Alien, leaving Ripley on her own...Sigourney Weaver plays the character 'Ripley' in this film, who is part of a group of crew members aboard a mining spaceship. The space ship interior looks great, and director Scott keeps the corridors dark to build up tension. After receiving an SOS call, the crew of the space ship land on a strange planet where they find thousands of what seem to be eggs. It would be harsh to spoil this films to the people unfortunate not to see it, but poor old John Hurt has a terrible death when a small, baby alien pops out of his stomach. I say 'pops out' because new comers will want the surprises. The small Alien very funnily zooms across the kitchen floor in the spaceship, where all the crew members are left in silence, with a new addition to their crew, an alien!Its great to see that no CGI was used in this film, as I have explained that pure realism can't be beaten by hand made special effects in many other reviews. All the aliens in this film were produced using puppets and models, which look fantastic. I love the way you see the aliens acid spill out their moths on the close up shots, and the shiny, silver teeth. The acting is good and is probably the best performance we see of Sigourney weaver in the alien series, as unfortunately, by the time we get to alien3, its all getting a bit too much with the constant F**k you, man!. There's just no need for it. Alien is a film to enjoy because of the excellent directing, like The terminator. The sounds are great, camera angle are good, and its a memorable flick.

Indeed no-one can here you scream, and this silent filming method prepares us for many of our characters to (spoiler) be killed by the deadly Alien, leaving Ripley on her own...Sigourney Weaver plays the character 'Ripley' in this film, who is part of a group of crew members aboard a mining spaceship. The space ship interior looks great, and director Scott keeps the corridors dark to build up tension. After receiving an SOS call, the crew of the space ship land on a strange planet where they find thousands of what seem to be eggs. It would be harsh to spoil this films to the people unfortunate not to see it, but poor old John Hurt has a terrible death when a small, baby alien pops out of his stomach. I say 'pops out' because new comers will want the surprises. The small Alien very funnily zooms across the kitchen floor in the spaceship, where all the crew members are left in silence, with a new addition to their crew, an alien!Its great to see that no CGI was used in this film, as I have explained that pure realism can't be beaten by hand made special effects in many other reviews. All the aliens in this film were produced using puppets and models, which look fantastic. I love the way you see the aliens acid spill out their moths on the close up shots, and the shiny, silver teeth. The acting is good and is probably the best performance we see of Sigourney weaver in the alien series, as unfortunately, by the time we get to alien3, its all getting a bit too much with the constant F**k you, man!. There's just no need for it. Alien is a film to enjoy because of the excellent directing, like The terminator. The sounds are great, camera angle are good, and its a memorable flick.

Against this background, we see the three of them dealing with their various relationship problems and turning to each other for support. Jojo loves Bill but cannot get to the point of saying I do; Daisy falls for three men a week and appears to have bitten off more than she can chew, when she falls for rich whitebread Charles. Meanwhile Kat takes up a babysitting job for Tim Travers only to find herself falling for him.Despite the fact that it was a big hit and made the names of several people involved, Mystic Pizza is really nothing more than an enjoyable, down-to-earth film that could play in cinemas as well as it does on daytime television. The basic plot is about the love problems of the three girls but yet it manages to avoid overly sentimental moments although it does have its close calls. Mostly the film has a nice down to earth quality that is rough and ready and avoids the gloss of daytime TVM's and feels like it is set in the real world. The direction may not set the world on fire but he deserves praise for avoiding these traps.Of course a major reason that it works so well is the nice playing from the majority of the cast. Gish is vulnerable and convincing and is the heart of the emotional story. As such she doesn't stand out as well as Roberts, who gets a cocky character to dominate the others. Taylor is also pretty good and all three of them are down to earth and quite realistic. D'Onofrio is as good as he usually is; Ferrell is typically bubbly and fun; Perry Mason fans will take the chance to see Moses in something else and he is OK. Also worth noting is a very young Matt Damon in a small role.Overall this will not win over those viewers who hate soapy melodramas but it may win over the indifferent and the fans because it is a quality piece of melodrama. It rejoices in friendship no matter what is happening with love, but yet avoids delivering cloying sentimentality for the most part, instead delivering pretty convincing characters that are performed well by the trio of lead actresses.

Al Pacino, in what I feel is his best role, plays Frank Serpico, an honest cop who takes on the corruption of the entire police force. With the motto to serve the people, Serpico comes into the force to find that he is the object of all ridicule because of his honesty and dedication. And with a view to not succumb to the corruption he becomes the 'wierdo cop' with whom nobody wants to work. Through innumerable transfers Serpico can't cope with force anymore, and when the police commissioner chooses not to help him, he decides to take matter into his own hands. The irony is that his cause is given notice only when he gets shot in the face. I really liked the way the movie began, showing the wounded Serpico being taken to the hospital. With a few reactions from his superiors, the press and his fellow cops, 'six of whom said they'd have liked to shoot him', the audience is taken on a flashback of Serpico's life and the events that led to him getting shot. The ending was equally powerful, especially in the scene where Serpico was given the Gold Shield and he refused by saying, Why this? For being an honest cop or for being stupid enough to get shot in the face? With a powerful script, moving music, great performances and a brilliant director Sydney Lumet (Dog Day Afternoon, another fabulous movie) Serpico is one powerful movie experience. It is made with a certain realism that makes the audience feel for the protagonist and everything that he goes through. Also with so many hair styles and facial changes it is amazing how there is not one technical error with reference to the script.

Though initially skeptical, I was sold by these words of warning. These were all the proper ingredients for a perfect film.Yet The Forbidden Zone, a compromise between Rocky Horror and Monty Python, directed with questionable funding, talent, and motives, didn't work for me. I feel that it's my duty in life to support all misunderstood cinematic acts of deranged genius, so it therefore troubles me that I don't feel compelled to celebrate this one. What could have gone wrong? I guess my search begins by attempting to define what makes a weird film work. In my opinion, there are two ways. The first is when a director leads you through the weirdness with care and craft. Even in a film like Napoleon Dynamite, which makes no attempt to explain or even acknowledge its own purposeless randomness, the director is very consciously presenting this as if it were perfectly normal of both life and cinema, creating carefully calculated reactions of confusion and humor. These films work because the directors make them work. They cause you to either embrace the weirdness or to at least appreciate it.The second way in which a weird film can work is quite the opposite. A weird film can succeed when the director has no intention of making it weird. These are the much beloved b-movies made by directors who had fully intended to be taken seriously, but who were simply too bizarre to be seen as anything else. Ed Wood's Glen or Glenda is my favorite specimen of this kind of film. No one really knows what expectations Wood had for this film, but unrestrained laughter at a Satan with pipe cleaners for eyebrows certainly wasn't it. These films work because they present weirdness in its truest form, without the hindrance of a conscious lens attempting to frame and explain it. They are pure weirdness incarnate. No artificial ingredients added.But The Forbidden Zone falls into neither of these categories. Its particular brand of weirdness can best be compared to a party. Imagine arriving at a friend's party and discovering that you don't know any of the guests. They all grew up together and know your friend intimately, which makes matters all the more awkward. Your friend makes only the most meager of attempts to introduce you and make you feel welcomed, so the conversation quickly descends into old stories and in-jokes with which you have no familiarity. The Forbidden Zone is this friend, whom you are dependent upon for clarity and involvement, but who makes no effort to tailor the conversation (film's content) to your level of understanding. Rather than make any effort to present it to you, it merely leaves you to bear witness to the madness, watching gags and humor that seem very entertaining to the actors and director, but which only manage to evade and confuse you.I'm the kind of person who can find the unexpected use of the word carrot funny, so I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to off-kilter weirdness. But carrot can only be funny when we have some guess as to why it was said; what reaction it was intended to provoke. A stranger on the street, muttering carrot without context or helpful facial expression, is someone who causes us to move to the other side of the street and avoid eye contact. It's more an anomaly than humor. The Forbidden Zone rubs me the same way. The plot is incomprehensible, the humor is odd, over the top, and carelessly delivered, and as we watch this whole mess unravel, we're given no entrance point. We don't identify with the characters, we don't care about the plot, and we're not given any context for understanding the weirdness (which is everywhere). Granted, a film can do without any two of these things. But for all three to be absent, it leaves an audience with no incentive for following along.The production value of this film is a similar problem. Imagine an amateur home video that some eight year old kids put together. Now imagine a masterpiece of cinematography, complete with ingenious special effects and evocative, expressionistic backgrounds. Now imagine a compromise, somewhere between the two, but far from being either. It's hard to tell when this mediocrity is fully intended, and when it's entirely accidental. No doubt the cardboard walls of Cell 63 are an intended part of the film's look and feel, but what do we make of the characters' entryway into the Forbidden Zone, which includes them pressing themselves against a wall with a giant mouth painted on it, for one second too long, before the scene cuts to a cartoon of them journeying down the esophagus? I personally have no idea.This film does have some high points that almost make the view worthwhile. Danny Elfman's appearance as Satan is highly amusing for the first two seconds, before his subplot descends into similar incomprehensibility and then ends just as quickly. My favorite moment had to be the death of the queen, which was surprisingly well done and clearly quite funny.

Though initially skeptical, I was sold by these words of warning. These were all the proper ingredients for a perfect film.Yet The Forbidden Zone, a compromise between Rocky Horror and Monty Python, directed with questionable funding, talent, and motives, didn't work for me. I feel that it's my duty in life to support all misunderstood cinematic acts of deranged genius, so it therefore troubles me that I don't feel compelled to celebrate this one. What could have gone wrong? I guess my search begins by attempting to define what makes a weird film work. In my opinion, there are two ways. The first is when a director leads you through the weirdness with care and craft. Even in a film like Napoleon Dynamite, which makes no attempt to explain or even acknowledge its own purposeless randomness, the director is very consciously presenting this as if it were perfectly normal of both life and cinema, creating carefully calculated reactions of confusion and humor. These films work because the directors make them work. They cause you to either embrace the weirdness or to at least appreciate it.The second way in which a weird film can work is quite the opposite. A weird film can succeed when the director has no intention of making it weird. These are the much beloved b-movies made by directors who had fully intended to be taken seriously, but who were simply too bizarre to be seen as anything else. Ed Wood's Glen or Glenda is my favorite specimen of this kind of film. No one really knows what expectations Wood had for this film, but unrestrained laughter at a Satan with pipe cleaners for eyebrows certainly wasn't it. These films work because they present weirdness in its truest form, without the hindrance of a conscious lens attempting to frame and explain it. They are pure weirdness incarnate. No artificial ingredients added.But The Forbidden Zone falls into neither of these categories. Its particular brand of weirdness can best be compared to a party. Imagine arriving at a friend's party and discovering that you don't know any of the guests. They all grew up together and know your friend intimately, which makes matters all the more awkward. Your friend makes only the most meager of attempts to introduce you and make you feel welcomed, so the conversation quickly descends into old stories and in-jokes with which you have no familiarity. The Forbidden Zone is this friend, whom you are dependent upon for clarity and involvement, but who makes no effort to tailor the conversation (film's content) to your level of understanding. Rather than make any effort to present it to you, it merely leaves you to bear witness to the madness, watching gags and humor that seem very entertaining to the actors and director, but which only manage to evade and confuse you.I'm the kind of person who can find the unexpected use of the word carrot funny, so I don't consider myself a prude when it comes to off-kilter weirdness. But carrot can only be funny when we have some guess as to why it was said; what reaction it was intended to provoke. A stranger on the street, muttering carrot without context or helpful facial expression, is someone who causes us to move to the other side of the street and avoid eye contact. It's more an anomaly than humor. The Forbidden Zone rubs me the same way. The plot is incomprehensible, the humor is odd, over the top, and carelessly delivered, and as we watch this whole mess unravel, we're given no entrance point. We don't identify with the characters, we don't care about the plot, and we're not given any context for understanding the weirdness (which is everywhere). Granted, a film can do without any two of these things. But for all three to be absent, it leaves an audience with no incentive for following along.The production value of this film is a similar problem. Imagine an amateur home video that some eight year old kids put together. Now imagine a masterpiece of cinematography, complete with ingenious special effects and evocative, expressionistic backgrounds. Now imagine a compromise, somewhere between the two, but far from being either. It's hard to tell when this mediocrity is fully intended, and when it's entirely accidental. No doubt the cardboard walls of Cell 63 are an intended part of the film's look and feel, but what do we make of the characters' entryway into the Forbidden Zone, which includes them pressing themselves against a wall with a giant mouth painted on it, for one second too long, before the scene cuts to a cartoon of them journeying down the esophagus? I personally have no idea.This film does have some high points that almost make the view worthwhile. Danny Elfman's appearance as Satan is highly amusing for the first two seconds, before his subplot descends into similar incomprehensibility and then ends just as quickly. My favorite moment had to be the death of the queen, which was surprisingly well done and clearly quite funny.
