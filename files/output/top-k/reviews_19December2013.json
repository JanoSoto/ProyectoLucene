And not just any true story, a true story that is in some way related to the events of World War II. On paper, taking such a story and transitioning it into musical form would sound like a recipe for disaster. But in the case of director Robert Wise's Oscar-winning The Sound of Music (1965), it somehow miraculously comes together very well. It helps that the story itself is a credible one to be put to music seeing that it involves singers. Also, if there's terrific scenery, cinematography, and music to accompany a plot like this, it's all the more reason to celebrate its triumphant success. After her Oscar-winning turn in Mary Poppins (1964), Julie Andrews delivers two enjoyable performances in a row as Maria, a free-spirited Austrian nun who seems out of place alongside her fellow nuns. She is sent by Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) to become the governess of seven children for the widowed Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer). His strict disciplinary order in his house becomes a bit excessive for Maria, especially when it comes to the children. After she takes the children out to play and teaches them how to sing, the Captain reluctantly lets down his defenses and eventually becomes enamored with her. However, he's already set to be engaged with a wealthy socialite from Vienna by the name of Baroness Elsa Schraeder (Eleanor Parker). Furthermore, Austria is being taken over by the Third Reich and the Captain is being forced to fight in the German Navy. How will everything pan out for Maria, the Captain and his children? To reveal anything else regarding the main narrative would involve major spoilers for those who have yet to see it. I've heard that this film doesn't accurately follow the true events it was based on particularly that the Captain wasn't that strict, some of the names were changed, their property wasn't that massive, one of the characters is fictional, etc. I've also heard complaints from critics saying that the film is too sweet as if implying that there's hardly anything at stake for our main characters save for the Nazi invasion in the final act. And frankly, I'd be lying if I said I didn't see or understand where they might be coming from. But at the same time, I have to be honest and say that I didn't mind. First of all, you have to realize that this is a difficult kind of film to make. We're talking about a movie musical that is based on a true story, two separate things that shouldn't really be combined. Imagine a musical centered on the Boston Tea Party. Sounds impractical on paper, doesn't it? In the case of The Sound of Music which centers on Austrian singers escaping their Nazi-occupied country, it actually works. It helps that it's about singers since it warrants these songs being incorporated into this narrative as the children make progress on their singing skills for the music festival in the climax. Second of all, I felt like the way they handled the love triangle between Maria, the Captain and the Baroness was actually pretty subtle. Instead of being as over-dramatic as a soap opera, it feels as plausible and elegant as something like Downton Abbey. When it comes to the film's music, all I can say is that it's Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. No matter what Rodgers and Hammerstein musical you see, whether it's Oklahoma! or Carousel, you can bet that the best part is going to be the music. With songs like the immortal opening title tune, the charming Sixteen Going on Seventeen, the inspiring Do Re Mi (inspiring in that finds a way to basically teach people how to sing), and the epic Climb Every Mountain, we see this dynamic duo at the peak of their power. There's a good reason why these famous songs have been around for such a long time. They're catchy, well-written, executed perfectly by the singers singing them, and are simply filled with joy and passion all around. If the reprise of Climb Every Mountain in the film's final scene doesn't move you, I'm not sure what else will. The cinematography in The Sound of Music is some of the best you'll ever see in film history. Remember in my review of Bambi (1942) when I mentioned that forests remind me of that film since it had that deep an impact on me? Well, I experienced an identical reaction with The Sound of Music in that mountains and lakes remind me of the Trapp family climbing up the mountain together in the end as well as the mountain, lake, and gardens in the back of the Trapp estate. When the epic scale and grand beauty of the landscapes in Austria are captured as excellent as they are here, these heavenly images will stay with you for as long as you live. To be completely honest, I'm rather surprised by how well The Sound of Music holds up many years after its release. We all know how outstanding the music is, how scenic the images on screen are, and how good the performances and singing by Andrews, Plummer, and the child and teenage actors are. But the story and the way it's told is very surprising mainly because of how much it grew on me. As I better understood the risks of taking a story that happened in real life and translating it into a palatable musical, the more I appreciated what the filmmakers accomplished. It was a treat and a pleasure to revisit The Sound of Music again, and I'm fairly certain that it won't be my last.

Now, I have seen many tiny pieces (I believe everyone has), enough to the point that if another film or show references Back to the Future, I completely catch it. I must say, however, that there are very few trilogies on the planet that add up to such mesmerizing films as these. There are only four trilogies I love, and the list goes along like this The Lord of the Rings, the original Star Wars films, all three of The Matrix films, and now this. Believe me, readers you will never find something as excellent as these three films about the curiosity of time travel being invented. I must admit that I was quite reluctant by the trailer for this film at the end of Back to the Future Part II, but I admire this one to an extent that surpasses the second film by far.For this third chapter in the saga, Marty McFly heads back in time to pick-up the Doc. At the moment, the Doc is trapped in a western time period, thus forcing Marty to create a new identity; Clint Eastwood. That's right. For the third time in the series, Marty and Doc must head back to the future . . .The first noteworthy thing to tell you is that this film may also be one of the greatest science-fiction AND western films ever created. It was definitely a brilliant idea to carry the story to the past this time round; otherwise, Part III could have been a failed re-treading of the first two Back to the Future films.The acting in this film is--simply put--heartfelt and endearing. The audience could swear that all three films were shot back-to-back, and that adds so much more to the series. We have also acquired the same charm of humor and action blended that the prior films had presented us with. There is not one single performance in the entire film that is lackluster; all of these actors shine brightly in these roles, much as they always did previously.The writing of dialogue and action setpieces in the film are so enveloping and epic, especially towards the close of the film. It's extraordinary in so many ways. I think the most appealing thing about the film is how it self-references itself continuously throughout the films. Self-referencing, as I stated earlier, is very charming, and it makes the audience feel so much more at home with the tale and characters. This film gives us a well-executed message about life, and I think this is one point of a plus that makes the film so joyful and welcoming. This film, besides being set in the past (nearly a hundred years before the eighties, to be exact), is more about our individual futures as human beings. This idea, in turn, is so very rare to see in filmography that you cannot help but praise the film with applause. Phenomenal.One very shocking revelation is the set itself it looks like a real town in REAL western time periods. I actually had a double-take at how detailed some props and areas looked in the film. It is absolutely beautiful, especially when we see the many mountain ranges of this desert.As always, the soundtrack adds a childhood feeling to the film; that feeling you get when you are so familiar with a certain object that it brings this deep joy and empathy to your heart.With one last major compliment in the film's favor, I have to mention that when the film closed, I had the biggest smile on my face than I have had in quite a while. It is the kind of smile I believe everyone gets at the end of Star Wars, or The Lord of the Rings, or It's a Wonderful Life.

Anyway, I think the way their affair plays out is completely natural and believable and that's the reason I don't get why one IMDb reviewer (one that I can recall - perhaps there are more) AND Roger Ebert both have a problem with the movie turning into a romance in its second half (and with the ending, which I address below). OK, so it's not as funny as it is in the first half, but so what? Does it HAVE to be a laugh-out-loud comedy all the way? I have no problem with the genre-mixing here, none whatsoever - I rarely do, actually.

And you can't even say it was rushed - they both got there gradually, as is shown in the movie's second half. I don't really get the logical basis for this opinion. Not yet, at least. So, then, I ask what's not to like about this movie?!...Like the title says - to me, this is the best movie of 1973, save for (but very, very close to) The Exorcist.

Anyway, it was even better than expected. It was really, really funny and the characters were very likable. How do you NOT fall in love with Glenda Jackson?! ) And he's pretty cool too, but I'm straight so I can't really speak for that side. Anyway, I think the way their affair plays out is completely natural and believable and that's the reason I don't get why one IMDb reviewer (one that I can recall - perhaps there are more) AND Roger Ebert both have a problem with the movie turning into a romance in its second half (and with the ending, which I address below). OK, so it's not as funny as it is in the first half, but so what? Does it HAVE to be a laugh-out-loud comedy all the way? I have no problem with the genre-mixing here, none whatsoever - I rarely do, actually. To me, the narrative structure is pretty much impeccable and makes sense throughout, with the ending being, of course, pretty much inevitable given the situation. Would the movie really have been better had they implausibly stayed together, despite his kids and all of the other obstacles? I don't know. Maybe! It was certainly hard to take, but it made perfect sense to me.

I don't mean to imply its a perfect film because it is of course silly, implausible, full of product placement (good ol' Disney), but its also sweet and fun and magical. Watching our main character's transformation into Santa is easily one of the most memorable in Christmas film history. The movie really has everything you could possibly want from a Christmas film right from square one with familiar Christmas classics, a middle aged divorced father more concerned with his career than his family, Santa, presents, North Pole, elves, magic...you name it. It is all here. There is also a ton of hidden little Easter Eggs (pardon the pun) in the film from Mickey Mouse's hidden face in the moon to elves hiding amongst the humans throughout the movie. Its a fantasy adventure comedy that kids will absolutely adore and adults can still smile even if its a guilty little pleasure. Best of all the film is full of magic and morals and is squeaky clean save few a couple of stupid fart jokes in the beginning (I hate fart jokes but they are there for better or for worse.) Tim Allen blew everyone away with his comedy on Home Improvement in the 90's and with this film he proved his chemistry could translate to the big screen. Allen really is fantastic in this movie. He goes from the selfish single Dad to Santa in all the right ways and makes the unbelievable believable. Eric Lloyd does a great job as Allen's son. He isn't amazing but this is really one of his first films and he is absolutely right for the part. The chemistry between him and Allen is perfect and fits the film. Wendy Crewson is Allen's ex-wife and she is good in the role. She doesn't get a lot of time on screen and her best scenes are towards the end when she comes around to the idea of her ex-husband being Santa Claus. Judge Reinhold is really the closest thing you get to a villain in the movie and he isn't quite that. He's a grown up who refuses to accept a concept like Santa Claus. They do make him awfully unlikable though which is unfortunate. However, he serves a purpose and mostly is there for Allen to make sarcastic jokes about. His scenes near the end when he comes around to Santa are really silly and poorly done in my opinion. David Krumholtz is sorely underused as the head elf. He is a very funny actor and I think there could have been more done with him and the relationship between him and Allen.Director John Pasquin had worked with Allen on Home Improvement and a few projects since then including his new sitcom Last Man Standing. They likely know each other very well and know the style of comedy. I'm not sure he's the optimal choice for a family Christmas film but he absolutely gets it done in the right away. Perhaps my only but would be that there could have been more character development with the supporting cast and I felt like the ending is very rushed. They spend a lot of time building up this story and then it seems as though they realized they spent too much time and have to wrap it up very quickly. Nonetheless, this is a lot of fun and you will certainly enjoy watching it and you'll smile a lot. For me, it wasn't laugh out loud funny like I expected it to be but its simple and cute. There is a lot of magic for the little ones and you can't fault them at all for making something like that. Its worthy of adding to your family Christmas film rotation every year!

Interestingly enough, the film was more of a character study on Salieri, a Composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The film opens with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in an asylum after attempting suicide, asking for forgiveness for murdering Mozart (Tom Hulce) in 1791. His story; his confession; this film, is told to a priest by the name of Father Vogler (Richard Frank). Amadeus takes place primarily in Vienna, from 1781 until 1791, when Mozart dies. Through Salieri's words, we are able to see Mozart as he is (supposedly) when away from public eye, and the picture is less than ideal. Mozart, although still an undeniable genius and musical prodigy, is also immature, rude, selfish, and has no respect for his wife, children, family, nor anyone else in society. It goes without saying that the accompanying music is phenomenal. Mozart' compositions are essential and forefront enough throughout the entirety of the film to be considered a character. The costume design, period production, mise en scene, etc. was all exceptional. However, I could hardly watch the film because of Mozart's character. Especially his laugh. To make this worse was the fact that this was all in the director\/writer's imagination. Yes, this is historical fiction.

The story is involving enough to make you not to think about the 'fantastic' aspects, at least not during the film. The cinematography was awesome. The scenarios were undeniable well-done. The soundtrack with the typical 80s beats was new,I've never listened this beats in a western film before, but i thought it was fine and fitted some action scenes.One of my favorites films from the 80s. 8.3\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 December 2013","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Look up the word awe in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find?

Nick Nolte does a great job as a weathered, wise, and steadfast L.A. detective. It's a secret pleasure to see his special squad of 4 break all the rules if it has to. The setting is nice; they drive around in a 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible. Chazz Palminteri provides most of the comic relief. The basic plot conflict provides very good tension, as the bad guys turn out to be a military type (mainly Treat Williams) and an Atomic Energy Commission general (John Malkovich). There are a good many sharp and deep lines of dialog in this movie. The cinematography of Haskell Wexler is excellent. There are two main actresses, and each does a good job. Melanie Griffith is Nolte's wife, and he has had a fling with Jennifer Connelly who also went with Malkovich. It's when she turns up dead and a friend of hers mails Nolte some private movie material that his investigation goes into gear. A number of actors provide cameos or speak in scenes, including Bruce Dern, Louise Fletcher, William Petersen, Rob Lowe and Ed Lauter. Some of the action occurs at a desert test ground for atomic bombs, and this has a very realistic and scary feel to it. At one point, the squad looks at a giant hole caused by the bomb. That may not be realistic, but it is certainly an effective scene.Nolte and Griffith do an excellent job at bringing to life the downward turn in their relationship due to Nolte's affair. Not too many movies like this plumb personal relationships this deeply. There are a number of scenes like this that are very well-written and played, like one between Nolte and Conelley when they are breaking up, and another between Nolte and Palminteri near the end. The sharp and unpredictable dialog in these scenes, deceptively simple, hits right human notes.Nolte's character is Max Hoover. He thinks his main quarry is Malkovitch, Genl. Thomas Timms. Timms thinks about the world in terms of space, atoms and energy. When he thinks about people he sacrifices to radiation poisoning, it's in terms of numbers, not people 100 trade for 1,000. But Allison Pond awakens his senses Why would I kill Allison? She showed me pleasures I never dreamed existed. It's all I think about these days. Ironically, death for him is imminent due to cancer from radiation. His universe has changed, however. His affair with Allison brought out his limited view of the universe, which was also a contradictory view. Space and energy do not have the pleasures he had discovered with Allison, after all, so what does?Max Hoover thinks about the world in terms of people, in moral terms, the good guys and the bad. He sees himself as dispensing justice, a limited view of his actions. Yet he does not dispense justice. He doesn't give the criminals their legal due or their day in court. He rationalizes that even a scumbag can get elected D.A., so he discards the system. He uses violence as he sees fit, and that's Mulholland Falls and his downfall. He too has an affair with Allison, and in the process of this immorality he destroys the heart of his marriage. Why would he kill it? He has become more like Timms than he knew. He thought he could make it work both ways. That was his limited view. He could not live such a contradiction.Treat Williams's Colonel is a third flawed man in this story. Timms refers to the death of Allison as a mistake, an error in judgment, an overzealous reaction against a perceived threat to national security. Security is all the colonel can see, just as Hoover can only see his job, duty and getting the bad guys. He rationalizes killing Allison because she was in the way. Limited visions all the way around with no one fully respecting the human person that is each of us.Chazz Palminteri's likable character has an anger problem and he's seeing a shrink. He thinks this will help him, but it doesn't. He too has an illusion. He's buying into her teaching that all problems are solvable if you just break them down into pieces. In the end, he needs his anger even to attempt to stay alive.There are no major rays of light or hope in these characters or in this thoroughly noir story.I've read a good many negative reviews of this film, but I find the movie very enjoyable and above-average.

Amélie is one of those movies.After having watched it on my telly, I realized this is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is so personal, so enriching, so playful and yet, so sweet that I can't help but fall in love with Amélie. To me, it seemed a movie capable of inspiring someone to feel good about their life, no matter whatever trouble they are in. During the whole course of the movie, one thing that no one will fail to notice is the sheer importance of imagination and fantasy in one's life and how it makes everything so interesting around us. Amélie lives in an apartment in Montmartre and earns her living by working as a waitress for Café des 2 Moulins. This is another aspect of the movie, where we are left wondering how can she manage to live in her apartment on the meager income of a waitress?!

Being a military guy myself I think that the way that the hijack went down, it was just too far fetched.

The comedy is well thought out and Mushu, the dragon, is very funny as the comic relief. The pacing is fine, the dialog is pretty good. The characters are pretty good too and the voice acting is top-notch. Ming-Na did a solid job as the beautiful Mulan who determines to save her father's life by replacing him in an army. Donny Osmond is charming as General Shang, the villain Shan-Yu is a frightening villain and is easily one of the best out there. Like I said before, Mushu is funny thanks to Eddie Murphy's great voice work.The songs may not be as memorable as the other Disney scores, but they're fine enough for me to listen to.

The look of China, the emperor's palace, and the mountains are great as are the character animation.Overall, Mulan may not be as solid as the three films I've already stated, but it's a childhood classic that has been stuck with me for a while and would be looking forward to watch it again.

On the downside, the actors don't seem that interested in the movie they are playing in.As a Montrealer, my main interest in the movie was seeing how the city that I love and live in was filmed by director Frank Oz. I was impressed. The movie depicts a very accurate portrait of the city and its culture. We are treated to beautiful shots of the Old Port and the downtown skyline. The maps of the city (read at some point by the main characters) make sense. Overall, the film doesn't make any noticeable mistake concerning the look and feel of the city. However, the viewer should note that even though it is the main part of the city that we see throughout The Score, the Old Port is only a small neighbourhood in Montreal. Those brick roads and old buildings don't stretch on dozens of miles! Nonetheless, it makes a lot of sense that a rich American businessman lives there and not in some other parts of the city. Overall, we are far from some other movies that merge shots of Montreal and Quebec City and pretend it's the same place when these cities are about 200 miles apart.On the culture side, characters switch from English to French back an forth, which is very common in some parts of Montreal. De Niro, Norton and Brando speak a very good French, even if they don't do it often. It is nice to hear many side characters speak French. I do have a few gripes. Albert and Jean-Claude are not common names at all among Quebecois men, except those that are ages 50+, so it is kind of weird to see two young waiters in the same bar bear those names. And I don't really understand why two francophone security guards would have a conversation exclusively in English. My guess is that it is to accommodate the majority of the film's audience.I would recommend this movie if you are in the mood for a simple, pure heist movie. There is not much drama nor much character development but one the action kicks off about halfway through the movie, it is pretty entertaining.

That's not just because his performance was so terrific. What's impressive is that Bogie goes from an ultra-cool detective in Falcon and a noble Nazi-killer in Casablanca to a crazy loser in Sierra Madre. He didn't coast by playing lovable heroes. He was willing to look terrible and to play a despicable human being in a character-actor kind of way.Fred C. Dobbs (Bogart) is a jobless American in Tampico, Mexico, begging for food money. He pools what money he has with that of a friend (Tim Holt as Bob Curtin) and they head out with Howard (Walter Huston) for the titular mountain to find gold. Howard has been on many such journeys and knows this isn't going to turn out well. It doesn't take more than few months for Dobbs' paranoia to cloud his vision. Before long, he's hiding his gold and proving he'll do anything to protect his burgeoning fortune.Don't worry, Badges? I don't have to show you any steenking badges, I haven't forgotten about you! Yup, this is the movie with that quote. People love (mis)quoting the line, but they shouldn't overlook the subtext there's no law up in the wild Mexican mountains. Then again, the real villain is not a gang of baddies. It's Bogie. Dobbs' alienation of his friends not only proves how paranoid he is, but in doing so, he puts his gold and his life in serious danger from steenking bandits.The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre was highly ranked on both the 1998 and 2007 Top 100 lists released by the American Film Institute...and rightly so. It's nearly 66 years old and it holds up remarkably well. Writer\/director John Huston made several fine films, but this was his peak.

The film was pretty much made to flaunt machismo, daring, and flashy firework-battle scenes. To make matters worse, not even historically accurate. Wallace was not the poor villager the film depicts, but a landowner and minor knight.

But, as a whole, Braveheart was a loss.

Sadly, this is not proved fact, but a myth. Still, it is interesting trivia that could be true.
