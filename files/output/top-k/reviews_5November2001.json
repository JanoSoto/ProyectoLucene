But when I finally watched it straight-through, I have to say I was kind of disappointed.  First of all, I thought they could've stressed the idea of spoofing fairy tales.  I think that's what tantalized me most about the film.  I laughed my head off when Lord Farquaa (voice of John Lithgow) looked into the mirror and gave that Mirror, mirror on the wall speech and the mirror commented on him negatively.  So he calls his henchman and he punches a crack into a small mirror.  Lord Farquaa then continues with You were saying?.....  Now that's funny!  I also loved that little tribute to The Dating Game where Farquaa had to choose between Princess Fiona, Cinderella and Snow White (who is described as living with seven men).  Then the people in the audience, his knights, start holding their fingers up screaming out who he should pick.  Again, hilarious!  And I have to commend the always-talented John Lithgow for lending his voice to that character, because he absolutely cracked me up and I don't think any actor could've done a better job.  In fact, though he was the villain, I was hoping he would have a bigger part in the story.  The story mainly focuses on Shrek and his pal, Donkey.  Eddie Murphy provides the voice of Donkey the donkey, and he's funny at times, but after a while he gets obnoxious.  I was amazed by the abundance of crude humor.  I know it's nothing compared to the average Farrelly Brothers movie, but how many parents are taking their children to see their flicks?  The opening scene alone is filled with gags involving farting in the water, taking a mud bath and spraying spit all over people's faces.  I don't see how a film like Road Trip gets panned for using gags like that--and often in a funny way--yet this movie gets rave reviews by critics everywhere.  There's always a certain way to deliver a crude joke, and it's hard to deliver it adequately when trying to appeal to children and keep the PG rating.  Kids will most definitely laugh at every crude joke in sight, but adults will probably roll their eyes.  Even at an hour and twenty minutes, I felt the film dragged quite a bit.  They could've cut a few of those Shrek-Donkey interactions and concentrated more on plot.  I liked the movie, but not as much as I thought.

Anyone remember &#145;Nutty Professor 2'? I sure do. Yet that horrible film has been erased from my memory with an even worse film, which also happens to be a sequel. Poor Eddie, just when he was getting hot again he is simply cashing in on his success with some really, really bad films. &#145;Doctor Dolittle 2' is just that type of film.  A forgettable, tepid, horrible film that manages to retain its' great qualities from the first film for only about the first 5 minutes.       Eddie Murphy stars as the world famous veterinarian who can talk to the animals. As a result, his life is completely abnormal as all animals try to see the Doctor in the worst of times. Yet, the plot in this film sees a &#145;Godfather' &#150; like Beaver ask Dolittle for his help in thwarting a logger's plan to destroy the forest in which they live in and turn into a new city. The only way to stop this from occurring is for Dolittle to have two Pacific Western Bears mate and produce an endangered species, thus stopping the project.        Talk about lame. This film goes downward right after the story shifts from the city to the woods as the film tackles many topics simultaneously. Dolittle must deal with the neglect of his wife, the neglect of his children and the stress of saving these animals from the evil loggers all while staying sane.

There is something mysterious about this movie that rises toward the staggering mysteries of life, and repeated viewings are really the only means toward a full understanding of these ideas.Undoubtedly, this is the best film made in the 1990s based on a true story (if you, like me, discount _Schindler's List_ from such assessments.

Most self-proclaimed film buffs and critics will and have been easily convinced by the film. That's not to say that if you like this film you're dumb. You just missed the flaws. Anyone who wanders upon it unawares is likely to be repelled, needless to say. I, who have been wanting to see it since Jamie Berardinelli spewed about it as being one of the best films of the 1990s, that bone head, I myself found it contrived and very annoying, containing some bits of worth in individual scenes. To me, it seemed that Tim Roth, as well as the screenwriter (who also wrote the novel on which it's based), had calculated every iota of this film from the dialogue to the shot composition. Their goal was emotional manipulation, but the camera records the film's falseness clearly.This film is an attempt to produce a realistic situation. In the cinema, realism is achieved by a naturalness in the actors and writing, as well as the actual filming. In a good 90% of the scenes, dialogue was obviously scripted with nothing improvised. I would bet that the minutest detail of tone of voice was written into the script. You can tell this because the rhythm of the dialogue is so precise, it leaves no room for invention. It might seem natural to the untrained ear, but it is phony naturalism. In the remaining 10%, I think it is possible that there was some improvisation, especially in the scene where the father denies everything and attacks his son for suggesting such awful things. I would bet my life that Tim Roth began his career on the stage. He's a mediocre but entertaining actor, speaking his lines, even those in the basest slang, as in Pulp Fiction, with the most eloquent and practiced diction. As a director, this is how his actors turn out, too. It should not be this way. The acting is measured to an unnecessary degree. All of the performances, except for a few individual scenes, seem forced. I can just see Roth directing these actors from behind the ever-present camera.Also, the impeccably composed photography is totally out of place in The War Zone. This should have been done with hand held cameras, maybe even on video. It should have seemed sloppy. Instead, we get one of the most beautifully shot films of the past few years, which tells me that Roth was so confident that his subject matter was important, the only thing he was worrying about was the cinematography. Movies about sexual abuse should not be beautiful in any way. The photography definitely undermines the weight of the subject.Even if the film had not seemed so phony to me, I still would have had problems with it. The film sickened me, not because its subject matter was sickening, but because it is treated in an exploitative way. My guess is that more people would get off on it than would get anything from it. Nudity is rampant, which is called for, I suppose, but Roth couldn't have found a more sexually compelling actress to get buck-naked. I guess if the film had worked, I would have felt guiltier about finding that actress so attractive. But she seems like she's playing naughty through the whole film. Sadists will love the scene where she burns her nipple, not to mention the very graphic depiction of daddy-daughter anal sex. Speaking of which, the version I saw was rated R. I swear it was rated NC-17 in the theaters, so I assume that there was some editing done to reduce it to R for HBO. But what the hell could have been removed?

Most self-proclaimed film buffs and critics will and have been easily convinced by the film. That's not to say that if you like this film you're dumb. You just missed the flaws. Anyone who wanders upon it unawares is likely to be repelled, needless to say. I, who have been wanting to see it since Jamie Berardinelli spewed about it as being one of the best films of the 1990s, that bone head, I myself found it contrived and very annoying, containing some bits of worth in individual scenes. To me, it seemed that Tim Roth, as well as the screenwriter (who also wrote the novel on which it's based), had calculated every iota of this film from the dialogue to the shot composition. Their goal was emotional manipulation, but the camera records the film's falseness clearly.This film is an attempt to produce a realistic situation. In the cinema, realism is achieved by a naturalness in the actors and writing, as well as the actual filming. In a good 90% of the scenes, dialogue was obviously scripted with nothing improvised. I would bet that the minutest detail of tone of voice was written into the script. You can tell this because the rhythm of the dialogue is so precise, it leaves no room for invention. It might seem natural to the untrained ear, but it is phony naturalism. In the remaining 10%, I think it is possible that there was some improvisation, especially in the scene where the father denies everything and attacks his son for suggesting such awful things. I would bet my life that Tim Roth began his career on the stage. He's a mediocre but entertaining actor, speaking his lines, even those in the basest slang, as in Pulp Fiction, with the most eloquent and practiced diction. As a director, this is how his actors turn out, too. It should not be this way. The acting is measured to an unnecessary degree. All of the performances, except for a few individual scenes, seem forced. I can just see Roth directing these actors from behind the ever-present camera.Also, the impeccably composed photography is totally out of place in The War Zone. This should have been done with hand held cameras, maybe even on video. It should have seemed sloppy. Instead, we get one of the most beautifully shot films of the past few years, which tells me that Roth was so confident that his subject matter was important, the only thing he was worrying about was the cinematography. Movies about sexual abuse should not be beautiful in any way. The photography definitely undermines the weight of the subject.Even if the film had not seemed so phony to me, I still would have had problems with it. The film sickened me, not because its subject matter was sickening, but because it is treated in an exploitative way. My guess is that more people would get off on it than would get anything from it. Nudity is rampant, which is called for, I suppose, but Roth couldn't have found a more sexually compelling actress to get buck-naked. I guess if the film had worked, I would have felt guiltier about finding that actress so attractive. But she seems like she's playing naughty through the whole film. Sadists will love the scene where she burns her nipple, not to mention the very graphic depiction of daddy-daughter anal sex. Speaking of which, the version I saw was rated R. I swear it was rated NC-17 in the theaters, so I assume that there was some editing done to reduce it to R for HBO. But what the hell could have been removed?

But, let me ask you what were you expecting when you first heard of Hedwig and the Angry Inch? It's been billed as a punk rock musical about a transsexual from East Germany who was duped into coming to live in a trailer park in Kansas City. So what was I expecting? A gay camp film. I had no doubts that it would be anything else. And that's not to say that I wouldn't have enjoyed a gay camp movie. After all, I liked Moulin Rouge. But I got a surprise that was entirely unexpected what I experienced was the best new film I had seen in years. And I mean that. Hedwig and the Angry Inch is equally hilarious and touching. Not that I want to spread cliches, but I seriously laughed and I seriously cried, often simultaneously. This manages to be the best American comedy since, damn, Preston Sturges was still writing and directing. It's easily the best movie musical since Cabaret. It's also one of the most heartfelt and passionate dramas, and one of the best character studies I've ever seen. Along with that, John Cameron Mitchell delivers a performance that perhaps hasn't been equalled since, I don't know, Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull, which might be the ultimate cinematic character study. I shouldn't say that, because it might hint that Hedwig is a dark character, but, well, I'd call her just a great protagonist. She's a heroine, especially to anyone experiencing sexual confusion, but even to me, a straight, Midwestern boy. Hedwig is a heroine for anyone who's ever felt that they've been treated like crap their entire life. I wanted to clap for and support Hedwig emotionally throughout the entire film. In short, Hedwig is a character I deeply loved, equal to just a few other characters I've met throughout my extensive journeys in the cinema. Parallel to a situation in the film, if I should ever see John Cameron Mitchell on the street, I'd have to hug him.I also have another heap of praise that I have to go through before I am done. I've always thought that movie musicals adapted from stage plays were the death of the genre. Only a few exceptions ever seemed more than unimaginative, slavish films that worked only to bring Broadway to an audience who could or would never visit NYC. Cabaret was the one big exception that I had seen previously, but you also hear West Side Story mentioned as being a great film. But, in adapting a stage play for the screen, I always expect the film to seem stranded on stage. To boot, Hedwig had another mark against it the director, Mitchell again, had never directed a film before. Well, I really don't know what training he had in the art, but it must have been enough. The cinematic art, at least the visual aspect of it, has nearly been forgotten in the 1990s and 2000s, but John Cameron Mitchell creates a visual tour de force as much as he does one of writing and acting. I love the scene where Hedwig the adult reminisces about how his mother forced him to put his head in the oven if he wanted to sing when he was a child. And Hedwig and the Angry Inch's (that's the band's name as well as the film's) appearance outside the Menses Festival next to the port-o-potties. A goth chick, who presumably didn't have tickets for the actual Menses Festival, watches the band in deep curiosity and confusion; Hedwig invites the girl to sit up on stage with her while she relates her past. I also love the sequence where the American G.I. discovers him laying naked in rubble. Hedwig's original name was Hansel, which leads to one of the funniest jokes I can ever recall seeing. Or how about the scene where Hedwig, when babysitting, discovers Tommy, the future rock star who steals all her songs, masturbating in the bath tub? That scene is handled so well that I almost died laughing. To tell you the truth, I don't think there is anything ostensibly wrong with the film, period. I just wanted to talk about the amazing direction because the one review of it I have on hand says the direction can't help from being flat. FLAT? How can you say that it is flat? PS The animated number and the song that goes along with it is adapted from Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium, about which I wrote my senior thesis in college.

Younger children will likely not quite understand the business of Monsters, Inc. and the nature of the jobs the monsters do.

You can't help but like Sully and thus have a vested interest in the events that affect him. John Goodman is the perfect voice for the giant, furry monster who, while being the company's leading scarer, is also the kindest and most selfless character. Billy Crystal is hilarious as Sully's sidekick, and Steve Buscemi appropriately voices the villain Boggs. I also couldn't help but like James Coburn as the company CEO and former mentor to Sully. It's interesting to me how the appearance of the animated Waternoose actually suggests Coburn without looking a thing like him (Waternoose, after all, is a multi-eyed, multi-legged, crablike creature). And Boo? What can you say about Boo? She does all of the things that one expects a tiny child to do, and it's no wonder that Sully is unable to resist her charms. You find yourself laughing at Boo just being a little girl.Monsters, Inc. is the best films I've seen all year. It's one of the few films that I could sit back and just plain enjoy.

Younger children will likely not quite understand the business of Monsters, Inc. and the nature of the jobs the monsters do.

This has some overtones that might disturb folks in the wake of Sept. 11.  So Sulley learns of a plot by his rival, Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) to trap a kid and keep them in Monstropolis so that there will never be an energy crisis.  Boo, the kids that Sulley ends up with is caught in the middle of this and Mike and Sulley want to save her from the nefarious Boggs and the CEO of Monsters Inc.  Henry J.
