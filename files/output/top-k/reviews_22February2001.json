After a difficult stretch for the family beginning with the youngest daughter ending her life at a party, and a broken curview on a specially sanctioned school event, the parents (masterfully played by James Woods and in particular by Kathleen Turner) begin a vicious crackdown on the girls to influence positive behavior.  The girls begin to communicate through records and notes with a group of neighborhood boys who have become obsessed with knowing more about the girls and become the eventual discoverers of the tragic events yet to unfold.Ms. Coppola has created a visual wonder, using brilliant cinematography to tell this story.  The film is very moody and atmospheric, which fits in well with it's subject matter.  Wonderfully done and it succeeds well in drawing you into the film.  If I had to complain about something though, its that the film suffers a bit from it's own pacing, there are times when it's too hypnotic, and comes off as a bit slow.Kirsten Dunst is the big name draw for this film, and as usual delivers a stellar performance as Lux Lisbon, the middle child of the doomed Lisbon sisters.  Lux is a bit wild natured, and after breaking curview from a school dance after a tryst with her date (nicely played by Josh Hartnett Halloween H20) rebels from her parents rules with a further series of sexual encounters on the roof of the family home.

Once the unthinkable happens, Mrs. Lisbon cracks down harder, basically isolating the girls in the house and unintentionally destroying the family.  Well written and brilliantly acted, these two performances may be the benchmarks in the film.Other roles are well written if not small in nature, Danny DeVito as the psychologist the youngest sister turns to after her first suicide attempt, Scott Glenn (another face from the past) as the family Priest, Michael Pare' as the adult version of Mr. Hartnett's character.

I just came from watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I am a great fan of the modern Mandarin Chinese Cinema that really flourished in the 90's. I'm also a fan of some of the sillier Hong Kong kung-fu movies that are usually in Cantonese. Being familiar with both types of films, I know what to expect. I expected a lot, especially being a fan of Ang Lee. Halfway through, during the big fight between the two female heroines, I was already planning to see it again with my sister. But, I must say that on some levels I was disappointed with this movie. People tended to focus more on the martial arts aspect of it, so I was under the impression that it was going to be a well-done kung-fu movie. Not an over-the-top Chinese tragedy. Chinese tragedies are some of my favorite movies, like Raise the Red Lantern, but I have to be in a certain frame of mind to watch them. CTHD really ruined my day, to tell you the truth. It's a fantastic film, but in some ways I feel manipulated as I always do during certain tragedies. In tragedies where the characters aren't developed in a certain way, it does seem like certain things happen just to advance the plot in the way the filmmakers intend.  I'm just not buying the suicide at the end. In fact, Jen wasn't really a heroine if you think about it. She was the villain until halfway through the movie. As I was driving home, I wondered why did she jump and why do we care? She was an impetuous jerk the entire movie, so why was I rooting for her? In some ways she had gotten everything she wanted, and I don't believe that she jumped because of guilt (over Li Mu Bai) or grief over Jade Fox. When Shu Lien told her to be true to herself is what I am guessing. She realized that she has no place in this world. It reminds me of Xiu Xiu, the Sent Down Girl., a film which I also found troubling.  I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but Roger Ebert gave it 4 stars. He admits that parts of the plot are plain silly and focuses on its martial arts aspects. But this isn't a martial arts film--it has fighting in it, but during most of the screentime it's a drama. And as a drama, I don't think it has the stuff Oscar-worthy films are made of.  I guess it some ways you have to see it for what it is. Kung Fu legends are like opera epic, grandiose tales not necessarily meant to be literal or realistic. As a viewer, it was difficult to know which I was watchingis this serious, or is it not? Many if not most Chinese dramatic films feature suicides, and repressed love but few of them have plots this contrived. It is a watered down version of common threads in other films of these genres. So many people loved this film, and it is perhaps received the most exposure in America of any Chinese language film. This is both good and bad in my opinion.  Perhaps it blended the two genres too well--it's definitely one-of-a-kind and I know that it will definitely hold up to repeated viewings.

I am a great fan of the modern Mandarin Chinese Cinema that really flourished in the 90's. I'm also a fan of some of the sillier Hong Kong kung-fu movies that are usually in Cantonese. Being familiar with both types of films, I know what to expect. I expected a lot, especially being a fan of Ang Lee. Halfway through, during the big fight between the two female heroines, I was already planning to see it again with my sister. But, I must say that on some levels I was disappointed with this movie. People tended to focus more on the martial arts aspect of it, so I was under the impression that it was going to be a well-done kung-fu movie. Not an over-the-top Chinese tragedy.

As far as I can see it satirises it quite cleverly through the smooth and cheerful characters, Neil Patrick Harris' Goebels uniform. The characters are comfortable in their world, and even when at war on another planet they are in their own world. No one questions anything, including the fact that they don't question anything. They are all too tied up in their own pathetic lives to even glimpse at the bigger picture. This film is ABOUT propaganda more than it is propaganda itself. Just look at the snippets from TV\/Internet with the slogan Would you like to know more? You never get to know more. The only character in the film that gets to know more is Neil Patrick Harris' character, and he answers questions with That's classified! The final scene of the film brings into question whether the whole film was a piece of propaganda littered with commercial breaks. The film is postmodern! Is it a film, or a film of a TV show, or recruitment propaganda, or something to show parents?3. - The film glorifies war. - Again I think that satire has been mistaken for support of an idea. The film has every cliché from every war movie going - the hyper-brutal drill-sergeant; the assault course; someone dying tragically in training, making everyone else wonder if they are tough enough to go on. When the characters get to the war zone they find themselves out numbered and out classed by the enemy. Numbers beat brains and technology (except in the end the humans (perhaos) prevail because of brain and technology) and we are treated to plenty of starlets torn to pieces.I like this film a lot. It is great sci-fi. The effects are excellent. The story is more complex than it appears to be at first glance (like a lot of Verohoven's movies - RoboCop, Total Recall, Showgirls even) and has lots of little asides which add to the feel of the thing (the aforementioned web-casts particularly). If you like nothing else, the scenes of millions of bugs attacking the troopers are amazing spectacles.If you would like to know more, watch Starship Troopers, and don't forget to keep your sense of irony and satire. This is not a film to take seriously. And don't take yourself too seriously while watching it!

From the bizarre introduction, and frantic photography I knew I was in for some fun.Instead of wasting precious screen time on pointless character development, the writers jump in feet first.   It was great to see Kurt Russel's tongue in cheek Elvis, especially if you remember his performance in the 1979 TV movie.  The boyish charm and winning smile that made him a Disney stalwart still shine.  His foil, the Evil Elvis if you will, is played to the hilt by Kevin-I-haven't-had-a-decent-role-in-ages-Costner, who has a lot of fun with his character.   He doesn't have to worry about sounding ridiculous, because he's supposed to.   I was also taken with Courtney Cox-Arquette who plays a fast talking temptress and was especially happy to see that she has abandoned that hideous stick look (she looked positively ghastly in Scream 3).There isn't a whole lot that can be said for the story except that it is totally unbelievable, full of double dealing and dirty pool, and is punctuated with explosions and gunfights.  Although the film does drag at points, especially in the last half-hour (which gets overly sappy), the gunplay soon resumes.  There is even a tantalizingly ambiguous ending. Oh, and I enjoyed the soundtrack - rather than filling it with Elvis tunes (the Elvis impersonator hired to amuse the audience before the premiere more than made up for this) it samples many different types of music.Critics, naysayers and plot be damned, this is my guilty pick for a mindless matinee.

I think it is because I have always heard how much of an epic quality the film had. This is simply untrue. The film has very little in the way of script. Not much really happens in the film. You could probably sum up in only a couple of sentences.The characters and situations of the film are somewhat trite. It is unfair to dismiss this category of criticism because this a children's cartoon. The heroes and villains of other Disney films are much less formulaic, as well as the challenges they encounter (e.g., The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, Beauty and the Beast).  Simba's challenge was a bit interesting, but, as I complained above, it is brought up and resolved in a half-hour's time.

Also, The Prince of Egypt is pretty good for slightly older children (I would put The Lion King in the 3-8 age range and The Prince of Egypt from 9-13).

He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, `Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is Flashdance lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous `Cocktail' with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role.  Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius).  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.

Brazil is not comedy, although it has its moments, but he makes evident that a good comedian can produce a much deeper and dramatic film than a serious director. ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 February 2001","score":"","review":"  What a disappointment! What a sour follow-up to two fabulous flicks! Sadly, what started as a renaissance of the slasher genre, films of quality not seen since Carpenter's work on Halloween I and II and the Fog...well, maybe *quality* isn't the best word, but you kow what I mean;) What this film truly lacks is Kevin Williamson's writing. Ehren Kruger desperately tries to write like Williamson (which is part of the problem) and fails miserably. Williamson's sharp wit and hilarious satire is missing, as is his keen sense of continuity and plot development. In short this film drags and lacks plot. The jokes aren't especially funny. The characters are dry. Even Wes Craven seems to be less than interested in making this film. I expected much more from a stellar cast. But even Neve Cambell and the Arquettes' reprising roles seemed to be out of steam. Their characters had dried up...had become generic and stagnant. Indie queen Parker Posey was missing the lustre she has in Dazed and Confused and Henry Fool, Patrick Dempsey's geek-boy charm was washed out, Lance Henriksen wasn't on screen for nearly long enough...even Jenny McCarthy's breasts couldn't save this film!;) Scream 2 was a sequel well worth watching, it had new sides to it that were exciting and fun to watch, it had twists that were fresh and unexplored in the first film. In many ways it out-paced the first and made for a better film. This film, unfortunately, had a redundant feeling...a 'we've seen it all before' feeling. It begged for that spark of excitement, that breath of fresh air that the other ones had. In the end, it was average. There were enjoyable moments (including the surprise guest appearance of Jay and Silent Bob and Randy's soliloquy from the grave) but they weren't enough to keep this film interesting. And the ending!!! Oh the humanity!!! Just a touch melodramatic!! This was even beyond the normal Hollywood cheeze factory! I haven't felt that nauseated at a horrid Hollywood ending since Face\/Off! They should have just killed Sidney and been done with it.  I'd recommend this at simply for closure. If one is a fan of the other two, it won't *ruin* the trilogy to see it...it's like Phantom Menace, it sucks but it's still Star Wars. This sucks but it's still Scream. And, also like ep. 1, this isn't bad enough to make me wish I'd never seen it, in fact, it was pretty much what I'd expected, so my expectations had been low and therefore I wasn't overly disappointed. Average, lamentable, a sad end to a great series. 5\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"22 February 2001","score":"","review":"  What a disappointment! What a sour follow-up to two fabulous flicks!
