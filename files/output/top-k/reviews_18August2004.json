With stories like The Shining, he has become categorically associated with the spine chilling. Ironically however, he is responsible for two films which are not as much spine chilling as moving and to a degree inspiring. The first of these is 1994's Shawshank Redemption and the other is 1999's The Green Mile.Staring Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan, The Green Mile is the story of a prison during the depression. In charge of the Electric Chair, Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) and his group of guards, run a tight operation where often the guards have a close relationship with their prisoners. One day a prisoner is sent to them in the form of the gigantic John Coffey (Clarke Duncan). Coffey is sentenced to death for the brutal murder of two young girls, but as the guards begin to interact with Coffey, they begin to realise he isn't quite what he seems.With multi-Oscar winner Tom Hanks in the leading role, King and director Frank Darabont, have chosen a well seasoned professional who can put in the outstanding performance often needed. In The Green Mile however, Hanks is outperformed by the surprising Michael Clarke Duncan. Used to more blockbuster based roles (1998's Armageddon and 2003's Daredevil for example), Clarke Duncan shines as the sweet giant with a heart of gold. Worthy of his nomination for best supporting actor at the Oscars, it took a questionable win for Michael Caine for him to not win.Aside from Hanks and Clarke Duncan, the remainder of the cast provide equally sound performances. Patricia Clarkson is perhaps underused, whilst Sam Rockwell is perhaps overused, but all in all, the cast perform effectively.The Green Mile is a brilliant film. It's perhaps slightly too long, running in at a hefty three hours, but the majority of it runs smoothly and effectively. It might not be as good as films like The Godfather (1972) or Casablanca (1942), but it's definately a film which everyone should watch. It's a film which inspires us to think, and simultaneously causes us to shed a tear. Three hours it might be, but make the effort and you won't be disappointed.

I like Alien and Blade Runner, and all of his other films (except for perhaps Black Hawk Down). And I'd have to say this is one of his better films. Simply because every aspect of the film comes together and creates a beautiful, interesting and thoughtful story of a roman general. Plus we get some awesome battle scenes.Maximus is a General in the Roman Army, in the year 180 A.D. He is leading the Roman armies to fight against the barbarian tribes of Germania. After all of Germania is conquered, Maximus looks forward to finally being able to go back home and seeing his wife and son again. But the Emperor has other duties for him. But before Maximus is able to perform those duties, the Emperor is killed and Maximus sentenced to death, by the Emperors own son Commodus.Maximus manages to escape the clutches of Commodus but finds that Commodus also ordered the death of his family. Maximus is however captured and sold off as a gladiator, and finds himself in a situation where he must fight to survive. But his real goal is to get revenge on the man who killed his family Commodus.The film is visually stunning. The battle scenes are awesome. The acting is superb. The script is excellent. Everything about this film is top-notch, but what can you expect from Ridley Scott? He directs the film like he knows exactly what he wants and the end result is something you'll want to watch over and over again. Russel Crowe is absolutely fabulous in the role as Maximus. He outdoes himself completely. You really care for his character, and in the end I always find that a tear rolls down my eye whenever the end credits roll across the scene. Oliver Reed (R.I.P) also gives us a great performance as the aged gladiator; Proximo. To bad he died before principal photography had ended, and had to be replaced by a CG Puppet in some scenes (altough I never noticed this while watching the film). Juaqin Phoenix also gives a stellar performance as the insidious and evil Emperor Commodus.The battle scenes are all great. My favorite is the battle between the Roman army and the Germanian tribes, which gives us some good IL' dirty warfare shots of people getting mutilated The dark ages way. Other great scenes are when the gladiators are forced to play the part of the Barbarian horde in the re-enactment of the battle of Carthage. Hans Zimmers music in these scenes may very well be some of the best aggressive movie scores I've ever heard.All of this, combined with Ridley Scotts excellent visual style and superb directing, makes for a flawless film that should never be forgotten.10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"18 August 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I've always liked Ridley Scott.

I have watched the show a few times, and I don't dislike it; but it's not the sort of thing that I would find myself watching week after week. Basically what I'm saying is I'm not a Trekkie. I did, however, find lots to enjoy about this movie. The plot revolves around Captain Kirk, who has now been promoted to Admiral Kirk and is going through a mid-life crisis. However, his crisis couldn't have come at a worse time; as it has come on the eve of the testing for a new creation, known as 'Genesis', and not only that but a man named Khan has just been found on a planet that Kirk exiled him on, and he doesn't just want to give Kirk a friendly hug.The acting in the film isn't great, actually, it's about the standard that you would expect from a TV show (which is no coincidence, I'm sure). I'm not sure if all the cast of the shows is present, because I didn't watch it often, but most of the main ones seem to be here; Spock, Kirk, Scottie, Sulu etc. Also joining them is Kirstie Alley, in the role of a young Vulcan commander and Ricardo Montalban who camps it up and dons a silly costume for the title role of Kirk's opposite number; Khan. His performance was the standout of the film for me; he's deliciously over the top, but despite that he comes across as believable as his mannerisms fit the character profile that he is portraying. Unfortunately, non of the show's best known baddies, the Klingons make an appearance. In fact, aside from the Vulcans, there are no aliens in the movie.One thing that surprised me about the film is the meatiness of the characters. As it's a film of a TV show, I wasn't expecting any development or for the characters to step out of their character arks, but they are surprisingly well done. Some characters also go through a change during the movie (some more than others), which is nice to see. The pace is also a good thing about the movie, as it doesn't let up and manages to stay interesting all the way through. One thing that worried me before watching the movie is that I would get bored as I don't know the show, but that didn't become a problem at any point.I am proof that you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy this movie.

Neil Jordan has crafted an enjoyable story about a man's struggle for his dream, the overwhelming odds he faced and ultimately his failure.

Liam Neeson was very good in the leading role of Collins, the man who reorganises the IRA into its modern shape an invisible army of plain-clothes soldiers who fight with unorthodox methods; he was a pioneer in guerrilla warfare, for better or for worse, and that was all born out of his desire to see his country free.The movie also counts with excellent suppoorting roles by Aidan Quinn, Alan Rickman, Brendan Gleeson and my favourite Stephen Rea. My only complaint is Julia Robert her character was, to me, very futile. I'd have expected Jordan to focus on Collins the fighter, but it seems he saw the need to include a boring, out of place romantic subplot. I wonder if to flesh out Collins' personality? Jordan should know characterisation is not akin to love, but to emotions and actions the foormer two do not need love to be expressed. There were two instances where I enjoyed Julia, though when she and Michael discuss in a room while at the same time the IRA is systematically killing British detectives; when she's picking up her wedding dress and we see simultaneously Collins being assassinated.

I'd have expected Jordan to focus on Collins the fighter, but it seems he saw the need to include a boring, out of place romantic subplot. I wonder if to flesh out Collins' personality? Jordan should know characterisation is not akin to love, but to emotions and actions the foormer two do not need love to be expressed. There were two instances where I enjoyed Julia, though when she and Michael discuss in a room while at the same time the IRA is systematically killing British detectives; when she's picking up her wedding dress and we see simultaneously Collins being assassinated. But this was more due to good editing than anything else.Otherwise, Michael Collins is a fine movie with great cinematography and a beautiful score. Elliot Goldenthal is a great composer and I admire his work very much.8\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"18 August 2004","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have just watched the latest, and greatest(?) version of this classic, and unless you are planning to play the commentary (which is not a bad idea, BTW), I would recommend doubling the speed on your DVD player, especially if you are a fairly fast reader.

Not only the very first ever animated feature from Walt Disney studios, but the very first animated full length feature in cinema history. It begins, appropriately, once upon a time in a kingdom far away. In this kingdom lived a beautiful young princess named Snow White and her cruel, mean, jealous stepmother the Queen, who feared that Snow White's beauty may surpass her own so she forced Snow White to become her maid. Each day, the Queen consulted her magic mirror on the wall and asked who was the fairest one of all. The mirror usually replied, You are, but today it said Snow White the fairest. That made the Queen very angry; Snow White wasn't enjoying her life of servitude. Her only friends were the birds. She had wished that someday a handsome, charming prince would come and taker away and marry her. Sure enough, a prince did show up that day, but he accidentally frightened Snow White away. The Queen saw everything and had finally had it. She ordered a Huntsman to take Snow White into the woods the next day, to a clearing. And there, he was ordered to kill her and bring the Queen back her heart. The Huntsman was not looking forward to this. So the next day out in the woods, as Snow White was picking some wildflowers, the Huntsman drew his dagger--And found he just couldn't do it. That gave Snow White a chance to run. She ran into the deepest, darkest part of the woods. She was now all alone. But fortunately the woodland animals, the deer, the birds, the chipmunks and the squirrels came to her aid. She asked them if they knew a place she could stay the night, so they took her to a small cottage in the middle of the woods. It was small alright. Even the furniture inside was small.         Snow White had assumed that children lived here. Seven children. The cottage was also a mess. There were clothes lying about, utensils scattered, even a pickax on the dinner table. She then took it upon herself to tidy up this messy house. Her animal friends helped. So they washed the dishes, swept the floors, straightened up everything and put fresh flowers on the table. Meanwhile, the owners of that cottage were hard at work in the far off diamond mines. These men were seven dwarfs and were named Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Sneezy, Bashful, Happy, and Sleepy. They were named this because they each had personalities that fit their names. Grumpy was always grouchy, Bashful was always shy, Happy was always giddy, Dopey was always dopey as well as mute, you get the idea. Well at 500 work as over, so they locked up their finds and Heigh-Ho, Heigh-Ho-ed their way home. Back at the cottage, Snow White was tuckered out from her long day and fell asleep on the dwarfs' tiny beds. When the dwarfs returned home, they were shocked to see their house so clean. They then decided it was haunted. They decided to check it out, stumbling over themselves several times. But pretty soon they discovered the princess asleep in their beds. Grumpy knew all about the wicked Queen and her black magic. But Snow White begged them to let her stay. They agreed as soon as she offered to cook for them, but first she made them wash up.         Now it had probably been a quarter of a century since the dwarfs last bathed, but soon they were having fun scrubbing up, all except Grumpy. But soon he was convinced to join in. Back at the castle, the Queen's magic mirror informed the Queen that Snow White was still alive and told her exactly where she was. The Queen was furious and ventured down into her dungeon\/laboratory where she kept all her spells and books and witchcraft. She decided to seek out Snow White herself with a good disguise. So with her black magic, she transformed herself from a tall, strikingly semi-beautiful Queen into a short, bent, withered old hag. Then she dipped an apple into a poison. A sleeping poison. One bite of this apple, and the victim collapses. Never to wake up; Back at the Dwarfs' cabin, they were having some musical fun. Grumpy played the wooden pipe organ while the others sang their silly songs. Then Snow White sang to them about someday her prince would come. It touched them all, except for Grumpy. Well the next day, the Dwarfs went off to work, while Snow White prepared a pie for Grumpy. Just then the Queen (in disguise as the old peddlar) came and offered Snow White an apple. The woodland animals sensed the evil in this peddlar so they rushed off to warn the Dwarfs. They were eventually convinced and raced back to the cottage. But it was too late. Snow White had taken a bite out of the poison apple--and collapsed to the floor. The wicked Queen\/ Peddlar cackled and started to leave, when she saw the Dwarfs and the animals arriving. So she made a run for it.           It was pouring rain and a fierce storm had begun. The Queen climbed atop a high cliff and was about to throw a giant boulder on the Dwarfs when suddenly, the rock she stood on crumbled, causing the Queen to fall off. The boulder immediately followed her. The Dwarfs watch the wicked Queen fall to her death. Back at the cottage, the Dwarfs were very sad over Snow White's death, so they fashioned her a glass coffin. Just then Prince Charming arrived. He had heard of the princess in the glass coffin. He opened it and kissed her. Suddenly Snow White woke up! The prince carried her to his horse and the two rode off, while Doc, Sleepy, Bashful, Happy, Dopey, Sneezy, and even Grumpy cheered her on. And so the prince and princess were married and lived happily ever after; Well, Walt Disney's first and probably best animated feature ever. The animators, writers and voice actors all did a very good job. This film was made during the Great Depression, so times being what they were, they did a very good job. This movie has a nice third dimensional look to it. This movie premiered in 1937 as Walt Disney's very first animated feature, but it definitely was not the last. Walt and his crew continued to do a series of movies over the next 6 decades. The second animated feature, Pinocchio, came in 1940, followed by Fantasia, then The Reluctant Dragon, Dumbo in 1941, Bambi in 1942, Fun and Fancy Free in 1947, Alice in Wonderland in 1951, Peter Pan in 1953, and so on! Sadly, Walt Disney died in 1966. I think Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was by far his very favorite. As for the voice cast Adriana Caselotti is Snow White, and a very good singer. Pinto Colvig is Happy and Grumpy. He also did the voice of Goofy until his death in 1967. In fact, I don't think anybody who worked on this film is alive today. If they are, they must be pushing 150. Billy Gilbert voices Sneezy because Gilbert was popular for his comical sneezes; So to all you Disney fans who are also fans of princess movies and want to see how it all began, I recommend Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The first and the best, and made back when they were truly made very, very well! You'll see for yourself!!

What this achieves is indeed a sense of a dreamlike viewing experience.Everyone has those dreams where they have a great sense of having gone somewhere and done something wonderful when they wake up.

The jumpy nature and fluid characteristics of the animation really help to create that very same feeling while viewing the film.I cannot stress the creative genius of Richard Linklater enough. He appears himself at the end of the movie and brings some closure to the main protagonists' dilemma of being trapped in this dream state. The film highlights the idea of how intertwined our dream lives and our Waking lives are. Memories that we once thought to be real often turn out to dreams and vice versa. Fans of philosophical debate and chat will be in heaven here however those who find themselves easily bored by such discussions may be skipping some scenes.

The bondage is designed to prevent an unwilling prospective bride from running away, but merely increases her determination to eventually do so. The incident which finally changes her mind about her suitor constitutes the heart of the film and is a perceptive look at what really makes many people tick.

This is the kind of movie where you check your brain at the door and take it for what it is.There are some great one-liners like the one where Fonda tells her ex-husband, who thinks she's having a kinky S&M affair with Mr. Hart, something along the lines of, If I want to do M&M's, that's fine with me!

I don't know what it is about it, the story, the way the story is told that makes you have to watch it 12 times to get it, the cool fight scenes (LOBBY SCENE!!), or all of the above. At the end you get feelings of coolness and hope, unlike some movies that have a depressive quality at the end (which I strangely also love). If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now! If you have, but you haven't watched the sequels, don't watch the sequels. Unless you really really really want to and have to.

I loved it.With colorful scenery and engaging dialogue, this movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The actors are amazing and I find the plot to be completely fulfilling. Make no mistake, this movie is not for the casual watcher. The is not a movie that you should watch unless you are ready to put you full attention onto the screen of your t.v. Many people will state there are holes and flaws in the plot but I think this is simply because they did not pay rapt attention to the movie. Personally it took me 3 times of watching before I tied everything together, but after seeing it that much and studying every scene I felt that I was left with such an amazing feeling to have viewed something so beautiful.Also, don't expect this to be a true account of David Bowie's relationship with Iggy Pop, it's not. Take this movie simply for what it is, a beautiful and engaging story that is somewhat of a puzzle of memories from a fictional character.10 out of 10 stars for such an amazing story.

I am 15 years old and I started watching it about 8. I have even been to where they filmed this movie & ate in the cafe! That was the most greatest gift ever, thanks to my sister! This movie reminds me of how important it is to have friends. Without friends, life isn't life. Yes, husbands are close, but friends are closer. Keep people you love and care for closest to you...that is what this movie taught me. When I was little I use to go along with the movie and repeat what they said. Such as....Towanda!! I don't know how you spell her name. I hope that if you haven't seen this movie, that you do! It's great. It is kind of sad, but just like life, everyone has their sad moments. I wish Buddy would have been in the movie more, but oh well. Thanks a bunch, make sure you go rent this movie!!
