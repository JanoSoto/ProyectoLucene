[{"date":"28 July 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek is the best movie I've seen all year by far, and the best ever computer animated film even better than Toy Story 2. This movie is just halarious, one joke after another, and they're not the kind of jokes only kids will laugh at. I loved all the characters, my favorite being Eddie Murphy as a loud mouth talking donkey. This movie is always entertaining, always fun, it's funny, it's exciting, it's somewhat deep, it's a great movie. I give it a 9 out of 10.

My expectations were moderate, and my girlfriend was being dragged along.  Her mocking tone was replaced with a feeling of awe as the first images of Aki appeared on screen.  Indeed, every detail (including tear ducts and freckles) were featured.  The only awkward imagery centered around the lack of synchronization when some of the characters spoke (especially Steve Busimee's).Aside from the awesome display of computer animation, the story had an above-average plot, above-average music, and decent dialogue.  The attempts to interject humor typically fell short, but that was easily forgotten. This has definitely been one of my better movie experiences for the summer, it kept my interest and before I knew it the movie was over.  My girlfriend agrees, claiming that it's the best movie out since early May (she liked Shrek and Mummy 2 alot).There were NO children in the theater (450 showing).  The movie seemed to be geared to a more mature audience, much to my surprise.  The fact that this film is categorized as animated has deterred several of my acquaintances from seeing it.  It's a great film, and it is definitely worth my time and money.  See it for the revolutionary computer graphics if nothing else, it's great eye candy. )  ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I am a mild fan of the Final Fantasy video game series and I have an appreciation for sci-fi\/adventure films.
