However, I feel Pleasantville doesn't hold a candle to The Truman Show. While Truman offered genuine pathos, a sympathetic, even heroic lead, and insight into the intrusive nature of television, Pleasantville is overlong, repetitive, simplistic, and hollow.The plot of Pleasantville has two modern-day teen-agers being magically transported to a fictional T.V. show set in the '50's, called Pleasantville (by no less a character than Don Knotts, the movie's only inspired idea). The boy, played by Toby Maguire, likes it there - it's a nice respite from his family problems, which includes his sister, played by Reese Witherspoon. She is transported with her brother, but feels she has entered Nerdville, and so sets out to change her surroundings to something she is more familiar with, something with a more 90's sensibility, like, say with...sex?This is actually an interesting premise, especially since the 50's world is in black and white, and only gradually introduced to color. Unfortunately, the movie takes a black and white attitude in its morality too, hammering the same point home over and over again. I think the movie is basically saying the 50's was a time of stifling conformity, dull and unimaginative culture, and in the end, threatening and oppressive patriarchy. The 90's, on the other hand, offers ultruistic freedom, better values, and color! to life.Please! One could make a better argument that the 90's offers moral decay and fear, as evidenced by broken families, teenage pregnancy, violence, and general cynicism towards all authority. The film takes the logically dubious step of taking 50's sitcom sensibility and making it the reality of that time. Just ask how 90's sitcoms accurately reflect 90's reality. One could defend the movie by saying that it is not making a literal 50's - 90's comparison, but is making the more general point that freedom is better than confromity. This is a truism and doesn't need over two hours to justify, and besides, the movie is taking that comparison seriously. The audience shouldn't.

His character 'Oddball' gets all the good lines and laughs as his character portray a hippy, calling people Baby, which is unheard of in 1940's.  The plot is very straight forward and the acting etc you don't really think about because you are listening out for the next line.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants a good laugh.

An unsatisfied gangster's moll looking for love and trouble in all the wrong places.  Your typical small-time hood out of jail, supposedly rehabilitated and ready to walk the straight and narrow.  Bosses and henchmen that must be two dimensional, cartoonish good fellas, right? And now, throw in the hot genre of the moment&#133; lesbian chic.If any of this is stopping you from seeing BOUND, you're missing out big time.   Combine the best of black comedy, film noire, the gangster movie genre and you have the wickedly entertaining BOUND.As for the gay aspect of the film, it's minimal and not any more or less gratuitous than heterosexual love scenes in most films.  As a woman, I must say, directors directing straight love scenes could learn something from this film.  Or they could at the very least screen a few classic noire films where there is as much sexual tension as there is general plot tension.Seduction is a greater aphrodisiac than flat-out sex. This movie would still be as suspenseful and thrilling without a lesbian romance taking place. That's why it works with being overly titillating or seemingly trendy.  This storyline has always worked as being traditionally one woman and two men. So here's to putting a 90's touch on the classic plotline of the gal doublecrossing the guy with yet another guy!This film has no Demi Moores or Sly Stallones, no guaranteed audience favorites.   No big shot director.  However, the amount of talent and smarts in this film, the acting, the dialogue, the cinematography, production-wise&#133; you'll get far more bang for your buck with this flick than most.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat as well if not better than many other similarly plotted movies with five or ten times the budget.Joe Pantoliano makes his Caesar a typical Everyman who happens to make his living as a mobster.  He's just trying to get ahead.  He badmouths the boss' dopey protégé behind his back, but he also makes sure that he has the boss' favorite hootch when he's expecting him over for a business meeting.  Caesar is no dummy&#133; watch him as his survival of the smartest kicks in as he contemplates getting himself out of a messy situation.  His suspicions might not mesh with what's actually going on, but he's onto to something.Violet, as played by Jennifer Tilly, is Caesar's babe. She's no dumb bunny either, regardless of how she sounds or dresses. Even Caesar underestimates her, which might very well lead to his undoing.  She wants out of the life and sees her opportunity when she discovers the new handyman in their apartment complex.Gina Gershon's Corky is Ms. Fix-It, currently employed at said complex.  Her character is no slouch either.  She's actually sharper than most of the dumb lugs in movies of this kind, circa  the 1940's.  She's recently released from prison and just trying to make a living when Violet approaches her. As they become friendlier, you can see that their relationship won't end at just sex.  Violet makes Corky see the bigger picture and how Violet doesn't see Caesar as fitting in their future.  The women then prepare to make him the fall guy for their plan.You'll find reviews that compare BOUND to PULP FICTION or THE USUAL SUSPECTS or any number of movies made in the 90's.  But to me, this movie brings to mind far more Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles.  The opening scene as the credits and mood music begin&#133; you slowly become aware of a bound body hidden away somewhere dark.  The first scene in which Corky and Violet cross paths is in an elevator.  But they are not alone, Caesar is present as well.  So the viewer is given the opportunity of seeing the two women give each other the once-over via an overhead camera angle.That's not the only trick shot and there's plenty more going on in this film visually, so pay attention.  Watch how telephones are used to great effect more than once.  The color palette is limited, which enhances the intensity of almost every scene.Practically everyone does something with their characters that really brings them out of the stereotypes you might expect in a film like this.  One of the smaller roles, for example, is Micky, played perfectly by John P. Ryan, as an elder mob enforcer.  John Ryan is one of those actors whose name always slips your mind.  He's been in everything from FATAL BEAUTY with Whoopi Goldberg to one of the DEATHWISH films to doing voices for BATMAN, the animated series.  Micky's character emanates power, but is economical in his words and actions.  You'll never confuse Joe Pesci's gangster with John Ryan's!  Micky's character is business-like, yet jaded.  He's seen everything and done everything and yet he has this soft spot for Violet.At the end of the film, he shows how much of a gentleman he is by reigning himself in before his passion for Violet get the better of him.  You almost have to wonder... is he afraid she'll break his heart or cut it out?  I have it on good authority that there were several scenes cut out for fear that Mr. Ryan might steal the thunder of his younger co-workers.   I see that as very likely.  He breaks the mold that all movie mobsters are cold-hearted, callus criminals whose only pleasure is quenching their bloodlust.The movie didn't get the attention in the theaters that it so richly deserved.  I was certain it would be the next CRYING GAME, where each person who saw it told someone else to see it.  Rent this film and you're in for a real treat with a very good thriller.
