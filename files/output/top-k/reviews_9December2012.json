The first one directly involves something I love, that's the journey of the film crew along the tunnel of the subway in construction. There is something surreal about that segment, something that gives it an out-of-this-world quality, while still belonging to our day to day, trivial reality. In my I Vitelloni review I said that Fellini had the capacity of making classics out of the most ordinary situations and this scene proves it. Because there's nothing in such episode that doesn't belong to our everyday reality, yet the feeling is that of a magical journey, something out of a fable. For ex., when the engineer orders to activate the cutter, what comes next doesn't look like a simple mechanical procedure, the drilling of a rock, but as it he had awakened instead a prehistoric monster, a dragon who was sleeping in the depths of the Earth and who starts suddenly breathing, slowly raising on its hinged legs over the men, thrusting its Alien-like jaws towards them. Here's is where Fellini's cinematographic genius appears at its best, as scenes like that one we may have seen many times in the news in TV, in civil engineering films, yet here the thing becomes surreal, straddles the realm of the fantastic. And all those effects, the eerie atmosphere, have been achieved simply with camera angles, lightning, the hovering dust, and the fact that all we hear is the life-like roar of the cutter. But he goes even further, he flirts also with the esoteric even before the crew gets into the 2000-year Roman house, we viewers see what it's inside. Amazingly enough, one of the frescoes contains the uncannily accurate portrait of one of the crew members, who starts at that very moment feeling sick. Coincidence? Point for reincarnation? Lots to ponder there.The second episode I loved is that of the chaos in the highway, specially the night scenes. Compare the incredible vivacity of it, the joyous exuberance, the pulsating life of the city in the midst of the mass of intermingled cars, trucks; in the cacophony of innumerable horns; in all the dirty gestures, smirks, stares flying from car to car and back; in the stoic, angry, perplexed expressions in mirrors, windows, windshields--all that while the camera boom goes up and down, right and left--compare this magnificent chaos with the dead--fish opening of 8½. No way on one hand we got a Fellini in full possession of his means, at the peak of his artistic creativity; on the other, an spiritually dead, practically sterile Fellini.The third episode I love here is the Vatican fashion show. As I've said about Buñuel, fans of Fellini tend to sell him short when it comes to social, political or religious commentary. True, they may be thinking they are just throwing jabs but, as irrepressible artists they are, the end result has always had a much greater reach. Think of Cervantes, who all what he wanted was to ridicule the Harry Potters of his day and who ended up penning instead the greatest literary work in History. That's how I see works where Buñuel or Fellini seem just being mean to the Church, the elites they just can't help going far beyond that, reach new levels. Being neutral in the subject I find a subversive beauty in this scene, even if taken as mockery--not to mention the fact that there's nothing that excludes that the Church actually does some kind of exhibition when studying new trappings for its members. But the beauty of that scene, at least for me, it's in that it escapes the purely derisory and becomes--once again--a surreal experience, to which contributes much the haunting Rota score. The only thing I didn't get was the arrival of the old man with glasses who brings the house down, so to speak. Our Pope is back!. What was the meaning of that, the Second Coming, a return to happier times?.Oh, the movie itself is a itinerary through time of the historic Rome from the 1930s to 1972, all seen through Fellini's eyes and life experience, yet you are never allowed to forget that this is a city thousands of years old. From the initial shot of a stone road sign, to a school principal talking to students about Cesar and crossing the Rubicon himself; to the movies in the matinée; to the ruins of buildings & monuments that liter the landscape, we are being constantly reminded that this isn't just a city that has lived through History but one that also contains History, one that's History itself, the cradle of our Western civilization nothing less. And this is Fellini's homage to it.Fellini Roma has no plot to properly speak of, just vignettes through time & place; the lives of Romans under Fascism, during war&#x97;including the ways they used to have a good time communal diners, Variety shows, movie matinées--up to present day 1972, with the problems usual to urban sprawl pollution, subway construction, hippies and other assorted malcontents. Fellini's cinematography is there and so his weird looking people with their odd behavior. In all it makes for an entertaining film, except for the bordello scenes, which I found rather long and tedious.

So he sneaks up into the hotel room where a beautiful woman named Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) is spying on Goldfinger's opponent with binoculars and talking in a secret microphone to transmit his opponent's cards to him. James Bond takes the microphone and tells him to start losing&#x97;or else. While Goldfinger angrily complies, James Bond decides to make romance with Jill. Afterward, he decides to get a bottle of wine from the refrigerator and gets knocked out from someone else who has entered the room. When he wakes up he finds Jill's nude body painted gold and quite dead. After that he goes back to England and is told to continue to keep an eye on Goldfinger. Anyway, rather than spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is a decent film even though it isn't entirely believable. It boasts one of the more memorably named female villains in Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). It also has one of the better evil henchmen named, Oddjob (Harold Sakata) and one of the coolest cars for James Bond to drive. That said, while I thought the movie was fairly entertaining, I don't consider it to be as good as its two predecessors (Dr. No and From Russia with Love).

Anyway, rather than spoil the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this is a decent film even though it isn't entirely believable. It boasts one of the more memorably named female villains in Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman). It also has one of the better evil henchmen named, Oddjob (Harold Sakata) and one of the coolest cars for James Bond to drive. That said, while I thought the movie was fairly entertaining, I don't consider it to be as good as its two predecessors (Dr. No and From Russia with Love). No doubt other people will disagree and that's fine. But when all is said and done I think we can all agree that most people who enjoy James Bond films will certainly be satisfied with this one.

Why is he considered by so many to be one of the best directors alive? On most days I would say that the sole reason is his mysteriousness. That his many years of inactivity throughout the 80's and 90's, his long intervals between films even after that, and his fondness for seclusion, served to build up his reputation as a cult figure and made the legend that much bigger than the man. It's only during and immediately after watching Days of Heaven that I see the magic Malick has, the one that made him a unique and legendary director even when he only had two films under his belt - a magic that, try as I might, I could never find in any of the films he made afterwords.Days of Heaven was fascinating for me because it's a rare case of a film that I loved but couldn't explain to myself why. In addition to breathtakingly beautiful (Oscar winning) cinematography and superb music (Ennio Morricone's beautiful score skillfully juxtaposed with segments from Saint-Saëns), Days of Heaven has a kind of human warmth that makes it very easy to be absorbed into; paradoxically, it feels very global and very personal at the same time. The fact that it deals with very general emotions and issues of human morality, emphasized by the pretty transparent use of biblical analogies, doesn't detract from the impression that it features real people that the viewer cares about deeply. This despite a sparse script that's pretty weak even when taking its minimalism into account, and an awful performance from Richard Gere (balanced by the much more believable work of Sam Shepard).Days of Heaven is an experience rather than a film, and the experience is so powerful and absorbing that the above mentioned flaws are hardly even noticeable. It's not perfect in every way, but it probably couldn't have been better than it is - it's a film where all the pieces fall into place, including all the seemingly meaningless and random shots of nature - unlike the ones in The New World and Tree of Life, that seemed like they were pasted in just to make it feel like a Malick film. I don't know if it's the fact that he didn't yet feel like he has something to prove, or if the short runtime is a factor, but Days of Heaven feels more personal than most films, and Malick seems to have invested his soul in it, which may explain why he didn't dare release another film for two decades.

It's about Ice Hockey (alwasys a good start), and an up and coming US player who goes over the border to Canada to play having been scouted, in the hope of making a career for himself.

The skating scenes are really good, Swayze throws himself into the physicality of the role in typical fashion. I'm sure some stunt skaters were used but possibly the actors were ice-familiar anyway. Keanu Reeves has a minor (comedic, and with some great one liners) role and was a goalie at school and he plays Heaver, the goalie with the Mustangs. Much of the story is predictable but there's also a few twists, and whilst the acting isn't stunning, Gibb is the weakest link, the skating and the comedy makes this a fab film - especially the bar scene when Dean first joins the team.

I LOVE IT! The acting in the movie is pretty much, beyond explanation with words. Marlon Brando is absolutely a genius of an actor playing Vito, one of my favorite movie characters. Al Pacino did a fantastic job playing the young war hero, Michael Corleone. The only bit of a weakness in terms of acting was Diane Keaton, but it doesn't bother me one little bit.The writing and direction in the movie is superb. Every scene is executed at top notch and this movie is simply a great explanation of what a great movie should be like and clearly defines Francis Coppola as a superb director. The dialogue is entertaining, and unlike the first time, no scene in the movie bored me one little bit. I love the whole movie and honestly, it felt half its running time The characters in the movie are just brilliantly conjured up. They are all so great in their own ways and each have their own personalities making them unique. I love Vito, Michael, Tom, Sonny, Kay, Sollozo, the corrupted cop and everyone, including such minor characters.***SPOILERS*** When Luca Brasi and Sonny were killed off, that left such a strange feeling of emotion in me. Luca Brasi seemed like such a warrior of a man and seeing that Sonny was killed when he was on his way to kill Carlo for his actions against Connie was just heartbreaking.However, no moment in movie history affected me the same way that this scene did and that is the classic scene with Marlon Brando's Vito playing with his grandson in the garden and abruptly, falling dead. It was so beautifully done. In any other movie, this scene would feel so unrealistic that you wouldn't buy it, the fact that a mob leader's final moments were playing with his grandson but here, the scene is executed to the perfect level.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 December 2012","score":"","review":" Remember the Titans Engaging But ExaggeratedEven though the film Remember the Titans, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman was a very emotionally engaging and entertaining movie, the sequence of events that occurred were seemingly exaggerated. The film Remember the Titans was inspired by the actual events that occurred in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, which explores many of the fundamental issues of racism in the 19th century.The film, directed by Boaz Yakin, follows the story of Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), an African American who comes to T.C Williams High School to coach the T.C. William's football team, the Titans. Racially divided, Herman Boone faces difficulty in getting the boys on his team to connect with each other, and also faces many instances of conflict with his white assistant coach, Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who had previously been the head coach. After going to training camp together and forcing the African American boys and white boys to further integrate and get to know each other, eventually the team learns to come together despite the racial divide that is still present in their town, Alexandria, Virginia. As the movie progresses, the bond between the players of both races develop and grow stronger, despite the initial hostility that plagued both the blacks and whites on the team. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst also star in the film, playing the characters Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier, respectively. Both characters play important roles in the film, leading and setting an example of the strong relationship that can be developed regardless of skin color. Initially facing a lot of discrimination from other teams, parents, and townspeople, together the Titans eventually start to change the views of the common people through football, in which they continue to have an unbelievable season. The film Remember the Titans was overall a very well made drama that at the same time also informed viewers of the issue that surrounded that time period. Through out the film, you begin to gain a great love for football after seeing how it affectively brings together the whites and African Americans in the movie. Furthermore the choice of music further enhanced the emotional connection with the film while also exaggerating it to make it more amusing. An example being where the song Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terell was played in a scene where everyone was joyfully singing together in the locker rooms. The storyline seemed well developed and was easy to follow, always leaving the viewer interested and engaged with the film. However, in comparison to how the events actually occurred, the screenplay did seem exaggerated and in some cases, the characters misrepresented. For example, near the beginning of the film, on the street you see angry citizens, both black and white, ready to attack each other while standing on the opposite side of the street, divided by only a few policemen. Even though at that time there was a lot of racial tension, the film did over exaggerate the conditions.

In the film, T.C Williams High School is seen as the first high school in their championship tournament to fully integrate black and whites together in 1971. However in reality, T.C Williams High School saw the integration of white and black students in 1965 where at that point, other schools had also began to integrate sports teams and classes as well.

All in all, the film Remember the Titans is a well-produced film that keeps you emotionally engaged through the events that occur and the characters that are portrayed. Remember the Titans is definitely a movie to watch that will leave you satisfied, but should also be known that in some cases, the events that occurred are slightly exaggerated and inaccurate.

The film Remember the Titans was inspired by the actual events that occurred in Alexandria, Virginia in 1971, which explores many of the fundamental issues of racism in the 19th century.The film, directed by Boaz Yakin, follows the story of Herman Boone (played by Denzel Washington), an African American who comes to T.C Williams High School to coach the T.C. William's football team, the Titans. Racially divided, Herman Boone faces difficulty in getting the boys on his team to connect with each other, and also faces many instances of conflict with his white assistant coach, Bill Yoast (played by Will Patton), who had previously been the head coach. After going to training camp together and forcing the African American boys and white boys to further integrate and get to know each other, eventually the team learns to come together despite the racial divide that is still present in their town, Alexandria, Virginia. As the movie progresses, the bond between the players of both races develop and grow stronger, despite the initial hostility that plagued both the blacks and whites on the team. Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst also star in the film, playing the characters Julius Campbell and Gerry Bertier, respectively. Both characters play important roles in the film, leading and setting an example of the strong relationship that can be developed regardless of skin color. Initially facing a lot of discrimination from other teams, parents, and townspeople, together the Titans eventually start to change the views of the common people through football, in which they continue to have an unbelievable season. The film Remember the Titans was overall a very well made drama that at the same time also informed viewers of the issue that surrounded that time period. Through out the film, you begin to gain a great love for football after seeing how it affectively brings together the whites and African Americans in the movie. Furthermore the choice of music further enhanced the emotional connection with the film while also exaggerating it to make it more amusing. An example being where the song Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terell was played in a scene where everyone was joyfully singing together in the locker rooms. The storyline seemed well developed and was easy to follow, always leaving the viewer interested and engaged with the film. However, in comparison to how the events actually occurred, the screenplay did seem exaggerated and in some cases, the characters misrepresented. For example, near the beginning of the film, on the street you see angry citizens, both black and white, ready to attack each other while standing on the opposite side of the street, divided by only a few policemen. Even though at that time there was a lot of racial tension, the film did over exaggerate the conditions.

For me, I've never seen it before. Heard of it; seen short clips of it; but never have I sat down and watched it straight through from beginning to end. Having now done that I can understand why it's such a beloved movie to so many people. It isn't necessarily a Christmas\/holiday movie. The basic message would work at any time of the year; it just happens to be set (in its climax anyway) on Christmas Eve. And the message it presents is an important one that everyone needs to hear from time to time, in a world where it's so easy to feel discouraged every person's life counts. Everyone makes a difference. That's the point here, and it's well made. The movie revolves around George Bailey (James Stewart.) George starts out as a kid with big dreams of escaping his hum-drum (to him) home town of Bedfork Park and seeing the world. But it never works out. He ends up running the small savings & loan operation his father started, while his brother and his friends all seem to go on to bigger and better things - becoming heroes; becoming famous; becoming rich. George has a good life. He's married to a woman he loves (Donna Reed) and he has great kids and a lot of friends, but it just isn't what he always wanted. It's not completely satisfying for him. Eventually it all falls apart when the local ruthless banker (Lionel Barrymore) comes up with a way of bringing him down. With everything apparently out of control, George decides to kill himself, only to be rescued by the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows him what Bedford Park would be like if he had never existed - and it's not pretty.The story isn't complicated. It's simple and straightforward. Everybody does a good job in it. Personally, I thought there was perhaps a little too much emphasis on George's life and what brought him to the brink of suicide, and maybe not quite enough emphasis on George being confronted by the consequences of his non-existence. (And, in the alternative timeline, Bert the cop opening fire on George in the street seemed a bit - shall we say - excessive; not to mention dangerous!) Perhaps the opening, with God and the angels talking to each other as stars and other heavenly bodies was a bit too cute, but it's all within the expected standards of 1946. It is a nice movie, and it does have a nice message. Your life does make a difference to a lot of people - probably more than you know, so be satisfied with it and rejoice in what you have.

It still is, to an extent. But to tell the truth, more than 40 years after its release, the definition of horror, in cinema, has unquestionably changed greatly, and, in these days, not having, as it does, any over-the-top gore or jump moments, Rosemary's Baby may no longer scare.In fact, if I found anything really unnerving in the film, it was that expression, on the face of Mia Farrow transcendentally evoking Rosemary, in the final 2 minutes. It made me grateful that the film ended there, without showing what followed thereafter ...For, as Polanski tells the story, we already know, or at least have guessed, about halfway through the film, all about Rosemary's baby, even when it is still in utero, though Rosemary herself may not. And THAT is where the supreme artistry of the film lies. Horrifying though it may not be any more, it still is chilling, and chilling to the core, as the fate of Rosemary herself always remains entirely unknown, till the very end. And that is also why the ambiguity in Mia Farrow's parting expression remains so disturbing, and stays etched in the memory much after the film itself has ended.I cannot figure out, for the life of me, why Mia Farrow did not get an Academy Award for her performance. Ruth Gordon did, of course, for playing the perfect foil, as Minnie Castavetes, to Mia's Rosemary. Mia's indecisions, her fear, her abject terror at the threat she perceives to the life of her unborn child, far transcend the limits of the script, and stamp themselves indelibly on the psyche. It is truly a bravura effort, and carries the character to a level where Mia and Rosemary become entirely indistinguishable. To say the least, it can serve as a textbook example for anyone who wants to learn what acting is all about.Equally inspired - if not, however, equally challenging - are, unquestionably, the performances of Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer as Minnie and Roman Castevet. I particularly liked the sly ambivalence with which Blakmer delineates his character, so starkly in contrast to his wife's menacingly overbearing effervescence.The premise of the film is undoubtedly far-fetched and difficult to believe or digest, and, in the hands of a less inspired cast, may have been reduced to B-grade phatasmagoria. As it is, however, as conceived and created by Polanski and as executed by Farrow, Gordon and Blackmer, it is nothing short of art on celluloid.Rewarding and memorably disturbing viewing, more than 40 years after it was made.

I dated Viet Nam vets who one even to this day, have nightmares and flashbacks of the carnage they experienced. One who is 61 years old, was spat on when he returned from the war by a anti-war college student, and called a baby killer. I didn't watch this movie when it came out, because I heard it was an authentic portrayal of the war, and it was. It was gripping, well acted and disturbing. Just like I knew it would be. The acting was top notched. The scarred bodies and psyches of the soldiers was authentic. The effect was disturbing. I fight back the tears as I write this. I score it a 9 only because I did not watch the whole film. I think about how only recently the President finally welcomed these boys home, 37 years after the fall of Saigon.
