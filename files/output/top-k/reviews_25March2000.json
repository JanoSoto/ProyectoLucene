I was disappointed that the movie suggested a Romeo & Juliet type of love story, but their romance is more like a fun friendship.  I guess Asian males are not allowed to have a serious love relationship in American movies.  Oh well.This movie is fun with cartoon type of characters with humor and comical scenarios.

However, it seems that is all she is good at.  Her acting skills do not go beyond her aesthetic qualities, making for an extremely dull character.  Additionally, it didn't help that she was given lines that sounded more like cliches than actual sentences, or that her character was written as completely wishy-washy.  All of that said, add in two good looking guys who had even less personality, a small town in Western Massachusetts (which was actually filmed in Minnesota) and an obligatory kissing-in-the-rain scene, and you have the disaster that is `Here on Earth.'Perhaps the underlying problem of the movie is that the plot was not only one big cliche,but a cliche stolen from countless other movies.  Sobieski plays Samantha, a recent high school graduate with no money who dreams of attending medical school.  For most of high school, she has been dating her lifelong best friend, Jasper (Josh Hartnett).  Just as they are about to carve their names into the `lover's wall' in her family's restaurant, rich kid Kelley (Chris Klein) swoops into town and steals Sam's heart.  Obviously, Jasper and Kelley don't get along well, which is very unfortunate considering that they are forced to live together after they burn down Sam's restaurant during a drag race.  Unfortunately, the audience is then forced to sit through about an hour of Sam's developing relationship with Kelley, while she strings Jasper along because she doesn't have the guts to tell him she's moved on.Although this has the potential to be a heartwarming love story, it is ruined by the sappy and contrived dialogue.  It felt as though writer Michael Seitzman just jotted down every single pick up line he had ever tried and failed at, and then decided that even though they failed in real life, they might work in the movies.  As a result, the audience was forced to sit through such conversations as Kelly asking Sam (referring to her father), `Do you always bring the sheriff on dates?' to which she replies (with about as much enthusiasm as a rock), `Not if I'm the one breaking the law.' Yawn.  A particularly excruciating moment was when the couple, after running through a sprawling meadow, shares an intimate moment reminiscent of Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in Armageddon. After Kelley names all of Sam's body parts after states, he finally calls her lips Massachusetts, to which she replies, `Massachusetts welcomes you.' Amused yet? That's not all.  In an effort to either move the audience, or make us laugh even harder (it was hard to tell by this point), Sam discovers she has terminal illness Ã  la Love Story.  Note to director Mark Piznarski Although this simple plot device worked for Love Story  thirty years ago, that kind of  sappiness just doesn't cut it when your cast can barely muster up any kind of emotion.Needless to say, the audience was in hysterics (with laughter) by the end.   Because of this instinct to just laugh at it, the movie was enjoyable in that guilty pleasure, Lifetime movie kind of way.  Plus, it had that pretty song with that guy from 98 Degrees...

She was brilliant, for example, with Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting and John Cusack in Grosse Pointe Blank.Even those performances, however, do not evoke the tremendous amount of charm Driver has in Return to Me.In this heart-warming movie, Driver plays Grace, a woman who has been given a heart transplant and is self-conscious about dating. However, sparks fly when she meets Bob (David Duchovny), whose wife died a year prior. Tension builds, however, because of Grace's reluctance to tell Bob about the heart transplant and because - unbeknownst to either of them - her new heart came from Bob's wife.Driver and Duchovny have chemistry that melts the screen. Then again, whoever is on the screen with Driver seems perfectly matched, including Carroll O'Connor who plays her grandfather and Bonnie Hunt who plays her best friend.Hunt also makes her directoral debut with the film, which actually does not seem put together very well. She makes some odd choices in developing the story, especially in the beginning when the wife of Duchovny's character dies. Instead of some build up to the fatal car accident, the scene shifts from the husband and wife dancing to the husband walking by her as she is wheeled to an emergency room.Indeed, the scene splitting in the film seems awkward and haphazard. The storyline is obvious to the viewer within minutes of the movie, but is still treated as a surprise when actually spelled out. But what Hunt lacks in a directing effort, she more than makes up for in her performance and in co-writing a wonderfully personable script. So much of the character in this film is created by cute little one-line jokes that seem almost out-of-place in a movie. In fact, those jokes make the dialogue seem as if it could actually be delivered in real life.Similarly, other small details give the film a credibility uncommon with most Hollywood productions. The timing with which actors deliver lines is realistic - people talk over each other and there are missing beats after humorous lines. The result is often some missed dialogue - either because too many characters are talking or because the audience is laughing - but there's also a feeling as if you're listening to someone's conversation instead of watching a movie.This is obviously an actor's movie. While the film might have benefited from a more standard line of direction, Hunt should be applauded for putting the strong script in the hands of the actors for interpretation. Many directors would have streamlined the movie to the degree that it would lose its personal feel.It's arguable that the movie is predictable and the story doesn't move much.

The problem is, by the end of the film, director Curtis Hanson and writer Steve Kloves seem to think they've made such a statement, when really all they've given us is two dour, rather dramatically inert hours with a college professor who has, to put it mildly, problems.The prof's name is Grady Tripp, and he's got a lot on his plate.  His third wife has just left him, and the married chancellor of his college has just admitted to him that she's pregnant with his baby.  On top of that, his editor is coming to town to see his latest book...a 2000+ page monstrosity that Grady hasn't been able to trim anything from, and which has been seven years in the making, a period of time that has made people start to speculate about whether old Tripp was a flash in the pan.  On top of THAT, Grady has to contend with James Leer, an immensely gifted and deeply troubled student who starts to get Grady to start questioning his own commitment to his art.  And ON TOP OF THAT, he's stuck driving around in a possibly stolen (?) car with a dead dog in the trunk, a transvestite in the back, and Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket being worn by a pregnant waitress in the driver's seat.  Get the picture?  Wonder Boys is so overstuffed with quirky characters and goofy plot conceits that it never really focuses its energies enough to say something about its main plot thrust, which is the dilemma of a man trapped in the grip of out-of-control creativity.  It's an interesting spin on the idea of writer's block, but a spin is all it becomes, and not a true hook to turn the plot in interesting or inventive ways.  I don't know what made Grady Tripp such a unfocused sad sack, or what made James Leer such a tortured, creepy genius.  I wanted to know, though, and that is the film's failing. It's almost shocking that the same Curtis Hanson who gave us the vital, fire-breathing L.A. Confidential was responsible for this picture, which is drenched in dark, muted visual melancholy and never seems to build any kind of momentum or dramatic energy.  It all comes off as curiously meandering and rather sluggish; one wonders what Hanson and his screenwriter, Steve Kloves, found in the original Michael Chabon novel that made them want to film it if this is what they came away with.  The Ellroy novel had passion, fire, trickiness.  This story is a wet dishrag.The film is somewhat redeemed by some decent performances.  Michael Douglas is nicely understated as Grady, and Frances McDormand has some affecting moments as the chancellor grappling with her feelings for her star professor.  Tobey Maguire is not bad, considering he's turning in the same performance he's given in every single film he's been in.  Katie Holmes is stuck with a  generally purposeless character, though her beautiful face is one of the film's saving graces.  The most fun to be had here is with Robert Downey Jr.'s impish, pan-sexual editor.  He gives the film a much-needed satirical distance from its own material, and his right angles to the preciousness provide a charge sorely lacking from the rest of the film.It was somewhat interesting to see the usage of my home town of Pittsburgh, though the city's most striking landmarks are not featured as prominently as they were in last year's Inspector Gadget.  Of course, I might have felt better about it if IT HADN'T HAPPENED AGAIN.  Everyone who reads my reviews on a regular basis will know what's coming next.

On top of that, his editor is coming to town to see his latest book...a 2000+ page monstrosity that Grady hasn't been able to trim anything from, and which has been seven years in the making, a period of time that has made people start to speculate about whether old Tripp was a flash in the pan.  On top of THAT, Grady has to contend with James Leer, an immensely gifted and deeply troubled student who starts to get Grady to start questioning his own commitment to his art.  And ON TOP OF THAT, he's stuck driving around in a possibly stolen (?) car with a dead dog in the trunk, a transvestite in the back, and Marilyn Monroe's wedding jacket being worn by a pregnant waitress in the driver's seat.  Get the picture?  Wonder Boys is so overstuffed with quirky characters and goofy plot conceits that it never really focuses its energies enough to say something about its main plot thrust, which is the dilemma of a man trapped in the grip of out-of-control creativity.  It's an interesting spin on the idea of writer's block, but a spin is all it becomes, and not a true hook to turn the plot in interesting or inventive ways.  I don't know what made Grady Tripp such a unfocused sad sack, or what made James Leer such a tortured, creepy genius.  I wanted to know, though, and that is the film's failing. It's almost shocking that the same Curtis Hanson who gave us the vital, fire-breathing L.A. Confidential was responsible for this picture, which is drenched in dark, muted visual melancholy and never seems to build any kind of momentum or dramatic energy.  It all comes off as curiously meandering and rather sluggish; one wonders what Hanson and his screenwriter, Steve Kloves, found in the original Michael Chabon novel that made them want to film it if this is what they came away with.  The Ellroy novel had passion, fire, trickiness.  This story is a wet dishrag.The film is somewhat redeemed by some decent performances.  Michael Douglas is nicely understated as Grady, and Frances McDormand has some affecting moments as the chancellor grappling with her feelings for her star professor.  Tobey Maguire is not bad, considering he's turning in the same performance he's given in every single film he's been in.  Katie Holmes is stuck with a  generally purposeless character, though her beautiful face is one of the film's saving graces.  The most fun to be had here is with Robert Downey Jr.'s impish, pan-sexual editor.  He gives the film a much-needed satirical distance from its own material, and his right angles to the preciousness provide a charge sorely lacking from the rest of the film.It was somewhat interesting to see the usage of my home town of Pittsburgh, though the city's most striking landmarks are not featured as prominently as they were in last year's Inspector Gadget.  Of course, I might have felt better about it if IT HADN'T HAPPENED AGAIN.  Everyone who reads my reviews on a regular basis will know what's coming next.  Hanson and his cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, are going on my Christmas list.  Hey, Paramount, if you hadn't spent so much to get Douglas, you might have been able to afford a TRIPOD!  Except for very specific dramatic circumstances, hand-held camera does not work.  Directors take note!Wonder Boys has been the best-reviewed film of the new year, probably because it's the only one with any real ambition and even an attempt at an underlying theme.  But that theme stays lying under, and Hanson really doesn't seem to be working overtime to excavate it for us.

That manifestation of mediocrity and anonymity in this, our post-industrial society.Where else but in a typical SFR (single-family residential) nestled on a typical tree-lined street in a typical North American suburb can we find someone like Lester Burnham?Where else can the inspiration be found for a movie as ironically sublime as American Beauty?Burnham is a 42-year-old man who makes a living writing promotional material for a magazine that faces downsizing thanks to the excesses of his superiors.He is married to Carolyn Burnham, a woman maniacally devoted to making it big in local real estate, and they have a daughter, Jane, who feels about as significant as plankton floating about the briny deep and about as attractive as a rusty Ford Pinto.About the only thing that keeps this family together is Burnham's self-loathing and the mutual hatred heaped upon him by the two women in the house.We're talking about a guy, after all, who starts the morning by masturbating in the shower. `This is the high point of my day,' he says. `It's all downhill from here.'It's pretty obvious that the Burnhams have been somewhat dysfunctional for a few years now. And there's no doubt that Lester is struggling with a mid-life crisis, one that is expressed in more than buying a sports car.Things come to a head when Lester develops a lusty obsession for his daughter's best friend, replete with life-like dreams of seduction as she lies in a bath of rose petals. Now Jane has to worry about dear old dad `spraying himself' whenever she brings a friend home.Meanwhile, Mom has started playing around behind Dad's back with a smooth yet snake-like super salesman, Buddy Kane. And Jane must come to terms with a rather unique boy next door, when some new neighbours move in.When Ricky Fitts, the son of a homophobic military man and a robotically devoted mother, isn't dealing marijuana to people like Lester, he's video taping anything and everything that remotely interests him, and he's developing enough footage of Jane to fill the vault at MGM. Needless to say Jane is a little freaked about this headcase with an eye for the visual.As you've probably guessed, the humour can be pretty black in this movie. Indeed, it may not be for everyone, but any accusations that this movie is nothing better than mean and cynical are simply unfounded.Instead, taking in American Dream is like biting into the fruit of knowledge (a.k.a. the apple), the edgy initial sting is followed by a bitter sweet aftertaste.Matters are most assuredly helped by the casting of Kevin Spacey, the kind of middle-aged guy that every middle-aged guy would like to be, in the lead role. And Annette Bening pulls no punches as the self-centred career woman whose need to prove self-worth knows no bounds.Indeed, everyone in this movie fits the bill perfectly, right down to the manager of the local Smiley Burger (Dennis Anderson) that Lester turns to for a job after he more than refuses to toe the company line.In its own way, American Beauty is a humourous tale about a man who finally decides to come to account for his `silly little life' on his own terms regardless of what that means in appearances. And while the price is heavy, Lester comes out a true hero.As ironically uplifting as it is caustic and acerbic, American Beauty, to use the clichÃ© of enthralled reviewers everywhere, is a must-see movie -- especially for anyone who has acquired enough wisdom to know that no matter how old you are, there's plenty of life left that's worth living, and plenty of growing up still left to do along the way.

I don't see anything about Lester and Carolyn Burnam that is different from the various frustrated husband and wife roles that have come before.  The film's only saving grace is Wes Bentley and the concept of the intensity of life's beauty.  But that concept only surfaces a couple of times in the movie and is only *talked about* by the characters.  It is never supported by any events or by any of the characters.  It's as if American Beauty was just a very mediocre story about an unhappy family, and somehow the writer managed to throw in a very 'deep' quote.  Perhaps that plastic bag floating in the wind deserves the Best Actor nod - it was the only figure that really inspired. ","genre":"Drama"}]
