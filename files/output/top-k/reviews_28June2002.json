First of all Max von Sydow is my favorite actor, and without any bias I can say that his performance was easily the best in the film next to Samantha Morton's. Secondly, I should tell you that I think A.I. was a terrible mess, and upon first and second viewing of Minority Report I thought the ending was too cliched and happy, not to mention too rushed and full of plot holes. However I, and others I saw it with can now say that Spielberg pulled a Kubrick on us. It is now clear and obvious to me that everything after John entered containment was nothing more than a fabrication in his mind. Think about it. First we already know that John has basically figured out that Burgess was behind the murders, seeing how Burgess was the only other to know about the Minority Reports and he helped to pioneer the interface, not only that but he is the only one with the access and the knowhow to setup the murders so brilliantly and wipe out all the minority reports that should have been stored in containment. Secondly, Gideon tells John as he is being put into containment that everyone who goes in sees their whole life flash before their eyes and its like all your dreams come true. Thirdly, everyone's acting up to this point had been very detailed and impressive, but when the fabrication begins, its almost like the acting was purposefully contrived and the tone of the film changes completely as if it were just one desperate man's hopes and dreams and speculation of how things should have gone. Also Burgess's slip of the tongue with Lara would not have happened, we have already become aware that he is too smart to start becoming so dumb near the end. And Lara using the eyeball after John's containment, John was able to use his eyes to get in earlier because he had not actually committed the murder yet, so he wasn't officially stamped convict, but afterward she obviously would not be able to use them. Burgess killing himself at the end, is completely out of character, he has already killed 2 innocents that we know of, and covered up at least a dozen more just to protect Precrime, if this situation wasn't a dream he still would have killed John. Burgess having the Minority Report on himself at the end is not in tune with the Burgess we got to know earlier. I could go on, and on about the subtle, but obviously intentional plot holes and strange acting, and strange character arcs that Spielberg puts in the end. The only reason could be that this is a dream sequence. John is only seeing what he wants to see, he is speculating about what happened and he probably has most of it right except for the part where he think that everything is all right now, nothing is all right, Burgess did get away with it, John is still imprisoned. This is a brilliant turn for Spielberg. Just like the flashing sign that said exactly that (you only see what you want to see) in the mall where Anderton and Agatha were running from the precrime officers. In retrospect, this film is so Blade-Runner esque. The reason I say that this is a Kubrickian touch, and in my opinion the true definitive homage to Kubrick, is that there is no blatant touch, or hint or explanation that this was a dream sequence, not like in Vanilla Sky, only the small intentional inconsistencies and change in tone that prove this to be true. I think that when people really start to notice this and ultimately realize that this was a dream sequence, they will see just how dark and bleak and cynical the ending really was. Watch the film again, really pay attention and you will see what I mean.

There were also a lot of great ideas concerning what advertising might become in the next few decades. But the movie just loses its focus within the first half hour. Let's not forget that this is based on a SHORT STORY, not a novel. At more than two and a half hours, the movie takes longer to watch than the story does to read. Why? Spielberg Padding.

Why? For some reason, directors think they can have some flashy binoculars and the words 'Zurich, Switzerland' in a computer-style type-written font, and that all us idiots in the world will sigh 'ooooh...cool'. Well not this idiot. Oh, and I haven't even gotten onto the ridiculous plot-holes yet.The premise of the movie sounded good. However, you have to suspend disbelief immediately when you're supposed to believe that Bourne didn't drown in the water in the beginning. I'll let that go though and move on... When we finally have Bourne on his feet, we're rewarded by some relatively solid acting. Matt Damon is a far superior and more believable actor than Ben Affleck, who was pretty unconvincing in The Sum of All Fears, out around the same time as Bourne. Anyway, Damon does a decent job, as does Franka Potente, who hasn't really done anything great since Blow and Run Lola Run - which was superb. Julia Stiles should be ashamed of herself for taking such a nothing part, and I won't any further mention of her during this review. Clive Owen does a pretty suave job as a government hired assassin, and I think we'll see a lot more of him in the future. 007 perhaps? Anyway, to the meat of the review - the terrible plot holes. Stop reading here if you haven't see the movie! Firstly, why exactly is it that the CIA want Bourne dead? Why? It makes absolutely no sense! Wombosi was killed afterwards, and so surely they just need to contact Bourne and sort out the whole amnesia thing. But no! Why not kill Bourne? No wait! I think I figured out why the CIA wanted to kill him! - because the director thought it would make a good movie and that hopefully movie-goers wouldn't notice! Genius!       As soon as we see Potente arguing at the American Embassy, you know she's going to be a part of the movie. How wonderfully coincidental that she just happens to be outside with a 'soon to be Porsche style' Mini when Damon makes his escape. How handy. Cliché-orama. And what about that red bag? Damon leaves it at the station in the locker, yet apparently never picks it up again. How then does he happen to have it back when they're shacked up at Eamon's house? The point of leaving it at the station was what, pray tell? That might not be too ridiculous, but you'd think the director could at least understand time zones whilst making the movie. 'Meet me in Paris at 5.30pm today' says Bourne, in one scene. We then see the plane, quite clearly not a Concorde - at the airport. There's no possible way the CIA agent could have made it to Paris at that time. You could just say I'm being picky, but it just irked me the second that scene graced the screen. Sigh (number 1 of many). Heck...watch the movie. You'll probably pick up far more instances than me in regards to the plot holes.In regards to the action, of which there was little, - it was pretty irritating. There was once nice car chase, which has been likened to Ronin's, but it's not in the same league. Firstly, Bourne is driving a Mini. Secondly...well..is there need for one? It did however amuse me when a policeman on a bike tries to...well...ram the car, or something. I couldn't quite figure out that part. Car vs bike. I wonder who will win.In regards to the Bourne fight scenes, they were astonishingly poorly shot. The camera kept moving in different directions. It hurt the eyes to watch. It was a real mess. I could go on, but I won't. I feel like this review is written as badly as the movie was directed. If you've seen the movie already, you'll know what I mean, and if you're about to see the movie, you'll soon know what I mean. Oh, and the ending. Can we say 'cliché' any more times?Sigh.

Why? For some reason, directors think they can have some flashy binoculars and the words 'Zurich, Switzerland' in a computer-style type-written font, and that all us idiots in the world will sigh 'ooooh...cool'. Well not this idiot. Oh, and I haven't even gotten onto the ridiculous plot-holes yet.The premise of the movie sounded good. However, you have to suspend disbelief immediately when you're supposed to believe that Bourne didn't drown in the water in the beginning. I'll let that go though and move on... When we finally have Bourne on his feet, we're rewarded by some relatively solid acting. Matt Damon is a far superior and more believable actor than Ben Affleck, who was pretty unconvincing in The Sum of All Fears, out around the same time as Bourne. Anyway, Damon does a decent job, as does Franka Potente, who hasn't really done anything great since Blow and Run Lola Run - which was superb. Julia Stiles should be ashamed of herself for taking such a nothing part, and I won't any further mention of her during this review. Clive Owen does a pretty suave job as a government hired assassin, and I think we'll see a lot more of him in the future. 007 perhaps? Anyway, to the meat of the review - the terrible plot holes. Stop reading here if you haven't see the movie! Firstly, why exactly is it that the CIA want Bourne dead? Why? It makes absolutely no sense! Wombosi was killed afterwards, and so surely they just need to contact Bourne and sort out the whole amnesia thing. But no! Why not kill Bourne? No wait! I think I figured out why the CIA wanted to kill him! - because the director thought it would make a good movie and that hopefully movie-goers wouldn't notice! Genius!       As soon as we see Potente arguing at the American Embassy, you know she's going to be a part of the movie. How wonderfully coincidental that she just happens to be outside with a 'soon to be Porsche style' Mini when Damon makes his escape. How handy. Cliché-orama. And what about that red bag? Damon leaves it at the station in the locker, yet apparently never picks it up again. How then does he happen to have it back when they're shacked up at Eamon's house? The point of leaving it at the station was what, pray tell? That might not be too ridiculous, but you'd think the director could at least understand time zones whilst making the movie. 'Meet me in Paris at 5.30pm today' says Bourne, in one scene. We then see the plane, quite clearly not a Concorde - at the airport. There's no possible way the CIA agent could have made it to Paris at that time. You could just say I'm being picky, but it just irked me the second that scene graced the screen. Sigh (number 1 of many). Heck...watch the movie. You'll probably pick up far more instances than me in regards to the plot holes.In regards to the action, of which there was little, - it was pretty irritating. There was once nice car chase, which has been likened to Ronin's, but it's not in the same league. Firstly, Bourne is driving a Mini. Secondly...well..is there need for one? It did however amuse me when a policeman on a bike tries to...well...ram the car, or something. I couldn't quite figure out that part. Car vs bike.

I'd only seen Matt Damon in one or two forgettable supporting roles before and thought of him as belonging to a recently minted crop of glamorous heart throbs like Brad Pitt, Leonard DaCaprio and Keanu Reeves, guys who seem to bring little presence to the screen. But I was wrong about Damon, at least as far as The Talented Mr. Ripley is concerned. He turns in a subtle and nuanced performance. And he LOOKS the part in a well-bred sort of way but with a sinisterly twisted mouth, a face as handsome and as meaningless as the full moon. Yes, in his appearance, including his grooming, he could easily pass for an old-breed Princetonian, the kind who belongs to a self-defined superior WASP elite, the sort ground out by Princeton, a factory for the uptrodden, a few generations ago, who know they're better than others and enjoy letting others know about it -- like Dicky here, or Richard Brookheiser at the so-called Free Press in actual life. Don't mean to put Old Nassau down too much. I was a proctor there.I was expecting a kind of thriller along the lines of Strangers on a Train, basically a mystery with character development built into it. There's little mystery here, except whether Ripley, a remorseless con man, is going to get away with it. I also expected him to enter the narrative deliberately committed to grabbing with both hands for every opportunity for exploitation and self-advancement that came within reach. Instead he is drawn into the narrative quite by accident. And, although he shows an early ability to adapt to ambiguous situations, he doesn't seem to have planned out very much. The entire story is more or less one accident after another. Ripley switches identities and keeps running into people who know him under different names in the most unlikely places. A bit more of that sort of thing, played for laughs, and we'd almost have Mrs. Doubtfire redux.Two other observations. The ambiance of Italy in the mid-1950s is gotten down pat. It's winter, and in Mediterranean climates this is the rainy season, so the streets are often slick and the shadows deep and disturbing. No sunny vistas here. And we get the grand tour of Italy -- the Spanish steps, the fountain of Trevi, the grand canal, somebody walking through a horde of pigeons in St. Mark's Square. Even the grooming is accurate. Horn-rimmed glasses, and long hair conservatively parted on the side. (That's accurate for Europe, anyhow. Americans had shorter hair at the time, with lots of crew cuts.) The background music includes Mozart but is mainly jazz, as it was in Europe at the time.The second observation. Some reviews have referred to a gay subtheme. I don't see anything sub about it. Ripley is clearly homosexual -- I'm dying to call him polymorphously perverse! -- or at least bisexual, like the author of the novel on which the story is based. Ripley's last affair is openly with a gay man. And there are homoerotic incidents and references slipped in whether they belong there or not. In a public square, one man sits spread legged across another's thighs and caresses his hair. Right. Freddy Miles, the vilest of the class snobs, walks around limp wristed (literally) and drips with catty sarcasm.Patricia Highsmith's novel, which gave Hitchcock Strangers on a Train, had no mind-numbing literary qualities.

Every time I revisit it I like it more.  The basic story has Robin and Little John, the nucleus of Sherwood Forest's storied Merry Men, winding up their prolonged tour of duty in the Crusades, disillusioned with the holy war and with the King to whom they pledged undying loyalty. The real focus of the film kicks in once the two return to England, after the death of King Richard.The movie's real strength, I think, is in its actors -- the thing is packed to the rim with fine actors the likes of Sean Connery, Audrey Hepburn, Richard Harris, Denholm Elliot, Ronnie Barker, Robert Shaw, and more. Sean Connery's one of those actors, like Gene Hackman and a few others, who make even a dreary or substandard movie eminently watchable.  He's the perfect Robin Hood, believe it or not, albeit a Robin Hood slightly more realistically heroic and flawed than usually presented.  This Robin is recognizable as the Robin of myth but the movie's storyline makes it plain that he was a man mythologized beyond his capabilities by a populace that needed a hero larger than any one man's life.  I like that.  His constant companion, Little John, is similarly heroic but neither is a fool and the story profits for revealing their humanity and taking a little of the impossibly heroic gloss off the legend.  Also integral to the concept of this movie is that 20 years have passed since the events immortalized in literature and later in the movies, and some of the characters' mutterings make it clear that they're feeling the passage of time quite intensely.Although the film's title promises a focus on Robin and Marion, it's really a 'boys' film,' and the real chemistry remains squarely between Robin and John, with the next most developed and complex relationship being that between Robin and the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Marion runs a distant third. That's not to say that Audrey Hepburn isn't great in her role -- it's hard to imagine a better Marion, actually -- it's just that the real focus of the story (as I see it) is on the fatal triangle between the two former outlaws and their old nemesis.The entire cast does their job spectacularly.  Richard Harris is great as a bombastic, out-of-control, psychopath version of Richard the Lionhearted. This Richard's a vain, self-centered murderer who is undoubtedly as brave and rugged as legend would have it but who perhaps believes too strongly in his divine right to do whatever the heck he wants.  Richard Harris' over-the-top performance is perfect for his role and generates some comic elements, even under the direst of circumstances.  The same's true of the entire movie -- it's laced with humor, especially in the dynamic between Robin and John, though one of my favorite bits goes like thisMarion - You never wroteRobin - I don't know howThis film's not one that goes for belly-laugh comedy, but a sense of humor is apparent throughout.  Even the scene in which Robin and John escape over the walls of the Sheriff's castle -- convincing because it's heroic, daring, and all the rest of it and yet is not as acrobatic and faultless an escape as it would have been in any other Robin Hood film -- ends with a bit of humor.  In this movie you even get to see Sean Connery in a ridiculous hat.Sean Connery's deadpan delivery, sardonic expression, and that perpetual twinkle in his eye are all at full potency in this film and some of the expressions on his face, alone, will cause you to crack a smile.  Like I said, he's the perfect Robin Hood, 20 years on.  The voice doesn't hurt, either.  Hood...Robin Hood.The dude who plays King John -- if Richard is Lionheart then John is the Cowardly Lion -- is convincing as an effete incompetent.  Actually, truth be told, right down to the way he looks this character reminds me of George W. Bush, and he's similarly out of his depth with the affairs of state.Robert Shaw perfectly captures the Sheriff in an understated performance that turns what is usually a one-dimensional 'villain' role into something rather more interesting.  I don't know whether the passage of time has mellowed this film's version of the Sheriff or if the film's internal history would have him having always been that way, but Shaw actually plays a fairly sympathetic 'bad guy,' one who obviously has far greater empathy for Robin than for his peers and the simpering new king's nobles.  He's actually, as played in this film, pretty much a 'good guy.'  He seems a decent man who is doing his job, the long-standing feud with Robin being evident but not as vicious as normally played -- this is even evident in the final duel, that features two over-the-hill warriors flailing about in the heavy garb and with the heavy weapons of the time.  The Sheriff's an honorable man in this iteration, a definite departure from the Robin Hood movies that I remember seeing in my youth, and the film's infinitely better for this characterization.The ending's a bit of a downer, mainly because I wanted he and Marion (and the others) to live to become even older codgers, but it's consistent with the rest of the film, is probably (as Robin says) better this way, and ties in neatly with the original tale.  In all, this is a classic movie and I think it's one that would be difficult to not enjoy.  The cinematography's very nice, too, and the props and costumes evoke a sense of realism that's both heightened by some of the characters (one example being Robin's falling just a tad short of the lofty heroic ideal that's been attributed to him in his absence from England) and undermined, deliberately, by some of the subtle self-reference and humor integral to the film.

Like I said, he's the perfect Robin Hood, 20 years on.  The voice doesn't hurt, either.  Hood...Robin Hood.The dude who plays King John -- if Richard is Lionheart then John is the Cowardly Lion -- is convincing as an effete incompetent.  Actually, truth be told, right down to the way he looks this character reminds me of George W. Bush, and he's similarly out of his depth with the affairs of state.Robert Shaw perfectly captures the Sheriff in an understated performance that turns what is usually a one-dimensional 'villain' role into something rather more interesting.  I don't know whether the passage of time has mellowed this film's version of the Sheriff or if the film's internal history would have him having always been that way, but Shaw actually plays a fairly sympathetic 'bad guy,' one who obviously has far greater empathy for Robin than for his peers and the simpering new king's nobles.  He's actually, as played in this film, pretty much a 'good guy.'  He seems a decent man who is doing his job, the long-standing feud with Robin being evident but not as vicious as normally played -- this is even evident in the final duel, that features two over-the-hill warriors flailing about in the heavy garb and with the heavy weapons of the time.  The Sheriff's an honorable man in this iteration, a definite departure from the Robin Hood movies that I remember seeing in my youth, and the film's infinitely better for this characterization.The ending's a bit of a downer, mainly because I wanted he and Marion (and the others) to live to become even older codgers, but it's consistent with the rest of the film, is probably (as Robin says) better this way, and ties in neatly with the original tale.  In all, this is a classic movie and I think it's one that would be difficult to not enjoy.  The cinematography's very nice, too, and the props and costumes evoke a sense of realism that's both heightened by some of the characters (one example being Robin's falling just a tad short of the lofty heroic ideal that's been attributed to him in his absence from England) and undermined, deliberately, by some of the subtle self-reference and humor integral to the film.

Cusack stars as Nick Falzone, a top-notch air-traffic controller who has everything going for him. He's got a seemingly great home life, great wife and is able to deal with the stress that comes with his high paying job. Enter Russell Bell, (Thornton), an equally impressive cool under pressure controller, who comes to work alongside Nick and the competition begins, at least in Nick's mind. It doesn't help matters either when Nick suddenly sleeps with Russell's wife, who then turns around and confesses all to Russell. Nick's entire life becomes a mess of confusion, fear and paranoia that Russell is out to get him. This movie misses the mark because we, the viewers, are not given any clear reasons as to what motivates these characters. We are supposed to believe that Nick sleeps with Russell's wife either out of pity for her, too much to drink or to prove something over Russell, possibly even all three. Russell's wife (Jolie) is lonely and her plant died, thus her supposed motivation behind the affair. Russell disappears a lot and we are never told why or where to. And although we aren't left with any mystery around whether Russell is really a good guy or staging Nick's paranoia, we are never given any hindsight into why he is the way he is. If you can get past the fact that these characters act completely on impulse regarding every decision they make in their lives, you might enjoy this film. I wanted more.

I should have taken three or four cups of soda (Mountain Dew, lots of caffeine) in the theater with me.Why?  I say so because this movie is LONG.  Tedious.  And at certain points, quite boring, to be honest.It's not the great action, sci-fi, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting thriller kind of experience that the commercials and trailers try to make you believe.  Rather, it's a drawn-out mystery with an intricate plot wrapped in CGI to cover up any mistakes.And I'll say right now, the special effects in this movie are really great. The futuristic appearance is sometimes a little overdone (Policemen with jetpacks?  Why not Flash Gordon, too?) but such scenes as the highway (as Anderton jumps from unmanned, autopiloted car to car) are really excellent.I was expecting action.  You know, jump around, get dirty, fight, mess with futuristic machinery, that sort of stuff.  Well, we get the futuristic machinery, but not too much of the rest.  There are really only three or four action sequences (which are pretty cool), but the rest is Anderton's search for the truth.  Well, that's great, but let's put that in the commercials and trailers, shall we?And John Williams' music?  Hah!  Matches the theme of the movie--slow and tedious.  It has its good parts, such as the highway scene, but even then I could tell Williams is losing his touch with action music.  I don't feel as thrilled anymore like I did with The Lost World's heart-pounding ethnic drums, Jurassic Park's raptor theme, or The Phantom Menace's Duel of the Fates.  I think Danny Elfman or James Newton Howard (heck, even Howard Shore) could have done much better.  Or maybe Hans Zimmer...Let's face it.  This movie was a disappointment.  Some parts were exciting, others were hilarious (the spiders in the apartment), but most of the movie was just dull.  It had too much explaining to do.  It was interesting at first, and I'm sure it would have stayed that way had I been able to stay awake and pay attention.So I'd really suggest seeing this movie when it comes out on DVD.  You may not want to sit in a dark theater for two and a half hours, unless you really enjoy futuristic mysteries.

It's one of those movies that tries to shock the average viewer with its casual approach towards taboo subjects (one of the characters is a kid who brags and jokes about actually having intercourse with his sister, which is so calculated to offend that it just seems dumb), kind of in the vein of Kids but a bit more plot-oriented.  What saves it from being just some annoying look-at-me-I'm-scary-and-gross independent film is Brian Cox as Big John, who elicits just about every emotion possible from the viewer.  I've said viewer twice already in this little write-up, and I'm very annoyed.  Viewer viewer viewer-riffic!  Viewer!  So Brian Cox is great; in an early scene with Howie, the protagonist, he confronts him in the front seat of a car, and it's beyond uncomfortable.  You have no idea what the guy is going to do, and that's a pretty rare attribute for most movie characters.  Overall the acting is good, quite good really.  The kids in it aren't annoying even when they're given potentially annoying things to say and do, and there's a lot of good little moments.

Following a terrific opening titles sequence, Jodie Foster and her daughter are moving into a big mansion, recovering from a bad divorce. Everything's okay on their first night until three burglars enter the home unaware of its occupants and looking for several million dollars locked in a safe. That safe just happens to be in the panic room, designed to protect the house's occupants in case of an emergency, and that's exactly where Foster and her child go. Now the crooks have to devise a way to get the two out. This film is extremely pleasing with a twist around every corner. Director Fincher sets the entire movie inside a house and it holds your interest until the end. Foster tries various ways to get out of the room, all of them mixed with hair-raising tension as the crooks also use various ways to get them out. This film is taught and drenched in beautiful camera-work. Shots through keyholes and coffee pot handles and even a close-up of small concrete particles shifting and moving give the camera a fluid style and it's amazing. There are very few special effects, just a solid thrill ride the whole way through. You'll be gripping your seat a lot of the time. Forget all the junk about stupid crooks and no plot, this movie is worth your money if you want to see a great thriller that doesn't cheat you out on scares. Extremely entertaining.

After Scream, every horror movie copied its formula, hired hot teen actors, and made it a guessing game of who the killer would be. After a while it got too tiring. Now that the trend is dying off and movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween are pumping out more sequels this year, everyone can thank God that movie studios quit ripping off this great series. Sure, Scream started it all, but you have to realize that Scream is THE teen slasher of the '90s. It's the only slasher series that's actually worth a damn, and it's not the movie's fault that other people copied it to death. This series was almost ruined by imitators, making the audiences blame this series.The story is a little different here in Scream 2. The heroine Sidney has graduated and gotten out of Woodsboro to a secluded college. The other survivors have gotten on with their lives, too. Gale the reporter got rich from a tell-all book, Dewey deals with his new limp, and Randy coincidentally attends Sidney's college (what are the odds?). When a new movie called Stab opens, which is the film counterpart to the events at Woodsboro and Gale's book, the past comes back again as another ghost killer stalks Sidney's college buds.This movie delivers on all that Randy promises in the trailer. The body count is bigger, but some of the deaths are inconsequential unlike in Scream when the deaths were major characters. The death scenes are only more elaborate due to the new volume of blood. But compared to Drew Barrymore's scene in the first, this can't hold a candle to that. And the killer(s) should never be assumed dead because are they ever?This movie may seem like a pointless attempt to cash in on the money from the first, especially since not even a year had passed since the first opened, but keep in mind this is a trilogy. Just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.Not everyone will be satisfied with this. Taking the characters from Scream and shipping them out of Woodsboro takes something out of the  film. Woodsboro was a small town where terrible things were happening and everyone had something to hide. With great scenery and people, the setting was almost a character in itself in the first movie. Now that is all gone, replaced by a college campus. The set-up to murder is all the same here, even the killer's voice, but the scenes lack the impact they had in the first. The first had a better set-up. Most murders were out in the middle of nowhere. These occur on a campus with hundreds of kids about.This movie jokes about sequels never surpassing the original. This movie only helps prove that, but is still definitely worth viewing. It can't beat Scream, but it can almost match it. As part two of a trilogy this movie does just fine.
