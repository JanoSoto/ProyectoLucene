[{"date":"15 October 2006","score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Concerning the Planet of the Apes (2001). First, let us pretend there is no other Planet of the Apes movie (1968). To do otherwise would invite comparisons and I want to minimize my negative review. My thoughts\/summary on Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes remake is as followsThe hero (Wahlberg), a highly trained and professional astronaut, blatantly disobeys his commanding officer to rescue a space monkey. After being sucked into a convenient local time warp that just happens to appear outside the space station. The hero crashes his tiny space pod on some strange planet, without getting a scratch on him. He gets out and immediately runs into some oppressed humans being chased by leaping killer apes. The hero becomes a slave, escapes, and finds his pretty space station has crashed on the planet and all of his friends are dead. The hero realizes that he is on earth and thousands of years in the future. With a look of shock(or lack of), the hero says oh no, it's not possible. Then the hero, using some old rusty technology and an expected plot twist, holds back an army of apes, stops the fighting, and brings peace, love, and harmony between humans and apes. The hero then hops into his sub-compact space pod and takes off for his own time period (going from Saturn to Earth in thirty seconds) only to crash land again on a planet and discovers the big surprise ending which leaves one bewildered. Watch the movie and see what I mean.In the background of this riveting tale is Helena Bonham Carter, playing a sympathetic, human loving, but annoying representative of the ape equivalent ASPCA\/PETA. Tim Roth plays the ultra-violent, bellicose villain Thade, who flies\/jumps through the air with the greatest of ease (Short of having a cape with an S). The other characters are little more than window dressing for the hero\/villain\/heroine triangle. Overall, a simplistic movie with great special effects. IMHO, the movie should have explained more about Thad's genetic killer ape ancestry, ape\/human history, man's technological failures. There should have been believable spaceships and space suits. Also, the movie devoted too much time to the cute and funny bits of ape society.

Lawrence, taken from the autobiography The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. T.E. Lawrence is a British lieutenant who is stationed in Arabia. He was sent into the deserts to report about the conflicts in Arabia concerning national movements from 1916-1918, but Lawrence comes back loving the Arabs, and decides to help them fight for their freedom against the Ottoman Empire.I thought this film to be absolutely magnificent, especially in respect to the breathtaking scenery captured. Lawrence of Arabia is made in the deserts of Morocco and Jordan. The scenery is very big, most of the time the characters in the shot are tiny in comparison to the large mountains, canyons, desert sands, and etcetera. The view is great, and makes you want to jump into your TV screen.The soundtrack is also brilliant, composed by Maurice Jarre. He uses orchestra filled with very bold sounds, a lot of the time glorifying the Arabs and their victories. It really fits the mood with the film, however a lot of times the soundtrack is overwhelming, and I had to turn down the volume at certain moments. There are also a few scenes in which silence is used, in moments of uncertainty and nervousness. This technique was used very well and we really get a sense of the anxiety that is felt by the characters.The cinematography and editing was also very creative and unique. A lot of times the camera uses shots to jump further into time. For example, the dust in the desert fills the screen, and once it is blown away, we are taken to an event further in the story. There aren't many close-up shots, but the shots that are close-up are on faces, which are full of expression.The performances of the characters were captivating. Peter O'Toole, Lawrence, was actually a new actor, but his performance does not show it. His facial expressions are amazing, and very down to earth. Through his expressions and body movement, we get a feeling for his glory filled personality, as well as his confusion about who he is, and what he wants. The performance of Omar Sharif was brilliant. He portrays his character with much enthusiasm, and we really get to know his character. One scene in particular was his encounter with Lawrence for the first time. We really get a sense of his motivation to protect his well and his lands by foreigners and other tribes. However, once he is a best friend of Lawrence's, we are able to see his loyalty and bravery towards those he loves. All of the characters were very down to earth, and in a way, easy to connect to, in a sense that they seemed real.Lawrence of Arabia was pretty much a glorious movie, and should be seen by everyone. I have been studying movies, and have watched a few of David Leans films, and I believe this is one of his best. It has a lot of different aspects that could intrigue all movie lovers. It joins adventure, drama, and war all into one to try and get to know this T.E. Lawrence who is struggling with loyalty to his country and his love for a people. In my opinion, this movie should be rated at a 9.0, and I would recommend this to everyone; it is a must see.
