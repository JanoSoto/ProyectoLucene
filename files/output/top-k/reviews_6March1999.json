Though this initiation to adulthood excited me at first, I quickly grew weary of it, because it tasted neither as good as wine nor soft drink.  I had, therefore, decided to switch back to my regular glass of coke in these occasions.  Today even though I prefer wine to any soft drink, if any one told me that I had to choose between a soft drink and the mixture of water and wine, I would probably choose the former.  `200 Cigarettes' seems to me like the mixture of water and wine that I have never been able to enjoy.  I have a feeling that this is due to the fact that `200 Cigarettes' tries to target an audience anywhere between the ages of 13 to 30.  While I certainly do not advocate `art for the sake of art', and I still think that films should be made with the purpose of communicating a story to viewers, I believe that targeting a specific audience eventually leads a film to lose the universal quality of its story.  In the case of `200 Cigarettes' it is even worse because targeting such a diverse audience leads it to lose any meaningful content.`200 Cigarettes' follows several characters as they each deal with their emotional\/sexual problems, before attending the same 1981 New Years party. To start with I do not understand why this story could not have taken place in any other period.  The only thing I can guess is that the film intends to appeal to people my age who may be nostalgic of the 1980s as well as the younger generation that may find that period, disco and punk particularly cool.  The only good thing that can come from such a marketing scheme is that I will not have to feel embarrassed anymore when I show my younger friends my CD collection dating back from the 1980s.  This is however the least important problem `200 Cigarettes' runs into.`200 Cigarettes' never attains an internal consistency.  This is due to two main factors related to the fact that it tries to please everyone.  The characters deal with emotional issues that are more common in people in their mid and late 20s.  However, the dialogues seem to be written for an audience that has the intellectual and emotional maturity that `200 Cigarettes' attributes to teen-agers.  The result is that `200 Cigarettes' only tackles the surface of the problems and never investigates the deeper more interesting layers of the characters.  This leads to very poor acting because the actors themselves, and I cannot blame them, do not seem convinced by their lines and characters.In terms of directing the style goes back and forth from slapstick comedy to simpler character study.  This often leads to missed cues in editing.  Each shot is either held a few seconds too short or too long than it should, underplaying any comic or dramatic effect it intended to convey.This is as tasteless as the mixture of water and wine that my mother used to make me drink.  And I believe that it undermines the intelligence and maturity of both adult and younger viewers.  Having tasted wine, I know that `200 Cigarettes' is not the genuine thing.  I am certain that younger viewers will not be fooled into thinking that they have been drinking wine. This brings me to my last point.  I have nothing against films made for younger viewers.  But I believe that they should be done not by targeting a specific audience but by finding a genuine story that concerns adolescents. The perfect example is `The Breakfast Club' which dealt with the issue of discovering one's own identity by breaking all the stereotypes that one is put into in high school.  The `Breakfast Club' may be soft drink and not wine but its appeal is more universal than `200 Cigarettes'.

I have a feeling that this is due to the fact that `200 Cigarettes' tries to target an audience anywhere between the ages of 13 to 30.  While I certainly do not advocate `art for the sake of art', and I still think that films should be made with the purpose of communicating a story to viewers, I believe that targeting a specific audience eventually leads a film to lose the universal quality of its story.  In the case of `200 Cigarettes' it is even worse because targeting such a diverse audience leads it to lose any meaningful content.`200 Cigarettes' follows several characters as they each deal with their emotional\/sexual problems, before attending the same 1981 New Years party. To start with I do not understand why this story could not have taken place in any other period.  The only thing I can guess is that the film intends to appeal to people my age who may be nostalgic of the 1980s as well as the younger generation that may find that period, disco and punk particularly cool.  The only good thing that can come from such a marketing scheme is that I will not have to feel embarrassed anymore when I show my younger friends my CD collection dating back from the 1980s.  This is however the least important problem `200 Cigarettes' runs into.`200 Cigarettes' never attains an internal consistency.  This is due to two main factors related to the fact that it tries to please everyone.  The characters deal with emotional issues that are more common in people in their mid and late 20s.  However, the dialogues seem to be written for an audience that has the intellectual and emotional maturity that `200 Cigarettes' attributes to teen-agers.  The result is that `200 Cigarettes' only tackles the surface of the problems and never investigates the deeper more interesting layers of the characters.  This leads to very poor acting because the actors themselves, and I cannot blame them, do not seem convinced by their lines and characters.In terms of directing the style goes back and forth from slapstick comedy to simpler character study.  This often leads to missed cues in editing.  Each shot is either held a few seconds too short or too long than it should, underplaying any comic or dramatic effect it intended to convey.This is as tasteless as the mixture of water and wine that my mother used to make me drink.  And I believe that it undermines the intelligence and maturity of both adult and younger viewers.  Having tasted wine, I know that `200 Cigarettes' is not the genuine thing.  I am certain that younger viewers will not be fooled into thinking that they have been drinking wine. This brings me to my last point.  I have nothing against films made for younger viewers.  But I believe that they should be done not by targeting a specific audience but by finding a genuine story that concerns adolescents. The perfect example is `The Breakfast Club' which dealt with the issue of discovering one's own identity by breaking all the stereotypes that one is put into in high school.  The `Breakfast Club' may be soft drink and not wine but its appeal is more universal than `200 Cigarettes'.  Ten years later I still have chills whenever I listen to Simple Minds' `Don't you (forget about me)' and remember the characters leave detention in defiance of authority.

The one thing Raiders had over Temple was the climax. But not by much.Temple of Doom was far more fun. It was genuinely funny & light-hearted to watch at many times. And yet, anyone with even a light case of arachnaphobia, claustrophobia, bogyphobia, pyrophobia acrophobia or a half dozen other phobias were scared to the edge of the seats (or out of the theatre) at various OTHER times.

But perhaps not. I hear this is the most faithful Grisham adaption yet, and if that is true, I can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work.A Time to Kill is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. Let's face it, those two types of films do not go together in Hollywood, which is why Dead Man Walking had to be made independently.The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) out to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rapists' trial, Carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building, he charged out and shot both of them dead. To help out with the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary, and put in the film only for marketing purposes.Meanwhile, one of the rapist's kid brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. All of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot.  I'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film, in addition to the courtroom scenes. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.The main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. This film, however, doesn't seem to think so. Besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Klan, and, for reasons unknown, is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the Klan. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company, and left for dead in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her---and we NEVER find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.And speaking of the Sutherland character's reign of terror, it's amazing how witless the police and the Bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. There's a scene when Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he comes out, shooting one of the guards instead. Now you'd think since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see, no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. Even after Bullock, was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never, ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it even questioned. Why was this? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense, although logically, he should have been out of the picture.Besides Bullock's character, there another thankless character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience. In my opinion, one-liners show a major weakness in serious films when used. It demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.But enough of the film's many minor problems. What about the film's message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc that caused him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. After describing everything that took place, he adds on one final line...The girl is white. We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.In the very next scene, a girl comes out yelling He's free! He's free!. Wait a minute! Do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? Most of all, why weren't  there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertion because NO JURY could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?This film should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in reality, there would not be an acquittal. But since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this film should be held responsible. What a socially irresponsible film this is!
