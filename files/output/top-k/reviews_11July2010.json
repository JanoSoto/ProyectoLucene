I actually watched this series in a weird order. I got caught up before the fifth movie came out, but I saw the others in order of 3,4,2,1. So when I finally did get around to watching the first movie, I actually thought it might suck. Because the fourth and second didn't really impress me very much. Well thankfully it just turns out that 2 and 4 weren't very good, because Final Destiantion turned out to be a pretty good movie.My biggest problem with the film would probably be the tone it goes for. Give the sequels credit, they were horror-comedy's. This film is straight up horror, sure we have Billy as the comedy relief, but for the most part this film is just a dreary dark horror film. This wouldn't be a bad thing, except that the death scenes don't match well with the tone, and it becomes a little uneven. Sure getting hit by a bus is kind of simple. But the rest are pretty over the top that it becomes kind of funny. Also I don't care much for the subplot with the FBI, I can't understand how they would think this kid would kill his friends, or how he would even do it.But the death scenes are actually pretty cool, they may not be overly complex, but they are just over the top enough to be entertaining. Most of the characters are likable, and portrayed very well by the young actors. Sure there are the characters you love to hate, but that just makes it more satisfying when they die. I laughed a descent number of times, and actually felt sad and sorry for these people. The effects are great and I love the final shot.Final Destination is a pretty good movie, it's entertaining enough, and the characters are likable.

At the opening a photographer (Robert Forster) tries to warn the tycoon once again before taking his ex-wife (Mia Farrow) to bed. Sure enough, the next day an avalanche takes place. This was produced by Roger Corman and I must admit that I was a little shocked to see his name attached to a disaster film. It's clear he stuck to his guns and didn't spend too much money on special effects but it's also clear that everyone involved seems to have wished they were somewhere else. This is a really, really bad movie that is thankfully bad enough to where bad movie lovers will find a few things to be entertained by. I guess we could start with the performances since the majority of them are embarrassingly bad. Just check out the first scene where we see Hudson and look at how badly overacting he is. None of his performance gets better as it's clear he was just picking up a paycheck. Farrow also sleepwalks through her role and Jeanette Nolan gets the part of the elderly woman who tries to give the film a few laughs. Cathy Paine is rather embarrassing as a jilted lover. Other actors fail in cardboard character roles but at least Forster comes off fairly good in his brief, supporting part. The biggest disaster in this disaster flick are the special effects. Corman apparently wanted to skip the majority of the special effects and just buy up stock footage from real avalanches but this is so incredibly silly that it's obvious when this footage comes up. It never makes much sense in terms of what's going on with the avalanche because the footage, when mixed together, seems extremely out of place and the bad editing doesn't help cover this up. When the real effects are used it just seems like fake pieces of ice being thrown around as people scream. One of the dumbest scenes happens with a woman is skiing on some ice as people all around her are screaming and getting crushed yet she never notices. We even get an ultra-cheap explosion where people are so fakely thrown back and into various objects. All of these supposed dramatic moments just contain one laugh after another. I guess the most shocking thing is that this PG-rated film contains several nude scenes including one with a female going full frontal. Fans of the disaster genre will probably want to watch this just so they can say they've seen it all but this is a very bad movie. It's not nearly as awful as WHEN TIME RAN OUT... but it's still pretty bad. Thankfully, it's bad enough and campy enough to get several laughs.

The story concerns a puppet master named Toulon who has found the ability to give inanimate objects life through some Egyptian parchment bury his life puppets in the wall of a hotel. Years(at least 30) later a group of psychics and other magicians arrive at the same hotel to attend the funeral of one of their kind. Death is the reason they are there and the future that awaits most of them as the puppets inexplicably(at first) reek havoc on them. We get an interesting assortment of puppets a tunneler that has a head like a drill that drills the face off of a truly lovely woman(Kathryn O'Reilly). A female doll that grunts and coughs up leech-like creatures. A maniacal puppet with a hook and a blade for hands. And a strong-arm puppet complete with giant hands and a small head(Pinhead). The deaths are fairly graphic and there are a few suspenseful moments. The plot isn't much, but the acting is acceptable with Paul Le Mat and Irene Miracle as two of the magicians doing rather well. O'Reilly bears her soul literally and what a soul she has to bare = bear I mean. There is also a nice little performance by Merrya Small as a maid. Director\/writer David Schmoeller does a pretty decent job given the budget he has to work with and the expectations that come with a direct-to-video film like this. Puppetmaster has some exciting moments, some horrific scenes, some inane situations, a dreary, predictable plot, and a stuffed dog - why I still don't know.

We get an interesting assortment of puppets a tunneler that has a head like a drill that drills the face off of a truly lovely woman(Kathryn O'Reilly). A female doll that grunts and coughs up leech-like creatures. A maniacal puppet with a hook and a blade for hands. And a strong-arm puppet complete with giant hands and a small head(Pinhead). The deaths are fairly graphic and there are a few suspenseful moments. The plot isn't much, but the acting is acceptable with Paul Le Mat and Irene Miracle as two of the magicians doing rather well. O'Reilly bears her soul literally and what a soul she has to bare = bear I mean. There is also a nice little performance by Merrya Small as a maid. Director\/writer David Schmoeller does a pretty decent job given the budget he has to work with and the expectations that come with a direct-to-video film like this. Puppetmaster has some exciting moments, some horrific scenes, some inane situations, a dreary, predictable plot, and a stuffed dog - why I still don't know. It also has some very innovative scenes and special effects given its budget, and hey William Hickey is there briefly and rather lethargically too. I haven't seen its sequels but the first one deserves a viewing.

I guess you would have to be one of those people who think a smashed soup can qualifies for modern art... in order to like this movie. Pretentious with no sense of genuine taste.Other than Alec Guiness and Omar Shariff, I didn't see any exceptional acting skills portrayed in this movie either. O'Toole's role came across as an idiotic, insincere dandy. I don't know which was worse... the actor's portrayal of the role of Lawrence or the writing of the dialogue and direction for his character.As for cinematography, most of the movie was showing the same section of the desert from different angles... over and over again... ad nauseum. Just look for the dark pyramid shaped mountain in nearly every scene.The entire movie and story positively bored me to tears. I can't think of a single redeeming moment or aspect of the entire movie. It might help a little if you read about TE Lawrence on Wikipedia before watching the movie... since the director filmed scenes out of context without explanation for those who were not familiar with the life and death of the main character... but that doesn't make it any less boring. When someone mentioned it was like watching paint dry... they weren't kidding. This movie is painfully boring from start to finish.I can see why this movie might have upset the Arabic audiences. The movie depicts Lawrence in a very lopsided view as the conquering hero leading confused, blundering minions. Not to say there weren't internal problems but deifying Lawrence as a superhero saint in this manner would have been insulting to any nation depicted under these conditions.But politics aside... this movie was painfully boring and doesn't do justice to anyone portrayed, including the title character. Perhaps if they had cut out about an hour and a half from the middle of the movie, it wouldn't have been as bad... but it needed some serious rewriting and new direction to make it tolerable.I really feel the most sorry for the crew and cast who had to endure the desert heat for over 2 years. No movie is worth subjecting that kind of hardship on anyone. Even these days, these egocentrical directors seem to think it is perfectly fine to place celebrities and stunt crews in terrible jeopardy and dangerous conditions just to make a movie... especially now when they have the option of using graphics and green screens instead. It reminds me of the 2006 remake of the Omen where they actually dropped a living person off the roof of the mansion with a noose around her neck... just to do a movie scene! What were these idiots thinking? That the audience would rather have a real person injured instead of a green screen or CGI? I realize we did not have CGI in 63, but they were able to superimpose scenes and use matte paintings and many other effects instead of having to drag the entire cast and crew into the sweltering desert... not to mention the dust in their lungs.Despite what the twisted minds of these megalomaniac directors think... the audience does not want their celebrities or anyone else to be injured or endangered just to make a movie... and that not only includes dangerous stunts... it also includes forcing them to endure sweltering heat or other horrible conditions which could have easily been avoided. That's how we lost actors like Clark Gable and John Candy as well as Jeffrey Hunter and Tyrone Power. Even on Lawrence of Arabia, O'Toole was nearly killed falling from the camel and Edmond O'Brien suffered a heart attack. Yet these kinds of travesties continue in filming movies today such as the stuntman for Harry Potter, now paraplegic because of a stunt which could have easily been done with green screen or CGI without a snap harness rigging required. When is someone going to stop these directors from subjecting our celebrities and crews to such harmful and dangerous conditions? It is a miracle that more actors did not die from the heat while making Lawrence of Arabia.Perhaps we can't do anything about a boring movie which is more than 47 years old, but we can start boycotting movies with crazed directors like this who insist on endangering cast and crew with dangerous stunts and harsh conditions. Perhaps they will get the hint when they fail to make money.

The franchise was huge and 20th Century Fox kept making on newer adventures. I tend not to call them sequels unless they copy the first film in a certain way. It is no doubt that Conquest is the most violent of the 'Apes' films and is the only one to bear a PG rating..... CUT! Yes, that is right the chances are that you yourself have viewed the US cut version which contains less violence and gore. When the film was released the previous 'Apes' films were all rated G, so in order not to pull away too much of the family audience for the series it was cut to avoid getting an R rating (there was no PG-13 in 1972). However, in Japan it was released uncut. The uncut first made its debut in the US on the 20th Century Fox movie channel when the ran an 'Apes' marathon in tribute to the 40th anniversary to the first film. This was right when the films were released on Blu-Ray discs. You can only find the uncut version of 'Conquest' on the Blu-Ray disc where it also gives you the cut version as well. Any DVD release of this is cut. But, looking back at all the 'Apes' films and their ratings, I'd say that they would all be rated PG today (excluding 'Conquest' even cut would likely get a PG-13). Back then the MPAA was either real 'loose' at rating films or real strict.'Conquest' follows the story of Corneilius and Zira's son, Caesear who is the only ape on earth with ability of speech and high intelligence. Cats and Dogs have been wiped out by a previous plague and the apes replace them as household pets which they later turn into slaves. After Caesear's owner from the circus, Armando (Richardo Montalban) commits suicide in fear of the powerful government finding him being responsible for Caesear (a talking ape for the governors stands a threat to civilization). Caesear then goes on a rampage of gathering fellow apes and weapons to organize a revolution or riot to overthrow the humans responsible for their slavery. This leads to tons of entertaining action that keeps on the edge of your seat for the remainder of the film. This one is probably the more mature 'Apes' films next to Escape From The Planet of the Apes (1971).A lot of people really don't get this films and consider it to be just a bombardment of mindless violence and a meaningless story line. It's not. This is a real good introduction to the character of Caesear and shows how he develops into the apes future leader. It really is a powerful story in which it echoes to the past of our country's slavery, except here it takes place in the future. It's also interesting to see how much the future of humanity has changed from the previous film's adventure. In a special way the Planet of the Apes films are like time travel films, in where the future and past is changed. The first 'Apes' films I ever saw was this one, while looking back it probably wasn't a good idea because I didn't understand anything and the only I liked was the violence (I was a kid when I saw it).

One of his greatest skills is not allowing his films to be watched passively. He forces his viewers to respond both emotionally and intellectually. Dr. Strangelove does so with its black, disturbing humor and its comical treatment of one of modern man's most penetrating fears nuclear warfare. 2001 does so by immersing us in its sweeping visuals as it follows mankind from the dawn of time to a place beyond time. A Clockwork Orange does so by forcing us to confront the inescapable violence and evil inherent in human nature and society's casual indifference and at times subtle encouragement of such. Paths of Glory is Kubrick's first masterpiece and while it is often forgotten in comparison to the three films mentioned above, it is just as compelling as any film he or anyone else has ever made.The film's running time is only 87 minutes, yet it is deeper artistically than most films that carry on past the 120-minute mark. The reason for this shows Kubrick's superiority as a filmmaker. Every scene and piece of dialog is instrumental in forming the film as whole. Nothing is wasted. Every aspect of the film coalesces with every other aspect. This is seen in the coming together of the overall narrative of the French army's suicidal mission and the storyline of two individual soldiers within the army. Before the failed attack on Anthill, three men embark on a reconnaissance mission to scope out the territory. The subordinate officer, Paris, witnesses his commanding officer, Lt Roget, accidentally kill the other soldier. After the failed attack on Anthill, when the commanding officers are forced to pick one man from their troop to be tried at the tribunal, Lt. Roget chooses Paris, in an attempt at silencing the one man who knows his secret. But after Paris, along with the two other soldiers, are condemned to be shot, guess who Col Dax assigns to lead the execution? Roget.Roget cannot hide from his guilt. He is forced to face it. When he asks Paris if he wants a blindfold for the execution, he cannot look him in the eye and asks for forgiveness. It is a powerful moment. This smaller narrative of Roget and Paris is interwoven then with the greater narrative. A lesser filmmaker might have had the Roget and Paris subplot remain a subplot with its own separate conclusion. The Kubrick, the conclusion of Paris and Roget is wedded to and made more powerful by the larger narrative.Roget needs to be forgiven by the only one who knows his secret. His guilt is genuine and his desire for redemption private. Roget's private guilt is contrasted by General Broulard's complete obliviousness to the blame he deserves (taking the Anthill was his idea to begin with) and his desire to set things right only in the eyes of the public. He does so by telling General Mireau that he will be investigated for misconduct. After Dax tells Broulard of Mireau's order to fire on the battalion, Broulard must investigate Mireau not out of any sense of justice, but because Dax threatens to go public with the information.

Dax is outraged that Broulard is incapable of comprehending the injustice and his indignation. Thus, the one who is most responsible for the failed attack and the numerous deaths is also the one who has the power to blame and punish others for his failure.The scene of Dax's indignant outburst against Broulard shows the nature of true evil. Mireau may have ordered his own army to shoot at the battalion and he may have vehemently argued for the battalion's execution, but he was acting on a set of principles, albeit a very twisted set or principles, but principles non the less.

A few of them wipe tears off their faces. Not knowing the words or the language, they begin to hum the song with the German girl. They are reminded of their humanity and it hurts.

One of his greatest skills is not allowing his films to be watched passively. He forces his viewers to respond both emotionally and intellectually. Dr. Strangelove does so with its black, disturbing humor and its comical treatment of one of modern man's most penetrating fears nuclear warfare. 2001 does so by immersing us in its sweeping visuals as it follows mankind from the dawn of time to a place beyond time. A Clockwork Orange does so by forcing us to confront the inescapable violence and evil inherent in human nature and society's casual indifference and at times subtle encouragement of such. Paths of Glory is Kubrick's first masterpiece and while it is often forgotten in comparison to the three films mentioned above, it is just as compelling as any film he or anyone else has ever made.The film's running time is only 87 minutes, yet it is deeper artistically than most films that carry on past the 120-minute mark. The reason for this shows Kubrick's superiority as a filmmaker. Every scene and piece of dialog is instrumental in forming the film as whole. Nothing is wasted. Every aspect of the film coalesces with every other aspect. This is seen in the coming together of the overall narrative of the French army's suicidal mission and the storyline of two individual soldiers within the army. Before the failed attack on Anthill, three men embark on a reconnaissance mission to scope out the territory. The subordinate officer, Paris, witnesses his commanding officer, Lt Roget, accidentally kill the other soldier. After the failed attack on Anthill, when the commanding officers are forced to pick one man from their troop to be tried at the tribunal, Lt. Roget chooses Paris, in an attempt at silencing the one man who knows his secret. But after Paris, along with the two other soldiers, are condemned to be shot, guess who Col Dax assigns to lead the execution? Roget.Roget cannot hide from his guilt. He is forced to face it. When he asks Paris if he wants a blindfold for the execution, he cannot look him in the eye and asks for forgiveness. It is a powerful moment. This smaller narrative of Roget and Paris is interwoven then with the greater narrative. A lesser filmmaker might have had the Roget and Paris subplot remain a subplot with its own separate conclusion. The Kubrick, the conclusion of Paris and Roget is wedded to and made more powerful by the larger narrative.Roget needs to be forgiven by the only one who knows his secret. His guilt is genuine and his desire for redemption private. Roget's private guilt is contrasted by General Broulard's complete obliviousness to the blame he deserves (taking the Anthill was his idea to begin with) and his desire to set things right only in the eyes of the public. He does so by telling General Mireau that he will be investigated for misconduct. After Dax tells Broulard of Mireau's order to fire on the battalion, Broulard must investigate Mireau not out of any sense of justice, but because Dax threatens to go public with the information.

This film is all about the script & it's concepts, ideas & it's twist's. The framing narrative of Frailty is similar to The Usual Suspects (1995) in which a story is being told to some law enforcement agent explaining some criminal plot right down to the twist ending which are also strikingly similar as the storyteller turns out to be not who we originally thought but the main body of the film deals with two young brother's who just happen to have a crazy religious nut as their father who starts killing people after Angels from heaven told him to.

Today's young adult probably does not remember a time when smoking pot, hitting LSD, and open sex were more main stream and not as much counterculture. When truth be told, there was a time when a major part of our society smoked pot like people go to Starbucks today. Also, this movie was made during the reformation of the Black South. It is for these reasons that the movie seems to push the subject of drug use and the issues of bigotry to the level of hyperbole by today's standards. Interestly, the theme of drug usage by the main characters conveys a means of becoming more in tune with the moment, instead of trying to escape from any type of adverse reality. In other words, pot usage is not portrayed as any evil nor is it worshiped as a type of panacea(I am not soap boxing here-just observing).The heroes Wyatt and Billy seem to live by their own amoral code outside the law(and thus the irony of their names). They sell cocaine to fund their adventure to New Orleans. What is refreshing about the story is that neither the drug sale or subsequent usage inspire greed, violence, retribution, or war on some type of moral code and\/or legal dogma. Their actions are a means of becoming something and getting somewhere with no intent of harm to anyone else. I don't know if there is any noble cause at steak, but one does get a real Robin Hood type of feel for the story and characters.

Unlike the real thing. STUDIO 54 as a disco scene is legendary but lemme tell ya, in Sydney in 1988-1994 we had the gigantic real thing massive and spectacular dance parties (no NOT raves) but massive disco nights in a place that held 5000 people and staged Busby Berkeley sized massive dance entertainment. See any Kylie Minogue concert today to get a sense of we had for free at the time! They were called RAT parties and BACCHANALIA events. Often our own big disco clubs competed and it was massive and musical and a throb of wild night fun unlike anything I have seen in any movie anywhere. STUDIO 54 as a small movie version of what we know as gigantic and real in our own Australian lives and makes us look like Hollywood epic disco.

Ryan Phillippe is cute and Adonis and well cast as the pretty chipmunk bar boy, Brecken Myer believable in their NY suburban angst.... as is all the cast esp the girls Selma Hyack and gorgeous Neve Campbell...however the dialog at the end of the film where they reconcile is truly lame and lets the film down. I real life these characters would both end up as prostitutes. But it is Mike Myer pulling off another creepy performance (see CAT IN THE HAT for the other) that is the core of the film. Studio 54 as depicted in this almost-there setting looks like a stinky old cinema with nut-case clients and ghastly B grade celebrities.

Further, beneath the ostensible light, good-natured goings-on, with everybody supposedly having such a great time acting crazy or simply being weird, runs a subliminal hostility and meanness that progressively depresses the viewer. Ha, ha. Isn't the fat girl funny, especially when she outweighs her nerdy boyfriend by 200 pounds? What a riot! Ha, ha. The opera singer bellows off-key and then falls into the pool! How original!

They all reference the Seven Deadly Sins. The Seven Deadly Sins, also known as the Capital Vices or Cardinal Sins, is a classification of vices propagated by the early Christian Church as being the most objectionable and immoral. They fit within St Augustine's rhetoric in terms of fallen humanity's tendency to sin. The list consists of gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath. Seven incorporates the literary references of the Seven Deadly Sins into a compelling but shocking serial killer story.Brad Pit, in one of his best performances, plays a rookie detective, David Mills, teamed with veteran and soon-to-be-retiring Detective William Somerset, played by Morgan Freeman in one of the best roles of his unequaled career. They are investigating a series of ghastly homicides in an American urban center that seems a helluva lot like Chicago. The veteran detective has seen almost everything an urban cop can endure during an average career before the beginning of the story. However, as events transpire, they reveal things even he, after decades on the force, hasn't experienced. The rookie has no idea what's in store for him, and by movie's end he will have sustained the most horrific experience of a police detective coming-of-age ever shot on film. We get the sense all rookie detectives go through a kind of baptism of fire but nothing which would prepare a newbie to the force something as simultaneously horrific and devastating as that presented in Seven.Unlike the usual street crime, these murders have a disturbing combination of dreadful horror coupled with high literary intelligence. The killer incorporates religious and literary symbolism into his acts of unspeakable violence and murder. Each act and victim reference a different Deadly Sin. The killer may be mad but he is an highly intelligent madman, who could probably quote Dante while loading a Magnum 44. The well-known actor who plays the killer\/religious fanatic who reveals himself toward the end is perfect casting.Hollywood rarely produces films with such a combination of horror and high intelligence. The closest comparable film is Silence of the Lambs whose character Hannibal Lecter is strikingly similar to the fiend in this film, although their motivations are entirely different. Both of these characters, the killer of Seven and Hannibal Lecter, are homicidal sociopaths of uncommon literary knowledge, which communicate disturbing overtones of higher purpose. They are the type who would probably view the act of crucifixion as an artistic statement.This is an incredible film both in its dreadfulness and its cerebral content, but definitely not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. As for myself, this is probably the limit in terms of the disturbing meter--worse than this would be out of bounds. Despite the gruesome subject matter, this film has enough compelling elements, from the literary references to the relationship between Pitt and Freeman, that it does work as a masterpiece of the serial killer genre. And the ending is one of the most compelling and original conclusions I have ever witnessed in this type of film, but don't expect the main characters to be celebrating with beers at the end. There are very subtle hints during the film which point to how the movie's ending will unfold, but like most movie-goers during my initial viewing, the ending erupts like a dragon flying straight out of Hell.
