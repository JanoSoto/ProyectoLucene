[{"date":"15 February 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Magnolia is what a daytime soap opera would look like if filmed with a big budget. The pacing is the same, the interrelationships are the same, the feeling that nothing is really progressing is the same, and except for the profanity, the dialog is the same. Even the ending is straight out of the Luke and Laura arc of General Hospital.Further, the use of music is intrusive, or perhaps it was meant to mask that the characters aren't saying much of importance. I found it particularly ironic that at 2 hours and 20 minutes, all the main characters start singing It's not over yet. The best thing about this movie is Amie Mann's contribution of original songs, but only if one listens to them from the soundtrack CD.
