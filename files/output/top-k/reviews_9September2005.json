They cannot understand them, but the interpreter understand they talk about something called The Kong. Then they discover the scary Kong himself. A huge king gorilla bigger than anything they have ever seen. He can beat a Tyrannosaurus Rex! They manage to capture this creature and take it to New York, but it escapes and climbs The Empire State Building with the main girl in his hand. When Kong dies, rather sadly, there is the great quote, number 84 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast. Peter Jackson's version is much longer, it is a very good remake, but the original is some what more fun (and the critics give it five stars, not four).

BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench plays Iris Murdoch, a famous writer who makes books, most about her private thoughts and problems made into a story or autobiography like book. Iris's husband John (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jim Broadbent) is proud of her making these books, but there are moments when living with her he cannot deal with. She suffers Alzheimer's disease, and doesn't understand what is going on, and has panics for no reason. She also has flashbacks of her life with young John, where she is played by Oscar nominated Kate Winslet, with a couple of nude scenes thrown in. Also starring BAFTA nominated Hugh Bonneville as Young John Bayley and Shaun of the Dead's Penelope Wilton as Janet Stone. I thought Broadbent stole the show, particularly with his panics, happy times, but ultimately struggling to cope with Iris. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay.

Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Cruise plays Jerry Maguire, a sports agent who is at the top of his game, and he is breaking down after being fired. The only person willing to go with him to make a new company is Dorothy Boyd (Bridget Jones's Renée Zellweger). When he loses his best client Frank Cushman (Jerry O'Connell) to his mean opposition Bob Sugar (Small Soldiers' Jay Mohr), the one and only client he can try and make a career for, and from, is ego-maniacal football player Rod Tidwell (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Cuba Gooding Jr.). Jerry is doing everything he can (for free) to try and resurrect Rod's career and get him the recognition he knows he and his wife Marcee (Regina King) want. Also on Jerry's mind is his close relationship with Dorothy and her lovable son Raymond (Stuart Little's Jonathan Lipnicki), turning into real love and eventually a marriage, that does fall apart for a little while, but in the end is saved by Jerry's words. Also starring Kelly Preston as Avery Bishop (Jerry's ex-fiancée), Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt as Laurel (Dorothy's sister). The scene where Cruise and Gooding Jr. are shouting the famous catchphrase on the phone is pure entertainment. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy\/Musical.

Basically it is Thanksgiving 1973 in New Canaan, Conneticut, during the days when the Watergate scandal has unfolded with President Nixon as the most guilty involved. The story focuses on neighbouring families, the Hoods with husband\/father Benjamin 'Ben' (Kevin Kline), wife\/mother Elena (The Bourne Supremacy's Joan Allen), son Paul (Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire) and daughter Wendy (Sleepy Hollow's Christina Ricci), and the Carvers with mother Janey (BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver), husband\/father Jim (Jamey Sheridan) and sons Mikey (Elijah Wood) and Sandy (Jumanji's Adam Hann-Byrd). The grown-ups are having troubles, Ben is drinking, in a dissatisfying marriage and having a not passionate affair with the bored Janey, Elena is also bored but unsure what to do about it, and Jim is hardly involved with his family. The youngsters are no different, Wendy is playing sexual games with a few boys from school and next door, Paul who sometimes uses drugs and compares life to the Fantastic Four comics is trying bed Libbets Casey (Katie Holmes), Sandy has a thing for Wendy, and Mikey has a thing for violence. The clear fact is that the two families lives all connect together in some way, and neither the parents or children of either clan communicate properly with each other. This may change when the cold weather comes along, and an ice storm forces the generations to face their problems head on. Elena does discover the affair between Ben and Janey, Wendy and Sandy do get close to each other, Paul looks forward to returning home after seeing Libbets, and tragedy strikes when Mikey is electrocuted resting on guardrail struck by a power line. In the end, the Hoods and Carvers have probably learnt some needed home truths with the devastating events adding to affect, but they try to pull together. Also starring Henry Czerny as George Clair. The casting of Kline goes against what you'd expect from him perfectly, Weaver and Allen I agree are the strong female characters, and the casting of young talents like Maguire, Wood, Ricci and even Hann-Byrd is fantastic. It is a good family based ensemble drama that really makes you feel something for each and every character, and the ice storm itself is well done as well, a very accomplished film that should certainly be seen.

This is the first of two appearances by his replacement, Welsh actor Timothy Dalton. In the role Dalton takes his character pretty seriously to make him his own, a harder and grittier version, and he makes the film more like a thriller, but that was the intention, and it provided more ideas, Daniel Craig has made a similar attitude in his debut. Anyway, Bond's mission is to stop a once trusted General Georgi Koskov (Jeroen Krabbé) from smuggling diamonds and raw opium (drugs) to other places. The girl of the picture is the beautiful cello player Kara Milovy (Maryam d'Abo) and the villain of the picture (besides the silly Koskov) is Brad Whitaker (GoldenEye's Joe Don Baker). Also starring John Rhys-Davies as General Leonid Pushkin, Art Malik as Kamran Shah, Andreas Wisniewski as Necros, Thomas Wheatley as Saunders, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Robert Brown as M, Geoffrey Keen as Sir Frederick Gray, Walter Gotell as General Anatol Gogol, Caroline Bliss as the new Miss Moneypenny and John Terry as Felix Leiter. I can't completely understand the two stars the critics give it, but I suppose there are unnecessary scenes, but the Aston Martin chase and Hercules plane moments keep you satisfied. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 16 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for A-Ha's title song (they also mentioned The Pretenders' If There Was a Man).

Soon enough, Judy and Peter hear the drumming of the game (that's how Alan found it) and start to play, and doing so also let out older Alan (Robin Williams). Eventually when they find the final player, older Sarah Whittle (Bonnie Hunt) they are all determined to finish the game and make all the plants and creatures go back into the game.

Basically Jackie Brown (Golden Globe nominated Pam Grier) is a flight attendant caught by the cops smuggling gun money at the airline she works for, along with some cocaine. Eventually though, Fed Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LA Cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) decide to team up in order to arrest the arms dealer she works for, who they don't know, Ordell Robbie (Golden Globe nominated Samuel L.

That's when she meets Max Cherry (Oscar nominated Robert Forster), her bail bondsman, who falls for her. Then Jackie comes up with a plan to play the cops off against Ordell and the guys he works for, Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda, Peter's daughter and Jane's niece) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), among others, and walk off with their money, but she needs Max's help. Also starring Rush Hour's Chris Tucker as Beaumont Livingston and Lisa Gay Hamilton as Sheronda.

It's a good date movie and an easy movie to just have on in the background while your doing something else, but if you are a movie fan and enjoy depth and meaningful emotions in the characters and the rest of good cinema, you shouldn't go here at all.The movie starts off simply enough a young girl finds things throughout her adolescence about a name of a man whom she will fall in love with and marry in her future. When the future arrives, the man never did come around until a fateful day when she talks with a man with this glorious name over the telephone and, dimwittedly, flies to Italy where he is supposed to be. I'll try and end the telling of the story there (in case you're curious), but be warned there is nothing amazing about this movie.The female lead character, firstly, is WAY too gullible (and has way too much money at her disposal) to even be engaged to, let alone have any friends who will give practically all their time and money to help her find this mystery-man. Secondly, who in their right mind ends up with a guy like the one she did in the end? I'll try not to ruin it, but it's pretty obvious when the two biggest actors are on the cover of these DVDs pretending not to like each other and all that. I thought that Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. didn't have any chemistry throughout the entire endeavor, even though they were good at playing their characters. There were pretty good extra characters and curve-balls thrown into the mix (a man in Rome who pretends to be her mystery man), but there were almost too many.The director did a pretty horrible job at the pacing of this film. He threw so much at you in the first 30 minutes that I thought my head was going to spin out of control. There was such an elaborate scheme of things taking place that it was almost to put into a movie and make it worthwhile. Robert Downey Jr. came off like a version of Pretty In Pink's Ducky to Marisa Tomei's characters the way he clung onto this chance encounter. Desperate does not equal in love. But this movie will try its best to prove that point wrong. Also the music must've been the second-thought for the film, although they tried to throw pop-sounding songs with ethnic vocalists of where they were in the mix of it all.All in all, I gave it a 4\/10.

The story revolves around two cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. Freeman and Pitt work great together and I was pleased to see Brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. It's a nice change and I'd like to see him do more characters like that. Freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. Although the new cop\/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow Freeman and Pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. The two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie.Of course, the real focus of the movie is not about our protagonists. A serial killer (Kevin Spacey) has started a killing spree and chooses his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins, which are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, and Wrath. He chooses very creative fates in which he fights fire with fire so to speak as he turns their Sins against them. This is where the movie gets very graphic. The Sinner's fates are both cruel and unusual. If you're sqeamish, stay away, but it really isn't too bad compared to other movies. You never actually see the murders take place, just the corpses and aftermath. (Which is bad enough) This provides a nice balance that helps you focus on the detectives and their search for the elusive culprit behind all this as opposed to the story just being an excuse to show you grisly murders like the Saw series. Most of the movie revolves around the cops finding the various victims and trying to make sense of the antagonist's tantalizing hints and clues. The villain is very mysterious, and is definitely an interesting head case. He remains an enigma right up to the end, but luckily you do get to see how his mind works near the end. Spacey does a spectacular job portraying this mysterious figure when he's on screen, but sadly he's only really in it during the final part of the movie. But this isn't really a complaint. It's an interesting step out of the norm to not fill the screen time with the villain calling the heroes every five minutes to let him know that he hates them and they'll never prevail against his evil plan. The entire movie has a very dark and gloomy feel to it. Just about every inside scene is dark and outside it's usually always raining or cloudy.Se7en is a great thriller that should appeal to everyone except for those who think that all movies should be fairy tales and should end perfectly. The plot runs along at a good pace and has one of the greatest (not happiest) surprise endings I've ever seen. I never saw it coming even as it was happening. Perhaps what I like the most about Se7en is that it is not just a gore fest. It has a feel of intelligence and even makes statements about the evils in our society and our tolerance of them. Pretty daring for a thriller. With it's dark mood, creative characters, and spectacular plot, Se7en comes highly recommended. A 10 out of 10.

The story revolves around two cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, one of whom is ready to retire and the other is just starting. Freeman and Pitt work great together and I was pleased to see Brad in a movie where he isn't some charming bad boy like in most of his movies. It's a nice change and I'd like to see him do more characters like that. Freeman of course does a spectacular job as well, but that goes without saying. Although the new cop\/old cop pairing has been done jillions of times before, somehow Freeman and Pitt manage to make their characters different and captivating. The two, after a rough start, become friends and a good subplot involving Gwyneth Paltrow as Pitt's wife, emerges that is a nice respite from the grittier main story, which of course later ties in with the main plot later, as in every respectable movie.Of course, the real focus of the movie is not about our protagonists. A serial killer (Kevin Spacey) has started a killing spree and chooses his victims based on the Seven Deadly Sins, which are Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Lust, Pride, Envy, and Wrath. He chooses very creative fates in which he fights fire with fire so to speak as he turns their Sins against them. This is where the movie gets very graphic. The Sinner's fates are both cruel and unusual. If you're sqeamish, stay away, but it really isn't too bad compared to other movies. You never actually see the murders take place, just the corpses and aftermath. (Which is bad enough) This provides a nice balance that helps you focus on the detectives and their search for the elusive culprit behind all this as opposed to the story just being an excuse to show you grisly murders like the Saw series. Most of the movie revolves around the cops finding the various victims and trying to make sense of the antagonist's tantalizing hints and clues. The villain is very mysterious, and is definitely an interesting head case. He remains an enigma right up to the end, but luckily you do get to see how his mind works near the end. Spacey does a spectacular job portraying this mysterious figure when he's on screen, but sadly he's only really in it during the final part of the movie. But this isn't really a complaint. It's an interesting step out of the norm to not fill the screen time with the villain calling the heroes every five minutes to let him know that he hates them and they'll never prevail against his evil plan. The entire movie has a very dark and gloomy feel to it. Just about every inside scene is dark and outside it's usually always raining or cloudy.Se7en is a great thriller that should appeal to everyone except for those who think that all movies should be fairy tales and should end perfectly. The plot runs along at a good pace and has one of the greatest (not happiest) surprise endings I've ever seen. I never saw it coming even as it was happening. Perhaps what I like the most about Se7en is that it is not just a gore fest. It has a feel of intelligence and even makes statements about the evils in our society and our tolerance of them.

So Jamie asks him to get the new and very popular Turbo Man doll. Unfortunately he forgets and now has only Christmas Eve to get it. He is trying everything he can to get the doll, but he has competition from father Myron Larabee (Sinbad) who also tries to get the doll.
