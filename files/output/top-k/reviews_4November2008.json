Yes, serial razzie offender for its respective year, Battlefield Earth A Saga of the Year 3000, is as bad and as bizarre as I expected it to be. It's not just a saga of the year 3000, it's an ordeal FROM the year 2000 and while I haven't seen any of English director Roger Christian's other work, the fact he made films before this failure and has made films since suggests that he is a director whose work carries a certain competence so perhaps the blame must lie with the writers. In this case, quite possibly with the novel from which the film was based, written by Scientology creator himself L. Ron Hubbard.The film is a disaster, a 21st Century Flash Gordon but done with a stranger approach; a 21st Century Plan 9 From Outer Space purely because A; it falls into the sci-fi genre and B; it's absolute garbage. But there are always those two different types of 'bad' with films, those crazy; all over the place; complete suspension of disbelief films that come across as quite purposeful due to the demographic they're aimed at and the other, more difficult to spot 'bad' films that degrade or misinform but come across as something the makers are taking seriously. Battlefield Earth seems to want us to have fun but at what cost? The dialogue, special effects and general use of mise-en-scene are horrid, rendering the film an absolute chore when it isn't trying to worm its way into the 'guilty pleasure' realm.Battlefield Earth sees an alien race known as the Psychlo's having already invaded Earth and are now pillaging it for gold and other such resources for their own race back home on the very originally named 'Planet Psychlo'. Amongst all this is Barry Pepper's Jonnie Tyler, a young and energetic human being, of which few remain, who looks to strike back against the alien race in a bid to bring back freedom to planet Earth. In this sense, the film is a journey of self discovery raising issues to do with confidence, maturity and the ability to act on one's own following the leaving of a 'home' or 'farm' setting in which everything is normal and safe. The example here is the huge wooden wall Jonnie and his human counterparts hide behind when threat of the Psychlos emerges. But do any of us really think a wooden perimeter is going to stop these aliens if they wiped out Earth's combined resistance in something like ten minutes? From here, Jonnie breaks free of the wall confining him and goes on his quest. He will encounter Terl (Travolta) and his assistant Ker (Whitaker), the former of which spends nights in a mock-bar downing Psychlo alcohol and regressing. He'll meet other humans and engage in conversation; 'The grass is greener on the other side' says one of them, a phrase that has survived the 1,000 years since the invasion happened but the ability to recognise a mall mannequin doll has seemingly not. Jonnie will eventually be captured and placed in a cell with many others - he'll get into a fight with a fellow male human who looks like a supermodel despite slavery conditions. Meanwhile the Psychlos walk around in clothing that looks like a combination of 1970s flair and rubber fetish gear. Terl dreams of getting off Earth and rising through the ranks; his comic exchanges with Ker and the manner in which he bangs his head on the ceiling at one point just makes for wired watching. If it's supposed to be funny, we're not laughing.The film likes its slow motion which is no problem but it also likes its double takes, something that should be used sparsely if at all in films in my opinion due to the zoning out of reality it carries with it. The film carries on down a path that splits Jonnie's rise to this level of a 'second coming' being and Terl's gradual demise as a Psychlo supervisor, having him get into the odd comic verbal exchange with Terk at the same time. The finale is ludicrous to say the least; completely contradicting the Psychlo's might when at the start they said they crushed Earth's resistance in minutes or an hour or whatever but here the logic goes all awry.It also contradicts science itself when it appears a flight simulator as well as several fighter jets are available and ready to work &#150; it appears electricity and fuel are still available. The film is a disaster but it's a grand, big budget disaster meaning there'll always be something to look at or laugh at, however unintentional it's supposed to be. For every Pulp Fiction or Saving Private Ryan Travolta and Pepper will appear in, there will be a Battlefield Earth - it's the way the universe works.

The fact that another film exists with it's same title starring the well-liked Will Ferrel does it's own damage, but still many complain about the content of the film itself.Starting first with the characters that the film depicts. Many complain about them being boring and uninspired. Why couldn't Noah Baumbach pick a group of interesting people and have things happen to them? Mainly because this film is a realistic depiction of types of people you meet and may befriend despite their faults. Baumbach paints each person carefully onto the page from obvious personal experience in college life. Typically, events take place that could happen to any of us; a break up, a divorce, someone moves away, someone stays when they shouldn't, we all make bad decisions which effect our lives in ways we don't realize until it's too late.A good example of the type of slight an artist such as Baumbach faces in his own work is a flashback scene which takes place in Jane and Grover's writing class. Jane makes a comment regarding Grover's piece regarding the hollow nature of his subjects and how they never discuss anything important and tend to discuss the little things with more anxiety than anything else. This rings true to many things I have personally heard regarding Kicking and Screaming, that everyone could be interesting if they put all of the jokes and snide comments aside and talked about how they really felt. The problem with this is how often do those situations of pure honesty and intimacy arise in the common person's life? It is rare to be able to pull your deepest feelings out for all of your friends to see in every conversation you have, and it usually comes out in a fight or when a situation is deteriorating - such examples are Skippy and Miami\/Max and Skippy, which are some of the most honest moments in the film combated with the development of the persons themselves throughout the film.Baumbach tends to overkill the stress on aspiring (as well as accomplished) writers in his best-drawn films, which are this and The Squid & The Whale. Where as the two parents on the edge of divorce in the latter film are writers, in Kicking and Screaming, the two young people in the outs of their love are aspiring writers and the main's parents are going through divorce. You can see many pieces of Baumbach's latter work in Kicking and Screaming, as he went back to the basics with The Squid & The Whale after suffering many disappointments in the 1990's.It is clear that Baumbach is a different type of film maker than his auteur counterparts such as Wes Anderson. His films feel and look realistic, rather than coming from another world inspired by the many worlds within our own. He has an interesting voice, and a knack for dialog.

Julianne Moore has an intensely maternal love for Dirk Diggler yet has no qualms at all about having sex with him repeatedly for a film. They are totally nonchalant about private parts. At one point, for instance, Robert Ridgley asks Wahlberg if he can see his cock, Wahlberg shows him, and Ridgley thanks him. They are extremely careless with drugs. What is uncanny about writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's story is how he portrays a group of people so casual and detached regarding these things that they are cavalier and nonchalant when it is simply amiss to be so, specifically. Macy and his porn star wife constantly humiliates him by frequently having sex with muscular younger men in public places, or when a woman OD's on a guy at a party and everyone but the guy is calm and matter-of-fact about taking care of the situation.PTA isn't afraid to have a lot of peripheral characters that are overlooked by a lot of the central ones, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman's gay, nebbishy boom operator who loves and follows Dirk, Don Cheadle's unlikely black country-western follower, William H. Macy's frustrated assistant director, and Melora Walters's timid porn actress. Some of them bond and find great luck, others remain lonely and find tragedy that serves as omens for harder times for the characters as a collective conscious.I first saw Boogie Nights as a sophomore in high school. I was a virgin. Now that I'm not, it's that much more fascinating to watch scenes like the first time Diggler is before the camera having sex with Julianne Moore, not just because of its admirably unapologetic realism but because of how gifted a porn actor must be. There are so many strangers watching, unexpected interruptions and overall lack of familiarity with the situation, throughout all of which you must maintain an erection, relentless stamina and making the act look as sexy as you can to non-participants who are watching it.In terms of Dirk Diggler's character, Anderson reflects the very intimate and fragile male issue of the fear of impotence by constructing a major character stumbling block out of it. As Diggler grows more and more addicted to cocaine, he finds it more and more difficult to achieve an erection when he needs to, winding up internalizing this panic and frustration and beginning the crumbling of a big house of cards. Anderson has the confidence and humility to portray this obstacle under an inevitable magnifying lens, as Diggler's one special thing is his thirteen-inch penis.The most resonant talent that Anderson shows specifically as a director is that the film is high brow in terms of production values and the effect and quality of the story and the acting, but it is essentially a movie about a guy's amazing penis, and the film offers hilariously crude sex humor and pitch-perfect individual degrees of stupidity in the characters, and in the uncanny depiction of terrible quality in the porn films within the film, the Brock Landers\/Chest Rockwell films for instance, mostly in the cast's hysterical portrayals of horrible acting and the horribly staged and filmed action violence.Paul Thomas Anderson's films are mysterious wonders, because each of them, in their own respective ways, is about so many things. Boogie Nights is a period piece about the porn business. It's about a group of people that coagulate like the hierarchy of a large family through the years. It's about a dense young man whose penis leads him to stardom and leads him into a lot of trouble. It's about the control of less intelligent, less sensitive people over the compliant intelligent and sensitive ones. It's about fate and coincidence. The pleasures and dangers of sex and drugs. The id of the 1970s and '80s. Everything about this dynamite stick of talent is grippingly unanticipated.Not many films have been more blunt, even disillusioned, concerning sexuality. Porn movies are a business to these people, not a distraction, and one of the charms of this period entertainment industry drama is the manner in which it showcases the day-by-day behind- the-scenes routine life of pornographers. The range and diversity is reminiscent of films by one of Anderson's biggest influences, Robert Altman, but there is also some of the consistent charm of low-budget breakthrough films of the 1990s, in scenes that stay poised riskily flanked by hilarity and graphic violence. Throughout all the characters and drama, Anderson's script focuses on the emotional facets of them.

As Diggler grows more and more addicted to cocaine, he finds it more and more difficult to achieve an erection when he needs to, winding up internalizing this panic and frustration and beginning the crumbling of a big house of cards. Anderson has the confidence and humility to portray this obstacle under an inevitable magnifying lens, as Diggler's one special thing is his thirteen-inch penis.The most resonant talent that Anderson shows specifically as a director is that the film is high brow in terms of production values and the effect and quality of the story and the acting, but it is essentially a movie about a guy's amazing penis, and the film offers hilariously crude sex humor and pitch-perfect individual degrees of stupidity in the characters, and in the uncanny depiction of terrible quality in the porn films within the film, the Brock Landers\/Chest Rockwell films for instance, mostly in the cast's hysterical portrayals of horrible acting and the horribly staged and filmed action violence.Paul Thomas Anderson's films are mysterious wonders, because each of them, in their own respective ways, is about so many things. Boogie Nights is a period piece about the porn business. It's about a group of people that coagulate like the hierarchy of a large family through the years. It's about a dense young man whose penis leads him to stardom and leads him into a lot of trouble. It's about the control of less intelligent, less sensitive people over the compliant intelligent and sensitive ones. It's about fate and coincidence. The pleasures and dangers of sex and drugs. The id of the 1970s and '80s. Everything about this dynamite stick of talent is grippingly unanticipated.Not many films have been more blunt, even disillusioned, concerning sexuality. Porn movies are a business to these people, not a distraction, and one of the charms of this period entertainment industry drama is the manner in which it showcases the day-by-day behind- the-scenes routine life of pornographers. The range and diversity is reminiscent of films by one of Anderson's biggest influences, Robert Altman, but there is also some of the consistent charm of low-budget breakthrough films of the 1990s, in scenes that stay poised riskily flanked by hilarity and graphic violence. Throughout all the characters and drama, Anderson's script focuses on the emotional facets of them. Boogie Nights has the value of most of the great movies, in that it is constantly buzzing and animate.

Without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery, and even with it I'm still no more educated about the story of 1984 than I was before I watched it.On the plus side...The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making.Now for the down sides, and there are plenty...There is a war going on, (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why & with who? Nothing is explained. There are a couple of names bandied about (Eurasia etc), but they mean nothing without explanation.Who is Winston? what does he do? where does he come from? where does he work? why is he changing news reports? why isn't he on the front line? Why doesn't he eat the food in the canteen? What is that drink he's drinking through the entire film? Why is he so weak & ill? Why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them? What's the deal with his mother & sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that, essential for those like myself that haven't read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard to follow art-house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on.The soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the Big Brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it's very annoying all the same.Also, I know this has been mentioned before, but why all the nudity? It just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage.I personally can't abide the way Hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but this is a few steps too far the other way. I can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you've read the book because if this film really is the 'literal translation' that I've seen many people say, I would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is.There's no denying that it was light years ahead of it's time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date, (maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be?), but many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline.I guess I have to do what I should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i'm to make any sense out of this.All in all, very disappointed in something I've waited for years to watch.

Charles Bronson is harmonica, the mysterious loner, who smoothly drifts his way through each scene by means of his slick dialogue, his quick and sharp shooting and his harmonica. Jason Jobards is Cheyenne, the comical, yet philosophical, criminal, who has the more humane role. Finally you have Henry Fonda as the dirty and gritty Frank, a role that Fonda was surprisingly well suited. The entrance and interplay of each of these three characters result in one of the most thrilling films you will ever see. As well as thrill, Claudia Cardinale is based within the centre of the trio, who brings a sense of hope that separates her from many of the dark aspects that are involved within the film. Furthermore, Frank Wolff plays the tragic Brett McBain, who has very limited screen time, but uses the time he is given to portray an unforgettable character, whose death sparks off the whole plot.Ennio Morricone also provides an electrifying score, a true masterpiece, which energises every scene and knocks the film into a completely different ball park.Ultimately, Sergio Leone's directing is the reason why this is such a classic.
