It was the best sports movie I had seen up until that time, and it still is. In fact, it has legitimate claim as the best American movie ever. It incorporates all that is unique and good in American culture, and does it better than any other film has ever done. It is a magnificent artistic achievement, quintessentially American and an inspiration to everyone who sees it.Jeff forgave me for not waking him up -- but not before we went back the very next day.

'Shadow of a Doubt' was the director's sixth film in Hollywood, and his second with Universal Studios. This shadowy, cynical thriller probes within the darkened heart of a typical small American town, revealing a horrifying secret that none of them could ever possibly comprehend. Throughout his career, Hitchcock delighted in creating suspense by recruiting our sympathies for a villain certain scenes in 'Strangers on a Train (1951),' 'Psycho (1960)' and 'Frenzy (1972)' spring straight to mind, but here he constructs much of the film around a character we initially believe to be one of the director's wrong men. Perhaps I was just being influenced by my previous experience with Hitchcock's films, but it wasn't until a long way into the picture that I even contemplated the possibility of Uncle Charlie being a murderous psycho, and Joseph Cotten seems such an amiable fellow that I wouldn't have believed it anyway.'Shadow of a Doubt' explores the duality of good and evil, as personified by the mysterious, almost-telepathic bond between the young and innocent Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright) and her disturbed uncle Charlie Oakley (Joseph Cotton). After Uncle Charlie whom we'll call Charles henceforth to avoid confusion arrives in the Newton family's quaint hometown of Santa Rosa, California, Charlie is absolutely overwhelmed with joy, having shared a special bond with her uncle from a very early age, despite only seeing him on rare occasions. Charles in beloved by all who remember him; his sister Emma (Patricia Collinge) forever cherishes the idealistic childhood memories of her younger brother, and it doesn't take long for the peace-loving townsfolk of Santa Rosa to welcome him as a son. However, there's something sinister about Charles Oakley that nobody could have imagined, as young Charlie, to her dismay, is about to uncover.As well as some thoroughly-gripping suspense, 'Shadow of a Doubt' is also full of the black humour for which Hitchcock was well-known. I particularly enjoyed the playful bantering of Joseph Newton (Henry Travers) and neighbour Herbie Hawkins (Hume Cronyn), as they came together each night to discuss the most efficient means of murdering each other. There's a brilliant irony to be found in the fact that, despite their self-confessed fascination with murder, the two men are simply incapable of recognising a real-life murderer in their midst, dining at their own dinner table no less. The film's climax, though I would have liked for it to be longer, is extremely thrilling, even though we were never expecting our young heroine to be the Merry Widow Murderer's final victim. Another moment I loved, and which I didn't notice the first time I watched the scene, was the director's cameo appearance as a passenger playing bridge on the train. Appropriately in this story, it is Hitch who is holding all the cards, and the characters - as well as the audience! - are merely at his mercy.

O'Brien and Lovejoy leave their families to go on a fishing trip and, en route, make the mistake of picking up hitchhiker Talman who suddenly threatens them with a gun and holds them hostage, forcing the two men to drive him through the southwestern desert and into Mexico. He is a wanted killer and intends to get to Baja California and leave by boat to points unknown. Talman has already killed a number of people; he is a sadistic and utterly cunning psychopathic killer. He toys with the men, first offering them opportunities to overwhelm him, then to escape. At every turn, he second-guesses their desperate moves and is waiting for them with a gun. Slowly, his background is revealed to them. He has been an abused child and early learned to hate humanity. Talman has a permanent affliction an eye which never closes. At a campfire site one night the men try to move in on him but he has been faking sleep and suddenly holds the gun on them, almost killing them both. Near the end of the film one of the hostages leaves his wedding ring on the pump at a Mexican gas station, alerting police who save the pair and capture Talman. Lupino's direction is superb as she slowly builds the tension, cleverly selecting her setup shots in remote desert areas. She was the only woman directing films at the time, and she proved her enormous talent as a writer and a director with this taut little thriller. Talman's role is based upon the real-life exploits of mass murderer William Cook who slaughtered six people in 1950-51 before Mexican police captured him; he was executed in San Quentin's gas chamber on December 12, 1951. The story, taken right out of the headlines, was written by Daniel Mainwaring who had written INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS. He did not receive credit because of his left-leaning politics during the HUAC witch hunts, and because Howard Hughes, then running RKO, refused to give radicals any credit for film work.----copy right TV guide listing 11-8-2007 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 November 2007","score":"","review":" A perilous and grim film noir entry--noted as being the only one of the genre ever directed by a woman, Lupino--THE HITCH-HIKER offers three outstanding performances by victims O'Brien and Lovejoy and killer Talman. O'Brien and Lovejoy leave their families to go on a fishing trip and, en route, make the mistake of picking up hitchhiker Talman who suddenly threatens them with a gun and holds them hostage, forcing the two men to drive him through the southwestern desert and into Mexico. He is a wanted killer and intends to get to Baja California and leave by boat to points unknown. Talman has already killed a number of people; he is a sadistic and utterly cunning psychopathic killer. He toys with the men, first offering them opportunities to overwhelm him, then to escape. At every turn, he second-guesses their desperate moves and is waiting for them with a gun. Slowly, his background is revealed to them. He has been an abused child and early learned to hate humanity. Talman has a permanent affliction an eye which never closes. At a campfire site one night the men try to move in on him but he has been faking sleep and suddenly holds the gun on them, almost killing them both. Near the end of the film one of the hostages leaves his wedding ring on the pump at a Mexican gas station, alerting police who save the pair and capture Talman. Lupino's direction is superb as she slowly builds the tension, cleverly selecting her setup shots in remote desert areas. She was the only woman directing films at the time, and she proved her enormous talent as a writer and a director with this taut little thriller.

The stories all contain the same elements and the concepts were all loosely based on something supernatural rather then something realistic and something like body horror.The Shining was the first film which I thought had brought something original to the horror film genre. The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumours of the place being haunted, the last resident went crazy and murdered his family as a result of the effects of the hotel onto his stability of mind. However, Jack is convinced that he and his family will be okay and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent man. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad? One of the scariest parts of the film is the extreme sense of isolation which Stanley Kubrick makes. The hotel is extremely large, with vast, empty rooms and the sense of eerie stillness as Nicholson's son, Danny, rides his tricycle through the deserted corridors.
