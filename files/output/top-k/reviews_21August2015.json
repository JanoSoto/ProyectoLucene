[{"date":"21 August 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Throughout the long trajectory of his career, Robert Altman was known for interweaving multiple plots and characters within the context of a given theme. Think the brotherhood of the country music community in Nashville or the detachment of contemporary California life in Short Cuts. But in 1999, Altman tried something a bit unique &#x96; he directed a motion picture with a plot. One plot. One story. A comparatively small cast of characters. It was called, Cookie's Fortune, and it's this month's Buried Treasure.With a clever screenplay by Anne Rapp, Cookie's Fortune tells the story of Willis (Charles S. Dutton), a handyman wrongly accused of murder in a small Mississippi town. His widowed employer (Patricia Neal) commits suicide at the outset, and her daughters decide to disguise the shooting as a murder in a vain attempt to preserve the family's reputation. Since Willis had just cleaned the widow's guns the night before, his fingerprints are all over them. And there you have the most plot structure you'll ever find in an Altman film.What follows this sullen and morose setup is Altman's funniest picture since M*A*S*H in 1970. You see, everyone in the town knows Willis couldn't possibly commit murder. The jailer (a young Chris O'Donnell) consistently leaves the cell door open, and the sheriff (a fantastic Ned Beatty) plays cards with him &#x96; in the cell! You see, Beatty's character knows Willis is innocent because, I've fished with him &#x96; which seems to be his quintessence test for everyone he knows.But, as in every Altman film, there's one character who doesn't quite fit. One who takes things more seriously than the others. Remember how pathetically dangerous Robert Duvall's Major Frank Burns seemed in M*A*S*H (as opposed to the maniacal buffoon Larry Linville played on the long-running television series)? It was as though the Major Burns character walked on the set from another movie &#x96; just to give the audience a jolt; to let us know this is war, and war is real.In Cookie's Fortune, Glenn Close plays Camille, the theatrical and mildly deranged daughter of the deceased &#x96; a slightly more comical version of her wicked turn in Fatal Attraction. Camille is the smartest character in the picture, but she's also the one who doesn't belong; the one who, in a panic attack, might just turn this lovable comedy into a dreary exercise in unhinged madness. Fortunately, Altman is a skilled enough director to not allow this to happen, but my does he dangle it closely (pun intended). Had Glenn Close played her role ever so slightly more unsettled, the entire film would have been ruined. Altman walks a fine line allowing Camille to exaggerate her pomposity, but then her function seems to be to remind us that this is murder, and murder is real.Still, Altman never loses sight of the fact that Cookie's Fortune is a comedy, dark though it may be. The script is peppered with well-drawn characters, and the acting is first-rate &#x96; particularly Ned Beatty as the sheriff, and also Liv Tyler as Camille's desperado niece, whose boyfriend just so happens to be Chris O'Donnell's maladroit jailer. Altman is a master handling these intertwining characters, as he doles out information in small enough doses for us to completely process their connections, and for us to understand the soul of the town in which they regale.Unfortunately, Cookie's Fortune was released during the spring doldrums &#x96; that period between the Oscars and the summer blockbusters, when the studios trot out the fare they don't think anyone will pay to see. By the time the Oscars rolled around that year, the talk was all about Magnolia, American Beauty, The Cider House Rules, and The Green Mile. Cookie's Fortune was simply a forgotten footnote to American cinema in 1999. And that's a shame. You need to seek out this one. It's funny, touching, and intelligent &#x96; and easily one of Robert Altman's ten best films.

I respect directors who intentionally dole out information on a need to know basis. I'm often drawn to films whose stories might begin in the middle of a long overarching plot line. When I first saw German director Wim Wenders' 1984 English-language achievement, Paris, Texas, I was hooked from the start.In the only leading role of his career, longtime character actor Harry Dean Stanton meanders through a vast, lonely desert, apparently confused, and disconnected from the real world. He stumbles into a bar and promptly faints. Thus begins one of the most interesting sagas I've ever seen on screen. Stanton's character, Travis, turns out to be the father of a boy he abandoned four years earlier. With the help of his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), Travis returns to Los Angeles to reunite with his son, Hunter (a very unaffected and pragmatic Hunter Carson). But Travis suffers from severe amnesia. He doesn't know how he ended up in the stark desert of West Texas, nor does he remember Hunter &#x96; at least at first.As Travis' memory slowly returns, Stanton delivers the best acting of his career. With very little dialog, we witness Travis reconnecting with the life he left behind for one reason or another. Stanton's facial expressions allow the backstory to unfold at an intentional pace, brilliantly orchestrated by Wenders, revealing just enough information to give us time for every little nuance to sink in. After viewing old home movies at his brother's house, Travis takes Hunter to Houston to find the boy's mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski, in the best performance of her career), who now works as a striptease artist at a peepshow. The long scene of Travis speaking to Jane through the one-way mirror is a thing of cinematic beauty. Stanton speaks slowly and calculatingly, as he discloses the story of their tragic relationship. It's a poignant apology, if you will, which also serves as the catalyst for reuniting Jane with her son.As in many Wenders films, the primary character is disconnected from the hustle and bustle of modern life. His world is a world of vast, persistent deserts, which seems to operate in perpetual slow-motion. Even the Los Angeles scenes are bleak and dreary. In one of the best Los Angeles scenes I've ever witnessed, Travis walks across a footbridge over one of the area's many interstate highways. He passes a man screaming at the top of his lungs about an encroaching end-of-the-world scenario. No one is listening, Travis walks right past him, and the man continues his tirade. Both Travis and the screaming man are disconnected from one another, and from the outside world of soccer moms, businessmen, and overworked citizens.Wenders' longtime cinematographer, Robby Muller, presents the West Texas desert as the world in which we exist, and the city scenes of Los Angeles and Houston are merely overpopulated versions of that barren desert. Ry Cooder's deft slide guitar music plays throughout, further epitomizing the vast emptiness of the cinematography. Paris, Texas presents a vacuous world, into which is infused a deeply touching story of lost love.Paris, Texas was the unanimous choice for the coveted Palm D'Or (or top prize) at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Next to David Lynch's Blue Velvet, it is my favorite film of the 1980s. Yes, Paris, Texas moves at a very deliberate pace. It's obviously not for everyone. But what a beautiful change of pace from the obnoxiously overbearing superhero cinema of today! Take a break from life, and spend a few hours with this subtle yet moving story.
