Being the most prehistoric creatures in the planet, we'll always be desperate to learn about them in earth science. So with that in mind, it was really great to see Hollywood making movies about them. Two of them were Steven Spielberg's epic film of the 90s Jurassic Park and Disney's mega-budget from the early 2000s Dinosaur, but before all of that, there was Don Bluth, who directed his magnum opuses The Secret of NIMH, An American Tail and All Dogs Go To Heaven, but later teamed up with Steven Spielberg and Star Wars creator George Lucas to create this animated prehistoric masterpiece known as The Land Before Time.It tells the story about a young brontosaurus named Littlefoot who is orphaned when his mother is killed by a Sharptooth. He then flees famine and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area which has been spared devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions Cera, a Three-Horn Ducky, a Big Mouth, Petrie, a Flyer and Spike, a Spike-Tail as they try to avoid the sharptooth while going into dangerous places in a tale of survival, love, friendship, and teamwork.Aside from the 70 minute length, there's a lot of good things to offer. The animation in this movie is shockingly impressive, the acting is amazing especially the child actors who portrayed the kid dinos. The music score from James Horner is the best and it was innovative and very emotional. Even the song If We Hold On Together performed by Diana Ross was brilliant. The tone of the movie was as dark as Bluth's previous entries in the 80s that drives the movie with drama, suspense, and very touching moments.The Land Before Time is one of Bluth's magnum opus that has adventure, suspense, conflict, and emotionally sad moments and will go down as one of the greatest animated movies ever made. Recommended it to kids, adults, and teenagers who are in desperate need for nostalgia.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 September 2011","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" We all love dinosaurs, do we?

As a kid I was a fan of the animated series but I remember my parents refusing to take me to the theater to see this feature because they thought it would be a waste of money. Over time I had grown apart from the series and it never really struck me to go back and watch this feature until years later. By the time I did get around to it I had forgotten the majority of the story lines from the original series but I'm not sure if that really played a part in my disliking of this so much. I will start off by saying this type of fantasy isn't normally my cup of tea but I'm one who believes that any movie can be enjoyed if it's well-made and especially if it's a good one. This, however, isn't either of those things as this cheap looking picture looks even worse today than I'm sure it did back in 1987. I think the biggest problem lies in the screenplay, which has an incredibly weak story, no character development and it seems really boring when the action goes to Earth. We get the typical type of humor of the newbies being on a new planet but there's not a single laugh to be had. The action scenes were all clearly inspired by STAR WARS but there's just not any excitement to any of them and after a while you can't help but start to look at the clock to see how much more there is. The bad thing about that is the film clocks in at 107-minutes, which is way too long for this type of thing. The performances have become somewhat of a cult over the years and it's easy to see why. Lundgren is never going to be confused for being a good actor but while watching him here I really started to wonder if perhaps he was smoking something strong or perhaps he had no idea where he was and what he was doing. He's certainly got the look of He-Man but as far as any type of performance you're certainly not going to get it here. Langella has the misfortune of wearing a really embarrassing mask and his constant screaming is certainly over-the-top but this at least brings a few smiles to your face. The supporting cast includes Meg Foster, Jon Cypher, Courteney Cox and the one and only Billy Barty. The laughable special effects really don't help much but I will admit that the entire film has a campy tone that might keep some entertained. Sadly, I wasn't one of them.

It was all about Pokemon back then. So, like 100 percent of my peers, I was thrilled about this movie.I do not believe I saw it in a cinema (although I regret this). I did see it as soon as I could though, the moment I saw the movie at Walmart (I was going shopping with my brother and grandma) I just merely pointed to it hinting, and she already knew we had to have it. The moment we got home, my brother and I popped that sucker in and watched every minute of it including Pikachu's Vacation. I'm also pretty sure we got a Pokemon card for free as well.Let me tell you, it was epic. I'm 19 at the time of typing this, but still have a great love for this film. The music is epic, the storytelling is epic, the cover of the freaking movie is epic. What I don't understand is why this movie has such a low rating. My bet is the low rating stems from adults who never understood Pokemon. They just weren't 90's kids like us so they just don't understand the significance of Pokemon.The opening theme for this also gave me chills. I didn't know at first if the Pokemon theme song was going to be in the movie, but it was, and remixed. It was well done. I think the music alone is part of what gives the film its magic. Christina Aguilera, M2M, etc, are all such wonderful artists and I'm so glad we had the pleasure of having them in the ending credits. Back then I never cared about the credits for anything, but for this it was different. I watched all the credits. They were interesting. The music makes you want to burst out in tears. Especially now.A lot of people think that this is nothing but fighting and blah blah blah but I assure you this movie DOES have a message. And besides, whats a movie without some action? It would have been boring without the action. You know it, and I know it.All in all, I'm giving this a 10. How can I not? It was such a HUGE piece of my childhood. And I'll always respect the franchise- even the newer generations. I hope it never dies. Because I hope kids can enjoy it as much as I did.

The songs are awesome rock and roll\/ poetic ballad types that you will not be able to get out of your head. I mean, you must be able to look at this movie as a compilation of artwork that is meant to freak you the hell out! The songs, the costumes, the over-acting, the beautiful suspense between lines, and the eccentric everything all come together to make you question what your eyes are truly seeing. The characters are very lovable and they are all funny, which helps the zany atmosphere of the movie.Tim Curry.(see all films)One of the coolest and bravest actors of all time absolutely makes this movie! And he accomplishes it in many different ways. I would have to say his first stroke of brilliance in this flick are his first two lines. How d'you I, See you've met my, faithful handyman. He's just a little brought down because when you knocked, He thought you were the candy man. (que groovy-ass rock tune)In these lines he expresses his character in one fell swoop. Total tranny, mock feminism taken to the enth degree. Lots of confidence, sexuality, seduction, mystic, and the way he moves his lips is absolutely genius. I love just watching his facial expressions when he talks. Next it's his ability to be the most powerful person and character on the screen in every scene he's in. He is, by his introduction, the most interesting character. Then I must give it to the script and the director. The scenes that he is in and the things he says are so funny and true to his character that seeing an actor excel as much as that is a privilege. The seduction of both Brad and Janet is such an untouched subject and such a taboo. It is so refreshing to be the viewer and to see the story hold nothing back.

The same QT who to me has come to epitomize stylish but gratuitous violence and whose alleged masterpieces I have yet to watch in their entirety. But JB is different. Here he takes us to an entertaining rendez vous with suspense, humor, (implicit) romance, action. This is the story of a stewardess in dire straits--because of a past conviction--who's caught again, now delivering money & coke and who's put in the dilemma of doing time or collaborating with police and thus facing the wrath of the man who put her in that situation. She decides to do the later--but also, as a bonus, to get the guy's money, half a million dollars.Some say this is not a real Tarantino and I'm glad for that because otherwise I'd have never known how good a filmmaker he can be. JB is a very well done flick, from beginning to end; there are no lagging segments, even when the risks for it are the the greatest, in those lazy scenes in the couch between dope heads Melanie & Louis, thanks to good acting jobs by De Niro & Fonda. Jackson does okay too, but I found his language rather excessive; I don't get that overkill of profanities, unless the point is that his Ordell is a very bitter, screwed up, insecure man. But the flick belongs to Grier & Forster anyway. They are both superb in their common scenes, which are beautifully understated and where their overall behavior is more meaningful for what they are implying than for what it's said or done.Every good filmmaker know a few tricks that would save him\/her a lot of work if doing things properly For ex. it makes a lot for characterizations to put a few people in an unusually difficult spot and let them react in their own particular way. JB is a classic ex. of that, even more when the tension essential to a thriller doesn't come here from a villain, a temporary circumstance, a disaster, but by an unavoidable fact of life old age; or rather the possibility of lacking financial security for it. That's why, rather than bad apples what we got here are just a few desperate people who see coming the big 5 without having anything to provide for what comes later. Or even if they got it, it can be all lost in a wink of an eye. That's what gives JB his special edge, the fact that Jackie, Ordell, Louis, got only one bullet left in their revolvers, which they'll have to use wisely--as Simone does--or who don't even have that and they'll have to bluff their way out of trouble. We may include also Melanie who, even as a younger dope head, knows well that she'll end up the same way. Max presents the same portrait, but emotionally. He may have financial security, but he has no emotional bearings, nothing for which to live or to die. That leaves Ray; Keaton may overact sometimes but that for a good reason, as QT failed to provide him with a Damocles' sword which would have justified his over the top eagerness, his rage, as he'd have been acting then by similar motivations as the others. As for Mark, he is not really part of the drama, rather an amused observer. But the real leads are Jackie and Max, and we have to thank De Niro, Jackson, Fonda for having graciously left Grier\/Forster the spotlight.

How could it be that a film with such a fine crew of actors and producers etc., create such a so-called childish, attention-seeking rant? I was instantly intrigued. After purchasing it soon after, I can honestly say never has a film, or for that matter, any form of entertainment touched me the way Fight Club did and indeed had. WIthin just over 36 hours of owning it, I'd watched it three times. Yes, its that good! It has a unique cold feel to it from the start, something no film I've seen since has been able to match. THe longer I watched it, the sterner my face became, the more I wanted to destroy something beautiful. Fight Club rejects the emotional, social and indeed financial 'comfort' of the condo life, provoking within you a desire to get out and make something of your life. Harrowingly comedic at times, Palahniuk's (author of the novel) idea not to display the name of the lead character (referred to as Jack in the film), gives the viewer the unique experience to almost adopt the character of Jack, which in itself is some achievement. This is a film that is preach-worthy, genuinely incredible, filled with a feel-bad after effect that begs you to get angry at the societal structure you happen to adore. Its not, as the title would suggest, just about a group of weak men starting up a 'Fight Club', its so much more, and is essential to every house around.

THe longer I watched it, the sterner my face became, the more I wanted to destroy something beautiful. Fight Club rejects the emotional, social and indeed financial 'comfort' of the condo life, provoking within you a desire to get out and make something of your life. Harrowingly comedic at times, Palahniuk's (author of the novel) idea not to display the name of the lead character (referred to as Jack in the film), gives the viewer the unique experience to almost adopt the character of Jack, which in itself is some achievement. This is a film that is preach-worthy, genuinely incredible, filled with a feel-bad after effect that begs you to get angry at the societal structure you happen to adore. Its not, as the title would suggest, just about a group of weak men starting up a 'Fight Club', its so much more, and is essential to every house around.

However, when he arrives, the prisoner is in the infirmary and he must wait a short time to get him. When he finally does take the guy to the airport, he's jumped and beaten by David Doyle!!! Yes, THAT David Doyle!! The one from Bridget Loves Bernie, Charlie's Angels and Rugrats (he played the voice of Grandpa). Of all the actors who you could imagine pummeling Clint Eastwood, about the only one LESS likely might be Paul Rubens or Billy Barty!! This alone is reason to see the film! Well, Eastwood is not about to just return to Arizona empty handed and spends the rest of the movie searching throughout New York for the escaped scum-bag. And so, the cowboy-hatted Eastwood does the whole 'fish out of water' thing until he ultimately gets his man. Does it all seem a bit familiar? Well, apparently this film was the inspiration for the series McCloud just a couple years later.While it's fun watching Eastwood, I really felt the whole 'New York is crazy' aspect of the movie was WAY overdone. Sure, New York City of 1968 wasn't exactly Heaven on Earth, but come on! The worst example is the insane probation officer (Susan Clark) who allows a degenerate to fondle her breast repeatedly--right there in the police station!! I wonder how many OTHER probation officers do this sort of thing? How about ZERO--especially since this is happening right in front of everyone AND she then scolds Eastwood when he stops this probationer!!! This entire scene made no sense whatsoever and apparently it was to illustrate what a sick place this city is. Yeah, right!! I think it just illustrated bad writing. And then, following this, Eastwood and Clark then become very chummy--perhaps he's assuming she'll let him do what the probationer was doing! Later, Clint walks into a super-freaky dance club--full of naked painted ladies, gay men, a FLYING naked lady and drugs. Once again, it all just seems way, way overdone. We GET that New York is a strange place--stop with the sledgehammer symbolism! I did not particularly like this film. I wanted to...but the writing was just dumb. It's not that I don't like Eastwood--he was great in almost all his other films and actually was fine here. But here, he's just saddled with cartoony supporting characters. No one in New York City makes any sense--none! How can you take a Dirty Harry-like character and STILL screw up the film?! Too much emphasis on the weird and confusing--particularly Clark's character who only gets more strange and confusing as the film progresses. In fact, I might be willing to nominate her for the worst supporting female character of the 1960s for this performance (this isn't hyperbole--I'm serious. She was THAT bad). Cool action, a neat character and a decent basic story idea just aren't enough to overcome bad writing and dumb characters.Extremely overrated. My advice is to skip this one and go right to Dirty Harry. Your brain will thank you for this.

The zombie tries to attack, but she escapes. Finding herself in an empty world, Reggie goes home to find her sister. Sam had spent the night in a metal yard shed after the fight and is also all right.After figuring out what has happened, they hear a radio disc jockey and race to the station, only to find it is automated and just a recording. They do find another survivor there, Hector Gomez (Robert Beltran), who spent the night in the back of his steel semi truck. When Sam interrupts the recorded show and makes an announcement, the broadcast is heard by government researchers in an underground think tank. They call the station, telling the survivors that a rescue team is on the way. The scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet, will soon disintegrate into dust themselves. Reggie tells Hector that, as military brats, she and Sam were taught how to use firearms by their father. Hector then leaves to see if any of his family survived, while Reggie and Sam go foraging at a local mall.

After purportedly euthanizing Sam, she then kills the other scientist. When Hector returns, Audrey provides enough information for him and Sam to try to rescue Reggie. Audrey then gives herself a lethal injection.The researchers had suspected and prepared for the comet's effects, but inadvertently left their ventilation system open during the comet's passage allowing the comet's deadly dust to permeate their base. Meanwhile, Reggie has become suspicious, escapes, and discovers that the dying scientists have hunted down healthy survivors and rendered them brain-dead, so they can harvest their untainted blood to look for a cure.Hector and Sam find Reggie, along with a young boy and a young girl Reggie has rescued. Some of the researchers are killed in the escape, while the rest presumably perish from the comet's after-effects.Eventually, rain washes away the red dust and the world is left in a pristine condition.

If I could give a zero to the film, I would.The background score is non-existent, the gore is close to nil, the acting is a joke and the script is a disaster.Full Plot(Why Do I Even Bother?) The Earth is passing through the tail of a rogue comet, an event which has not occurred in 65 million years, the last time coinciding with the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. On the night of the comet's passage, large crowds gather to watch and celebrate the event.18 year old Regina Reggie Belmont (Catherine Mary Stewart) is an employee at a movie theater in southern California. Annoyed that her #6 high score on the arcade game Tempest was beaten by someone with the initials DMK, she decides to have sex with her boyfriend, the theater projectionist, in the steel lined projection booth. Meanwhile, Reggie's 16 year old sister Samantha Sam (Kelli Maroney) argues with their stepmother, and she gets slapped in the face.The next morning, a reddish haze covers everything. There is also not one sign of life, only small piles of red dust and empty clothes. Reggie and her boyfriend wake up, unaware that anything strange has happened. Her boyfriend steps outside behind the theater and is immediately killed by a zombie. When Reggie comes looking for her boyfriend, she finds the zombie eating him. The zombie tries to attack, but she escapes. Finding herself in an empty world, Reggie goes home to find her sister. Sam had spent the night in a metal yard shed after the fight and is also all right.After figuring out what has happened, they hear a radio disc jockey and race to the station, only to find it is automated and just a recording. They do find another survivor there, Hector Gomez (Robert Beltran), who spent the night in the back of his steel semi truck. When Sam interrupts the recorded show and makes an announcement, the broadcast is heard by government researchers in an underground think tank. They call the station, telling the survivors that a rescue team is on the way. The scientists note that the zombies, though less exposed to the comet, will soon disintegrate into dust themselves. Reggie tells Hector that, as military brats, she and Sam were taught how to use firearms by their father. Hector then leaves to see if any of his family survived, while Reggie and Sam go foraging at a local mall. After a surprise firefight with some zombie ex-stock boys, the girls are taken prisoner but are saved by the rescue team from the think tank.Reggie is immediately taken back to their base. Audrey White (Mary Woronov), a dying, disillusioned scientist, offers to remain behind with Sam to wait for Hector.

She plans to use Lerigot to open up a portal so that she can marry an evil dark creature, Maligore, and unite their powers. Naturally, the Power Rangers must stop this.Turbo A Power Rangers Movie is nowhere near as much fun or cool to watch as the first movie. Most notably, Aisha and Billy are completely missing, with no explanation, and Kimberly is no longer a Power Ranger either for some reason, even though she has an important part in the film, thankfully, along with old regular Jason. Rocky is technically there, but he suffers an injury at the start of the film, as if trying to get him out of it, which is sad. Then we have a new blue ranger, Justin, who really is much too young to be a Ranger.A more serious problem is the Zords. The whole mythology around the Power Rangers is much lamer here. The Zords are no longer kinds of animals, they are now all cars, called Turbo powers, which just feels nowhere near as imaginative. At a pivotal point of the film, the car Zords merge into what I find hard to describe as anything but a Transformers rip-off. Even worse than that, though, is the fact that the Power Rangers, in Power Ranger form, have so little screen time.Furthermore, the plot is terribly paced, and not very fun to follow. The Rangers have to travel to another dimension via an old pirate ship. Seriously? In the first half hour, a lot of time is wasted with the Rangers trying to find Lerigot, and some insufferable scenes of him wandering around the jungle. Nothing hangs together at all. Remember how central the very concept of being a Power Ranger was to the first movie? Here, it feels like little more than a gimmick.Lerigot is a body-sized puppet who looks like an extra from The Dark Crystal. With his wide doe eyes and nonsensical slurring, he gets on your nerves very quickly, and he just does not stop. The rest of the supporting cast is just as bad. Divatox's henchmen are just laughably embarrassing, especially the insufferable Elgar. Remember Goldar, and Mordant? Those were entertaining henchmen. Maligore, for a supposed unstoppable force of evil, is incredibly ungainly and ineffective. Divatox herself is amusing and Hilary Shephard Turner clearly has a lot of fun with the role, but her overacting gets a little over the top. All the puns are so self-conscious as if the writer were self-aware how bad it would turn out. The special effects are much poorer than in the first movie, too, especially Zordon (he barely looks like he's talking) and Maligore's crater (amateur bluescreen mistake there). Thank goodness Alpha is as good as ever.The best part of the movie is an amusing cameo from Rita and Lord Zedd. That's about a minute in length, and it made the movie for me. Too bad that the rest isn't as fun to watch. Not even having Kimberly and Jason there can help, really. There's none of the spirit of adventure from the first movie. Do yourself a favour and pass this one up, you're not really missing anything. Watch Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers instead.

If you ask anyone about Kurosawa's best film, they'll probably tell you Seven Samurai is his masterpiece. Although it is true that it is indeed a masterpiece, it's not my favorite film from him.The first time I watched this film, I didn't like it, due to its length. It would take more viewings to really appreciate its greatness. So when I read reviews complaining about its length, I understand them. I encourage everyone, though (mostly to those who found it boring because of its length), not to give up on this film, it really requires more viewings. And if you don't like it, there's nothing wrong with it, after all, you just can't like everything.This film can be divided into three parts 1- The search for the seven samuraiThe villagers, being oppressed by bandits, decide to stand up and fight this time against them, so they go in search for samurai to help them in that task. This is my favorite part of the film, the recruitment of the seven samurai is one of the best things I've seen in a movie.2.- The preparation for battle (against the bandits) The villagers, with the help of the seven samurai, start their preparation to defend their village and fight against the bandits. This part is also outstanding, the defense planning of the village is something to behold.3.- The Battle The Bandits finally decide to attack the village, the great battle between the villagers and bandits takes place. The battle sequences are really impressive here, the astonishing Kurosawa's camera-work allows you to behold the battle without missing a thing; you can see everything that's happening in the battlefield (mostly when the bandits enter inside the village).I know I didn't get into much plot detail, but I just needed to review this movie and let everybody know that they may not appreciate this film in the first viewing, although there are many that liked it in the first one.
