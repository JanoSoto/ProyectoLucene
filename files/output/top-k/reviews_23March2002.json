[{"date":"23 March 2002","score":"","review":"  Sylvester Stallone writes this film in reverse of 1990's 'Days of Thunder' only this time we have the Indy circuit instead of NASCAR.  We also have some of the worst acting of 2001.  Stallone and Burt Reynolds are just earning paychecks now and have completely fizzled out as actors or even performers.  This film is packed with sexy women, advertisements, fast editing and the ultimate commerciality which puts total Hollywood fabrication over good film making.  Renny Harlin is a very hit and miss type of director.  He did a good job with 'Die Hard 2' and 'Cliffhanger' but failed miserably with 'The Adventures of Ford Fairlane' and now with 'Driven'.  Most car racing films have fallen short of quality because there has never been a great one.  Ok, ok, maybe for a trashy guilty pleasure you can still watch Reynolds in 'Smokey and the Bandit' and 'The Cannonball Run', movies still on target for a memorable late show on Saturday night.  On a present note, avoid all movies with Estella Warren, who, with 'Driven' and 'Planet of the Apes' is emerging as the worst good looking actress in movies today.  She's bound to fade into oblivion just like Milla Jovovich.
