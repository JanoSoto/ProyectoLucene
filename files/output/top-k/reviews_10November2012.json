[{"date":"10 November 2012","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Woah, woah, woah.... I'm seeing the term brilliant satire being tossed around in these reviews far too much. (I think I saw a comparison to Dr. Strangelove! I hope Kubrick hunts you down and punches you in the face).This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.As for plot, it is essentially the same thing as Canadian Bacon (2 years prior, imo infinitely times funnier and smarter than this). Which is not necessarily a bad thing if it weren't so haphazardly thrown together.The movie begins a bit in medias res, and awkwardly introduces you to the situation and this Albanian idea without a single laugh. Robert Di Nero (who I usually like) is clearly just playing a poorly developed caricature of himself; Dennis Hoffman (who I love) is occasionally good for a chuckle, but the whole producer persona and dialogue just gets old, boring, and unrelatable after the first scene; and then there's this 'who are you?' Anne Heche character who's only purpose in the story is to praise Di Nero's character for his brilliance (cause he's not actually brilliant! O trolololol that's hilarious....) Then these characters (who we could not care less about or relate to) go on a bunch of farcical adventures, which would usually be a dynamite recipe for comedy, but again, we just don't care about or even understand these characters and their motivations&#x85; Overall this movie might not be the worst satire ever, but it certainly is an awful movie &#x96; proof that good actors and a good idea cannot make up for a hideous screen play.
