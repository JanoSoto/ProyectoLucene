In fact, as the polity that he founded now encompasses 1\/6 of humanity and will in time regain at least some of the powerful presence it still had just 200 years ago, Ying Zheng\/Qin Shihuang can be said to impinge more directly on our contemporary lives than those colossi of far western Eurasian history, perhaps as much as someone much closer to our time like Philip II of Spain or Napoleon Bonaparte.Chen Kaige has done justice to the First Emperor and to the world which created him and which he in turn shaped.  Of the world of 3rd century B.C.E. China, of the period known succinctly as the era of the Warring States, he offers us a faithful reconstruction, wonderful and full of marvels.The film is a great antidote to the tendency of Westerners to view China as changeless.  For those whose images of China are based on films like The Last Emperor or even Marco Polo, the world of the First Emperor will come as a revelation, so utterly different is it.  For those accustomed to seeing the artwork of the period, the film will satisfy the longing of their imagination's eye to see what all those isolated artifacts (bronzes, bamboo scrolls, murals, and above all the haute couture) might have looked like in their proper context.Far more valuable, however, than the reconstruction of material life is the evocation of the mental universe of the time.  This movie does not serve up any easy black-and-white caricatures which could give succor and solace to contemporary ideologues of whatever persuasion.  Both the Qin king and his enemies, the rulers of the other kingdoms, are portrayed as championing a morally justifiable cause  the latter the preservation of their individual countries' independence and their proud ancestral traditions (with a fanaticism which reminds one of WWI Europe) and the former the unification of the known world to bring peace and prosperity to the common people of whatever fatherland (again reminiscent of 20th century global politics). The drama turns on the eternal and universal  question of whether the ends justify the means, depicting this in the shift in the major characters' loyalties away from a leader whose mounting cruelties render his declared noble aims emptier and emptier.Now we come to the treasure of the film which is accessible to all viewers, not merely Chinese ones or those whom history as history can engage. Ying Zheng's cruelties are put in the context not merely of a fable about the excesses of absolute power but of an account of the vagaries of specific human lives -- that of the king of Qin himself but also of his lady and of his assassin. Ying Zheng's, at least, are founded on the historical tradition (meaning historiography worthy of Tacitus but also gossip worthy of Suetonius).  He is shown as having a troubled childhood, a hostage in a foreign country and even, in a sense, orphaned.  This past haunts him as surely as do the shades of the Qin royal ancestors, speaking through the figure of a Master of Rites who presents the paradox of a  youthful face and an austere, unbending voice, a clever device evoking timelessness and stressing the irrevocability of duty.In visual terms, the movie reminds one of Kurosawa's Ran with its court ceremonial and battle scenes (and of his Hidden Fortress with its glimpses of the life of commoners).  It does lack the dramatic tightness of Ran, but after all Emperor is not an adaptation of a play of genius but rather a staging of a synthesis of disparate chapters from Sima Qian's 2nd century B.C.E. classic, The Records of the Historian.  The film bears better comparison with another glorious film, however imperfect Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible.Some of the sense of dramatic incoherence comes directly from the fact that one has to be Chinese and steeped in Chinese lore or a foreigner versed in that history to appreciate the seeming detours the plot is taking.  I myself had gotten fuzzy enough on the history to wonder why a certain plotline was given as much attention as it was, but then I heard one line of dialogue which obliquely reminded me of one crucial fact (or rumor become legend), and the point of an entire sequence of scenes came to me.  Viewers who do not know the history, however, will still get the same point after watching the subplot to its end.Despite the fact that certain scenes (fittingly palace scenes) are done in the stilted manner of Chinese opera dialogue (which style can be enjoyed, of course, in its own terms), the language was overall straightforward.  I can say this as a person whose Mandarin has gotten rusty but who can still match up 80% of the heard dialogue to the subtitles.  Much is lost in translation naturally but also some things might even have been corrected for instance, the Mandarin word guojia which could sound to modern Chinese ears in its modern sense of nation is translated as empire which might more clearly reflect the way Qin Shihuang may have meant it (if indeed he actually ever used that particular word).  The various solutions for translating the key word Tianxia, meaning both the known human world and supreme political power are, however, less felicitous.  The subtitles may in fact contribute to a more accurate historical reconstruction at the cost of obscuring a message about nationalism aimed at a contemporary Chinese audience (what message that might be is a debate in itself!).The Emperor and the Assassin is high ENTERTAINMENT, which is to say it is a true EDUCATION.

I must confess to being a little disturbed at seeing 17 and 21-year-old girls (though both presented as 16 year olds) having to perform topless shots, though not the elder Annette Bening, who keeps her blouse and bra on even for sex scenes. Okay, that's a knee-jerk reaction I admit, but seeing a virtual minor disrobing is a little disconcerting in a movie. Then again there is much about American Beauty that is subversive. Does this film contain the most prominent usage of cannabis on celluloid? There is no moral debate about its use; other than it makes you high.It's hard to describe what the film is actually about, as it has so many themes and issues coursing through it without it ever feeling forced or scattershot in it's approach.

We are never allowed to make up our own minds about what is being played out on screen, there is no ambiguity or need for interpretation.

That's not to say that American Beauty is dumb - far from it. Just that every nuance, every satirical barb is spoon-fed with a saccharine coating so that no effort is required on behalf of its audience.

We all hoped he would choose his projects wisely (from what I have heard about American Psycho, he was wise to turn it down).If hindsight were 20\/20, one could argue for his passing on The Beach as well, the film adaptation of wonder boy Alex Garland's novel, which I have not read. The source material notwithstanding, this is a grim tale that goes everywhere you don't expect. Usually this would be a good thing, but this project meanders endlessly as we take a trip through the slowly fragmenting mind of Richard (Leo), an adventurous twentysomething just looking for a little excitement in his life.Richard's journey begins in Thailand, where he stays in the world's worst motel and ends up living next to Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle), a dope-smoking psychotic raving about a hidden beach on an island paradise. Because Richard doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life and he's real bored, he buys the story, takes Daffy's map, and sets out to find the island. He even finds two more suckers willing to be stupid with him, the lovely Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet), French lovers traveling together (but of course, it's Leo and poor Etienne never stands a chance).When they finally find the island, the film becomes a bit humorous (intentionally, I think) as we meet its inhabitants, basically a bohemian mini-culture living in complete seclusion from the world, calling themselves Parallel Universe.

Also like a roller coaster, once the ride is over, you don't take anything home with you and there isn't much of substance that needs to be said.I really enjoyed this ride.  I think it is among the best of its genre.  But calling it one of the greatest...etc, etc--that's a leap I'm not willing to make.  The acting styles and dialogue are campy, and I the plot certainly can not be supported by any rational argument; rather it is something that, like religion, requires a leap of faith to buy into. Examples1.  Everyone, including the agents evidently, can be killed by a single bullet.  If this is not true, then why (other than the visceral thrill of it) all the gymnastics to avoid them?  If it is true, then it is absurd to think that their bodies could withstand even a fraction of the pummeling they receive at each other's hands.  Everyone gets punched, kicked, hurled, and driven into (occasionally through) plaster walls, only to emerge unscathed but ready to dodge that next damn bullet. 2.  <<SPOILER FOLLOWS!>>  The energy delivered by the captive human embryos to support The Matrix must, of course, be less than the energy required to support them, making their use illogical.  (Reference The Law of the Conservation of Energy.) 3.  The function of The Kiss at the end is really getting into the shaky ground of Dramatic License.  I know that the film is chock full of Jesus symbolism, so it is required that <<SPOILER FOLLOWS!>> Neo dies and then comes back to life.  But, as in the case of Jesus, it does require a major leap of faith to embrace the idea--and drama is not religion.  Personally, I get the impression that the writers just wrote themselves into a dramatic wall, and required an unmotivated miracle--literally--to get out of it. In the context of the action\/thriller film genre, I think the examples I've quoted above are really trivial.  But when an attempt is made to glorify The Matrix as a film masterpiece, that changes the yardstick entirely.Really, I liked The Matrix quite a lot.  As an action\/thriller film, I think it is about as good as they get.  But it is an amusement park ride and little more.  When the ride is over, you either get off, or get back on for another go; but you certainly don't claim to have had a spiritual experience in the process.

But it will be for the dumb ideas rotting your brain.We find British diplomat Robert Conway helping white people escape revolution in China only to have their plane hijacked -- to Shangrila.  Turns out Conway wants to solve the looming war in Europe by having the good guys lay down their arms and welcome the invaders.  I suppose Neville Chamberlain's agreement with the Nazis really kept Britain out of the war....Amazingly the fleeing white characters fail to notice the reason the 10,000 peasants in China are about to be slaughtered is because they are unarmed and defenseless against the conquering hordes.  No need to worry about little details like  this however since it pays to be idealistic.  If you're good at heart you get to go to Shangrila, even if your policies result in genocide, mass murder and totalitarian domination for the rest of the world.  Gag me with a spoon, I gotta hurl.Premise, story, and acting aside this film is competently crafted.  The Max Steiner music score is excellent as usual, and the sets and cinematography are great, easily some of the best from Hollywood's golden age.  The restored version now in stores is very clean, though several of the missing segments are filled in with stills and voiceovers, and the effect is a bit jarring, like cutting to a slide show.This would be an entertaining film if it had more of a Wizard of Oz sentimentality.

The spouses of two air crash victims go about the routines of their lives as the news of the disaster creeps into the fringes of their consciousness.  As most of us do, they regard the news with a disconnected interest, another news story about strangers dying.  Suddenly, it occurs to Dutch (Harrison Ford) that his wife said she was going to Miami and he discovers two awful truths, that she was killed and that she was traveling with another man.  He then informs the wife of that man that her husband was on the plane.  The treatment of this entire chain of events was extraordinarily well done.Unfortunately, after this the story bogs down and becomes highly contrived.  Dutch then becomes obsessed with knowing everything about the illicit relationship.  This is almost believable.  But he also drags Kay, (Kristin Scott Thomas) into the vortex and they develop this complicated relationship of grief, passion and maybe even love.  Not so believable.The microscopic character study that ensues of the complex emotions and reactions of the characters is well done, but the viewers find themselves wondering why they have to watch it since most sane people would just have let it go.  After all, the offenders are dead, and little is to be gained by knowing the details of the betrayal.The story also introduces a completely superfluous subplot about the pursuit of a crooked cop by Dutch, a detective in internal affairs.

This character was far more complex than any he ever attempted and Ford didn't have the range necessary to give a satisfying performance.  He was fine in the cop scenes, but in the scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas he was overly subdued, almost like he was medicated.

Very little was known about it and many things were masked by the media. It was one of the few movies that shows that not only the US army is right and the 'enemies' or the opponents are simply a bunch bad and clumsy soldiers. This is the usual trend regardless of whether the enemies are Germans , Russians, Arabs or Vietnamese. In this movie there was an encounter between four American soldiers and Iraqis that belong to several groups. It was clearly shown in which bad conditions the people are living under suppression and in a destroyed country. It was also the first encounter of these American soldiers with war at all since they were sitting in their camps waiting that the air raids and the other allied forces finish the job. Many mistakes of this war were shortly mentioned in smart short commentaries like mentioning burying the Iraqi soldiers alive in their barricades with bulldozers. In fact many dialogs and statements met some sensible issues of this war like bombarding civilians. It demonstrated as well what a bullet can do to the human body and that it is not only a game! It showed the Americans, the Iraqi soldiers and the population of south Iraq as human beings with their strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless one can not expect a Hollywood movie to be completely non-hollywoodic. For instance the end of the movie was rather traditional. Also the American soldiers can shoot better than the Iraqis although the latter ones are members of the elite troops. The movie had even humor in some scenes although sometimes one doesn't know whether one should laugh or cry! The photography was very good and it served its purpose efficiently. Special photographic effects were used like altering the contrasts , the brightness and the graininess of the pictures scenes to enhance their beauty. The music was also generally well chosen and fitted good. In my opinion there was nothing special about the acting performance of the main characters. In general the roles of the Arabs were more convincing or let us say more natural. I am still asking myself why does this movie have this name? Although they were four soldiers only three are mentioned. Is this a similar case like the 'Three musketeers'? Does it have anything to do with the three kings of the new testament? It is maybe like this since they gave a big gift to a group of poor refugees at the end of the movie. Some other comments suggested nominating this movie for the academy award. Well I think it is too good to win an academy award!  ","genre":null},{"date":"1 March 2000","score":"","review":"  I wanted to watch this movie because very few movies were made about this war.

To Catch a Thief is a film which is unlikely to feature as a Hitchcock masterpiece. Cary Grant playing a common, yet somehow sophisticated mastermind thief is not the most convincing of characters, even if the character comes packaged with being debonair, suave and a tux worn from time to time. Yet the film is inviting. It has sameness and flaws later perfected in North by Northwest, including protective Mothers, false accusations relating to suave, debonair men and great chase sequences over the extensive region of either Europe or the Americas. Although neither Grant or Grace Kelly perform at their highest levels, their glamorous, romantic roles are intimate and a whole lot of fun.  By no means is the Oscar winning cinematography the best point of the movie, although quite a breathtaking marvel for its time.
