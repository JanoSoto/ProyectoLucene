[{"date":"8 June 2004","score":"","review":"  You won't see much in Pitch Black that hasn't already been done a few times before, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining anyway.  The basic premise is that a ragtag group of space travelers crash on a planet that has three suns and no nights.  Or so they think.  Adding to the problem of escaping this seemingly deserted planet is the problem of Riddick, a serial killer who survives the crash and almost immediately escapes from the man who is supposed to be watching him.  But, as they find out, there is an alien organism lurking in the shadows that is much more of a threat to their survival than Riddick is.What makes this movie good boils down to David Twohy and Vin Diesel.  Twohy's resourcefulness is showcased here, by the fact that he made this film on a $23 million budget when films that cost twice as much often look much worse.  His visual stylings and guiding hand create a spooky atmosphere, and the deliberately paced film consistently builds tension as it moves along.  And Diesel, who might not be the best actor in the world, is however perfectly cast in the role of Riddick.  He is imposing and intimidating all the way through.  To enjoy this one you have to accept it for what it is, a B-movie concept with a modest budget that is well executed by its director and cast.  It's a given in a movie like this that there will be some shaky acting, cheesy dialogue, and plot holes.  You just have to be willing to let that slide.  Beyond those flaws Pitch Black is a very slick, entertaining sci-fi horror movie with a lot of excitement and a some good laughs, some intentional and some not, along the way.  All in all a fun update of grade-B science fiction.

In fact, some of the movies he directed were better than just good e.g. 'The Trip' and 'Bloody Mama'. His early reputation mainly rests on his quickie monster movies, and 'It Conquered The World' is one of the most entertaining. So okay, it a low budget movie (and I mean LOW), it's very naive and the special effects are poor. The Venusian monster and the flying bat things will probably inspire fits of giggles in most people, but despite all that the movie has lots of energy and it hooks you straight in. It's also helped enormously by having an above average cast. The two leads are Peter Graves and Lee Van Cleef. Graves later became immortal on TV as Mr. Phelps in 'Mission Impossible', and Van Cleef became a Western icon via his work in movies such as 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' and 'Death Rides A Horse'. Van Cleef gives an intense performance as a scientist obsessed with communication with aliens. Graves is his more level headed colleague. When Van Cleef intercepts messages from an extraterrestrial that only he can hear, his wife (Beverly Garland) and Graves think he is cracking up. He co-operates with the alien, helping it to try and take over the world. Garland is best known to most people for her later work on TV (e.g.'My Three Sons'), but boy is she sexy here! Hubba! Hubba! Being a Corman movie we shouldn't be surprised to see Dick Miller in the supporting cast. He plays a soldier, as does Jonathan Haze (Seymour in 'Little Shop Of Horrors) 'It Conquered The World' isn't up to the standards of such 1950s SF classics as 'The Incredible Shrinking Man' or 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', but it's lots of fun, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys b-grade movies from this period.

Director Lucio Fulci is equally revered and reviled for his weirdo 80s gore movies such as Zombie Flesh Eaters, City of the Living Dead, and the New York Ripper (a slasher film where the killer has Donald Ducks voice!).The Beyond is often cited as Fulci's best film, and I'm inclined to agree.  Sure, it has little in the way of coherent plot or character development and an often slow pace, but for once it doesn't seem to matter.  While those problems tend to be true of all of Fulci's work, here the film actually achieves a genuine dream-like atmosphere where the gaps in the story and sudden jumps in logic make a sort of strange anti-sense (if you follow me!)The story has another one of those pesky gates of hell being opened up by accident, which seems to be a worryingly easy thing to do.  You'd think it would involve a whole lot of chanting, devil worshipping and virgin sacrificing, but apparently a plumber called Joe knocking through the wrong wall will do the job just as well.Given the disjointed, surreal nature of the film it seems almost pointless to go into too many plot specifics, but through it's course the Beyond has Zombies (of course), people with strange eyes staring into the camera, a cunning reverse of the eyeball scene from Zombi, a woman melted by acid, a man eaten by spiders (or is it a plastecine face being picked at by pipe cleaners?  You decide!), and a crucified Warlock.And if one thing's guaranteed to make a film at least, well I'd say about 15% better, it's a crucified Warlock.This being a Lucio Fulci film it really picks up when the zombies arrive, and while they take their time turning up, they don't disappoint when they do.Apart from the climactic escape from hordes of flesh eating ghouls (which gore fans should note features one of the most classy exploding head effects ever filmed), Fulci also delivers another fine animal vs zombie scene to follow up the shark fight from Zombi.  Here it's zombies vs a dog, which could really have been a film in its own right.The Beyond's greatest achievement though, is that for once Fulci's emphasis on eerie visuals at the expense of story really pays off, with the slow pace and hazy photography lending a genuinely creepy atmosphere, while the use of twisted dream logic really pays off in the climax.Several films have tried to create a surreal, nightmare like quality, but the end of the Beyond seems to nail the disjointed events and geography of dreams better than most (or at least better than most Nightmare on Elm St films!)The Beyond is probably not a film for all tastes, and it's not without flaws.

In one sense, you could say that this film is a tired rip-off of the first one.Julianne Moore isn't right for her role as Clarice Starling. Her distant, uninvolved acting style, so appropriate for her role in Boogie Nights, is a terrible fit in this film. She has all the conviction, intensity, and presence of a wet dishrag. Where Jodie Foster's marvelously expressive face conveyed every thought and feeling of agent Starling in the first film, Moore's disinterested deadpan is more appropriate for the role of an IRS agent or a bored secretary. Yes the system has drained agent Starling physically and emotionally over the last ten years of her career, but Moore just doesn't have the presence of mind to even make that simple implication believable. She just isn't right for the role; even her jog through the woods (another scene lifted from the first movie) is unconvincing. Gary Oldman as the disfigured moneybags is the polar opposite of Moore. Typically, Oldman's performance is over-the-top, a nightmarish clown of cartoonish proportions, mannerisms, and speech. Is there a name for the Oldman Suck? He does it in every role. Watch closely, because it is how you can discern Oldman underneath all the fleshy makeup he will pause for a moment in his speech, and do this little clicking\/sucking sound with his mouth just before he speaks again. He has been doing this little sound in every role since Sid and Nancy. That aside, you'll never be bored with Oldman in the picture, and as with his roles in the Fifth Element, Lost In Space, and Dracula, he is a fascinating figure. He's good at what he does playing wacked-out monsters just on the edge of going completely bonkers. If there was ever a man who loved his career, it must certainly be Oldman. Anthony Hopkins is simply brilliant, and it is fascinating to watch the little details that he puts into the character. His voice changes from one scene to the next, from southern drawl to clipped northeastern highbrow. He is a modern-day vampire, an operatic madman, a kindly schoolteacher, with a voice like warm brandy as he goes about his dark deeds with a casual 'okey-dokey'. Where Oldman has the subtlety of a baseball bat, Hopkins uses his eyes, voice, and body movements to let us know we are watching a man of extraordinary intelligence. His face after seeing Verger again is a rare treat; you can see the wheels turning behind his simultaneously warm and icy stare as he admires his handiwork, unafraid of his captivity. 'I much prefer you this way,' he says, oblivious to his fate as Verger promises torture. In spite of Lechter being featured prominently in the film, Hopkins manages to endow the character with the same degree of mystery which he had in the first film. Along with Geoffrey Rush, Hopkins is one of our greatest living actors. Unfortunately, even given the excellent acting by Oldman and Hopkins, the film wallows in its own self-importance. The music swells repeatedly, drumming into our heads that Lechter is evil. Where in the first film much of the violence was implied, and thus more frightening, in this tired sequel we see more of Lechter's mayhem than we care to. Where the ending is supposed to be shocking, it is instead a cheap gimmick, lifted straight from the storyline of a teen horror film. On top of all that, Lechter was laughably easy to catch at the mall. That a man with such advanced intelligence would allow himself to be caught so easily just didn't make any sense and did not match the character. And Mason cutting off his own face with a shard of broken mirror made absolutely no sense at all. For one thing, why did Lechter order him to do it? For another, why did Mason do it? It was a silly and stupid plot twist. And, lest there is any doubt that the film deserves its rightful place among banal mediocrity, the man-eating pigs are only slightly less irritating than the chimpanzee which usually shows up in sub-standard films.

Featuring a massive cast, an extravagant budget, and an epic sweep that brings it from the Forbidden City to Manchuria to the streets of Bejiing, it chronicles a half-century of history and the life of China's last emperor, Henry Pu Yi.It is not a film for everyone. At times it is decidedly opaque; the acting is unspectacular, and the story is slow moving. If you want a dramatic, fantastic epic, go see Braveheart or Lord of the Rings.But if you're in the right state of mind, Last Emperor is spectacular. Much of the story centers around the title character's life in a communist re-education camp, told in flashbacks as he comes to grips with his life and the parts he played. For years a prisoner in his own palace, held captive by the winds of change in China, he becomes tyrant and puppet-emperor of Manchuko, the Imperial Japanese puppet state, and collaborator. In his own mind, he has finally ascended to greatness, but we see how sad and utterly pathetic he has become. When the war ends, and he is captured by the communists, he is confronted with the reality of his own sad life, and forced to come to grips with it. The conflict between inner and outer perceptions characterizes most of the film.The Last Emperor is remarkably even-handed in its portrayal of the various political factions. This is probably due to the fact that almost every nation portrayed contributed in some matter to its production. There are no winners, and as we see the chaos of the 1920s and Chiang Kai-Shek lead to the tyranny of the Japanese occupation and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution, we are left with a sense that history is fulfilling itself, again and again and again. We see Pu Yi's helplessness and impotency firsthand, that even as China moves from the 15th to the 20th century that men do not change. They can only come to grips with their own actions and accept responsibility for their deeds. And yet, life goes on.The Last Emperor is a somber, artistically reflective piece, and one of the best films of the late 20th century.

The story is interesting, but some scenes are fairly outlandish, and may take repeated viewings to understand. In short, you should probably watch this film if you're a film buff wanting something different, a novice filmmaker, or someone whose more interested in the the artistic\/thematic ideas that film is able to capture. If you're looking for a night's worth of entertainment however, than this is definitely not your movie, and a waste of your time. You have to approach this film with a patient and willingly open perspective, and only then, you may be able to get a glimpse of what Godard is trying to do.A french-speaking American private-eye, Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constanine), sets out for the dystopia, Orwellian Alphaville, intent on stopping the master computer of the city, Alpha 60, and its inventor, Doctor Von Braun. He eventually meets up and falls in love with Natasha Von Braun (played by the ineluctable Anna Karina). There are many very admirable things Godard does with the plot, and how he is able to make a futuristic environment with relatively low-budget and common film-noir streets is a feat of creative imagination. The composition of some of the shots are a marvel to behold, and some of the framing of the conversation scenes with Natasha really capture the beauty of actress Anna Karina. However, Godard does take the experimentation to an extreme degree in some situations, (i.e. the inverse color vision, the strange dance\/pose fight scene, random uses of a gun), but the one thing I did like was the use of the distorted voice of Alpha 60 and the directly Orwellian philosophical overtones (many of the ideas from the script are ripped straight out of 1984).In summary, watch this film more for the ideas (artistic, cinematic), and not for its potential to entertain. If you don't try so hard looking for a pleasing, entertaining experience, you'll find out that there's a lot to appreciate about this movie. Just try to examine its aspects and individual strengths and scene compositions, and perhaps after repeated viewings, you'll begin to maybe see and appreciate the originality of Godard's vision.

From Edmund Gwenn's (great casting) larking cutthroat to George Sanders' wry snobbery to Eddie Conrads's eyebrow-rustling Latvian, Hitchcock puts together a very light-hearted setting.  Into this brush of sparkling romance, hack journalism, and amateur politics comes a nest of Axis spies.  The McGuffin is a particular clause of a peace treaty, and our cast is whirled around this center.  Many of the set-pieces-- the assassination, the windmill, the crash landing-- are virtuosi in themselves but are not meant to distract from a weak script, unlike many of today's films.  The main plot, the secret kidnapping of a diplomat, keeps its steam.  Subplot #1, the romance between lovely Laraine Day and McCrea, is charming and believable.  Subplot #2, the intrigue, is masterfully handled by Hitch, and it is his forte.  When first viewing this, you will be glued to the screen, attempting to figure things out before Hitchcock, in typical fashion, releases the pressure by revealing some secret thing.

The cast are all likable characters - especially the sensitive Mikey, the loud Mouth, the inventive Data, the lovable Chunk (who could forget 'The Truffle Shuffle'!), the clumsy Fratelli family (especially the brilliant Anne Ramsay - now sadly deceased) & the heroic Sloth (Hey you guys!).Some of the actors have continued their success - Corey Feldman (Mouth) went on to the aforementioned Stand By Me & Gremlins (then sadly made less successful films), Sean Astin (Mikey) has made himself immortal in the movies as he played Samwise in Peter Jackson's awesome Lord Of The Rings trilogy, Josh Brolin (Brad) has continued to work in films & Martha Plimpton has gained critical acclaim for her theatre work.The movie has all you need for a couple of hours of pure escapism - a treasure map, an secret underground passage, booby traps, pirates and of course the good old good vs evil.The Goonies has stood the test of time 20 years later. If you remember this film from your childhood I urge you to re-visit it - you won't be disappointed. A bone-fide movie classic!

This movie has a good cast, an okay plot line, but the ending is so predictable. From the beginning to the end I knew exactly what was going to happen. I've seen many reviews saying it keeps you suspended, but it really isn't like that. Other than having a predictable and an obvious ending, it's okay. It has a respectable cast. Gabriel Byrne and the rest of the stars in the movie are excellent. Plot line, other than being obvious, is once again okay.This movie definitely doesn't deserve all the attention it's been getting and its way overrated. I've seen many movies which are twice as good as this one and have a lower rating. I got bored after the first 30 minutes since it became so obvious what was going to happen. I would give this movie a 5.5\/10.  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 June 2004","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  I don't understand the big fuss about this movie.
