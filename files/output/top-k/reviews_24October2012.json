I have Seasons 1 - 9 all on DVD and i bought recently the movie on DVD too. I watch the movie so far twice and i absolutely love it so so so much. The series is awesome but the movie is best one ever so far i love it so much. The movie was shot on a lot of locations the same as the story follows. The movie continue the run from the end of the fifth season where Season 5 end it and The X - Files got close. The movie begins here. The story follows Thirty-seven thousand years ago, a deadly secret was buried in a cave in Texas. Now the secret has been unleashed. And its discovery may mean the end of all humanity. When a terrorist bomb destroys a building in Dallas, Texas, FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are drawn into a dangerous conspiracy surpassing anything they've ever encountered. With the dubious assistance of a paranoid doctor (Martin Landu), Mulder and Scully risk their careers and their lives to hunt down a deadly virus which may be extraterrestrial in origin - and could destroy all life on earth. Their pursuit of truth pits them against the mysterious Syndicate, powerful men who will stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe, leading the agents from the cave in Texas, to the halls of the FBI, and finally to a secret installation in Antarctica which holds the greatest secret of all. Terry O'Quinn also stars as Darius Michaud FBI Agent who leaves that terrorist's bomb explodes in the building so they can cover the truth about the deadly alien virus. Chris Carter & Frank Spotnitz are awesome writers with story and amazing job by Rob Bowman as the Director of the movie. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are amazing as FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The movie is the best i am glad that William B. Davis is also here as Cigarette Smoking Man and The Well-Manicured Man portrayed by John Neville are also here. Gosh i miss John Neville so so so much in Next Seasons in The X - Files. The Lone Gunmen are also here is mayor part in this movie. So far i have seen only the first seven seasons. Did not see the Eight and Nine Season yet but i will start watching it. The X - Files series are so awesome but the movie is the best one of all X - Files. I can't wait to see someday second movie The X Files I Want to Believe. I heard some badly critics about that movie and some fans were really disappointed, i hope i wan't be. The X - Files movie is really awesome the best one best one. I vote 10\/10.

I oddly put it off so much and then decided that one day, where I had nothing else to do, I decided to pick up The Rocky Horror Picture Show and give it a good shot. I thought to myself at the time, if I don't like this film, I'm glad I would've given it a try. I had put it off for so long, but I found that after I viewed this well crafted, colorful 1975 masterpiece, my views totally changed.The story is quite simple and it contrasts very well with the songs and strong cast. The entire film round was not a creepy, scary or clich√©'d horror film. It never intended to be a dark, gory or sad horror film which depicted disturbance or shock. Instead, for me, it was a massive change that I have ever encountered when watching a horror film. This film was oddly bizarre and crazy. It had the typical themes of musicals and horror aspects going for it, but it overall produced and presented a light hearted value which I had never seen before in many horror films.Sure there were killings, but the crazy chase scenes, the bizarre acting from the cast (especially Susan Sarandon and most notably Tim Curry) and the fantastic musical scores kept this horror film on the lighter side of things. I was never afraid of it.I have to strongly point out that Tim Curry as the wickedly posh\/stylish doc was really impressive. As a kid, I first saw him in Muppet Treasure Island where he didn't do to badly with the script he was given. Then the 2nd film I saw him in was Stephen King's IT where to me his performance was a great improvement from the last as he was able to pull off a very scary and sadistically insane clown which showed much humor. But in this, my gosh... it was the best acting I have ever seen in his films.His character was fascinating as I watched the way he did his moves and actions on screen. He truly brang a memorable horror character to the table. The make-up, attire and light-hearted accents also gave a chime of great contrast to the way he started to sing songs.Many of the other cast were strong including Susan Sarandon who I had never seen in a roll like this. I first saw her in The Lovely Bones where she didn't do a bad job, with the little amount of time she had on screen. Then in Dead Man Walking, she did an excellent job and it was a powerful and very provoking performance. In this, I just didn't expect her to play such an out-going roll, where she would prance and 'let the guilt go'. Even if she was excellent here, I just found it so odd to see her in a role like this one.Lastly, the musicals were excellent. Many musicals don't work, but this one kicks the nut out of the shell. Tim Curry especially is the pioneer in mastering the skills and techniques of the way the musicals were shown, contrasted and revealed.Overall, it a classic but very unusual horror film which shows a lot more than your average dark, gory film. Most of the 1970's films were excellent, but the age they were made in were so grim and bleak. Especially films like TCM, Halloween, Wickerman, The Omen or Dawn of the Dead. This film really caught me by surprise with its musicals contrasting with acting and scenarios.Its a good ol' Trabsvestite! 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember seeing the trailer for this film many times and also hearing about how great this horror film was.

Campbell Jr. story Who Goes There? on which it was based. This science fiction horror film is directed by John Carpenter and written by Bill Lancaster.It features Kurt Russell together with Wilford Brimley,Keith David,Donald Moffat and Charles Hallahan. The title refers to its primary antagonist a parasitic extraterrestrial lifeforms that assimilates other organisms and in turn imitates them.It infiltrates an Antarctic research station, taking the appearance of the researchers that it absorbs, and paranoia occurs within the group.Carpenter's film is more faithful to Campbell's story than Hawks' version and also substantially more reliant on special effects, provided in abundance by a team of over 40 technicians, including veteran creature-effects artists Rob Bottin and Stan Winston.The screenplay opens enigmatically with a Siberian Husky running through the Antarctic tundra, chased by two men in a helicopter firing at it from above. Even after the dog finds shelter at an American research outpost, the men in the helicopter land and keep shooting. One of the Norwegians drops a grenade and blows himself and the helicopter to pieces; the other is shot dead in the snow by Garry, the American outpost captain. American helicopter pilot MacReady and camp doctor Copper fly off to find the Norwegian base and discover some pretty strange goings-on. The base is in ruins, and the only occupants are a man frozen to a chair and the burned remains of what could be one man or several men. In a side room, Copper and MacReady find a coffin-like block of ice from which something has been recently cut. That night at the American base, the Husky changes into the Thing, and the Americans learn first-hand that the creature has the ability to mutate into anything it kills. For the rest of the film the men fight a losing battle against it, never knowing if one of their own dwindling number is the Thing in disguise.The Thing is a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina- wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror.This is one of Carpenter's greatest moments, creating a terrifying atmosphere of claustrophobia, suspense and paranoia. And Kurt Russell is as good as he's ever been, wearing one of the best beards in movie history.Added to that,the special effects can't hope to be as creepy to our seen-it-all eyes as they were to the film's first viewers, but we can still enjoy the monster's unique weirdness, and the story is a rock-solid yarn.And most of all,it is not just an excellent remake, it's an excellent movie, and an almost perfect horror movie as it shows more originality, wit and invention than possibly any other film in its category.Also,it is as influential as Alien for its blend of action, sci-fi and chilling horror.Finally,it is a masterpiece.

It is even, dare I say it (and I will), superior to Whale's original 1931 film, possibly because he didn't have his usual producer, Carl Laemmle, breathing down his neck. He could do whatever he wanted, and here he decided to start the film with what is, at least to me, almost something post-modern (and this before modernism, or during it!) where the Shellys, Percy and Mary, talk with Lord Byron about the Frankenstein story, ruminating on what happens in the original story (accompanied by film clips, and while this takes place technically 90 years after the Shellys\/Byron lived, pay it no mind), and then Mary takes a bit of a leap what comes after, and more specifically, what about if that Monster lived and didn't die in that windmill fire? Eh, eh? This film also carries the distinction of being funnier and fresher than the original film, in part because Whale had to realize some of this stuff was silly, and even surreal; when the other, much-more-mad-thank- Frankenstein doctor Pretorius (the unforgettable Ernest Thesiger playing this role with full-tile scene-chewery in the best way) shows off his 'creations' as little people he has grown like plants in little jars, you know that this won't be really much like the first film. And yet, it is in some ways still a movie about a big Monster going about without control... and yet learning a bit more control, but unfortunately at the lead of a mad Doc like Pretorius, who promises the big galut something much more tangible and, frankly, emotional than what he's had in his limited time as the un-dead a woman 'friend', a Bride all his own. Hey, if forced marriage worked for thousands of years before, why not with Good-Bad man?The script is full of some good zingers, like Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be much more amusing if we were all devils, no nonsense about angels and being good. And there are moments where real pathos does come in, and the idea of the Monster being humanized is brought even more to the forefront than in the (great) scene of the Monster and the girl by the lake in the first film; when the Monster stumbles upon a cabin in the woods where a blind man plays violin and draws him in because of it (and because he can't see) we get one of the most poignant, simple couple of scenes in any horror film. There's some humor, but it's mostly about what can happen when one isn't immediately AAAH! in front of the Monster, which only goes to agitate and get the Monster to attack more, and there is an attempt at civility, respect, and knowledge, even about something like bread as food and smoking (also Good and look at Karloff's face, what a happy camper).The atmosphere, especially in the climactic tower scenes, is rich with the dark and gloom, but it's surprising how much light the film is, a lot of it in the day, and even a scene where the Monster breaks out of jail isn't quite as scary because of it. Whale does know that some of this is blatantly silly, and that's more than fine. In a way his direction, as well as Karloff's performance and other things like Una O'Connor as the (also) unforgettable housekeeper who comes into a room and with only a line or two steals the rug out from all the other actors, is ahead of its time. I think even something like the evil doctor's plan and the collaboration with Frankenstein to make this Bride is so clever as to have its own logic outside of horror. Bride of Frankenstein will work as something to chill and entertain the kids, or the adults, but there's other layers to it that I hope to return to in years ahead.We belong DEAD!

He could do whatever he wanted, and here he decided to start the film with what is, at least to me, almost something post-modern (and this before modernism, or during it!) where the Shellys, Percy and Mary, talk with Lord Byron about the Frankenstein story, ruminating on what happens in the original story (accompanied by film clips, and while this takes place technically 90 years after the Shellys\/Byron lived, pay it no mind), and then Mary takes a bit of a leap what comes after, and more specifically, what about if that Monster lived and didn't die in that windmill fire? Eh, eh? This film also carries the distinction of being funnier and fresher than the original film, in part because Whale had to realize some of this stuff was silly, and even surreal; when the other, much-more-mad-thank- Frankenstein doctor Pretorius (the unforgettable Ernest Thesiger playing this role with full-tile scene-chewery in the best way) shows off his 'creations' as little people he has grown like plants in little jars, you know that this won't be really much like the first film. And yet, it is in some ways still a movie about a big Monster going about without control... and yet learning a bit more control, but unfortunately at the lead of a mad Doc like Pretorius, who promises the big galut something much more tangible and, frankly, emotional than what he's had in his limited time as the un-dead a woman 'friend', a Bride all his own. Hey, if forced marriage worked for thousands of years before, why not with Good-Bad man?The script is full of some good zingers, like Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be much more amusing if we were all devils, no nonsense about angels and being good. And there are moments where real pathos does come in, and the idea of the Monster being humanized is brought even more to the forefront than in the (great) scene of the Monster and the girl by the lake in the first film; when the Monster stumbles upon a cabin in the woods where a blind man plays violin and draws him in because of it (and because he can't see) we get one of the most poignant, simple couple of scenes in any horror film. There's some humor, but it's mostly about what can happen when one isn't immediately AAAH! in front of the Monster, which only goes to agitate and get the Monster to attack more, and there is an attempt at civility, respect, and knowledge, even about something like bread as food and smoking (also Good and look at Karloff's face, what a happy camper).The atmosphere, especially in the climactic tower scenes, is rich with the dark and gloom, but it's surprising how much light the film is, a lot of it in the day, and even a scene where the Monster breaks out of jail isn't quite as scary because of it. Whale does know that some of this is blatantly silly, and that's more than fine. In a way his direction, as well as Karloff's performance and other things like Una O'Connor as the (also) unforgettable housekeeper who comes into a room and with only a line or two steals the rug out from all the other actors, is ahead of its time. I think even something like the evil doctor's plan and the collaboration with Frankenstein to make this Bride is so clever as to have its own logic outside of horror. Bride of Frankenstein will work as something to chill and entertain the kids, or the adults, but there's other layers to it that I hope to return to in years ahead.We belong DEAD!

Keeping that in mind, any sequel is bound to elicit a measure of disappointment simply because matching or exceeding the peerless kickoff to this series is an impossible feat. But despite an extremely spotty track record, the (admittedly over-)extended Halloween franchise has its share of strong efforts, and this fourth installment certainly deserves to be mentioned in that capacity.The most effective aspect of The Return Of Michael Myers is how closely it adheres to the atmosphere and spirit of the original, and though there is a clear effort made to incorporate some overt bloodshed to please fans of the '80s splatter cycle, Halloween 4 has even more in common with the first Night HE Came Home than the hastily made but suitably enjoyable part II. This offering faithfully duplicates the deceptively ominous leaf-strewn streets of Haddonfield, the manic fervor of the returning Dr. Loomis, and, most importantly, the deadly disposition of The Shape him(it?)self. At this point in the series, we're still a couple of sequels away from quasi-mystical ramblings about ancient Pagan symbols and hip and edgy self-aware contemporary updates, and, thankfully, we're a world removed from Rob Zombie's obtusely trippy white stallion hallucinations. So, the Michael Myers we get here is the same remorseless and unyielding killing machine we were introduced to ten years before, and his purpose is equally singular and inexplicable. That's precisely what makes him the perfect Boogeyman, and Return wisely maintains the air of menace and mystery that later entries watered down by neutering our series figurehead via ridiculous plot elements that were closer to parody than they were to anything resembling horror. Halloween 4 isn't about rappers doing battle with a pop culture serial slayer, it's about a malevolent force stalking and killing anyone who gets in its way, and at least in that sense, the film remains true to its aim.The impetus for the titular Return is Michael's eight year-old niece Jamie Lloyd, the orphaned daughter of the, we're informed, deceased Laurie Strode (H2O et al. decided differently, but this development works for our purposes here). If you can accept the apparent psychic bond that allows Jamie to have nightmares about the uncle she's never seen before he re-appears in Haddonfield and Michael's myopic fixation on murdering a relative he really shouldn't know even exists, this cat-and-mouse aspect of the plot falls into place rather nicely.Jamie is played by the debuting Danielle Harris, who delivers an absolutely fantastic performance, especially given her age and lack of experience. Harris was a great find, and even during the film's most harrowing sequences, her acting chops easily rival those of any of her more seasoned cast-mates. Her youth ends up being a major asset because of its direct deviation from the archetypes of the strict slasher formula, and the fact that a relatively defenseless child is at the nucleus of Michael's murderous rampage heightens the tension immeasurably.Of course, Return does feature its share of goofiness. While the presence of Donald Pleasence is certainly welcome and integral to the story, his occasional dalliances with overblown histrionics create unfortunately cheesy moments out of a few scenes that should be bubbling with intensity. Also, though The Shape is as formidable and sadistic here as fans would hope for, his ability to teleport from an industrial power plant to a suburban neighborhood in the span of one scene, and to apparently hide beneath the chassis of a moving pick-up truck for several miles before climbing into the bed and catching the passengers unaware, strikes a serious blow against the hyper-realism that grounds the most potent terror elements in the series.But despite the sillier aspects here, the film as a whole hits more often than it misses. Several references to Carpenter's benchmark such as an homage to the POV murder which launched the saga and Jamie's donning of a clown costume identical to the one worn by her uncle when he was her age keep part 4 closely tied to its source. Even better, the utilization of a few subtle shots of the iconic ghostly mask hidden deep in the background while the future victims go about their business completely unaware of their peril re-establish the lurking Shape persona which provided the original Halloween with its most indelible images. There's also a mirthful scene between the hitchhiking Dr. Loomis and a drunken fire-and-brimstone religious zealot that allows Pleasence to crack a smile for a change, which will remind savvy viewers of his endearingly coy grin after the Lonnie, get your ass away from there moment from 1978.You'll have to decide for yourself whether the dicey twist ending really works, but it certainly does finish off the film on a tremendously dark and shocking note, which is in keeping with the fairly serious tone Return maintains throughout. Chalk that at as yet another touch which sets this entry apart from some of the unbearably ridiculous drek that followed it.I'm not sure if I can definitively state that this is the best of the Halloween sequels, but it is most assuredly nowhere near the worst.

Poitier, playing again an elegant and well-spoken man, explains that Joey believes her kids would define the values that America stands for, so much that they would be the most likely to rule the country. They could even have a future President as a son, and that they met in Hawaii makes the coincidence even scarier.A visionary moment? Yes, in the sense that it knew the right direction History would take, foreseeing the fact that in 1967, a breakthrough year for USA, and then for movies, American society was needing changes, if not in actions at least in perceptions. The idea of a Black President was mentioned, as a silly possibility because it's too optimistic but that was toward this 'silliness' that society had to tend to. 40 years later, America did it, but the pleasant irony is that Sidney Poitier makes it obvious and natural even in the film's context he's so close to perfect that it goes without saying that this man could be a President regardless of any racial consideration. After To Sir, With Love and In the Heat of the Night, Sidney Poitier embodies the fight for human tolerance by playing a man who was beyond all the archetypes related to his ethnic background, who carried his heritage with pride but also struggled to show that there's more than a pigmentation to define him.All came in three with Stanley Kramer's directed Guess Who's Coming to the Dinner, probably the movie where Poitier delivered his message in the most explicit way, notably in the climactic moment when he confronted his father, with eyes burning with rage. Roger Ebert wondered why Poitier adopted this attitude toward his father, almost accusing him of carrying the weight of the past, while he was ready to accept the refusal of his to-be father-in-law. The question puzzled me but then I compared the three roles that Poitier played in 1967. Whether it's in To Sir, With Love or In the Heat of the Night, he never had to confront one of his 'own', he was the Black man struggling with the Whites, he was like carrying his community's flag and forced despite himself to justify his actions, because he knew that no matter what he believed, people would see the colored man before the man. Yet when it comes to his father, he can't stand it and needs to express the anger he repressed for years.Yet no matter how inspirational is the message, the film is imperfect in the 'deliverance' process. First, there's so much to be against in this marriage beyond the racial issue Joey and John knew each other for 10 days, they almost give an ultimatum to their parents who must give their blessings, Joey's character was too blinded by her love to John that she couldn't figure one second what her parents went through. Matt Drayton didn't dislike John but hated the way they were forcing him to make a decision before he could even put their relationship into perspective and realize that it's definitely a problem of skin. Indeed, it's not a class issue since John is a well-educated man with a bourgeois lifestyle, so the problem is between Matt and himself, the film reaches a very intelligent point, the idea of being unconsciously racist, which compensate others moments where the film dangerously drifts to mindless comedy (I could have done without the camion driver and the foxy chick, unless it was supposed to say something) but overall, the film redeems itself through some powerful moment.The chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy, who loved each other in real-life, is the soul of the film, here are two parents put in a tricky situation, confronted to their principles with the very idealism they inculcated to their daughter is thrown at their faces. Yes, they taught her to respect minorities, not to consider Whites superior, but they simply forgot to mention that she shouldn't marry a Black man. It's an intelligent move because sometimes people realize that they're more conservative than they think, that's 'unconscious' racism. The film also reaches the right emotional moment when John's parents come to dinner to express their disapproval, not one-sided as we'd expect. But the voices they expresses diverge too, the father is upset while the mother, Beah Richard, can see in John and Joey, something simple called passion. The film does give the fathers the bad roles, as if it's the very rationality of men that prevents them from acknowledging the supremacy of love beyond any consideration.Although the transition can seem a bit abrupt, it's when confronted to this thought, while John expresses his rejection of the old Black vs. Whites dichotomy, that Tracy sees the light and invites everyone for a poignant speech, the last cinematic moment of an actor, who died 17 days after the filming. The film makes very powerful statements, with the most emblematic addressed to John's father You see yourself as a colored man. I see myself as a man, it does feel staged but when it's done by such great actors, the flaws are superfluous, and the film turns into an insightful and profoundly human experience that can be seen and seen again, without losing its relevance. By the way, an IMDb user suggested that now that interracial marriage is not a taboo anymore, the film should be remade with a gay couple.

So when he's introduced to Dr. John Prentice, Sidney Poitier as the man who wants to marry his daughter Joey, he asks him a simple question. How would their children live in a country where interracial marriage was still forbidden in many states or at least frowned upon? Poitier, playing again an elegant and well-spoken man, explains that Joey believes her kids would define the values that America stands for, so much that they would be the most likely to rule the country. They could even have a future President as a son, and that they met in Hawaii makes the coincidence even scarier.A visionary moment? Yes, in the sense that it knew the right direction History would take, foreseeing the fact that in 1967, a breakthrough year for USA, and then for movies, American society was needing changes, if not in actions at least in perceptions. The idea of a Black President was mentioned, as a silly possibility because it's too optimistic but that was toward this 'silliness' that society had to tend to. 40 years later, America did it, but the pleasant irony is that Sidney Poitier makes it obvious and natural even in the film's context he's so close to perfect that it goes without saying that this man could be a President regardless of any racial consideration. After To Sir, With Love and In the Heat of the Night, Sidney Poitier embodies the fight for human tolerance by playing a man who was beyond all the archetypes related to his ethnic background, who carried his heritage with pride but also struggled to show that there's more than a pigmentation to define him.All came in three with Stanley Kramer's directed Guess Who's Coming to the Dinner, probably the movie where Poitier delivered his message in the most explicit way, notably in the climactic moment when he confronted his father, with eyes burning with rage. Roger Ebert wondered why Poitier adopted this attitude toward his father, almost accusing him of carrying the weight of the past, while he was ready to accept the refusal of his to-be father-in-law. The question puzzled me but then I compared the three roles that Poitier played in 1967. Whether it's in To Sir, With Love or In the Heat of the Night, he never had to confront one of his 'own', he was the Black man struggling with the Whites, he was like carrying his community's flag and forced despite himself to justify his actions, because he knew that no matter what he believed, people would see the colored man before the man. Yet when it comes to his father, he can't stand it and needs to express the anger he repressed for years.Yet no matter how inspirational is the message, the film is imperfect in the 'deliverance' process. First, there's so much to be against in this marriage beyond the racial issue Joey and John knew each other for 10 days, they almost give an ultimatum to their parents who must give their blessings, Joey's character was too blinded by her love to John that she couldn't figure one second what her parents went through. Matt Drayton didn't dislike John but hated the way they were forcing him to make a decision before he could even put their relationship into perspective and realize that it's definitely a problem of skin. Indeed, it's not a class issue since John is a well-educated man with a bourgeois lifestyle, so the problem is between Matt and himself, the film reaches a very intelligent point, the idea of being unconsciously racist, which compensate others moments where the film dangerously drifts to mindless comedy (I could have done without the camion driver and the foxy chick, unless it was supposed to say something) but overall, the film redeems itself through some powerful moment.The chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy, who loved each other in real-life, is the soul of the film, here are two parents put in a tricky situation, confronted to their principles with the very idealism they inculcated to their daughter is thrown at their faces. Yes, they taught her to respect minorities, not to consider Whites superior, but they simply forgot to mention that she shouldn't marry a Black man. It's an intelligent move because sometimes people realize that they're more conservative than they think, that's 'unconscious' racism. The film also reaches the right emotional moment when John's parents come to dinner to express their disapproval, not one-sided as we'd expect. But the voices they expresses diverge too, the father is upset while the mother, Beah Richard, can see in John and Joey, something simple called passion.

I watch movies like 'The Goonies', or 'Star Wars', or 'Hook', and I get nostalgic and it feels great. Nostalgia can also turn out to be very misleading and delusive. This is pretty much exactly how I felt as I endured an hour and forty-five minutes of 'Tango & Cash'.For those of you lucky enough to not have seen it, it's about Tango (Stallone) and Cash (Russell), two of the best cops on the force, who also happen to be extremely competitive and hateful of each other. When they're framed for a murder, they are forced to pair up and find the real culprit.There's nothing original about the story. Its standard odd couple material, the sort of plot you'd expect from an action comedy (I use that term loosely) in the eighties. But, basically, there's nothing original about anything in the movie. It's all cookie-cutter stuff, with not an ounce of originality. The acting, the characters, the storyline, the action scenes &#x96; it's all so predictable and boring.Probably the one decent thing about the movie is Sylvester Stallone. We all know Kurt Russell has the comic timing but, at that point in his career, Stallone hadn't really gone all-out with comedy. Here, he gets to quip those one-liners usually reserved for the Schwartzneggers of the world. He does a valiant job, and it's fun to see. Teri Hatcher's there, nobody cares. The legendary Jack Palance is there, and nobody cares.My vivid memory of 'Tango & Cash' is a scene where Stallone stops an oncoming lorry simply by standing in front of it and refusing to move. I always get really nostalgic about that sequence. What I'd forgotten was that it's literally the first scene of the movie and, more importantly, I'd forgotten how bad the movie actually is.

Boris Karloff was, apparently, not a known actor by any real stretch, despite working in almost eighty films as a character actor and on stage for quite a while (think about how many actors today could break through at 44?) When combined with Jack Pierce's unique, strange\/deranged make-up, it is quite a sight to see the man transform himself into the un-dead 'brute'. His physicality is what makes him an imposing presence, and it's not so much a scare of where he'll come from, but just seeing his face and shape and knowing what damage he can do. I have to think a little of the Hulk, despite being more about anger, had something in debt to Frankenstein's monster.And there is one truly great scene in the film, where the Monster, after escaping possible dissection by Dr. Frankenstein's mentor (this is actually a scary\/cool bit where he flicks opens his eyes little by little and then attacks suddenly), and comes upon a little girl by a lake. The little girl is very sweet and understanding, not really knowing that it's a monster of the un-dead, and wants to show him some flowers and how they go on a lake. And then, seeing as he doesn't have flowers, he tosses her into the lake as well. What's shocking here are a few things to me 1) the action itself, since it seems so sudden, and yet so inevitable, 2) that the scene was cut-out for many years, and yet, in a way, made the Monster less of a 'gray-area' sort of creature, that there *could* be the potential for understanding and human connection, but severed once he did wrong. And 3) that an audience I saw the film with today (on its one-night-re-release in theaters) thought it was funny. My how times change. The rest of the film has some spooky atmosphere of course, if nothing else cause of the tower where Frankenstein does his experiments (and the set is the Grand-daddy of all sci-fi\/horror film sets where madness and science collide with electricity and gadgets and such). But there's also dated stuff to it as well, and a brief excursion to show the town in excitement and dancing, shot with a not-so-steady tracking shot, doesn't flow well. And outside of Clive, who plays the doctor, I wasn't very keen on a lot of the performances; Baron Frankenstein especially is tough to watch as he ambles about as a gruff 'Well what is the meaning of this such-and-such' sort that is tiresome after the first minute. And a very last scene where the Frankensteins are seemingly beloved again with a 'toast' is extremely bizarre and not in a way I found amusing.But so much of Frankenstein is just cool to watch, maybe just for the iconic 'It's ALIVE! moments, and its beginning which doesn't really waste much time with preamble about who this doctor is right away, he goes for digging up the bod(ies) and getting to work. While a few moments have become sort of laughable, in general Frankenstein still works as one of the keystones of Universal horror, as Whale had a good eye for detail right at the start of the sound era (though one can only imagine what he could have also done in silent film, seeing as how the Monster, in this film, doesn't speak outside of grunts and ROARS).

Chicago (2002) seems to be on the same lines, and I enjoyed that also. This film has given me an unforgettable acting by Julie Andrews as Maria. Her character is inspirational and cheerful all the time. The cinematography, locations esp. when they are singing and running are all an eye candy. I'll always remember the sequence in which the seven children stood in line for the first time. All were looking so good with appropriate heights that you will praise the casting for sure. The movie explores ideas of how to tackle situations and especially when all are against you. It is the belief in you that plays a role to handle them. When you face a problem, go and face them.

Another dialog when the children give the reason for the mischiefs as the way to get the attention of their father is an eye opener. Children doing mischief on a regular basis is an eye-opener and cannot be ignored but to think about carefully. The acting by all is satisfactory with Maria taking most of the credit. The art direction and choreography in many dance sequences is again cute and commendable.

Scripted by Romero based on a novel by Michael Stewart, it tells the story of Allan Mann (handsome Jason Beghe), a law student who gets into a horrible accident that renders him a quadriplegic. He soon becomes despondent enough to attempt suicide, but soon he receives some temporary salvation in the form of Ella (Boo), a capuchin monkey who is trained to see to his needs. What he doesn't know is that his friend Geoffrey (John Pankow) has been playing mad scientist and injecting the cute lil' thing with human brain cells. Soon the bond between patient and helper becomes so strong that a mental connection is made, and Ella is physically acting out Allan's worst impulses. So what is he going to do about this little homicidal primate? Romero does a good job here at telling a fairly interesting story, although some viewers might be turned off at the lack of sympathetic characters. Most of them are flawed to some degree or another - creepy dean Burbage (Stephen Root), smarmy, incompetent doctor Wiseman (Stanley Tucci), fair-weather girlfriend Linda (Janine Turner), bitchy nurse Maryanne (Christine Forrest, a.k.a. Mrs. Romero) - and even a guy like Geoffrey, who initially just wants to help, has his problems as he's obsessed with his work. At least Allan has an appealing love interest played by Kate McNeil, whom horror fans will recognize as the lead in the slasher The House on Sorority Row. The cast is pretty good overall; Joyce Van Patten plays the stereotypically smothering mother to good effect, and it's a treat to see character actors Root and Tucci near the beginnings of their careers, but the one performer the audience is likely to remember is Boo, who's adorable and very well trained; the animal action is first rate throughout (there's also a rather annoying bird on hand). The evolving relationship between Allan and Ella makes for a compelling hook, and it makes one appreciate the real-life efforts that people put into training service animals, and the animals themselves. The film is light on horror - most of the violence is implied - as Romero tends to go for a more psychological approach, and refrains from going for the gore. Overall, this is a decent flick, worth a look for genre fans who are interested in checking out Romero's non-zombie films. Seven out of 10.

Barry Lyndon is a period film starring Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee and Hardy Kr√ºger. It was written, produced, and directed by Kubrick. It is based on the novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray which recounts the exploits of a fictional 18th century Irish adventurer.Young Irishman Redmond Barry leaves home to seek his fortune after apparently killing an English officer in a duel. Through a series of mishaps and accidents, Barry winds up fighting with the Prussian army in the Seven Years' War under the command of Capt. Potzdorf; at war's end, Potzdorf enlists Barry to spy on a shady Chevalier. Instead, Barry joins up with the Irish Chevalier to flee Prussia and live as gamblers among Europe's elite. Wishing to climb even higher, Barry soon meets the beautiful Lady Lyndon, marrying her for her fortune after her older titled husband dies. Her son Lord Bullingdon, however, despises the upstart Barry, and, regardless of how his mother may feel, sees to it that the re-named Barry Lyndon will never be able to stake his claim to the entrenched aristocracy.In 1975 the world was at Stanley Kubrick's feet. His films Dr. Strangelove, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange, released in the previous dozen years, had provoked rapture and consternation--not merely in the film community, but in the culture at large. On the basis of that smashing hat trick, Kubrick was almost certainly the most famous film director of his generation, and absolutely the one most likely to rewire the collective mind of the movie audience. And what did this radical, at-least-20-years-ahead-of-his-time filmmaker give the world in 1975? A stately, three-hour costume drama that now stands as one of his greatest and most savagely ironic films, not to mention one of the few period pieces on celluloid so transporting that it seems to predate the invention of cameras.In addition to that,Ryan O'Neal's excellent performance captures the shallow opportunism endemic to the title character who is brought down as much by his own flaws as by the mores of the ordered social structure of 18th-century England.All of Kubrick's features look better now than when they were first released, but Barry Lyndon, which fared poorly at the box office in 1975, remains his most underrated.

Don Corleone is a bad guy. every one is a bad guy here,they all do bad things,they all do crimes. But you can't escape from the fact that you love Don Corleone(Marlon Brando). The scene that he cries after his son(Sonny)died,made me cry. And I think that's what a movie is all about,You love the bad guys,because They're Good! I guess the Director some how skips the back together part when Micheal and Kay get back together!Or Apolonia(Mike's first wife in the movie)'s death. I guess it was for shortening the movie,or maybe it just Doesn't matter. But Francis Ford Coppola could shorten another scenes. It was a great movie after all,maybe the greatest, I voted 9.

And both of them are fantastic movies, so this clearly isn't a contest. That having been said, Manhunter does have Brian Cox as the psychotic doctor, and it's such a resonant performance. He does so much with so little screen time (seriously, the guy's like a footnote in the grand scheme of things) and you feel like he's a real person. Really scary, 'natch.But Manhunter is above all a Michael Mann film, and that's what I love about it. It has the mood and color use of Miami Vice, a great eye for visual compositions, and it's psycho-thriller-as-police-procedural. There's energy to be found even in the usually mundane lab scenes, so the whole thing comes off understated yet kinetic. It's got a great soundtrack, too, I mean the Red 7 ending just packs a punch.This movie's incredible.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2012","score":"","review":" Since both movies share Dr. Lecter in common, you can't help but compare The Silence of the Lambs with Manhunter.
