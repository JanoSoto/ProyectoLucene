Tommy Jarvis has grown up into a young man and returns to Jason's grave, unable to go on living unless he can completely verify for himself that Jason is really dead. On the other hand, digging up Jason's grave and essentially freeing him (since Tommy doesn't believe that Jason can be killed) doesn't exactly strike me as the best course of action. What was he planning to do, collect Jason's teeth and go check his dental records? At any rate, at least there is some thought put into an interesting way to bring Jason back to life, at least long enough to kill enough kids to fill up another movie.Tommy digs Jason up and then stabs his decayed corpse with a nearby fencepost, which is promptly struck by lightning thus bringing Jason back to life. It was earlier in this scene in the movie that someone utters the line, Some folks have a strange idea of entertainment, which I had planned on using as the summary line in my review. Sadly, I logged on to the IMDb and the first thing I noticed was that I was not as clever as I thought. It is, after all, one of the best lines in the movie, since it is such a tongue in cheek jab at the movie's biggest fans.During the paintball scene that soon follows, I was immediately struck by the intelligence of the characters. I really appreciate that this movie has people in it who are boneheads but they're not stupid. These are regular guys with undeveloped intellects rather than the typical horror movie moron, one of the worst things to ever see in a horror film. Or any other film, for that matter. It is a great scene when Jason gets his hands on a machete, for example. One of the boneheads in the movie, Burt, is shot by a woman during the paintball game, after which he proceeds to hack away at the trees around him, and check this out. He curses to himself that she shouldn't have been out there in the first place, she should have stayed where she belonged (presumably the kitchen), etc. This is a development of his character as well as the revelation of a deep character flaw that allows the audience to enjoy his death even after learning something about who he is. When was someone invented as fodder ever given that depth of character? Never!Sure, we hardly learn about his childhood and his dreams, but the point is that he ceases to be nothing but some poor sucker to get hacked up in a creative way by Jason. Then you have the other guy who loses his gun. Again, a lesser horror film would have had him lose his gun through some monumental act of paralyzing stupidity. In this film, he's just an office geek who isn't used to handling guns. He thinks he's in a warzone but he is just out of his element, and Jason is closing in to remind him of where he belongs. These are some of the best characters ever put into the Friday the 13th series.Granted, the movie does have its share of lame goofiness. The cemetery man (that's a good movie, too), for example, at the beginning responds to Tommy's request to dig up Jason with something like, Dig him up? Does he think I'm a farthead?! Huh huh huh! but the characters clearly have the most depth and meaning that we have seen in the series so far. The dumbest characters in the movie are the cops, which I'm sure has some sort of hidden message (which Hitchcock would have appreciated, no doubt), and there is also a clever scene involving the TV. One of the kids staying at the camp (oh, I forgot to tell you, they've changed the charming name of Camp Blood so that they can operate as a summer camp) one night swears that she saw a monster. The counselors tell her that it's okay, it was just a bad dream, but she insists that it was real, just like TV. Hear that, parents? Don't let your kids watch too much TV or they'll grow up and watch movies like this!Besides that, the little girl's name was Nancy. Could this be an homage to Nightmare on Elm Street?There is an interesting plot structure that involves the police thinking that Tommy is doing the killing, which ties in neatly with their status as the dumbest guys in the movie. This is leaps and bounds better than the sequels that preceded it (and light years better than Part VIII!!), there's even some good direction. The shot of Jason standing on top of the burning motor-home is one of the best shots thus far in the series. If you're going to watch some Friday the 13th movies, definitely don't miss this one. It's easy to get tired of the same old thing by this point, but this one is worth skipping ahead to see.

This is deserved as it brings together a talented cast and director with varied characters to a brilliant story about a hit-man who befriends a girl after her family is slaughtered by a local crooked cop. Jean Reno stars as Leon, in his best performance, the hit-man, 100%successful, professional, silent, but lonely. Gary Oldman is the crooked cop, stealing almost every scene he is in. Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, in easily one of the best child performances ever, conveying sadness and loneliness with hope and innocence, and anger and pain. The rest of the cast is also noteworthy.We are introduced to Leon, we see his mundane life, occasionally interspersed with acts of violence necessary for his career. His only friend is a pot plant, and his boss who fully respects him, exploits him to a certain degree because Leon is so quiet. He lives alone in a flat. A few doors down is Mathilda who lives with her abusive father, alcoholic mother, and innocent younger brother. They have seen each other occasionally in the corridor. Mathilda's father is in trouble with Oldman's character, and he is killed along with his wife and son when Mathilda is shopping. She arrives home to see what is still happening, knows she will be killed if she shows any emotion, so walks to Leon's door. Leon knows what has happened, and is torn between what to do. He cannot interfere, but eventually does the right thing. Soon the 2 become friends, and Mathilda wants to learn how to kill so she can get revenge. Oldman is looking for her though, and is not stupid.The film's direction is often beautiful, and it complements the story perfectly, meaning that the tear-jerking scenes, action scenes, and everything else are all the more potent. Although the action is brilliant, it is the scenes between Leon and Mathilda which make the film so good. We watch them grow together, learning off one an another, and they learn that life does not have to be spent on your own. There are many funny parts, most involving the fact that Leon has been outside of society most of his life. The training scenes are good, and it is more a story of love than anything else. Many critics mention a potential sexual relationship between the two, admittedly this may have happened in the future, but by the end the most important thing is that they have found a special person who can give them hope. The ambiguous and touching ending will pull at the heart, but we know that Mathilda can be strong now by herself. Although this is growing in fame it is still relatively unknown, but it is a startling film which everyone should see. 10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 February 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A strange film blending genres and emotions, made all the more strange because it is widely seen as one of the best films of the 90's.

Welles also uses this opening seen to introduce practically every character in the film so you immediately have a feel for the shady world you're about to enter. Aside from lending his directorial genius to Touch of Evil, Mr. Welles also contributes his performance as the grotesquely obese, crooked Police Captain Hank Quinlan, one of the great screen villains of all time! His prejudice is as complete as his corruption as he abuses his power as a police officer to enforce justice as he sees fit. Quinlan's method of operations comes into question when the honey-mooning Mike and Susan Vargas (Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, respectively) find themselves at the scene of an explosion. Vargas, an up-and-coming Mexican narcotics officer (yes, Heston plays a Mexican, but the film is very good despite this question of casting) is waiting to testify in a case against a Mexican narcotics ring. Vargas, begins to uncover the truth about Quinlan's investigations, and the two battle for position in this brilliant film noir. Vargas is played with Charlton Heston's signature pride and dignity, as he attempts to bring Quinlan's reign of terror to an end. Susan Vargas is trapped in the middle of the conflict between the two detectives. Susan Vargas is portrayed by the lovely Janet Leigh, who is every bit as beautiful as ever in this film. She isn't given many lines, but she delivers what lines she does have with passion and energy. Akim Tamiroff plays Joe Grandi, this film's representation of Mexico's underworld. There are also some interesting cameos in this film, including Marlene Dietrich as Tana, Zsa Zsa Gabor as a strip club owner, Mercedes McCambridge as a member of a gang, and Welles' long-time collaborator, Joseph Cotten as the coroner. This film contains enough gritty atmosphere, suspense, plot twists, and brilliant cinematography to keep you coming back over and over again for any number of reasons. It is a stunning example of everything a film noir should be; dark and mysterious, every shot tainted with a Touch of Evil!

It's become a classic because of its over the top and performances and realistic (apparently..) depiction of the drugdealing scene. The character of Tony Montana, invented for this particular movie, is still a point of reference and admiration for today's popular rap artists. This is a man with an ego as big as a whale, brilliantly played by Al Pacino in one of his best performances. What makes this movie hold up well is the slick direction by Brian De Palma and the perfect acting from all involved. The settings and costumes are a feast for the eyes and the movie is never difficult to follow. Seeing those big gold necklaces hang down the Hawaaian shirts with thick black chest hair coming through on various characters is hilarious. Probably many gangsters nowadays have been inspired by Tony Montana. Scarface is a movie where there's always something going on, and feels so much shorter than 170 minutes or so. Of course it's very violent, but the over-the-top language, the frequent humor, the colorfulness of it all make it very fun to watch. Once again, Al Pacino is genius here, at his best. In fact, on a certain level you can sympathize with his character, because he probably never had a proper education and was never really taught what's right and wrong. He also has strong fundamental values in the sense that he never kills someone who doesn't stand in his way (as he says, no one who doesn't have it coming to them), in fact when he has the chance to kill a man who's about to reveal important information about the organization he works for, he doesn't let it happen because the man's wife and kids are with him. Of course, he remains a born scumbag, and Pacino's appearance is just perfect for the role. Small and with a mean face.I find this movie more fun to watch than any of the Godfather pictures.

There's a lot more to it, but then ... I would be telling the story instead of reviewing the film. The story per se appears to be quite predictable and as straight as a fairly acceptable high school essay should be. But don't let it fool you ... the story per se is not Preminger's main concern. The dialogue is filed with subtle insinuations ... meaning that you must pay close attention as to when, where, why, how and what is really being said. Turn on your 'significance-decoding machine' and enjoy a great movie. It's definitely a must see.The film's slow pace allows its viewers to blend into the story and empathize with the characters ... so, for its own benefit, it's as slow as it should be. I recorded it somewhen around 1993 and since then ... I've seen it twenty times over; and in spite of this, I always laugh along with the trial's audience in reaction to the spirituous tirades thrown about by Jimmy Stewards' impeccably played character ... invariably I laugh along, as if I were sitting there with the people witnessing the trial. All actors did a great work in this film, including the supporting roles ... and this very trait impresses me for each new viewing ... as if I were watching it for first time ... every time.Needless to say, of course it's a film I would suggest for all film lovers ... you would be surprised by the possible readings you'll get from it. It's as multi-layered as a film can be, but yet ... it's just a simple, very simple, story; crafted along a very straight story-line.

The smell of holiday ham and homemade pumpkin pie has been extinguished like a used up candle and the strains of Yule melodies have fled the air. Just the perfect time to take a look at It's A Wonderful Life' from a different perspective and at an angle which is free from the traditional Christmas messages of redemption and human charity that the movie is usually seen to offer. What I am talking about here is...lechery.....lechery and lasciviousness pure and simple. I am referring to sexual degradation not only in the speculative chimera of Pottersville but also in that great American expository small-town oasis of Bedford Falls. If Frank Capra bothered to read the reviews of It's A Wonderful Life at the time the picture was first released at Christmastime in 1946--there is little doubt in my mind that he would have been at least slightly disturbed by the assessments made that his new movie was nothing more than just a slight variation from his past efforts. His penchant for fashioning heartwarming films that championed the individualism and strong character of the little man against the vagaries and injustice of the system had, after all, given rise to the pejorative term Capra-corn. By 1946, however, it appears that Capra was working hard, if not to change his modus operandi, then to at least spice it up a bit. That is part of the reason he gave us a view into the dark side of American society by highlighting the filth and sordidness of Pottersville. What few people remark on, however, is that dribs and drabbles of the parallel universe represented by the cesspool of Pottersville can be whiffed every now and then in Bedford Falls itself. You don't believe me? Well let me give you an example.Do you remember the scene in the movie where George Bailey is standing on a street corner shooting the breeze with his pals, Ernie the cab driver and Bert the cop? Yes --another nice sunny day in Bedford Falls. Then Violet Bick strolls by. She is accosted by George who has the impertinence to remark Say Vi that is some dress you got on there. Violet puts her hand on hip and protests This old thing--I only wear this when I don't care what I look like. She then shimmies across the street.... the camera following her receding wiggle for almost a good half block. Capra provides some cover for this ogling by having a middle aged bank clerk type pass by and then crank his head around to closely inspect her saunter. He, in turn, is almost flattened by an automobile that is crossing the intersection in the other direction (the sex as death ethos). But this exercise in venality is not finished. The camera then switches back to George and the boys still staring at Violet....... who at this point must be nearing the edge of the horizon. Ernie pipes up How would you like to.....? George cuts him off by blurting, Yes! The trance is broken and Bert stumbles away commenting that he has to go home and see what his wife is doing. Sly and sick Ernie then sarcastically cracks family man. This is a scene fraught with sexual tension, voyeurism with masochistic tendencies and it is occurring in real time in broad daylight on a street corner in Bedford Falls. O.K.--want another example? One without that sexpot Violet Bick---who some reviewers have painted as the Mary Magdalene to George Bailey's suffering Jesus. Well how about that virgins of virgins--little eighteen year old Mary Hatch? Everyone has witnessed the famous high school dance\/pool scene where George and Mary end up soaking wet. The next scene shows them walking home in the dark--George is wearing an over-sized football uniform in lieu of his wet duds and Mary sports nothing more than a robe. This sweet couple gets right down to business by breaking out the windows in a neighborhood house. Then George tries to put a move on Mary at the instigation of a peeping-tom yelling from a nearby porch. Mary jumps out of her robe in the ensuing mêlée and is left shaking and naked in a nearby hydrangea bush. The use of the hydrangea represents, of course, only the most demented form of erotic symbolism.

This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job, as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table, and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below, lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over, so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote, juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair, which by all appearances, seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the only person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution as an actor, but also helped produced the movie.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great American actors of the last century, is seen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged son, who he hasn't seen in a couple of years, having left home because of the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr. Fonda, and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in turmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment to shine.There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading a couple of comments about 12 Angry Men, some people marvel there were no women in the jury, or that the accused man's case hasn't been presented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to remember first of all, the times in which the action takes place, and the fact that being a poor man, the accused man has been given an attorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man being from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these jurors, at all, which might have been the prosecution's goal in going along with the selection.This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a court of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film that will be the standard in which everything else is judged.

This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job, as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table, and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below, lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over, so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote, juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair, which by all appearances, seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror.
