Now, I am slightly confused with my own statement here. Because, there is not much done in this movie. I shall elaborate on what I mean a bit later on. But let me briefly summarize that this movie is indeed a scary movie that does give you the scares and the goosebumps that one expects from a scary movie. But the beautiful part of this movie is that it does not give you typical ghosts, ghouls and monsters as found in this movie. It taps on the fact that you are more afraid of the unknown rather the known. And this is the greatest strength of the movie.The movie is about a collection of tapes. The movie starts out by stating that three kids had gone into a certain forest searching for what is simply known as the Blair Witch. They have never seen her but almost everybody has heard about her. The movie says that the kids were never found but their tapes were found and all we are shown in the movie is the tape recording of the adventure the kids went on. The movie does not have a cameraman. It is all recorded by the three kids who are the only major cast in this movie. Other people appear for only 2 or 3 minutes at the very beginning of the movie.There is a certain rumor surrounding this movie that it is real. Many people believe that the tapes are authentic. I recommend you read the detailed and elaborate article on www.wikipedia.org which clearly explains the methods adopted by the producers of this movie to advertise this movie. The producers actually placed advertisements reporting the three lead actors as missing. This has led many people to believe and also spread the rumor that Blair Witch project is real. Well, it is not. The movie's strength is that it shows you fear. The lead characters are scared of their experiences and fear shines on them. But if you have read about the movie in detail, you very well know that the fear on the characters' faces is genuine. They did go to the forest and instead of making them act, the director actually decided to scare them and thus the fear you see on their faces is genuine. So, for the genuine emotions of fear, frustration and tension you see on the characters, I'd prefer giving credit to the director. After all, he made the decision of making half of their experiences seem real to them. I don't know if it is a cruel way of making a movie but it works. The audience is scared and the movie is meant to do that. The most scary thing about the movie to me was the stick figures they find in the forest. This really heightens the overall tension in the movie. The characters have lost their way in the forest and are doing the balancing act between consoling each other and also taking out their anger on each other. Each blames the other for their state of misery. We get to see genuine anger, frustration, fear and eventual terror in this movie. A very well done movie indeed. Highly recommended for watching especially in the dark and preferably alone!

While classics like A Nightmare on Elm Street do nothing but bash you over the head with a block of cheese, they get positive reviews because they follow the same tired, safe formula that make the horror fans go in their pants due to nostalgia. The majority of the horror genre isn't really scary, and it never was. When The Blair Witch Project first came out it was the only movie to break these rules and delve into true, realistic terror. It didn't follow a formula. It tried to recreate the terror of someone lost in the woods on film, without the cheese or eye candy. I think that is why it captivated me. I've seen thousands of movies in my life, the majority horror movies, and maybe less than 5% really scared me. I'm not sure The Blair Witch Project scared me, but, I can say I felt the terror in the characters and script more than the vast majority of the other horror movies I've seen combined.But there is another factor it seems no one is mentioning in their reviews. If you've never been lost in the woods, as I've been many times, I'm not really sure you could appreciate or understand the fear that the characters were feeling. If you're not a camper, I really doubt you'd like this movie whatsoever. A lot of the negative reviews from people calling this stupid or boring, I can understand if they've never been lost in the woods. This is NOT a film everyone will like, or should like, and that is something someone really needs to say.Because I'm reviewing this in 2008, not 1999, I'm going to have to add that this movie is not like Cloverfield whatsoever. Cloverfield was a huge adventure caught on a small camera, while this is a small adventure caught on a small camera. If you liked Cloverfield (or vice versa) and are looking for a similar experience, this isn't it. They're both good movies, but for very different reasons.The main flaw that a lot of people are having a problem with is the pacing, which is reasonably slow. The reason for this is because it is meant to echo real life, not bash you with an explosive beginning like is typical Hollywood. Some will find this boring. Some won't because they appreciate realism. I fit into the latter.Overall, a very intense movie . . . if you know how to understand it. I found it very enjoyable and lacking of the typical horror cheese, which is something I can't say much anymore. Very much worth watching. You are not a real horror fan if you haven't at least viewed this once, because it's unlike anything that has ever been made before it.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 October 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Something that so much of the horror genre lacks is realism.

Because for instance in lot of other horror\/comedies, the comedy really weakens the horror. It makes them ineffective as scary and gory ones but this really isn't the case with An American Werewolf in London.Perhaps this is because the comedy within this movie is more subtle and B-movie like. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously which allows the movie its comedy to work out so effective and subtle. John Landis obviously made the movie deliberately B-movie like in parts, especially by picking not the best actors and by not giving them the best dialog imaginable. It on top of that features some great typical B-movie like moments, which perhaps is only truly notable for the genre fans and most other people will probably write it off as lame and simplistic.Just because the movie features humor and has B-movie elements in it doesn't mean that this movie is ineffective as an horror movie. In that genre this movie also really stands out. It does this by featuring some great imaginative and gory looking sequences. but it also does this not in the least with its make-up effects. Especially the dream sequences within the movie are quite memorable. This movie was actually the first to receive and Oscar for its make-up. Before this, best make-up wasn't even a category at the Oscar's, believe it or not. But thanks to this movie the academy realized that this was a profession to take seriously and to include in the award ceremony. The award of course went to legendary make-up artist Rick Baker. It was the first out of 6 Oscar's he has so far received during his career.The movie is actually surprisingly gory. It's just not something you would expect from an horror\/comedy but this movie is basically just as gory, if not gorier, than most other 'serious' genre movies. Director John Landis actually now days is surprised how gory this movie actually is when he looks back at it.Of course the movie doesn't feature a too complicated plot (luckily so) but it nevertheless know to pick an original approach with its story and all. It doesn't feature an usual werewolf plot in which the victim is battling his transformation during full moon and is plotting to kill the werewolf that bite him in order to lift the curse. I won't tell what the actual plot of the movie is, since it will probably spoil to much but fact is that it's original, which also means that the movie doesn't end in a typical 'Hollywood-way'.When watching this movie it actually becomes more painfully obvious how bad its sequel An American Werewolf in Paris, which got made 16 years(!) after this movie, actually is. It tries to achieve the same thing as this movie, by picking the same type of approach but in moments like that it becomes obvious that directing is a real important job and that some directors are simply more talented than others. Anthony Waller just obviously ain't no John Landis! John Landis would also later impress with the legendary Michael Jackson video-clip for the hit song 'Thriller'. The special make-up effects again came from Rick Baker. The clip definitely shows similarities to this movie in especially its style.A great as well as enjoyable unique werewolf movie!8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"10 October 2008","score":"6 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" What this movie does very well, and what it is so well known for, is the fact that it perfect blends the comedy with its horror, without letting the one element weaken the other.

I didn't see Chicken Run until 2005, not long before Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit came into theatres. At that point, I had never seen anything else from Aardman Animations. Three years and a few months later, I've finally watched this film again, after seeing Wallace & Gromit's full-length movie three times, as well as some Wallace & Gromit shorts, and much of the Angry Kid series. Comparing the two full-length movies, I would say the 2005 Wallace & Gromit one is the superior of the two, but Chicken Run is still a fine accomplishment.Ginger is a chicken who lives on a chicken farm in England. The farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, a dysfunctional couple, and the chickens know that if they don't produce any eggs in a week, they will literally lose their heads! Ginger knows that the only way to save herself and the others on the farm from this fate is to escape, so she leads the rest of them in many attempts to do so, but never succeeds. It eventually looks hopeless, until an American rooster named Rocky comes flying over and crashing down on the farm! The chickens are convinced he can actually fly, and can help them escape by teaching them how to do so. It turns out that he is from the circus, so Ginger makes a deal with him. If he gives the chickens flight lessons, she will hide him whenever the circus people come looking for him. Unfortunately, Rocky may not be very reliable, and he and Ginger have trouble getting along. Another problem is that an elder rooster on the farm named Fowler isn't too fond of Rocky. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy now has a chicken pie-making machine and intends to make pies out of every chicken on the farm, so they are now in even more danger! The humour in this film may not be as consistent as it could have been, but without a doubt, it's still there. For example, the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy is good for some laughs. Basically, Mr. Tweedy is a dimwitted farmer, married to a selfish, greedy, nasty woman, who sometimes insults him or gets a bit violent. Certain chickens can also be amusing at times, such as the airheaded Babs, with some of her lines (such as I don't want to be a pie. I don't like gravy.), and so can Rocky. For the laughs, the film features a combination funny dialogue and slapstick. Not usually hilarious, but often amusing. To add to the entertainment value, not only is there humour, there's also some suspense, especially later on in the film, such as the pie machine sequence. There may be some dull moments in the film, but for the most part, it remains intriguing, sometimes with humour, sometimes with suspense, and sometimes both.I haven't seen everything from Aardman Animations, but unlike the first time I saw this particular effort of theirs, I'm now familiar with some of their other work, and can't think of a time they've failed to impress me with their fine stop-motion animation, humour, adventure, etc. I think my second viewing of Chicken Run was pretty much like the first - not absolutely stunning, but pretty good nonetheless. Now that I'm familiar with Wallace & Gromit, two excellent, unforgettable, and very funny characters, I can say that maybe none of the characters in Chicken Run can quite match them, but some of them may come close. So, overall, this is an entertaining piece of animation which can appeal to many viewers, both kids and adults. It pretty much has everything that makes Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit so entertaining; the animation, the humour, the adventure, and likable characters, except to a smaller degree.

I didn't see Chicken Run until 2005, not long before Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit came into theatres. At that point, I had never seen anything else from Aardman Animations. Three years and a few months later, I've finally watched this film again, after seeing Wallace & Gromit's full-length movie three times, as well as some Wallace & Gromit shorts, and much of the Angry Kid series. Comparing the two full-length movies, I would say the 2005 Wallace & Gromit one is the superior of the two, but Chicken Run is still a fine accomplishment.Ginger is a chicken who lives on a chicken farm in England. The farm is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy, a dysfunctional couple, and the chickens know that if they don't produce any eggs in a week, they will literally lose their heads! Ginger knows that the only way to save herself and the others on the farm from this fate is to escape, so she leads the rest of them in many attempts to do so, but never succeeds. It eventually looks hopeless, until an American rooster named Rocky comes flying over and crashing down on the farm! The chickens are convinced he can actually fly, and can help them escape by teaching them how to do so. It turns out that he is from the circus, so Ginger makes a deal with him. If he gives the chickens flight lessons, she will hide him whenever the circus people come looking for him. Unfortunately, Rocky may not be very reliable, and he and Ginger have trouble getting along. Another problem is that an elder rooster on the farm named Fowler isn't too fond of Rocky. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy now has a chicken pie-making machine and intends to make pies out of every chicken on the farm, so they are now in even more danger! The humour in this film may not be as consistent as it could have been, but without a doubt, it's still there. For example, the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Tweedy is good for some laughs. Basically, Mr. Tweedy is a dimwitted farmer, married to a selfish, greedy, nasty woman, who sometimes insults him or gets a bit violent. Certain chickens can also be amusing at times, such as the airheaded Babs, with some of her lines (such as I don't want to be a pie. I don't like gravy.), and so can Rocky. For the laughs, the film features a combination funny dialogue and slapstick. Not usually hilarious, but often amusing. To add to the entertainment value, not only is there humour, there's also some suspense, especially later on in the film, such as the pie machine sequence. There may be some dull moments in the film, but for the most part, it remains intriguing, sometimes with humour, sometimes with suspense, and sometimes both.I haven't seen everything from Aardman Animations, but unlike the first time I saw this particular effort of theirs, I'm now familiar with some of their other work, and can't think of a time they've failed to impress me with their fine stop-motion animation, humour, adventure, etc. I think my second viewing of Chicken Run was pretty much like the first - not absolutely stunning, but pretty good nonetheless.

In the ensuing years I have watched it, written papers about it, discussed it in classes . . . and it STILL confuses the crap out of me. Do George and Martha love or hate each other? Why don't Nick and Honey make a polite excuse and run like hell? What's up with the kid they keep talking about? No one in this movie acts like a rational human being, but that's the point . . . there's no such thing as a rational human being. People are cruel, petty, manipulative liars, and the only thing worse than having to live with another person is having to live alone. It's not an uplifting movie, but it is viciously honest and ultimately quite moving. John Waters has said that if you remain dry-eyed during the finale of this film, you have no heart. I agree with him.The plot of this film is so simple, it barely qualifies as such a middle-aged academic couple invites a young academic couple over for drinks. They spend the night drinking and arguing. Bam. That's it. I couldn't understand what was at stake when I first saw this flick. Then again, the concept of sado-masochism had yet to penetrate my prepubescent world. Martha is a drunken, middle-aged shrew who enjoys tormenting George, her wimpy husband. Why does he put up with it? The funhouse-mirror image of George and Martha are Nick, a handsome, brilliant Biology professor, and Honey, his mousy, slightly dim wife. What is this stud doing with this frump? We learn the answers to these questions, and they're horrifying. Well, they're horrifying if you assume the characters are telling the truth. I've never been sure. Whatever, it's even more fun to watch than it is to discuss. This was director Mike Nichols' first film, and his theatrical roots are pretty obvious -- with a few notable exceptions, like that wrenching last shot, the entire story (such as it is) is told through dialog. But it's some of the best dialog ever written, so you can be glad Nichols didn't distract from it with a bunch of cinematic techniques like the ones he would use in The Graduate a year later. Since the focus is so mercilessly on the actors and their words, this is one of the few films in which hammy overacting is not only forgivable, it's absolutely necessary, and this cast is up to the challenge.Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton didn't always pick films that wisely (Boom, anyone?), but here they are to be applauded for using their clout to bring Edward Albee's Broadway sensation (alas no Pulitzer) to the big screen. And for once in the history of their long, often painful collaboration, they're both brilliant. George and Martha are ugly people, inside and out, and Hollywood's most glittering couple manages to capture all of that delicious hideousness. Gorgeous actresses often frump themselves up on screen so they can get Oscars (The Hours, anyone?), but Liz earned this statuette. Martha is, in the words of her loving husband, a Satanic bitch, but her hatefulness masks a lot of pain, and Liz lets us know that. Burton, Taylor's husband at the time (fourth of seven, I believe), was a macho blowhard whose histrionics ruined a lot of movies (The Night of the Iguana, anyone?), but here he makes the bold choice of playing George as an impotent but bitter whipping boy, a wimp with a will to power. Notice the smug satisfaction he takes in needling poor, stupid Honey, the only creature on Earth more defenseless than himself. Maybe Nichols explained the role to him, or maybe Burton was smart enough to figure out the gay subtext that so many critics have read into the play and movie, but for once Dick actually lives up to the great actor reputation that mystifies anyone who has ever seen Exorcist II The Heretic. (Caveat he was also good in The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.) George Segal, never known for his dramatic intensity, is fine as creepy Nick and Sandy Dennis is flat-out brilliant as pathetic little Honey. From her screechy, overeager first line (oh, he's a WONDERFUL man) through her weird drunken dance right up to her meek assist in Martha's ghastly final comeuppance (like a good boy!), Dennis hits every wrong note and is just as deserving of Oscar gold as the film's formidable leading lady. Dennis had an erratic career, and it sounds like she didn't have the greatest life, but here she displayed some serious star potential. Or at least she did in 1960s Hollywood, which still had room for homely, quirky stars (Streisand, anyone?) and serious films without explosions and trite moral lessons. I'm trying to imagine Tom Cruise and Katie Homes doing this movie, and the idea is sickening. We live in an era of plastic, self-congratulatory celebrity actors who couldn't hold Liz Taylor's girdle.

And I can understand those angry people who say it has nothing in common with the classic novel or some even say this film disgraces it. I can understand them but I don't agree with them.First of all I'd like to say that I've been a dire-hard fan of the classic novel since my childhood (now I'm 28). Especially I loved D'Artagnan an Atos. And I loved Milady!!! Yes I really loved her! She was such a bitchy girl! (I'd like to watch her playing by young Sharon Stone, but maybe it's too much!). So the guys were the heroes of my childhood and I 've always realized all the brilliance of the novel and its characters!So when I watched this film for the first time (approx. in 1995-96) I was so angry with it! How could they spoil such a beautiful story!, I exclaimed. But with years I became much more patient with this film and began to realize that it's quite good but on its own. You see, so many times filmmakers tried to screen The Three Musketeers. Some did better some did worse. In Russia we have our own version of the novel which is made in style of a musical (and have always been of a great popularity here). But the Disney version is something new. Something that has never been done before. Yes there're a lot of clichés there. There're constant discrepancies with the novel. There're talks and actions that could never happen in those times.

The first meeting of the two is full of awkwardness on both sides, that kind of clumsiness that only arises from mutual attraction and the perceived need to resist it. Jet Li presents the shy timidity of a well-raised Chinese man in the presence of an attractive (and taller) white woman initially and retains that polite distance throughout the movie, though it takes on shades of greater intimacy during the course of the 2 days they spend together (though never to unrealistic excess). Here you have two people who desperately need a human connection to find meaning and purpose in life. They find each other.One exchange of dialogue in particular emphasizes this point Jessica  I don't trust them. I trusted you. For the first time in-- God, I don't know, forever-- I don't know why I trust someone. You promised you'd take care of her. (Jessica's daughter)Liu Jian  Yes. (Liu is still the polite and soft-spoken Chinese warrior who is not given to long speeches, but he proceeds to go on a one-man tour of force through an entire police station to save Jessica's daughter,and it is not overdone or ridiculous. he does it because he has connected with Jessica on a human level, he cares for her, and wants to help her)I find it amazing, that with the relatively short length of the movie, the connection between Liu Jian and Jessica is wholly believable, a testament to a sensitivity on the part of the writer, the director, and both Bridget and Jet.ONE HUMAN GESTURE FROM THE BAD GUYThis is a feature which always elevates a film for me. The black and white simplicity of good guy \/ bad guy is never genuinely satisfying. Richard, the corrupt French Inspector, takes a moment to gently caress the head of one of his fallen subordinates in an act of companionably farewell, upon finding him dead from the attack of Jet Li. I was very happy to see this scene. It made Richard a little bit more than a cardboard cut-out character. One of the main reasons I like Japanese Anime so much is that it is extremely prevalent for the antagonists to be complex, and, very human, characters. As a species, humanity needs to evolve beyond thinking of one another in the simplistic terms of good and evil. Such is never the case. Everyone has reasons for their behavior. One man's villain is another man's hero.TRANSCENDING CULTURAL BARRIERSJessica  Any interest in an ex-junkie hooker... who can cook, clean, sew and who likes Chinese food?An attractive tall white girl can fall for a shorter reserved Chinese guy. A white girl can show a great deal of compassion for the death of an old Chinese man (the Chef whom Jet was staying with). FROM SOLITARY PATRIOTIC SOLDIER TO A HUMANE HEROThe evolution of Jet Li's character in the course of the 2 days of the film is remarkable, yet wholly believable.Jet Li's performance never leaves a moments doubt that he is a tremendously potent one-man army, but, that he is a sensitive human being as well, who longs to connect with someone, to have someone to care about and protect (even though he was not even aware of that need).CLOSING SCENEThe closing scene is wholly touching, when Bridget holds Jet's hand in a vulnerable, heartfelt gesture of total gratitude at saving her daughter's life, while Jet looks back somewhat shyly, but grateful to her as well for awakening such feelings in him. sniff. sniff.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"10 October 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Two of the greatest stars in the history of film, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, team up in Fonda's last role as an elderly couple living in their summer cottage in New England. Jane Fonda, Henry's real-life daughter, has some nice scenes as the couple's daughter who comes to visit with her boyfriend and his son. There is obviously tension between the father Norman and the daughter Chelsea. However, through many situations, all the relationships here will be tried and changed.To put it straight, this is in my mind, mediocre material that is uplifted tremendously by some of the finest acting ever put on the screen. Henry Fonda, in his own way, puts together a great character in Norman Thayer Jr., a successful, self-loathing, even cantankerous man who dreads having to die some day and takes his fear out on others. Jane Fonda is the successful daughter who has had a strained relationship with her dad but realizes this may be the last chance for them to fix it. And in the middle is Katharine Hepburn, the wonderfully charming mother and wife who knows how to enjoy life and does everything in her power to help her family reconcile as well as have a good time.Even though the acting is superb, I felt the story and situations were just okay and could have been much better to match the acting and make this and absolute classic. Still, that is a small trouble in an otherwise wonderful story about family, life, death, and knowing that it could all be gone in a second. And of course, this being the last film for Henry Fonda, it is a great send-off for a great actor to end his great career.

Considering today is Christmas, there will be hell to pay if her loving parents let her down.

With Dawn now pregnant, the familiar stranger wants nothing more to do with her, so like any strong woman in her position, she gives birth, to little Taffy, biting through the umbilical cord, and everything. Now, with two mouths to feed, Dawn takes on just about any job available, robbing houses, go-go dancing, hell, even waitressing. The pressures of motherhood are driving Dawn crazy, this kid actually expects poor Dawn to send her to school, and to feed her, kids can be so ungrateful. Luckily, Dawn gets a job (or something similar) at the Lipstick beauty salon, owned by Donald and Donna Dasher, an exclusive salon for exclusive beauties, and these two want Dawn as there customer (or mascot?). Anyway, Dawn ends up married to a guy named Gator, who works at the salon, and looks an awfully lot like Crackers from Pink Flamingos, but isn't.

Some people don't like those two genres mixed together, but honestly for this film, it works. Johnny Depp and Ichabod Crane is the best. Johnny Depp has his role. I'll never forget him as the dark, sensitive detective, researching the case of the Headless Horseman. Christina Ricci-I've never seen her scarier or more good-looking. She gives this feel of romance and light, as well as a dark, witch-crafty feeling. In all, the film is great. Tim Burton made one of his finest films. This is probably one of his best, but might be tied with Edward Scissorhands.
