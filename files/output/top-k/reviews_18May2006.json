After defeating the evil deadite that lingers in the depths of the pit, he is hailed as the chosen one. Ash, wants nothing to do with them and only wants to get back home, but the only way to do his is to retrieve the book of the dead. Unfortunately for Ash, he awakens the dead while taking the book, and now must battle the army of Darkness before he goes back to his own time.Back in the year 1981, Sam Raimi and a group of friends created one of the most terrifying horror movies to date, The Evil Dead. Again in 1987 Raimi and Co. managed to create yet another genuine horror experience with Evil Dead II. Now with the third installment in this series, Raimi gives us a comedic cult classic film that will have you quoting every piece of dialogue in your every day life.Army of Darkness is a perfect example of a cult classic. If you go walking down a street and ask if anyone has heard of it, they'll give you the crazy look. But search the net or go to any horror convention and you'll see that there are Evil Dead maniacs out there, and I am proud to say that I am one of them.Most trilogies tend to suck by the third film, Blade trinity and revolutions to name a few, but here Darkness manages to make itself a stand alone film and a fine damn one at that. It still has it's nods to the original Evil Dead, but if you're looking for the ultimate horror experience, then this film is not for you. Instead Darkness is full of comedic dialogue and actions. Our hero ASH spits out classic one-liners that so many people try to copy today...I'm looking your way Duke Nukem.Bruce Campbell is ASH. His character evolves throughout the trilogy and it's in this third installment that he is a badass. It's in this third installment that everyone remembers him from. It's in this third installment where he has the chainsaw, the boomstick, the one-liners, the sugar. Campbell will always be known for this one character. He's such a coward and yet we still feel the need to cheer him on. Campbell is the master of physical comedy and he uses it to his advantage here, fighting an army of mini ashs, splitting away from his evil self and getting his face sucked down an unknown demon hole from a book.Speaking of which, that's what makes the film even more enjoyable. It's insane bizarre comedic tone. Whether you like slapstick comedy or have a dark funny bone, this film is delightful for all. I never thought I would laugh so much at someone pouring boiling hot water down their throat. Then to have the thing grow inside of you and try to detach itself from your body, only in a movie like this can you watch that and laugh with it. Granted, it would help if you've seen the first two films and in order as well. The opening does give you a recap of what's happened, but you feel more for the film and ASH if you've been through the horrors that he has.Much like Peter Jackson got his start in the horror movie genre, so did Sam Raimi. You know, the guy that went on to direct such big hits as Spiderman and Spiderman 2. Army of Darkness has the little Sam Raimi touch with it. Once you see it you can tell that it's Raimi behind the lens. Raimi has his brothers scattered throughout the film, playing many different characters at that. As well as Three Stoogies get ups and the POV of certain objects, such as arrows being shot or forks being thrown.The effects are great and still low key. You can tell which deadites are guys in suits and the black fabric behind the eyes of other skeletons, but that's what gives this film it's cheesy B movie goodness. Seeing ASH fight against all the evil mini ashs is a feat for the eyes as well, even if it does look so fake.This is a great way to end the trilogy. I hope they do not make a fourth installment, as this is one of the greatest trilogies of all time, I'd even put it in the same sentence with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, watch the Helm's Deep scene and tell me Jackson did not use army of Darkness as inspiration. I do not own all the DVD versions out there, which are a handful, but I do have the boomstick edition, so I'm able to enjoy the theatrical cut and the director's cut. Army of Darkness is a film that I can watch over and over and never get tired of, which is what a great fun movie should be.

From what I hear the movie is very very different from the book, which by the way, I haven't read. So I want be comparing this movie to the book. The book is said to be more frightening then the film, but I guess thats understandable considering that this was a film produced by Walt Disney Pictures. Still, I found many good things in this movie.Its story is about two young boys who are the best of friends. Will and Jim. One day a strange Carnival roles into town. This carnival seems to grant peoples most ardent wishes, but at a price. When Will and Jim discover whats really going on with this carnival they decide to try and stop it.This movie was a bit uneven. There were some good things and there were some bad. First lets start with the good. The movie managed to evoke the feeling of a spooky, old town in the 1930s. Little shops all around, everyone knows each other, they are all friends. It kind of reminded me of that little town in that 80s TV show Little House on the Prairie. Remember that one? So anyways, the sets were very well achieved, so Kudos to the art department. There's also some very very good atmosphere on this film. I loved how the wind was constantly blowing and there were dried leaves all over the place. You get this kind of autumn feel, where winter is right around the corner, but not here yet. Anyhows, all the atmosphere adds to a very spooky town and that helps the film since this is after all horror\/fantasy film.Yeah its horror, but its not too horrifying. Its a Disney movie after all so you will never see anything too horrifying. Though Ill admit some of the images towards the ending of the movie scratched on too scary for kids. So what we have here is a light horror movie thats perfect for kids on the 7 to 10 year old range. I loved what the movie has to say. There's many good themes that are touched upon in this film. So in essence, even though its a dark horror tale, its a good film that will teach kids important things about life .So I applaud it for that. I can see what Bradbury was trying to transmit with this movie. Unfortunately, I inferred most of these themes on my own. The movie doesn't exactly do a good job of explaining it all and here comes my first negative point about this film.The story can sometimes become a muddled mess. For example we know that the carnival is evil. And we know that people get in trouble whenever they give in to what Mr Dark is offering. But its never really clear what it is that the Carnival people want with the towns people. Is Mr. Dark the devil himself in search of human souls? I don't know because its never fully explained. Whos this Dust Witch and why does she help Mr. Dark? Why is it wrong for the towns people to wish for what they wish for? I mean I don't understand why the movie is trying to give this message like its wrong to desire these things when in fact, I see nothing wrong in the football player wanting his leg and arm back. Or the old teacher wanting to be young again and so forth. So, the true intentions of the Carnival and Mr. Dark are not clearly explained and we are left to come to our own conclusions as to who Mr. Dark is and what he wants. So I'm going to have to say that the script was a bit weak and could have done a better job at explaining things instead of generalizing so much.The special effects are as good as can be expected for 1983 and they sometimes amazed me. All in all the effects were pretty decent for those days. But I honestly think that this movie could benefit from a remake. In fact Id go as far as to say that this movie is screaming for a remake, with better effects and a more fleshed out script.Jonathan Pryce does a good job at portraying Mr. Dark. My only beef with him was that even though he spoke a sinister sounding dialog, he himself didn't come off as pure concentrated evil. I think they could have cast someone slightly more evil looking. Slightly more menacing. But I can chalk that up to Disney not wanting this movie to be too scary. Jason Robards does the best job as Wills father. A man tormented by a mistake from his past and a man fearing death and getting old. He is a tormented soul and it shows in Robards performance. Pamela Griers role as the Dust Witch was short and I think she was wasted in this role. Honestly anyone could have done it.All in all, this film had its faults like the ones I mentioned above, but still managed to be rather good. Yeah, it was uneven; yeah it wasn't to clear in explaining certain plot points. But it still managed to evoke that sense of wonderment you have when your at that young age as the kids in this movie. If only Disney hadn't held back in showing this stories full potential. Oh well, who knows, maybe someone out there in movie land will take this movie in and remake it following more closely Bradburys story. From what I hear, its a chilling read that I will no doubt be doing sometime soon.Rating 3 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 May 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is based on Ray Bradburys novel Something Wicked This Way Comes.

However, throw in a couple of amazing actors, writer Alan Ball, director Sam Mendes, and mix it in with complete originality, and the result is an excruciatingly complex and deep movie.The story starts off with Lester talking about your 'regular' 40-something year-old mid-life crisis life, and reminds the audience the he will be dead in less than a year. From the moment the narration from Kevin Spacey is initiated, we are juggled into a realistic world of self-pity, lust, betrayal, narcissism, and controversial subject matter. The following 100-something minutes leave us breathless as our imagination grabs hold of the tragedy that is life, and doesn't let go until we realize 'American Beauty' is nothing but a metaphor for the life that surrounds us.The surreal juxtaposition of the characters foreshadows an ever-growing feud between families, friends and even colleagues. Carolyn (Bening) loathes the thought of being an average housewife, while their daughter Jane (Birch) accepts the idea of being 'ordinary' and moves on with life. Each character is flawed and never either overpowers or seems inferior to another character, which is so strongly a reflection of the real life. The rest of the cast is unique and quirky but just enough to show that not everyone is perfect. Angela - portrayed by the brilliant Mena Suvari - gives off the impression that she is loved and looked up at while never facing the reality that she pales in comparison to the beauty that is life.The movie focuses more on Lester (Spacey) and how he comes to terms with his own identity, and lives life to the fullest.

Jamie Lloyd is now in a hospital for children and she's a mute due to the trauma she endured from the year before. Loomis makes check ups on her to see how she's doing. Meanwhile, Michael is being nursed back to health by a hermit in the woods (don't ask). Suddenly, Michael awakes and begins going after his 10 year old niece again. This Halloween is so much like an entry into the Friday the 13th series that you might even forget what film you're watching. The murders are increasingly gory, Michael Myers is more like the Hulk, and everything else is just bad.The only thing that's left over from the previous movies is the score. Everything else has changed in style, for the worse. Michael Myers is now a brutal killing machine instead of a silent stalker. His mask looks utterly terrible and it would inspire bouts of laughter rather than screams of terror. Continuity goes out the window when we see that the once modest looking two story Myers house has transformed into an 18th century Victorian mansion. In this movie, Jamie shares a telepathic bond with her uncle, making the plot more ridiculous than it has to be. The addition of two bumbling police officers with idiot music to accompany them every time they appear takes the mood right out of the film. This movie doesn't feel like a Halloween movie at all.The acting in this film is terrible. The acting in the previous movies (not counting part 3) held up for slasher movie acting, but in this movie it's just like Friday the 13th. The acting is so goofy and unbelievable that you're left shaking your head. Even the great Donald Pleasance delivers a poor performance, but can you blame him? I bet he knew the series was going to hell. But hey, a paycheck's a paycheck right? This movie even dares to compromise everything we've learned about Michael Myers so far by showing him cry! He's supposed to be emotionless. What is the most disappointing aspect of this film you ask? The ending. I'm sure there are tons of people who love the ending of this movie, but I'm not one of them. After seeing Michael shot, stabbed, lit on fire, blown up, etc. you find yourself wondering what great way they're going to kill him this time. Nope, they end up arresting him. We actually see Michael handcuffed like a common criminal in a jail cell. And what happens? The movie turns into Rambo when a mysterious man in black bursts into the police station and kills everybody, breaking Michael out. Who is this man? Where has he been through the rest of the series when Michael was in trouble? Why does he want Michael? I guess we'll just have to wait until Halloween 6. Oh, and for those who haven't seen Halloween 6, trust me...The explanation ain't great.While I will give it the fact that this is one of the most complicated end of movie cliffhangers ever, I can't praise the rest of the movie.

When I tried to watch this movie for the first time on TV, I gave up after the first five minutes. I hated the way the movie handled the relationship of the two main characters. Their dialogue exchange in the car in their first scene... It was a real disgrace. I got so angry, I actually ran away from the TV and I didn't want to see how the rest of the story was handled by the director.That was about 4 years ago. Now, I calmed down to a level, I could watch the entire movie. And I'm angry again. But now I can handle it...The whole movie is just a vague shadow of the story of the book. The character's names are similar, some similarities in their story here and there, but nothing serious.1. Dennis and Arnie are reduced to two testosterone-driven jerks. WTF? In the book their relationship is so detailed, you can breath the same air they're breathing. When I read the book I was there. I was freakin' there! In the seventies! In the book, Dennis never saying anything like he says in his first scene. I won't even quote that line, it's not worth it. The entire conversation is pointless and goes nowhere. Their relationship in the movie is just lame. It doesn't justify anything that happens, and when Arnie dies, you can't feel sorry for him. You never knew him, why should you care? Why should Dennis care? Why should anybody care? In the book, the outcome of the events carried such impact, I've never read in any book ever. It's a brilliant masterpiece. In the movie there are ruins of a decent killing car horror flick. The book is not a killing car horror flick. No, it's not. The book is about growing up and having issues with yourself. None of this could make it into the movie. I would be ashamed if I filmed such a piece of garbage from this book.2. The origin of the spirit in Christine. In the book everything makes perfect sense, in the movie even the simplest thing is illogical. Who bought the car originally? We meet a guy called LeBay, who had a brother, who bought the car which turned out to be a killer car, killed everybody, including the poor guy, and what does his brother do? He sells the car! Let's endanger some other people! In the book, the guy who sells it, bought it, and it's his spirit which made the car an instrument of killing, and when he is about to die, he sells the car, so his spirit can live on in it. This is basically it, but in the book it's so much more detailed, and it's simply brilliant all the way.3. The characters doing nothing in the movie. Buddy Repperton is a villain, that's about the only OK point of the movie. Dennis isn't aware of anything, he just lays in the bed in the hospital, hardly sees Christine, hardly hears anything about her, and despite all of this, he knows everything about her, makes contact with Leigh, and they plan to kill her. But it doesn't make any freakin' sense! It's totally ridiculous Dennis never saw anything remotely suspicious about the car, he doesn't have a reason to believe it can run by itself, etc. He just says Ok, let's waste it!. Ludicrous! 4. There are so much more distasteful changes, and blindingly obvious plot holes in the movie, that I don't even want to go into them. There is no 4th point.Here's what I'll do I'll forget this movie entirely, and when I'll read the book for like the 20th time this summer, I won't remember it.This movie shouldn't have been made.2\/10, because it's at times watchable.

I only discovered the other day that he died a couple of summers ago at the considerable age of 92. I suppose I had thought that like most of those figures who reached their peak in the middle of the last century he had passed away many years ago. A re-seeing of The Bad and the Beautiful fairly recently reminded me of just how outstanding was his contribution to movies of all shades of quality. I first became aware of the uniqueness of the Raksin 'sound' on my original viewing of Wyler's Carrie in 1952. It is impossible to define, other than to say that it owes nothing to central European romanticism, the sound of almost all the in-house studio composers such as Newman, Stothart and Steiner, or to the tradition of 20th century symphonists such as Copland and Diamond which fed the imagination of film composers as diverse as Elmer Bernstein and David Amram. Raksin had a sound all his own as did Bernard Herrmann and Miklos Rozsa, as instantly recognisable as theirs but I feel his range is wider. He seldom repeated himself as did Rozsa who composed in the same style regardless of genre. (Double Idemnity, Ben-Hur and Madame Bovary have nothing common apart from their same sort of watered down Kodaly-like music.) His style is intensely lyrical, conceived with a verve and passion that always transcended the most trivial movies and made them, if not worth watching, always worth listening to. Unlike many of his colleagues he seldom hit the jackpot by working on films of great quality. I think it only happened twice, with Abraham Polonsky's B movie Force of Evil which has become recognised as a marvellous example of film noir and of course William Wyler's Carrie where he was just one of many outstanding contributors to what I have long argued is possibly the greatest work of art to have ever emerged from the Hollywood studio system. Although it has its passionate advocates, I cannot share their enthusiasm for Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful. It is certainly very professional in the way it slickly dissects an unsympathetic character through the flashback reminiscences of those he mistreated, but it had all been done before and considerably better in Citizen Kane and All About Eve. However the film is worth watching if only to wallow in Raksin's gorgeous score. And there is plenty of it, particularly in accompanying all those voice-off narrations. And then just as one is beginning to wonder if the marvellous opening credit theme is about to be heard once too often, the composer introduces something entirely new for the Dick Powell narrative, a jaunty section based on a four-note motif (a falling perfect fifth, rising up a major sixth, then down a major seventh). The way this is subsequently developed is truly symphonic. Incidentally if you want to discover a film score that has the length and complexity of a symphony just close your eyes (you won't be missing much) and listen to Forever Amber. Raksin in excelsis!

He seldom repeated himself as did Rozsa who composed in the same style regardless of genre. (Double Idemnity, Ben-Hur and Madame Bovary have nothing common apart from their same sort of watered down Kodaly-like music.) His style is intensely lyrical, conceived with a verve and passion that always transcended the most trivial movies and made them, if not worth watching, always worth listening to. Unlike many of his colleagues he seldom hit the jackpot by working on films of great quality. I think it only happened twice, with Abraham Polonsky's B movie Force of Evil which has become recognised as a marvellous example of film noir and of course William Wyler's Carrie where he was just one of many outstanding contributors to what I have long argued is possibly the greatest work of art to have ever emerged from the Hollywood studio system. Although it has its passionate advocates, I cannot share their enthusiasm for Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful. It is certainly very professional in the way it slickly dissects an unsympathetic character through the flashback reminiscences of those he mistreated, but it had all been done before and considerably better in Citizen Kane and All About Eve. However the film is worth watching if only to wallow in Raksin's gorgeous score. And there is plenty of it, particularly in accompanying all those voice-off narrations. And then just as one is beginning to wonder if the marvellous opening credit theme is about to be heard once too often, the composer introduces something entirely new for the Dick Powell narrative, a jaunty section based on a four-note motif (a falling perfect fifth, rising up a major sixth, then down a major seventh). The way this is subsequently developed is truly symphonic. Incidentally if you want to discover a film score that has the length and complexity of a symphony just close your eyes (you won't be missing much) and listen to Forever Amber. Raksin in excelsis!

I only discovered the other day that he died a couple of summers ago at the considerable age of 92. I suppose I had thought that like most of those figures who reached their peak in the middle of the last century he had passed away many years ago. A re-seeing of The Bad and the Beautiful fairly recently reminded me of just how outstanding was his contribution to movies of all shades of quality. I first became aware of the uniqueness of the Raksin 'sound' on my original viewing of Wyler's Carrie in 1952. It is impossible to define, other than to say that it owes nothing to central European romanticism, the sound of almost all the in-house studio composers such as Newman, Stothart and Steiner, or to the tradition of 20th century symphonists such as Copland and Diamond which fed the imagination of film composers as diverse as Elmer Bernstein and David Amram.

John Denver stars as a supermarket manager who is visited by God to spread the word that things can work for mankind on earth. God is played by George Burns who appears to Denver in the form of a casually dressed old man, kind of like George Burns on vacation.

Vincent (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) make a great pair of hit men philosophizing and quoting scripture as they go about their brutal business.Having said that, there are significant negatives. The tone is generally that of stylized movie-making fun that is not to be taken seriously. We have, for example, contrived dialog, Mia's (Uma Thurman) making gestures indicating a square that is outlined in white on the screen, references to other movies like the glowing briefcase a la Repo Man, Jack Rabbit Slim's 50s retro bar where Thurman and Travolta do a captivating twist, and so forth. But the violent scenes are disturbingly realistic and Mia's drug overdose is truly vile. I felt whip-lashed by the uneven tone. While most of the dialog is ingenious and engaging, on occasion it falls flat. I am sure that the scene where Butch's (Bruce Willis) girlfriend goes on for five minutes describing what she wants for breakfast is meant to be preciously humorous, but it had me looking at my watch. Then, for such a fast-paced movie, there are inexplicable dead zones like when Butch goes to retrieve his watch from his apartment and for several minutes we watch him park his car and walk through fences and fields before getting there. We know his destination, just jump to the apartment scene please. And would Vincent not hear Butch enter the apartment and would he not take his gun with him to the bathroom? In fact I found the Butch character uninteresting and unnecessary and the movie would have been better if he had been written out. This would have shortened the overly-long run time of 154 minutes to something more reasonable and we would have been spared the over-the-top scene with Zed, Maynard, and The Gimp as well as the homosexual rape. Perhaps the latter was an homage, in questionable taste, to Deliverance. But this movie is not worried about taste. However, without Butch we might have been deprived of the hilarious scene with Christopher Walken, but for all of its significance that scene could have been tossed in almost anywhere.In summary I think this is an undisciplined, sometimes exhilarating, sometimes frustrating, original work of art.

But the violent scenes are disturbingly realistic and Mia's drug overdose is truly vile. I felt whip-lashed by the uneven tone.

I watched it with them and now that I am seventeen years old, I feel that this was one of my most cherished memories. Of course i fell asleep near the end of it then, but it was still a really good memory, to watch CONGO with them. And now I have viewed this film fairly recently without falling asleep and have read the Michael Crichton(Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain) book. I for one find this film to be very entertaining. Of course it goes without saying that this film is not completely accurate to the book. They have added new characters and added more gory death and less technology and actual factual feeling. The creators could have made this film an interesting sci-fi adventure feature, but instead they have made a B movie. Although the film feels like the former, and did when i was six. This film has enough technology and factual feel to be interesting, but not quite believable. And yet, this for once, is not at all a bad thing. The film is pretty convoluted. It is about a primatologist and a friend who have a talking gorilla(via electronic headset) and decide to go to it's birthplace to see what its like and discover what happened to a team that went their a little while earlier to find a treasure in which Tim Curry randomly appears in a fake accent and pretends to be a companion who is searched for by a stereotypical soldier looking dude who turns out not to be a friend and, yeah. I don't really know how to exactly explain the plot, suffice to say that somehow, the gorilla named Amy and her friends, for some reason, must escape from a helicopter because they are shot at and end up in the jungle, not alone, with all of their crew mates and stuff. And from there on, they must try to avoid danger from snakes, hippos, and a wild pack of mutated monkeys that intend to eat their flesh and kill everyone. I know that this film sounds completely ridiculous and stupidly pointless, but that is really part of the fun. Usually movies are either thought provoking and interesting, or entertaining. This film is very entertaining and funny. This film also has a high body count, with a lot of characters meeting their end in gruesome ways. It takes itself seriously, but not seriously enough to make it not fun. I liked this film as a kid because it was funny and fun. It still works for me.
