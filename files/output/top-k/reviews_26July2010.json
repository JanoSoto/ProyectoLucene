I had pretty high expectations, considering all of the rave reviews, it being heralded as one of the best war movies of all time, and the fact that it won some Oscar awards. Instead I was treated to seeing a 3 and a half hour long melodrama, where every single scene was dragged out as long as possible.I know that this film was more about the effect war had on soldiers, their friends and family, as opposed to being in combat, like most other war films, which is why most of the film took place at the home front, rather than on the battlefield. The film was basically divided into 3 parts. The first focused on the main characters, and their relationships, and should have been dedicated to developing the characters, but instead you have to endure watching over an hour and a half of people dancing at a wedding. I constantly found myself fast-forwarding through scenes like these. Another example of this tedious style, is the scene where the guys are driving down the highway, and they pretend to ditch one of their friends. You then have to watch the car drive off way out in to the distance, turn around to come back, only to start it all over again, 2 or 3 times. Moving on to the Vietnam war, this film makes you think that the whole war experience is about playing Russian Roulette. Flashing forward, De Niro's character comes back from the war for a short period of time, only to go back to try and find his two friends, and you're forced to believe that Walken's character has been surviving for who know how long, playing Russian Roulette in a fighting ring.What I find extremely funny about the high status the film has, is the fact the film's director, Cimino, was universally panned for his film, Heaven's Gate, which is directed in the exact same dragged out style. I'm just glad I didn't have waste any money to watch this film, however, my time wasted will never be refunded.

It's sheer brilliance. This film is a masterpiece thriller, full of amazing performances. For its time, it is a HUGE eye-opener and an outstanding attempt to recreate the fairy tale in a suburban fashion. It is simply riveting and very satisfying in terms of plot, action and character. I have never seen Reese Witherspoon kick so much ass ever. I don't understand why she didn't get any Oscar buzz for this one. This performance completely tops her part in Walk the Line. She is more than amazing in this film. You really don't wanna mess with her. She is capable of almost anything after what's been done to her. We still sympathize with her though because she's still compassionate and cares for what is right. She has a set of principles that she won't let anyone tread on. Being more of a Punisher, she is that strong heroine that uses her sense of justice to subdue those who wrong her, but at the same time, she's all about instinct and guts, she isn't your Lara Croft or your fancy Black Widow. She just acts on pure instinct of what is right and she understands that most of the time, reality is screwed up and doesn't care for what is wrong or right. I was left speechless at the sheer simplicity with which she conveys so much pain, anger and most of all strength. At the same time, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what she could do. At the beginning of the movie, you can't picture her as that tough. But by the end of it, even those cops were smiling at her, thinking 'Okay, let's never upset this one or we'll get our asses whooped!' As for Sutherland, wow, he can play a real creep when he wants to and be good at it too. His facial expressions and his gestures tell everything you need to know about him as a killer. And at the beginning, when he's playing the good guy, he's so believable you know right away he's sure to be off his bonkers. I have to admit though, he's a tad underplayed. There's not enough focus on him. Also, I was expecting a little bit more from him, but Reese made up for whatever was missing. As a side note, Brittany Murphy is another nice touch to this movie. I have seen this kind of performance before, but I think she made it personal, as in she made you believe that she was the one going through all of that. I just wish she could have played more parts like this one, but I guess we'll never see that happening now...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see Reese Witherspoon show her acting props. I really miss this side of her. Now she's more into sweet, sugary indie movies which aren't all bad, they just don't give her much to work with and waste some of her huge potential. Oh and that accent of hers needs to take front stage right now, it's adorable! Go watch this movie and you won't regret it!

I don't understand why she didn't get any Oscar buzz for this one. This performance completely tops her part in Walk the Line. She is more than amazing in this film. You really don't wanna mess with her. She is capable of almost anything after what's been done to her. We still sympathize with her though because she's still compassionate and cares for what is right. She has a set of principles that she won't let anyone tread on. Being more of a Punisher, she is that strong heroine that uses her sense of justice to subdue those who wrong her, but at the same time, she's all about instinct and guts, she isn't your Lara Croft or your fancy Black Widow. She just acts on pure instinct of what is right and she understands that most of the time, reality is screwed up and doesn't care for what is wrong or right. I was left speechless at the sheer simplicity with which she conveys so much pain, anger and most of all strength. At the same time, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what she could do. At the beginning of the movie, you can't picture her as that tough. But by the end of it, even those cops were smiling at her, thinking 'Okay, let's never upset this one or we'll get our asses whooped!' As for Sutherland, wow, he can play a real creep when he wants to and be good at it too. His facial expressions and his gestures tell everything you need to know about him as a killer. And at the beginning, when he's playing the good guy, he's so believable you know right away he's sure to be off his bonkers. I have to admit though, he's a tad underplayed. There's not enough focus on him. Also, I was expecting a little bit more from him, but Reese made up for whatever was missing. As a side note, Brittany Murphy is another nice touch to this movie. I have seen this kind of performance before, but I think she made it personal, as in she made you believe that she was the one going through all of that. I just wish she could have played more parts like this one, but I guess we'll never see that happening now...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see Reese Witherspoon show her acting props. I really miss this side of her. Now she's more into sweet, sugary indie movies which aren't all bad, they just don't give her much to work with and waste some of her huge potential. Oh and that accent of hers needs to take front stage right now, it's adorable! Go watch this movie and you won't regret it!

However, that this is one of the most overrated of all time, no one can deny that.I hate westerns. However, considering the fame of this one, the fact that it is in most lists of the all time's greatest movies, the fact of being a Spanish-Italian production and the value that most people give it (including this guy who is a friend of mine, who owns the movie and loaned it to me), I decided to give it a look, even though its long runtime could easily scare me off.I know that its Italian title is 'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo', but I don't know if it was filmed in English language and later dubbed in Italian or the contrary, although I believe it was filmed in English.This spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie (The Good), Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (The Bad) and Eli Wallach as Tuco (The Ugly).To be frank, the character Tuco annoyed me very much, not to mention that he was worst than snakes. Angel Eyes was nowhere near as annoying, being a more likable character in comparison. Blondie is a more complicated character. He's supposed to be the good guy yet he teams with Tuco during most of the movie and actually saves him twice from his execution rope (including in the end, when he was supposed to kill him). He kills Angel Eyes, yet he doesn't kill Tuco - and after everything that Tuco did to him. He is not that good after all...There's some good in this movie but I saw far more of bad and ugly in it. There is brutal violence in this. Plus, the movie is way too long. And it doesn't really offer much during its runtime of nearly 3 hours.Certain sequences were filmed in a way that strongly resembles me '2001 A Space Odyssey'. The first 9-10 minutes are a good example of this. The opening is long and has music, there is no dialog, the slow pace of the scenes gives us time to appreciate the scenario. Another good example of this is the Mexican standoff scene that lasts 5 minutes near the ending when the 3 main characters stare each other down in the graveyard's circular center, calculating alliances and dangers (and the amazing distance which the camera films it).The famous film score by Ennio Morricone (who is a genius, like John Williams) is phenomenal, especially the spectacular and unforgettable main theme. But the music that plays when Tuco is running in the Sad Hill cemetery is equally memorable.I didn't know that this movie was part of a trilogy, much less that it was the 3rd one.

The value of these people is strongly emphasized--despite a feudal society that saw them as expendable. Through the use of a haughty young doctor from a rich family who arrives at Red Beard's combination clinic\/hospital, the director is able to show the nobility of the poor. The young man's opinions change towards these people he previously thought were beneath him as he is forced to make rounds in the hospital and surrounding community. Seeing men die, women getting operated on without anesthesia and the degradation of the poor has a strong effect on the young man--and the audience as well. Interestingly, however, despite Toshiro Mifune being the star, he is a shadowy figure through much of this film--appearing and disappearing for long stretches of the film. Instead, the film really is about this young doctor's journey and the effect the unorthodox Mifune has upon him.Speaking of unorthodox, I loved some of Mifune's strange techniques to help the poor. In particular, I loved the great fight scene at brothel where he took on a gang of thugs to save one young girl as well as the way he occasionally used extortion on his rich patients in order to gain funds for his hospital!

The value of these people is strongly emphasized--despite a feudal society that saw them as expendable. Through the use of a haughty young doctor from a rich family who arrives at Red Beard's combination clinic\/hospital, the director is able to show the nobility of the poor. The young man's opinions change towards these people he previously thought were beneath him as he is forced to make rounds in the hospital and surrounding community. Seeing men die, women getting operated on without anesthesia and the degradation of the poor has a strong effect on the young man--and the audience as well. Interestingly, however, despite Toshiro Mifune being the star, he is a shadowy figure through much of this film--appearing and disappearing for long stretches of the film. Instead, the film really is about this young doctor's journey and the effect the unorthodox Mifune has upon him.Speaking of unorthodox, I loved some of Mifune's strange techniques to help the poor. In particular, I loved the great fight scene at brothel where he took on a gang of thugs to save one young girl as well as the way he occasionally used extortion on his rich patients in order to gain funds for his hospital! Great stuff--and well worth seeing because of the complex and rewarding plot. Exquisite.

He has great skill as a storyteller. He addresses important social and political themes. There are moments in this film that utterly delight this viewer. Cinematography by David Watkin, one my favourite cinematographers and a very much unappreciated one, brings immense joy to watching this movie. I don't know if he or Mr. Jewison is responsible for the close up of eggs in the middle. I love that shot. I also very much love the score by composer Dick Hyman. It is a perfect work for this film. No one does better film scores than Mr. Hyman, whose remarkable work with Woody Allen became an important part of my love of many classic Allen films. The script by John Patrick Shanly, the writer of Joe Versus the Volcano, a much neglected and undervalued film, seems (to me) to personify a love of New York and Italian New York culture and society. This is beautiful writing. If editor Lou Lombardo had somehow been able to edit Nicholas Cage from this work, the film would rate close to a ten. The rest of the cast does outstanding work. For a look at what Mr. Jewison did achieve look at Fiddler on the Roof, A Soldier's Story, or The Hurricane. At any rate, this is a fine work to enjoy in spite of that fundamental flaw in casting.

Even today, this film includes some of the grossest sequences ever captured on screen, and one is often not sure whether one is about to puke out of disgust or laughter. Some disgusting highlights include Crackers having a date that includes sex acts with chickens, a man with a 'singing' anus, Divine performing oral sex on her film son, and Divine eating actual dog-crap (for real!).
