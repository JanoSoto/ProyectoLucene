[{"date":"28 January 2003","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Lola Rennt is actually a masterpiece in modern film-making and it's good to see this one is not from Hollywood. I've never seen a movie so interesting and revolutionary in basic concept. But besides that, several other flicks like superb background music (and in right sense each case), set designing, brilliant camera angles, use of animated portions have made this movie an allover champion, we'll come to the acting later.Actually, the movie is an indirect example of the chaos theory. Lola (Franka Potente) receives a phone call from her boyfriend Manni who left a bag of hundred thousand DM in the subway but without it he's doomed. But Lola says him to wait until she comes and she has only 20 minutes to reach Manni with the money. And so Lola runs.....Now director Tom Tykwer explores the situation's limitless possibilities by defying time and space. In each of Lola Rennt's three scenarios (with three different endings), subtle changes in Lola's run instantly affect the lives of random strangers encountered on her path. Every action has significance and every second counts. Such a fantastic idea was not easy to describe in the movie. But Tykwer was magnificent at that... he finely applied the theory but without making a slightest reference.Besides running wildly, Potente had many other things to do and she offered a pretty good performance. She looked younger and energetic in that bright red hair. Bleibtreu as Manni was also good. But the real hero of the movie is itself, or more precisely, Tom Tykwer. I'll rate his movie 5\/5.

He regains consciousness on a ship at sea with a stranger performing impromptu surgery on him.  With no memory of how he'd gotten there, nor who he is, he tries to retrace his life and figure things out.  How surprising, then, to find out that there is someone or someones trying to kill him...and he has astounding self-defense skills he didn't know he had.This is the premise of The Bourne Identity.  Matt Damon's nuanced and sensitive performance of Jason Bourne keeps this thriller from sinking into just another entry in that genre.  When he makes startling discoveries about his past identity, he actually shows it!  *gasp!*  A sensitive, caring assassin?  Who'da thunk it?  As the plot barrels forward with stunning stunts and excellent acting from Damon and his reluctant sidekick, the always phenomenal Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), The Bourne Identity is well worth viewing!
