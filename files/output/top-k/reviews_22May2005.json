Doubtless there are some who would not enjoy this movie, as with any movie, but it is certainly among the best kids movies ever made, that is also enjoyable for adults. The film deals with a boys journey through the chocolate factory of the eccentric Mr Willy Wonka. It is an adaptation of a novel by acclaimed children's author Roald Dahl, and as such, the plot is whimsical and engrossing. I have no complaints with the plot, except for Charlie visiting his mother at the laundry, an intrusive device to allow the inclusion of a song that is boring at best. The song was supposed to give some emotional impact, and give us a look into the relationship between Charlie and his mother. The only thing this achieves, is to leave the viewer wondering why Charlie did not even consider asking his mother to accompany him to the chocolate factory, instead of his bedridden (and lazy) grandfather. Aside from this small complaint, I believe the plot is excellent.The casting of the film is superb, leading to some great acting. The obvious standout is Mr Gene Wilder, who gives the performance of his lifetime as Willy Wonka. He is charming, eccentric, dark and a little bit scary. Of course no small amount of this is due to a script that gives him some great lines. Still, we must take nothing away from Gene Wilder, who gives a performance that most actors would give their right arms to equal. Other characters are also memorable, such as; Charlie's teacher, Veruca, Veruca's father, Violet, Mr Slugworth and the candy store owner. All of the actors playing these parts give exceptional performances. In regards to the characters, the only real complaint is Charlie himself. He is noticeably the weakest link in the chain. This is not entirely the actors fault, though he must shoulder some of the blame. The character, as written, is weak. He is given nothing memorable to say or do. He seems to be your classic goody-two-shoes (despite the fizzy lifting drink episode, obviously added to try and combat this problem). Charlie is supposed to be the straight character, in that he is the normal one. This is to give the other characters someone to bounce off if you will. However this idea was carried much to far, to the detriment of the film. Such is the problem that every second Charlie is on screen, we wish for the camera to focus on a different character. Other than this, the characters, and acting, are great.It may seem that this review is rather critical given the rating (10\/10). This rating was given in response to the amount of enjoyment that one can get from watching this film. The movie is flawed, yet it is a great movie nonetheless. No movie is perfect, despite what some fans might say. But a great movie is enjoyable in spite of its flaws. This is a must see movie.

A freedom based rebellion fighting against an evil Empire, the film draws a very strong line between good and evil (a line which will eventually become blurred) and simultaneously provides us with the ultimate Science Fiction Epic.Over a quarter of a century old, this film and it's two sequels is perhaps one of the most famous and popular films of all time. Entertaining and addictive, it has some serious flaws, but we overlook them due to the feeling of child like joy that it gives us.Written and directed by creator George Lucas, this first film, second sequel Return of the Jedi and it's prequels, contains some of the worst lines you will ever encounter. As one star said to Lucas you can write this sh*t George, but you sure can't say it.The problem with George Lucas is that Star Wars has always been his baby. As a result, Lucas often gives the impression that the only person to be allowed to change it should be him. Releasing remastered versions of his original trilogy, Lucas is constantly cutting and changing his original film to degrees that it is beginning to loose a lot of it's original glory.Released in the 1970s and early 80s, Lucas's original trilogy is a joy to watch because of what it is. At the time an original, well constructed film, by modern standards, the special effects are laughable. Aliens consisting of men in masks or rubber puppets, part of the beauty of the Star Wars trilogy was always it's out of date style. Unfortunately though, as the times have changed, George Lucas has released altered versions of the film with new, inappropriate, special effects and scenes which feel out of place. Lucas needs to realise that films are good because of what they are, they don't need to be constantly updated. Films like Battleship Potempkin from the 1920s were good because of their story and because of the meaning at the time. If someone was to release an edit of 'Potempkin' with colour added, a new soundtrack and brand new special effects during crucial scenes, the film would loose some of it's beauty. With Star Wars this is what Lucas has done. Adding random animals to scenes and reintroducing an edited scene starring future bad guy Jabba The Hutt, Lucas has corrupted the wonderful film he worked so hard to create.Everyone who has seen it, tends to love Star Wars. Often winning polls to find the best ever films, this marvellous trilogy is a reminder to so many people of a childhood past. Sadly though, as the films get older, George Lucas refuses to let them date gracefully. Constantly rehashing and rewriting, Lucas is already responsible for an atrocious script, only to add to his crimes.

Anderson's Boogie Nights is basically a character study of porn industry participants between the years of 1977-1984. We see much of the film through the eyes of a young man who takes the industry by storm at the tender age of 17. We see his rise during the care-free innocence of the later 70s and we witness him bottom out in the early 80s. We are also introduced to several other performers, filmmakers, hangers on, and criminals. Cocaine seems to be the catalyst behind much of the action. This type of film might have been laughable if made by a director with less talent, but Anderson's unique style and skills make it a winner.Mark Wahlberg plays our young stud who takes the name of Dirk Diggler. He's apparently a high school dropout with an enormous penis who catches the attention of a porn director played by Burt Reynolds. Wahlberg's performance begins as properly understated, then seems to grow with the character. Reynolds hasn't been this good since Smokey and the Bandit. The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of the more respected actors of our day. Don Cheadle is outstanding as a young man who takes pride in his acting, but really wants to open up a stereo store more than anything else. Julianne Moore is is also very good as the maternal figure of the troupe who has basically adopted the younger actors as her own children to replace her real son lost in a custody dispute. There is simply not enough space here to give credit to everyone who acted superbly in this film.Anderson's skill with the camera is on display in numerous shots. Many have been used elsewhere, but he knows how to work them into his story. Many of the scenes take place in crowded rooms or at parties where all kinds of interesting things are going on. His technique often takes us from one room to another, then perhaps outside so we don't miss a thing. The use of soundtrack is perhaps the best of any film I've ever seen. In fact, it IS the best. With so many great songs of the period at his disposal, he works two discs worth into the story. Nothing seems excessive or out of place.If one fault can be found with this film, then I would have to say it would be too much violence in the last half hour. Any industry that deals in sex and drugs to that extent is bound to encounter violence in some circles, but Boogie Nights over does it. I counted no less than five extremely bloody scenes. In one, a VERY young woman overdoses on coke and breaks a blood vessel in her nose. There are several gunshot victims. But the most over-the-top scene would have to be the one where Heather Graham stomps on the head of a young man with her roller skates. The manner in which she comes in contact with him is contrived to the point of hysteria, then the scene ends in such a brutal assault that you'll hardly be able to control your skepticism. The fact that the consequences of the assault are not even revealed to the audience (at least not in any version of the film I've seen) makes you wonder why Anderson thought to include it at all. It was just a means for the young woman to get some revenge on a guy who made fun of her way back in high school. Nothing more.The film lacks any scene which inspires any true sexual feeling from anyone I've ever talked to. This was indeed intended. The sex in the film is all about business, though Graham's brief nude scene was well appreciated. The film is also lacking in any kind of judgment or moral lesson. We are merely introduced to these characters, then we see what happens to them. Despite a near documentary point of view, the film never bogs down or fails to keep one's interest. The film didn't make that much money, but it has earned the distinction of being one of the better films made in the 1990s. A reputation well-deserved.9 of 10 stars from The Hound.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"22 May 2005","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" P.T. Anderson's Boogie Nights is basically a character study of porn industry participants between the years of 1977-1984. We see much of the film through the eyes of a young man who takes the industry by storm at the tender age of 17. We see his rise during the care-free innocence of the later 70s and we witness him bottom out in the early 80s. We are also introduced to several other performers, filmmakers, hangers on, and criminals. Cocaine seems to be the catalyst behind much of the action. This type of film might have been laughable if made by a director with less talent, but Anderson's unique style and skills make it a winner.Mark Wahlberg plays our young stud who takes the name of Dirk Diggler. He's apparently a high school dropout with an enormous penis who catches the attention of a porn director played by Burt Reynolds. Wahlberg's performance begins as properly understated, then seems to grow with the character. Reynolds hasn't been this good since Smokey and the Bandit. The rest of the cast reads like a who's who of the more respected actors of our day. Don Cheadle is outstanding as a young man who takes pride in his acting, but really wants to open up a stereo store more than anything else. Julianne Moore is is also very good as the maternal figure of the troupe who has basically adopted the younger actors as her own children to replace her real son lost in a custody dispute. There is simply not enough space here to give credit to everyone who acted superbly in this film.Anderson's skill with the camera is on display in numerous shots. Many have been used elsewhere, but he knows how to work them into his story. Many of the scenes take place in crowded rooms or at parties where all kinds of interesting things are going on. His technique often takes us from one room to another, then perhaps outside so we don't miss a thing. The use of soundtrack is perhaps the best of any film I've ever seen. In fact, it IS the best. With so many great songs of the period at his disposal, he works two discs worth into the story. Nothing seems excessive or out of place.If one fault can be found with this film, then I would have to say it would be too much violence in the last half hour. Any industry that deals in sex and drugs to that extent is bound to encounter violence in some circles, but Boogie Nights over does it. I counted no less than five extremely bloody scenes. In one, a VERY young woman overdoses on coke and breaks a blood vessel in her nose. There are several gunshot victims. But the most over-the-top scene would have to be the one where Heather Graham stomps on the head of a young man with her roller skates. The manner in which she comes in contact with him is contrived to the point of hysteria, then the scene ends in such a brutal assault that you'll hardly be able to control your skepticism. The fact that the consequences of the assault are not even revealed to the audience (at least not in any version of the film I've seen) makes you wonder why Anderson thought to include it at all. It was just a means for the young woman to get some revenge on a guy who made fun of her way back in high school. Nothing more.The film lacks any scene which inspires any true sexual feeling from anyone I've ever talked to. This was indeed intended. The sex in the film is all about business, though Graham's brief nude scene was well appreciated. The film is also lacking in any kind of judgment or moral lesson. We are merely introduced to these characters, then we see what happens to them. Despite a near documentary point of view, the film never bogs down or fails to keep one's interest.

It was about a lozenge or a drink which if taken could change the party digesting it into any person he or she wanted. Gilbert had ideas about how to develop this idea into a full story, but as he outlined the idea he was told by his partners it would not do. His only alternative was his first medieval Savoy Opera. In 1882 Lord Tennyson had created a verse play called THE PRINCESS. It, like all Tennyson's plays, was politely successful because of their creator's popularity. Like his fellow poet, Robert Browning, Tennyson was a good poet but a third - rate dramatist. THE PRINCESS dealt with a princess running a school only for women. Gilbert, no feminist, saw some possibilities for a spoof. So he created PRINCESS IDA, taking Tennyson's basic work and twisting it into a satire on education, feminism, and medieval romances. There would even be a dig at Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory in the song The Lady and the Ape. In retrospect it looks odd that Sullivan and Carte accepted it - it was a two act operetta with a prelude (today it is known as the only three act Savoy Opera). Reading it, even with allowance for predominant views of women in 1884, it is hard to understand why they felt it was suitable or would be popular. My guess is that the medieval background appealed to Sullivan's desire for a grand opera work.PRINCESS IDA ran about eight months. Given that from 1877 to 1884 the average Savoy work ran a year and then some, this was a flop (it remains something of a flop even now - revivals of PRINCESS IDA are less likely than any of the completed operettas except for THE SORCEROR, UTOPIA LTD., and THE GRAND DUKE). Sullivan actually was better in doing his share in this work than Gilbert was than in any other of their works but THE GRAND DUKE - Gilbert's heart really wasn't in PRINCESS IDA. As a result of this, and Sullivan's knighthood that year, Gilbert was in a weak position.His first offer was to let Sullivan do an operetta with another writer (Bret Harte was mentioned, interestingly enough). Then he offered the lozenge plot. Sullivan refused it again. He wanted a plot with real people and real situations. Actually that Sullivan said this at all shows how little he ever understood of his partner. Gilbert was not a realist, but went to town spoofing logic.At the behest of his wife, Gilbert went to Knightsbridge, where a model Japanese village was exhibited. He found it fascinating, even buying a Japanese ceremonial sword as a souvenir. It was hanging on a wall in his study, where Gilbert was racking his brains for a new idea, when it fell. Gilbert walked to it, picked it up, and began thinking. And theatrical history was made as a result.TOPSY-TURVEY follows the story of how Gilbert presented Sullivan and Carte with their greatest work, THE MIKADO, or THE TOWN OF TITIPOO (to give it it's complete title). It gives more details of the lifestyles and problems of both men (Gilbert's poisonous relationship with his mother; his failure to have children with his wife; Sullivan's relationship with Mrs. Ronalds - his American born lover). It looks more deeply into the lives and problems of Jessie Bond, George Grossmith, Rutland Barrignton, Richard Temple, and the other members of the cast and orchestra. As such it is more detailed than THE GREAT GILBERT AND SULLIVAN was, but it only concentrates on the year 1884 to 85. While all the performances are on target, and touching in their ways, Jim Broadbent as the stern but reliable dramatist gave his first film performance of international stature. He captures the lack of nonsense in the everyday Gilbert, the thorough craftsman of plays and productions standards (watch him when he rehearses Grossmith and the others - he fully knows the effects he wants). He missed out the Oscar that he was nominated for in 1999, but would get one a few years after for IRIS. His reputation is firmly established now.Oh, about the lozenge plot. Over the years after 1885 Gilbert brought it up again and again in 1887, 1888, 1889. Each time he was shouted down. When the partners went their separate ways briefly after THE GONDELIERS, in 1890, Gilbert approached Alfred Cellier with the idea. Cellier said yes. Sullivan finally produced his opera, IVANHOE at this time. It ran for four months, and then fell into oblivion. Gilbert and Cellier's THE MOUNTEBANKS ran for about as long as PRINCESS IDA did, and since it was not a Gilbert and Sullivan work that was terrific. It can be revived on occasion.

It seems as though Disney did not have very high expectations for this movie, considering the little promoting they did and release date they gave it. This was grossly underrated.Denzel Washington was excellent as Coach Herman Boone. A highly qualified coach who is tough, but fair to his players. He has faced racism and discrimination throughout his life, is given the head coaching job at T.C. Williams high in Virginia, because of his race.Will Patton as was wonderful as Coach Bill Yoast. Another highly qualified coach who will experience what Coach Boone has, as the head coaching job is taken away from him and takes a demotion as Assistant Coach to Boone, after the white players said they would sit out the season in out of loyalty to Coach Yoast, but mainly, due to their prejudice to Coach Boone.the rest of the cast was good as well. Ryan Hurst as Gerry Bertier, Ryan Gosling as Alan Bosley, had to overcome their prejudices and fears towards their African-American teammates and coach, while Wood Harrris as Julius Campbell, and Donald Faison as Petey to name a couple, will have to deal with their teammates' prejudices I mentioned and come together with their white teammates to become a team. The cast was wonderful. I could go on and on about it, but it there's more to this movie than the cast.Director Boaz Yakin seemed to capture the turbulent times of this era; The post Civil Rights Movement, integration of the public schools in the south and racism in particular. I almost felt like I was there, having to deal with this. I liked the football scenes as well. Once again, I almost felt like I was there cheering on the Titans as they were going for the perfect season and their battle for the Virginia AAA state football title.When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was taken in immediately and I said to myself I will add this DVD to my library. Needless to say, I have it.Another interesting thing is, when this movie is shown on television, I'll watch it. Normally, I won't watch it because these movies have scenes edited out, parts of the dialog is bleeped or dubbed, due to the inappropriate scene, time and\/or language content. In addition, you have to deal with those annoying commercial breaks.The reason why I'll watch it is, the scenes that ended up on the editing floor for whatever reason on the theater and DVD version. On the latter. you can find it in the deleted scenes section on the bonus features of the DVD, but on the television version, those same deleted scenes, you can find them back in the movie.

Normally, I won't watch it because these movies have scenes edited out, parts of the dialog is bleeped or dubbed, due to the inappropriate scene, time and\/or language content.

Films like Down by the Law and Night on Earth had made him a favourite long before the likes of Quentin Tarantino came on the scene, and Jarmusch was most definitely at the height of American cinema. These days, Jarmusch isn't quite as well liked as he once was; but this hasn't stopped him directing good movies. Ghost Dog The Way of the Samurai is much more down to earth than most of Jarmusch's earlier films, but it still has that coolness in it's essence, and although it isn't vintage Jarmusch; it's still a very good movie. The film isn't quite like anything I've ever seen before (and that isn't something I see much of these days!) as it's plotting is so relaxed that it's pretty much at walking pace throughout, and it's relaxed atmosphere isn't something that has been seen too many times in cinema, especially not modern cinema. All in all, what it lacks in coolness; Ghost Dog makes up for in originality.This movie is very much what film fans would class as an indie. It's just too absurd and daring to possibly have studio backing; and that is credit to it's director, as this film helps to prove that indie films are often far more likable and inventive than their big budget counterparts. The director has made best use of the casting, and Forest Whitaker, despite not being an actor with an impressive list of lead roles to his credit, pulls out an excellent performance that brilliantly fits the tone of the movie. This is the sort of casting that shows you don't need a well respected and highly paid actor in your movie for it to work, just one that fits the role. Jarmusch has written lots of great and absurdly funny scenes for the movie, the best of which is the one in which Ghost Dog's employer explains the arrangement to a baffled group of colleagues - it's comedy genius! The film, at times, gets a little bit too arty for it's own good and that may make some viewers roll their eyes. It's also perhaps just a little too relaxed. Still, it's not bad.

Was George Lucas going to create another amazing trilogy of films to rival the originals? Was he going to destroy the entire franchise through stupidity? Many people will have gone into the cinema with a feeling of dread. It must have been a shame therefore that their fears were proved right. Episode I of these prequels is an abomination and a travesty to the world of Star Wars badly written by George Lucas, it's one redeeming grace is the occasional decent performance by it's actors. Sadly though it is such a childish and uncomfortable film that it really should never have been released.After political sanctions surrounding the peaceful city of Naboo, two Jedi knights are sent to resolve the conflict and bring peace back to the galaxy. Finding themselves on the planet though Qui-gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) work with Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) to liberate her illegally occupied home world.Bright in colour and not much else, The Phantom Menace is truly awful. Written and directed by original creator George Lucas, the script and the direction are amateur in style and almost childlike. The finest moment in the entire Star Wars universe was The Empire Strikes Back and the reason for this crowning glory was the lack of interference from Lucas. Unfortunately for everyone though, Lucas has far too much involvement in all three prequels.It is a shame really that so much of this film is badly done. Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman show signs of why they are such respected actors with masterful performances, despite having nothing to work with. Their roles are forgettable though when you consider two characters who make the film childish and incredibly tedious.One of the most important characters of the Star Wars universe is Anakin Skywalker. Father of Luke, Anakin features in one form or another through all six created films. In the Phantom Menace we encounter him for the first time as a little boy, played by Jake Lloyd. Lloyd is not a bad actor for his age. Putting in a decent performance, he is let down badly because the character is annoying, infuriating and far too dominant in the story. His scene involving pod racing is particularly bad with visions of an exciting computer game clouding George Lucas' mind and commercial aspects taking complete control.As well as the character of Anakin, The Phantom Menace also contains the worst character to ever feature in George Lucas' universe.Jar Jar Binks is an ugly computer generated character who spends this film following around our heroes and constantly gets into trouble. Put in the film blatantly for cheap laughs and the approval of children, Binks is so unbelievably bad that there were even versions of the film posted on the internet where all his scenes were removed. He is an awful character and the one travesty is that we never get to see him die.There is no excuse for garbage like this film. Blatantly after money, George Lucas managed to create a film high on commercial possibilities, but void of plot or entertainment. The script is badly written, the story is weak, the majority of characters are a nightmarish reality and the audience are leaving in their thousands. With this film Lucas managed to destroy his own universe and for many, he inspired terror about the remaining two prequels. Dire.

So when a key scientist receives an inoperable brain injury, a medical team in a small submarine are miniaturised and injected into his bloodstream. Their mission is to treat him from the inside, but there is an unknown saboteur amongst them ...Fantastic Voyage is one of those great how-about-this-for-an-idea science-fiction films. Not only is it visually stunning, brilliantly made and great fun to watch, it's also a fascinating lesson in human biology and physiology. The script is a bit wonky - at times it's like a mega-budget widescreen version of a daffy old schoolkids' biology class film - but the miniaturisation idea is so clever, who cares ? Where the movie really scores though is in the visuals, as the sub Proteus glides through amazing vistas; arteries, veins, lymph-nodes, pleural sacs, neural membranes. Veteran cameraman Ernest Laszlo and director Fleischer create an incredible world, with all sorts of inventive techniques - travelling-mattes, filters, actors on wires, shooting in slow motion. The special effects (by L.B. Abbot, Art Cruickshank and Emil Kosa Jr.) and the art design (by Jack Martin Smith and Dale Hennesy) are both superb, and both won Academy Awards, and there is a great tension-building atonal score by Leonard Rosenman. Like any good cult classic the film features some great mad acting - I particularly like O'Brien as the cigar-chomping, coffee-snorting general in charge of the operation, but it's also interesting to see a then-unknown Welch as the only female crew-member. And whilst Pleasence may be far too obvious casting as the villain, he is completely wonderful as the shifty Dr Michaels. This is a great piece of technical film-making, a terrific science-fiction classic and a must-see for any kid who ever wondered how the human body works.

He actually proves to be quite likable as a romantic lead, and makes Forever Young a sweet, endearing romantic fable.In 1939, Mel plays Captain Daniel McCormick, an Air Force test pilot. No stranger to danger, he is willing to brave the latest experimental aircraft, but he's unable to take the biggest risk of all, proposing to his girlfriend, Helen.Every time Daniel tries to work up the courage to pop the question, he loses his bottle. So he decides to wait. Unfortunately, he waits too long. Helen is run down in an accident, and slips into a coma. Daniel can't live without her, and decides to volunteer for a risky experiment.Daniel's best friend Harry Finley (George Wendt) is one of the first scientists working on cryogenics. He has yet to test his theories on a living, human subject. Daniel decides to go for it, where he will be placed into a capsule and frozen for a year. If Helen ever wakes up, Harry wakes up Daniel.But of course, things don't go the way they're supposed to. When World War II breaks out, the cryogenics experiment falls through the cracks. Harry is killed, and as a result, Daniel is forgotten about. He stays frozen in the capsule for over 50 years.Daniel is eventually thawed out by two boys, Nat and Felix (Nat is played by a young Elijah Wood). Daniel wakes to find the world has become a very different place. Staying with Nat and his mother Claire (the delightful Jamie Lee Curtis), Daniel tries to piece together the last 50 years.To enjoy Forever Young, you will probably have to suspend disbelief quite a bit. The story itself is rather outrageous, but on a simple level, it's fairly enjoyable. It has more than a few shades of Back to the Future about it. In the same way Robert Zemeckis brought a Frank Capra style of storytelling to BTTF, the director Steve Miner also brings a gentle, benign touch to this story.The greatest discovery of all is the fact that Mel Gibson manages to make this film work. He makes for a very endearing character when he is lost in the 1990's. His amazement at the new world is played in a very understated fashion. His confusion and old-fashioned naiveté are subtly incorporated into the story, e.g. discovering filtered cigarettes, seat-belts, answering machines, etc.What's nice about his performance is also the fact that Daniel was brought up in different times. He has a completely different set of values compared to the cynical attitudes of the present day. I like the scene where Daniel saves Claire from an abusive ex-boyfriend, or when he gets to sit in the cockpit of an old-fashioned test plane.This type of story could have become very mawkish, but Steve Miner manages to find just the right focus, and balances events just right. Jamie Lee Curtis adds sterling support as always, and she gets a lot of good scenes with Gibson.Elijah Wood also puts in an excellent performance, showing incredible maturity for his age. He acts as Daniel's guide while he is in the 90's, and proves invaluable in putting together what happened to Daniel's past. He plays Nat as neither too precocious or too juvenile, and went on to the fame that he deserved.In some eyes, Forever Young has an improbably happy ending, where Daniel is reunited with Helen. But I didn't mind this time round. Probably because I was enjoying myself too much. I especially like the scene where Daniel teaches Nat to fly in his tree-house. Watch the camera angles, and you sometimes feel as if they really are flying a plane.Forever Young wouldn't win any awards for originality, but if they gave out awards for heartwarming stories, Forever Young would definitely be up for a nomination.

Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas's vision is better off for it. With it's recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it's original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original Star Wars because it isn't so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don't quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn't quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda's style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There's no real way to fault The Empire Strikes Back. The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up Star Wars, but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch. In this part though, Lucas didn't get involved and as a result, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece in it's own right.
