A remake would be tricky to do but not impossible - at least in my opinion. *I know how about we set up everything like the original 1960 movie - hey we can even use the same location and show off now we can do it in colour* *sarcasm*.So as you can see I was not a fan of this movie - I can't even say that much on this movie because if you've seen the original - you'll already know every shot, every line of dialogue, every twist and turn this provides - even Joseph Stefano gets the only screen writing credit.Okay the acting. By god was it terrible! I mean I guess a few people MIGHT have been trying to pull something off but I just have to say something that shows how miscast some of these actors are VINCE VAUGHN AS NORMAN BATES. That's like casting Jim Carey as The Grim Reaper in a remake of The Seventh Seal.The directing of this movie is horrible. I mean I know it's shot for shot Hitchcock's movie but even in the realms of doing that he still does a horrible job. Some of the clothing looks like it was done in the 1960's when it's clearly set in 1998 and when you do find out the twist at the end, seeing Vince Vaughn in drag is one of the most unintentionally hilarious things to be recorded on a camera. And there's the colour grading - it has to be some of the ugliest colour grading ever put on film (EDIT Seriously? THIS GUY WORKED ON HERO?!). Half the time I think they're trying to scream at you Hey look we're doing this in colour! Look! Look!! LOOK!!!.So I guess the only way to enjoy this movie is if you have never seen the original Hitchcock movie. My personal recommendation is that you watch the original and only watch this if you have way too much free time on your hands and even then there's about a million better things to do. I mean this is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen, I mean give some of the other ones credit at least they were somewhat trying to do something different, here all the differences are minor and could be counted on one hand. After this I am definitely watching the sequels because from what I have seen at least they're trying.

However, he is unaware that his whole life has been turned into a TV show in which every move he makes and everything he says is being observed by millions of people around the world. Following a chance encounter, Truman begins to realise that everything isn't as it seems and that maybe his life isn't quite as ordinary as he first thought.I'm a big fan of Jim Carrey, but for some reason this is one film that I've overlooked since its release in 1998. The concept of the film is interesting and I have a feeling that this film will age rather well. At the moment we are in the grip of several reality shows and the Truman Show, in parts, clearly satirises the reality show genres. The camera cuts from time to time to show various groups of people utterly engrossed in what they are watching - this element is believable as I honestly do believe that there are people who can't do without their fix of Made In Chelsea or The Only Way is Essex (UK reality shows)or Keeping Up With the Kardashians as an American equivalent. The Truman Show demonstrates this in a humorous, but subtle manner.The Truman Show for me just seemed to get everything right; the script was intelligent, but it was also cohesive. The plot was straight forward, but it also managed to be touching and moving. Truman Burbank was such a likable person that it's impossible not to care for his character. About halfway through the film there is a 5 minute segment which explains how the Truman Show came about and once you know the 'truth' about Truman you'll care for both him and his cause all the more.Jim Carrey proves here that he is a much more talented actor than some give him credit for. His zany OTT comedic acting style that we've seen in films such as 'The Mask', 'Liar Liar' and the Ace Ventura films are certainly not to everyone's taste, but I happen to like this style of acting and think he's a very funny man. Carrey gives a much more restrained performance here and his performance perfectly suits the tone of this film. Carrey's strong performance and tight script combine together to make this a pretty much flawless film. The cinematography and directing were also top notch. Ed Harris was also superb as the Creator\/Director, but he's only given limited screen time.The ending of the film was suitably uplifting and I can honestly say that this is one of the few films I've seen where I didn't want it to end. The Truman Show is a wonderful film which combines humour, satire, intelligence, a good script, and also manages to be touching and uplifting. It's a rare example of a film which not only felt too short, but also left me with a big smile on my face. The Truman Show is a film that simply has to be seen.

It could have been comic gold if the concept were in the right hands, but sadly this was not the case. The movie was too long. The beginning was fast-paced and humorous, but in Act 2 it became slow, tedious and predictable. The end is also completely and totally predictable. This is all quite unfortunate because the premise is great. The mind-reading scenes were too few. This was supposed to be the core idea of the movie. Therefore, we shouldn't just have a small smattering of mind-reading scenes. This should have been a stronger element. If this movie was made by Woody Allen or Wes Anderson, something truly great and hilarious might have been produced, but this turned out to be a big, sappy, gooey mess. Gibson shows us he can dance. That was a plus. The movie also looked good and had a few decent editing sequences (the scene where he gets electrocuted, for example). However, it does feel (by the end) rather superficial and empty. It could have been an intriguing dissection of gender and gender differences, but it ends up presenting men and women in black and white terms. There were a few nice scenes. The movie wasn't all bad (which is why I gave it five instead of one). The scene where Mel breaks down while watching a woman being emotional on TV, for example... or dancing like Fred Astaire. It was also nice to see the toddler from Growing Pains all grown up (and actually acting quite well!). Overall, I would have to suggest avoiding this one. It's exhausting. If they cut out half an hour, cut down on the subplots, made the film much funnier and if it wasn't so predictable and Hollywoody this could have been something special. Oh well.

They seem like they're going for this silliness, when they should be going for a darker more menacing look.To sum it up, there are plot holes, plot inconsistencies, and a bunch of stupid scenes. It's still better than a Hellraiser sequel, but not by much. Skip it.

The movie focus on the Gerry Conlon's memoir of his imprisonment in England, for a crime, he didn't commit. In the film, Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a trouble young man who would rather explore free love and dope than get a real job. After Gerry Conlon get in deep trouble in Belfast for stripping lead from roofs of houses and causing a riot with British security forces. Gerry's father, Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite), saves him from IRA punishment, by sending off to London to stay with his aunt, for his own good. While, at London, an explosion at a pub in Guildford kills five people (four soldiers and a civilian) and wounds 74, and Gerry Conlon find himself, prime suspect in the crime. Soon the Conlon home is raided by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary arrest both, Gerry and Giuseppe. After being torture and threated, both agree to sign a confession to a crime, they didn't commit. After years of being mistreat in prison, Gerry finally grew up from bitter son who rails against his father's wishes, to fight for justice for himself, his father and those, whom were wrongly convicted when he discovers who the real perpetrator of the bombing are. With help with Gareth Peirce (Emma Thompson), a campaigning lawyer, Gerry try to overturn the falsely convicted of the 1974 IRA's Guildford pub bombings. Will he triumph and gain his freedom or will he fail? Watch it, to find out. Even, so, the film is pretty predictable on the ending outcome, but that's not the main reason, not to watch this movie. You should watch it, to get a true understanding of the thought of being forced to live in a prison like that for seventeen years, accused of a crime, you had no part of. It made my stomach turn and I wept. In the climate of near-hysteria, the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed, allowing the UK police to interrogate suspects for up to seven days without bringing charges or allowing access to an attorney. Americans like myself should watch it, because a similar Act was passed here, after Sept. 11, 2001. Both acts are not right, and need to review. If this movie doesn't raise your blood pressure over the miscarriage of justice, the arrogance of leadership and the need for each individual to judge according to their conscience and not their prejudices, nothing will. Another reason is because the film really work on being a gripping drama between the relationship of father and son. The movie took some liberties by showing the father\/son relationship enhanced by sharing a cell in prison, which they never did in real life. I was immediately drawn into the story by Daniel Day-Lewis' as well, as Pete Postletwaite performances in both legal and personal perspectives. Both are great in this film giving the audience emotional depth. The language is a bit harsh in this movie, lot of cursing, but understanding heavy Irish accents as I do, watching a subtitled edition of this film might be a good idea. Some people might not like this movie due to its over impartially case that Britain misrules Northern Ireland, violates Irish civil rights and knowingly compromises its own legal system. I study a lot about the Troubles between England and Northern Ireland, but I really doubt every Englishman is a corrupt anti-Irish bigot. It might be a bit over exaggeration. Though some minor facts were changed, some the major 'facts' are just not real. Example like the crucial character of Joe McAndrew (Don Baker), an IRA man who might had something to do with the bombings is just a fictional character. Still, what remains as truth is gut wrenching when you think about it. Given the subject matter, the film was still well received in protestant areas of Ireland and in England. The film does shows that English public attitudes turned into a highly supportive for the Conlons' freedom when it started to become clear that they were not the culprits for these atrocities nor does the film make the IRA terrorists look like heroes. It is a bit frustrating that people take what the film tells them as fact, but this doesn't take away from the fact that this is a well made, engaging and quite moving film. Regardless of people's political beliefs or the idea that the film might be a bit political bias. The film is a good movie that never really tip over into slushiness or being over preaching or ranting. The music soundtrack is amazing to hear. I love Bono and Gavin Friday In the Name of the Father. Epic and beautiful. Another great song is 'You Made Me The Thief Of Your Heart performed by Sinead O' Connor. Quite inspiring. Overall, I thought this film was fascinating to watch. While the troubles are now over with 1998's Good Friday Agreement. I think the film is still very important to watch in a post-9\/11 world because it makes us question our current government's hastiness to find answers and make executive decisions. It makes you wonder if our government is or had jail innocent people. Hands down, a politically and emotionally charged issue such as that, is needed to be question. In the Name of the Father shows a good example of that.

Yes, you are reading a review from someone who even managed to find something enjoyable in Psycho 2, Psycho 3 and Psycho 4. Originally I wanted to avoid this movie like the plague because of its reputation. Then I saw the sequels and found something enjoyable in all 3 of them and they had the reputation of being crap. So naturally I thought this would be the same. Oh man was I wrong.Now let me explain the biggest problem with this movie. Its not that it was a remake of Hitchcock. Personally I'm fine with remakes as long as they're done well, for example Werner Herzog's interpretation of Nosferatu is a great movie. I enjoy both Nosferatu movies and place both of them as Horror classics and from what I know, I'm not the only one. Gus Van Sant tackled this with the mentality of If it ain't broke, don't fix it so what we get are almost exact shot replicas except in color, so much so that Joseph Stephano - the screenwriter for the original - gets the credit for writing the script for the remake. If you do that as a filmmaker, people can't help but to judge against the original and when the original is directed by Alfred Hitchcock, you're gonna fail. Yes, you're reading this review right. I actually wouldn't have minded this film if it didn't follow Hitchcock to the letter. Do your own thing, do not cut and paste the script of one of the best movies ever made.The only difference between these scenes are things like, a character wears glasses or carries an umbrella, the angles are different, the technology is updated and the director adds a total of 2 new shots in the entire movie! Thats pretty much the difference between this movie and the original with the exception of actors and its in colour. Oh there is one more thing, the original used rather dark lighting for obvious reasons if your doing a horror movie, this film has some of the brightest lighting I've ever seen. This works against the scenes making any atmosphere in this film (try to imagine) not work.The acting is generally crap. Okay people like Julianne Moore and Viggo Mortesen did okay but Anne Heche doesn't even come close to Janet Leigh and do I really need to point out whats wrong with casting Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? No, I think that actually speaks for itself. Its a shame because I feel as though almost every single actor in this movie is trying but it can't be saved.The thing that amazes me is how forgettable this movie is. All the other Psycho films hold something to marvel at. For example in Psycho 2, it was a movie with a sad message that no matter how much Norman tried, he could not escape his past nor what Mother did. Psycho 3 had him battling his personality when he falls in love with a catholic who also has psychological problems who tries to help him out of his psychosis but Mother interferes a few too many times for Norman's comfort. In Psycho 4, it went into the deep recesses of what made Norman a killer and how he would deal with his past for good. If this film offered that much originality and effort, it could actually be saved but, as I said not one paragraph earlier, it can't.This movie is a prime example of what happens when a remake sticks too closely to the original and why thats a bad thing. If you're going to remake Psycho, I'm one of those people that would be intrigued by it. But when you remake a movie you want to...remake it, not just reshoot it. Overall if I, a man who saw Psycho 3 and said there is something well written in this movie didn't like it, you know thats a bad sign. Do I recommend it? Actually yes. To two particular groups; 1.

For instance, you know that Jason Statham is going to have a heavy Cockney accent or that Nicholas Cage will over-act like his life depended on it. But with Clint, you know you're getting a man with a face that has seen it all and doesn't mind doing it again. He made his name in the saddle and this low-budget Western is exactly the sort of material the big man enjoys, when he isn't having a conversation with a chair on stage. But fifty long years have passed and this film is one in serious need of restoration. Crippled with technical problems, this cult shooter has a magnetic central performance but a patchy script based on the Japanese film Yôjinbô that's tricky to follow.Somewhere in America's vast dusty nothingness, a stranger (Clint Eastwood) arrives in a town dominated by two warring families - the Baxters led by John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy) and the Rojo family, headed by the bloodthirsty Ramon (Gian Maria Volonté). Ignoring the pleas of the town's bartender Silvanito (José Calvo) to leave town quickly, the stranger senses an opportunity to make some money by playing each side off against the other. But can he hope to survive when the lead starts flying in a town where he is almost completely out-gunned?Arguably the first so-called 'spaghetti western' that garnered any success at the box office, it's perhaps easy to see why A Fistful Of Dollars came to define a sub-genre. It took long-established traditions (Westerns were hugely popular back in the silent era, after all) and challenged them in ways that aren't immediately obvious. Simple things like camera angles, close-ups and cinematography were adjusted to present a well-known setting in a different way. And then, of course, there was Eastwood's iconic performance as The Man With No Name. Looking and acting very different from his predecessors, Eastwood's impossibly cool character easily holds the film together and outshines everyone else on screen. It is worth noting that the dubbing is appalling compared to other films of the time, which does detract somewhat from their performances, but also makes the actors kinda look and sound fairly similar. Halfway through, I'd lost track of who was doing what to whom and why (much like I did in another version of the story, Last Man Standing) and this made the plot almost unfathomable.Although it doesn't quite float my boat, I do understand why A Fistful Of Dollars is held in quiet reverence. It may be hokey, low-budget and poorly scripted but the sheer charisma of Eastwood's lone hero meant that a sequel or two was inevitable. It was also ground-breaking in its way, forging a separate path from the well-worn clichés of traditional westerns and heading off in a more entertaining direction. But its very success and legacy weaken it for viewers today as we have become used to the things that were shown here for the first time, in the same way that anyone who listens to rock music today would listen to The Sex Pistols for the first time with reverent indifference - thankful for its existence but not getting excited in the same way as listeners did back in the day. A Fistful Of Dollars looks a lot more quaint in its old age than it did fifty years ago but at least it's brave enough to break free from the shackles of its inspirations. Think of it this way - will The Matrix still blow you away in fifty years time in the same way it did when you caught it at the cinema? I very much doubt it.

For instance, you know that Jason Statham is going to have a heavy Cockney accent or that Nicholas Cage will over-act like his life depended on it. But with Clint, you know you're getting a man with a face that has seen it all and doesn't mind doing it again. He made his name in the saddle and this low-budget Western is exactly the sort of material the big man enjoys, when he isn't having a conversation with a chair on stage. But fifty long years have passed and this film is one in serious need of restoration. Crippled with technical problems, this cult shooter has a magnetic central performance but a patchy script based on the Japanese film Yôjinbô that's tricky to follow.Somewhere in America's vast dusty nothingness, a stranger (Clint Eastwood) arrives in a town dominated by two warring families - the Baxters led by John Baxter (Wolfgang Lukschy) and the Rojo family, headed by the bloodthirsty Ramon (Gian Maria Volonté). Ignoring the pleas of the town's bartender Silvanito (José Calvo) to leave town quickly, the stranger senses an opportunity to make some money by playing each side off against the other. But can he hope to survive when the lead starts flying in a town where he is almost completely out-gunned?Arguably the first so-called 'spaghetti western' that garnered any success at the box office, it's perhaps easy to see why A Fistful Of Dollars came to define a sub-genre. It took long-established traditions (Westerns were hugely popular back in the silent era, after all) and challenged them in ways that aren't immediately obvious. Simple things like camera angles, close-ups and cinematography were adjusted to present a well-known setting in a different way. And then, of course, there was Eastwood's iconic performance as The Man With No Name. Looking and acting very different from his predecessors, Eastwood's impossibly cool character easily holds the film together and outshines everyone else on screen. It is worth noting that the dubbing is appalling compared to other films of the time, which does detract somewhat from their performances, but also makes the actors kinda look and sound fairly similar. Halfway through, I'd lost track of who was doing what to whom and why (much like I did in another version of the story, Last Man Standing) and this made the plot almost unfathomable.Although it doesn't quite float my boat, I do understand why A Fistful Of Dollars is held in quiet reverence. It may be hokey, low-budget and poorly scripted but the sheer charisma of Eastwood's lone hero meant that a sequel or two was inevitable. It was also ground-breaking in its way, forging a separate path from the well-worn clichés of traditional westerns and heading off in a more entertaining direction.

Back in the days when Leary was a smokin' hot comedian but not much of a movie star and Spacey wasn't that much of a movie star either!. One of those films yous saw in the videoshop amongst the other comedies but never rented because you didn't really know who the actors were, and you'd never heard of the film, maybe that's just me.The plot isn't rocket science but it is genius. Its Christmas and a robber is on the run, so he kidnaps a middle aged married couple, taking them back to their house. Little does the robber know these two lovebirds are having a bit of a marital spat and are at each others throats. To top that the whole family are on the way for Xmas Eve dinner so Leary's robber must try to control the happy couple whilst dealing with a group of nosy pestering family members.It really does sound like the next perfect National Lampoon caper for Chevy Chase, the whole film is very much like 'Christmas Vacation' accept this is more for adults. Its all very obvious really, naturally Leary uses his quickfire motormouth wit to spearhead much of the comedy and cruel attacks against various family members. Spacey's character is soft spoken but with a sharp tongue whilst Davis' character beautifully grows from calm and collected to spiteful rude and loud with her verbal assaults as she slowly gets more drunk.The main attacks fly in the direction of Spacey's mother played in a very stuffy way by the stout Glynis Johns. Of course the old mother character has money so the family normally suck up to her constantly, but this all breaks down slowly as the evening progresses which leads to some very funny moments. You can count on Leary to lose his rag in a monumental fashion with everyone as the heat builds and his window to escape slowly closes. Quite simply the film plays on the common much used comedic factors of our own relations, something that every family in the world can probably relate to. The old mother who is gruff with little tact and heavily controls one son too much. That son being downtrodden weak and always overruled by his wife who clearly wears the pants in the relationship. The other son not liking his brothers wife (his sister-in-law) because she has his brother whipped. The old mother not liking either sons wives and the wives not liking her (the mother-in-law) either. Caught in the middle are the kids who watch with glee as their parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents swear and curse at each other.All the characters are very clichéd no doubt, all the usual family stereotypes are drained of every last drop of predictable comedy completely. But it works brilliantly, watching the grown ups verbally abuse each other whilst trying to hold it together for the kids and for Christmas is hilarious. Tiptoeing around delicate issues and then bringing them up deliberately to cause an outburst, it makes you laugh it makes you cringe. Then to add to that you have Leary going nuts trying to keep everything civil whilst trying not to break his cover and trying not get caught by the old bill. The fact Leary acts as the marriage counselor for Spacey and Davis really cranks up the laughs when he verbally jousts against the mother and sister-in-law.This is one of those perfect anti-Christmas flicks that's perfect for Christmas. All the performances are really very good bringing the film to life and making the story so compelling. Its a completely character driven plot with no fancy set pieces or effects or crazy stunts, its all about the dialog.

Luckily for them, the Wolf Man Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) shows up to help stop Dracula.This one has just about everything you could want if you are a fan of Abbott and Costello or the classic Universal horror films. About the only thing missing is Boris Karloff. The comedy is great and fresh for the time with no reliance on old vaudeville routines. The story is fun and continues with the monster mash formula Universal used in the House of... films, which were the last time we saw these characters. It's just a tremendously entertaining movie that you have to be a big fuddy-duddy not to enjoy. Hilarious comedy and a last hurrah for the timeless Universal monsters. Fun from start to finish.

However, in saying this, there is also one place where this story is indeed recognisable in many shapes and forms. Though it may not possess the same marketing value as that of Verona's famous pair of star crossed lovers, The Taming of the Shrew has always had an unusual popularity in the world of film. So much that it was this story to be the first put to the screen with sound and dialogue by Sam Taylor in 1929, which made it the first Shakespearian play adapted to film with the actual use of the language. Yet while Taylor's attempts are certainly admirable, there is simply no competing with a Franco Zefferelli production of Shakespeare. In true Zefferelli fashion, his 1967 adaptation is visually spectacular, and from the very first few minutes in, you are immediately captivated by the buoyant spirit and energy present within the streets of our fair Padua. Though Zefferelli is not completely faithful to the original script, it is barely noticeable and easily forgiven as he still remains so wonderfully loyal to the story in many other important ways. For example, through the use of exuberant music and bright costume, Zefferelli manages to intensify the vibrancy of the comical atmosphere as well as the contrasting character personalities. However, the most intensifying aspect to the film in itself is most definitely the acting. There is a clumsy and awkward unpredictability in the energy of the crowds that gather throughout the film. But this is also present in the behaviour of central characters, and there seems to be conflict almost everywhere. Even the little children who carry the train of Kate's wedding dress are fighting. Though this does give it a sort of pantomime feel at times, I believe Zefferelli's intention was to keep the arguments amusing rather than actually violent. Therefore, he chooses to tackle the destructive nature of the play in a way that is true to the story but still entertaining for the audience. A story so renowned for its daring and rambunctious nature, The Taming of the Shrew is truly unique to its time and setting. With a love\/hate relationship present between our two central characters (who often seem more prone to violence than anything else) Shakespeare does extremely well in challenging the typical preconceptions of love and marriage between man and woman of the time. Therefore, in order to successfully give us the right balance of this vicious yet amusing relationship on screen, the director's most important task lies in finding the actors who are capable. This is something of which I believe Zefferelli succeeds in more than anyone. With his risky and bold decision in casting a couple almost as notoriously wild as their characters, Zefferelli like others before him, deemed only a real life marriage worthy enough to possess the experience and knowledge needed in order to truly do the relationship justice. The difference was that this couple excelled. The legendary Richard Burton with his long career of Shakespearean drama was the perfect fit as our tamer Petruchio. Although his then wife Elizabeth Taylor was not the most ideal choice as Kate, (with no previous experience of Shakespeare,) it was not her reputation as an actress that landed her the role of the shrew, but her reputation as a tenacious wife. I must admit, as a massive fan of Taylor, I found myself trying extremely hard not to be bias in judging her performance as Kate. Although it wasn't exactly an Oscar winning performance, especially in comparison to Burton as Petruchio, I found Taylor's efforts as Kate truly commendable. Especially after having to bare the close to mute version of her played by Mary Pickford in 1929, I found myself almost grateful for the over dramatic moments given by Taylor. There's no denying that overall Burton was the ultimate star, but I believe that without Taylor as his fiery Kate, the film could have never reached its full potential. This was primarily the reason why Zefferelli took the risk of casting an amateur like Taylor in the first place. He knew that without an independent woman who was just as capable of handling Burton, as Kate is in handling Petruchio, the film would fall flat. And so he bases his decision on the chemistry of the actors rather than the ability to act, as they are truly believable on screen and everything is very natural between them. For example when you see a furious Kate giving Petruchio that signature scowl from across the room, you cannot help but feel like they have exchanged this look a thousand times before. Overall, I found Zefferelli's 1967 adaptation of the Taming of the Shrew truly enjoyable. While the imaginative costume, music and architecture is signature to a Zefferelli creation, it was the rustling and energetic atmosphere of Padua so exceptionally represented that had me immediately enthusiastic from the very beginning. I also found myself extremely grateful for the length of the film, as the 1929 version disappointingly, just ran over an hour long. Though he will always be criticized by some for his decision to not stick to the original script, I believe that Zefferelli was faithful to Shakespeare in all of the important ways. His efforts in paying enough attention to the main characters were his greatest success. As he had learnt from Sam Taylor's mistakes before him in 1929, how that passion and chemistry could very well easily be the determining factor to the films ultimate rise or fall.

However I DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone looking for an action intensive flick or a Full Metal Jacket-esque film. There is plenty of action in the film but it's main focus is the progression of Ben Willard (Sheen) in his reaching Kurtz (Brando).
