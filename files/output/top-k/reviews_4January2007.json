How time flies.I thought the first half-hour was actually pretty good - not luminous, but fine. The hostile takeover of the Daily Planet is interesting, and I enjoyed Superman's moral dilemma about the nuclear missile situation (some reviews suggest that Superman is all gung-ho about disarming the world; in fact, he's initially quite reluctant to do so).But after that decent first half hour, the movie pretty much falls apart. The Daily Planet storyline is resolved abruptly and unconvincingly - I simply can't accept that Muriel Hemingway's character undergoes a total conversion from yellow journalist to an editor with integrity. What exactly inspires this change of heart, besides the fact that she's hot for stumbling, stupid Clark Kent? The nuclear missile plot is also glossed over. I'm not exactly sure why Superman decides to abandon his disarmament mission; just because Lex Luthor's given him some trouble, suddenly he's not in favor of world peace? The movie simply doesn't explore his decision-making processes thoroughly enough.Another strangely underdeveloped plot line is the sale of the Kent farm. In an early scene, we find out that a big developer is interested in buying the farm, but Clark would prefer to sell it to a small-time farmer. This is actually a pretty nice segment, pleasingly reminiscent of the first film, but it comes to absolutely nothing, as the sale of the farm is never mentioned again. Huh? Some of these plotting problems doubtless arise from the fact that about 40 minutes were chopped out of the film before its release. However, I've heard that a lot of the missing footage is devoted to action, so it probably plugs relatively few of the aforementioned plot gaps. Anyway, what really matters is that the theatrical release is semi-incomprehensible.The special effects are another big minus for the film. For example, the same terrible green screen shot of Superman flying toward the audience is reused about eight times, and it's so bad that you didn't even want to see it once. I know this film had a limited $17 million budget, but for goodness' sake, I've seen better special effects done on much smaller TV budgets.And yet...and yet...I can't bring myself to hate this movie. At a mere 90 minutes, it's much pacier (and more sincere) than the plodding, dreadful Superman III. Also, it's nice to see Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman back in substantial roles after they were basically ignored in the previous film. Hackman's performance as Lex Luthor is always pretty funny, even if he's playing it on auto-pilot; I particularly enjoy the moment when he lights his cigar using Nuclear Man's radioactive aura.I don't even object to the presence of Mariel Hemingway, who is strangely sexy in this movie - though somehow I feel obliged to point out that an actress with a one-scene cameo as a teacher is actually the prettiest woman in the whole thing.Even the much-maligned special effects have a certain campy charm. And, you know, Nuclear Man is cool in certain dumb ways; he gives Superman a tough fight, which makes him at least somewhat interesting. He looks ridiculous, of course, but I don't really sweat his mullet as much as everyone else does. (When are we going to get over this whole childish mullet obsession, anyway?) Despite this praise, I should note that, toward the ending of the movie, Nuclear Man flies into space carrying Hemingway...and she survives, despite the fact that she's not wearing a space suit. That complete lack of realism, attention to detail, whatever you want to call it - I guess that's typical of the whole movie. But I still get a laugh out of it.

plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to Rocky IV.I will say right from the off, this movie is the greatest cinematic going experience of my life. Nothing even comes close. The double header of 'Rocky 3' and 'First Blood' gave Stallone the best year of his career in 1982. After flopping big time in 1984 with Rhinestone, as the new muscle man on the block Arnold Schwarzenegger scored big with The Terminator. Stallone hoped lightning would strike twice in 1985 with the pairing of the patriotic 'Rambo First Blood Part 2' and even more patriotic 'Rocky IV' The whole plot of Rocky IV could be put on the back of a postage stamp, so my usual plot in a paragraph part will be tricky, but here we go.Plot In A Paragraph Apollo dies in a boxing match with a Russian. Rocky seeks revenge. Nothing else happens.This is the least 'Rocky' of all the Rocky movies. Stallone is nothing like the Rocky character of the previous movies. It's basically Just Stallone being Stallone. This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. No 'Gonna Fly Now' no Museum steps, in fact no Philadelphia at all. This is also the only Rocky film that doesn't begin with the word ROCKY scrolling across the screen in some shape or form. But more damagingly it lacks any real heart. But despite the fact that the film is wafer thin, unrealistic and pretty silly, I still can't help but love Rocky IV. Stallone really took to the MTV style of editing in 'Rocky 3' and does it again here, with the training montages, Survivor\/James Brown\/Robert Tepper tunes, etc. very well. I personally enjoyed the contrasts-see Stallone chop wood. See Drago pump iron. See Stallone run across a snowy field. See Drago run on an Olympic treadmill. See Stallone do crunches while half-suspended from a loft. See Drago bend every conceivable advanced weight machine outta shape as he flexes and trains. See Stallone eat his spinach. See Drago take his Steroids....Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rambo and Rocky movies back to back, and it shows. I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here. One of the silliest things about Rocky IV is the fact that it's basically just one big music video &#x96; it should have been renamed Rocky The Musical.Whenever a bit of character development is called for another music video kicks in.Apollo's is whipping up patriotism 'living in America' Oh, Apollo's dead? We'll have a music video of Rocky moodily driving his car ('There's no easy way out'). Oh, Rocky's got to go to Russia? We'll have shots of Russian soldiers and we'll play some pop song about two worlds colliding Two worlds collide, rival nations.But ignore that and watch it again and try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the summer of 85. I remember I was 8 and my sister took me to see it.I remember the place was packed and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place. When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells  he's cut, he's cut!  the crowd went into a frenzy. And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular. It doesn't matter if you are American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us. That is the beauty of Rocky. If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.

Rocky seeks revenge. Nothing else happens.This is the least 'Rocky' of all the Rocky movies. Stallone is nothing like the Rocky character of the previous movies. It's basically Just Stallone being Stallone. This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. No 'Gonna Fly Now' no Museum steps, in fact no Philadelphia at all. This is also the only Rocky film that doesn't begin with the word ROCKY scrolling across the screen in some shape or form. But more damagingly it lacks any real heart. But despite the fact that the film is wafer thin, unrealistic and pretty silly, I still can't help but love Rocky IV. Stallone really took to the MTV style of editing in 'Rocky 3' and does it again here, with the training montages, Survivor\/James Brown\/Robert Tepper tunes, etc. very well. I personally enjoyed the contrasts-see Stallone chop wood. See Drago pump iron. See Stallone run across a snowy field. See Drago run on an Olympic treadmill. See Stallone do crunches while half-suspended from a loft. See Drago bend every conceivable advanced weight machine outta shape as he flexes and trains. See Stallone eat his spinach. See Drago take his Steroids....Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rambo and Rocky movies back to back, and it shows. I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here. One of the silliest things about Rocky IV is the fact that it's basically just one big music video &#x96; it should have been renamed Rocky The Musical.Whenever a bit of character development is called for another music video kicks in.Apollo's is whipping up patriotism 'living in America' Oh, Apollo's dead?

So Hill pumped out this little quickie of an exploitation flick that was meant to be a sequel to Coffy, but then got lopped off due to continuity, among other things, even though a lot of the plot points back to many things in the original Hill\/Grier collaboration (i.e. boyfriend getting knocked off, Grier playing the perpetual bad-ass, surrounded by corruption she must rid, etc). So in that sort of manufactured way, I liked it, and it actually gets into some really tough and gritty material when Foxy gets into trouble, deep trouble, when taken as a sort of slave-prisoner (following this is a really excellent scene of swift revenge, maybe the most exciting scene in the whole movie). There's some good character actor work by Antonio Fargas as the sort of flunkie Link, brother of Foxy's, and by the very cold Katherine, played by Kathryn Loder (and, true to the 'black-exploitation' fold all of the villains are white). It's a shame though that there isn't more of a really knockout spirit to the whole production, even when Grier is at her best (which is pretty constant as her character has the charm and the sass and the real conviction to be a real star in these vehicles) there seems to be not as much of a punch as with Coffy. The big action climax is a bit of a letdown too with the airplane chase. But I'd say there are worse things to see from the period, and Foxy Brown is definitely not one of them.

To make it short &#150; I don't have a clue why ever they did cut this one down, it's not overly gory and there is not one single shot where Leatherface slices through someone with the saw and you actually see it&#133;hmm. The Story I won't give too much away, but hey, it's another TCM, so what do you expect? Nothing new or innovative here, either. The Characters Like many other folk around here have already said - the main characters are not very likely, in fact, I found them quite boring and while the boy was some kinda nerd pain in the ass type of guy, the girl just had no personality to speak of. Only time she was okay was at the end of the movie, when she already had gone over the edge. He has not much to say anyway, and goes down after the first half the movie, never to utter another single phrase (not that he had much to say before that). Only glimpse of light on the side of the heroes\/victims\/nice folk is Ken Foree as Benny, who is not superior, but with the other two so dull, he stand out alone. Character depth is missing here, too - but he has some nice one-liners. Some basic problem with the guys on the good side &#150; there are way too few to make a nice chopping-festival. Four people to go down in a TCM? This could have been overlooked when the rest of the movie would have had more suspense, but alas, it had not. Now the family. Okay, they are not the original ones, and you don't get any explanation where they have come from, why they are here, or why Leatherface is hanging around with them. But, again it's a second grade Horror-Flik, so this did not overly pain me. In addition, they outrank their victims in style and anything else. What I thought rather funny was the fact that they were of course all raving lunatics, but acted as a nice and caring family amongst each other. Last, Leatherface himself. I never liked the original styling from TCM 1&2, with that mob-hair and being a fatty and doing this ridiculous Chainsaw-Wiggle. But then again, this Leatherface also lacks something in terror, style and menace. In my opinion, the new Leatherface from the remake is by far the best looking. Leatherface's first appearance in the movie should have been a shocking, crushing something with Leatherface doing his stunning entry, but he just comes waggling out of the dark, somewhat unmotivated swinging his saw. A rather small one, by the way. He later get's the saw from the poster The Saw is Family and everything, but this nice tool is not only way to polished, chrome-style - but also only used once after it's introduction. Again, Leatherface is a moron, and does some slightly clumsy acts, which could have been relaxing and funny, if not the whole movie was kinda clumsy. Though, I liked the scene where Leatherface is pictured doing his lessons with a little computer, trying to spell Fool right. The theatrical ending of the movie sucks, too, and the cuts they had to do to make it work are too obvious (even the director did not like this ending, so 'nuff said). But on the other hand, the original ending isn't that good or shocking either. Over all, a nice, middle class Horror-Flick, which could have been much better. Some shots and sceneries are nice, but the whole thing just shambles along, neither going into Splatter nor into Not-Splatter-But-Suspense and leaves for a TCM fan like me a rather stale taste, sadly &#150; I wished it would have been better.

In the near future, the polar ice caps have melted and the oceans waters have risen to flood all costal cities. One company owner, Professor Hobby, has designed a human like boy based on the image of his dead son. His name is David. David is different from most robots because he is programmed to feel love. Monica, his mother, is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who is in cryo-stasis because there is no cure for a disease that he has contracted. David lives happily till his brother is cured and sent home. David accidentally endangers his brothers life and is taken back to the lab were he came from for destruction. During the trip, this Monica has a change of heart. Instead of destroying her son she will abandon him in the forest. This movie is the tale of Davis quest of becoming a real boy to gain his mothers love.This movie was marvelous, interesting and suspenseful through out. I typically hate all child actors but the acting by Haley Joel Osment was great for the robot part. Frances O'Connor played a perfect role as a caring mother and Jude Law was a fantastic male prostitute. The camera work and special effects were very well accomplished. In the intense scene when David and Gigolo Joe are running from the Flesh Fair blimp I was given chills at the first sight of the rising moon like blimp. This was quickly followed by an intense chase threw the forest. The other robots in captivity have great effects on them as well. One has a head that can be seen threw and another is a old hunched back.At the Flesh Fair, David is put on display to be executed. Before acid can be poured on him he pleads for his life and people are put in an uproar because the Flesh Fair is killing a boy. He is soon set free. This part of the movie demonstrates the difference between Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. If Stanley Kubrick was directing this movie David would have fought a bloody battle out of the friar. Instead he is able to walk right out due to human compaction. While in captivity at the Flesh Fair, David becomes friends with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute, framed for a murder and they go on a journey trying to find the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio so she can turn David into a real boy. When David arrives at the house of the Blue Fairy he is shocked to see another David robot already there. This is the point when David realizes he is not an individual but actually a machine. David is outraged and bashes the other David's head in with a lamp. This is the first violent emotional outburst of David. After he talks to Professor Hobby, the man who created David, David learns he is an individual after all. David was the first robot to ever follow his dreams. Sadly, this does not boost David's spirits. As he sits on the top of the building where he thought The Blue Fairy would be and he utters one word,Mommy. Then throws him self over the edge into water where he sinks down to see an amusement park that has a Pinocchio exhibit. This again is a point were Steven Spielberg has obviously changed. Had Stanley Kubrick Directed this, David would have surely killed himself from the fall off the building. After David sees the Blue Fairy at the Pinocchio exhibit he takes the helicopter under water where he asks the statue, which resembles his mother, to make him a real boy.David stays at the bottom of the ocean with the Blue Fairy for two thousand years until he is unfrozen by aliens looking for the meaning of life through humans. Some people found this odd, but I thought it was a creative twist to the movie. Eventually the aliens are able to bring back David's mother for one day because Teddy, David's teddy bear, had a lock of her hair. This ends up being the best day of David's life and he falls asleep forever. David eventually gets his wish and lays happily with his mother till the end of time. Spielberg's last happy scene of the movie that I'm sure Kubrick would not be happy about.This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.

A bland title, a very atypically bland Johnny Depp, and a story that is too obvious and annoying. A certain Ravich wrote\/directed this unimpressive little mediocrity, and I'd be surprised if this guy is going to be making any more movies of a similar type of budget any time in the next couple of decades. What we have here is predictable situations, sudden appearances, a mysterious loss of electricity (which turns out to be nothing to do with aliens - duh!), Theron behaving like an idiot and a coward, and just generally things happening in the last moment that prevent Theron and the suffering viewer from finally finding out the bleedin' obvious namely, that Depp is an alien. What is apparent to even the most brain-dead viewer, very early on, is guarded as a top-secret surprise by a director who thinks that he is the only one who saw\/read dozens of similar movies\/novels\/comics about aliens taking over human bodies. One of the more ludicrous scenes is when Theron refuses to listen to the black ex-NASA guy; I mean, there she was wondering all the time what the hell is wrong with Depp, and when finally someone approaches her with potential answers to the Depp riddle that preoccupy her so, she decides not to listen to him. Duh. She is constantly crying, worrying, sweating with anxiety, but never really does anything intelligent to fight the alien beast. She is therefore annoying. And it's oh-so convenient of Ravich to make Theron have a mental-patient past, so that - very conveniently - no one will believe her when she expresses any kind of misgivings about Depp and his intentions. It's like the kid or the drunk whom no one believes when they see an alien UFO. What a brilliant plot device! It's straight out of the Idiot's Guide To Making Lousy Movies With Awfully Annoying Dumb Cliché Plot Points. Depp is neither menacing nor interesting; he is simply bland, and this is his worst role yet. Plus, I don't see why he has to talk like he just left a Tennessee farmhouse for the first time since his Maw and Paw brought him to this world. Apart from the obvious annoying things that I mentioned, the film somehow manages to be continuously irritating, and I can't quite put my finger on what it is that makes this film almost icky; perhaps it's Depp, or perhaps it's just bad direction - something intagible. The ending is one big nothing; she kills Depp, and the alien enters her. How brilliant! And then we are shown Theron some years later - finally with some hair on her head - with the evil alien twins going to school, while listening to alien sounds on their walk-mans. Big deal. Casting Charlize The(mo)ron, who once infamously said how much she enjoyed Budapest when in Turkey, is ideal for this dumb movie.If this movie could talk, it would say that Budapest was in Turkey.
