But, I know a good teen comedy when I see one and this isn't one of them. Hollywood knows how to make a great teen comedy. The 80's brought us such classics as Sixteen Candles, Fast Times, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, etc. The 90's has produced a few classics as well, including Empire Records, Clueless and American Pie. Can't Hardly Wait was painful to sit through. It has a truly capable cast, including such emerging stars as Jennifer Love Hewitt, Seth Green and Ethan Embry. But the movie falters because of a tired storyline, vapid dialogue and poor characterizations. The plot is simple - its the last day of highschool graduation and everyone is excited to attend a house party. The jock has dumped his girlfriend (Hewitt) so that he is free to date college girls that will be flocking all over him; the nerd is plotting to publicly embarass the jock for all of the humiliation inflicted on him during the year; the all around cool guy (Embry) wants to finally ask out his dream girl, who happens to be the same girl dumped by the jock. Nothing turns out as planned -- the jock finds out he'll be a nobody in college and wants Hewitt back; the nerd gets drunk and becomes the life of the party; Hewitt mistakenly reads a love letter from Embry, but doesn't know who he is. Seth Green is convincing as an annoying rap star wannabe who's smitten by the class pessimist after being locked in a bathroom together.The dialogue is so ridiculous and the jokes so flat that I kept fast forwarding through.

Nicolas Cage plays Ben, a movie executive who for some reason has lost his family and turns to drink, or, at least that's what he thinks. Early in the film he reveals that he's been drinking so excessively for so long that he can't remember if he drank so much that he lost his family or he lost his family so he started drinking. At the advanced stage of despair Ben is in, it doesn't matter. He is suffering so much he has decided to go to Las Vegas and drink himself to death. He crosses paths with a hooker named Sera, Elisabeth Shue, who instantly feels a bond with him. Why, she can't explain to herself, even though she realizes it IS real. It's important that he simply crosses paths with a hooker, because his mind is solely on drinking. It isn't until he literally runs into her that the thought crosses his mind that mindless sex could be an enjoyable idea. But Sera feels such a spark with Ben that she realizes he's not just another 'john' but a decent guy who must be in terrible pain. She identifies with him so much because she shares the same type of despair Ben does, and realizes the opportunity to save her own soul by trying to save his, as his angel, as he constantly refers to her. Trouble is though, that even after he finds his angel, he keeps drinking. In one of the most revealing scenes, the two of them are poolside at a cheap motel and Ben is, naturally, oblivious to her presence because of his soaked mindset. She really wants him to ravish her, so she takes his bottle of booze and pours it over her breasts until, finally, he does. This scene may sound tawdry or corny, but because the two actors have successfully shown up to this point just how much of a bond their characters have, the fact that booze is used as an aphrodisiac here is a major triumph for both of them. They have reached each other halfway.It's been a long time since I've seen two actors portray what real love and understanding looks like on screen. There is something so tangible in this film it almost feels voyeuristic. These characters love each other in such a way that since the hooker's job is, obviously, to have sex with other men, the element of cheating is moot for her, but when she comes home one night to find that HE has been cheating, suddenly your mind freezes up and you don't know what to think until you remember that outside of quickie oral sex you notice that they've never made love even though they are so obviously and operatically IN love. Wow.In Leaving Las Vegas two of the most down and out characters forge the unlikeliest of bonds and for a fleeting moment experience true love in spite of the money changing hands, money which magically becomes superfluous as their guards are let down to reveal an empathetic passion so real it keeps ascending and swelling, going for a gigantic crescendo. You'll notice that at the beginning of this film you hear blues which slides easily into jazz, and by the end of the film it has transformed into opera. So the range of emotions director Mike Figgis is dealing with on his palette go from despair to sentimentality to operatic overdrive. Opera goes for big emotions and follows them straight through the end. So does this film. It doesn't compromise. It must have been hard to get a film like this made without somebody trying to soften the story or, God forbid, add a different ending. You can imagine some Hollywood producer saying that at the end they should traipse off arm in arm to the Betty Ford Clinic so everything will be all right. But because the budget of the film was what it was, not too many people had the right to dabble with the script.This script is so good, based on the novel by John O'Brien (who committed suicide just before production on the film began) that at various times on the soundtrack when it fades out for effect you don't need to hear the words that are being said to know what's going on. I would say the only real flaw this film has is that Sera's pimp gets squeezed out of the picture in a pretty clunky way, and when he does you realize that outside of the obligatory battering about he gives her, the two characters have nothing in common. In fact even though Sera is, underneath it all, a vulnerable character, the amount of strength she has would really warrant her being a call girl rather than a hooker. But I'm nit-picking. For all you aspiring filmmakers out there, take a look at this film as a demonstration of how you can make a masterpiece with not much more than two incredible actors. Shot in Super 16mm (one quarter the cost of a 35mm film), the graininess of the image is able to evoke the bittersweet seediness of the situation and the locale, so when you do see the love that these characters share it is that much more tangible and real.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"22 March 2000","score":"","review":"  This is a wonderful, funny, romantic teen comedy that may not be as laugh-out-loud uproarious as AMERICAN PIE, but whose drifts into seriousness and sentimentality are far more plausible and acceptable.The film is at least the second modernisation of Shakespeare's The Taming Of The Shrew, but is much less objectionable than the Bard to its title character.  Surely it will soon become a commonplace that Shakespearean makeovers are more successful than actual dramatisations.  The advantages for the scriptwriter are legion - characters with a ready-made set of characteristics; forward moving plots etc.  But the exercise never feels contrived here - characters may be named Stratford or Verona; one goth-hippy worships Will; the wired Bruno Kirby-a-like may spout the odd Bardic tag - but the rich inevitabliity of the plot allows for many themes to be touched on.An adherence to this plot allows for some narrative surprise - for instance, Shakespeare, unlike most mainstream films, rarely begins his plays with his heroes, so it's a surprise when nearly ten minutes are spent introducing a character in the conventional Hollywood manner (past history; explanatory friend; introduction to him of other characters etc.), that it comes as a pleasant surprise to discover that he's only a subsidiary character after all.This non-claustrophobic opening out applies to the film as a whole - although the relationship between Catherine and Patrick is clearly central, there is an even-handed treatment of secondary characters, not just plot enablers, but with problems and plot crises of their own, that makes the film seem so rich and alive.Shakespeare's big theme is the mask, the roles we are forced to play in life, how we are fixed by how others see us, how this can lead to emptiness and perversion in our own nature.  10 THINGS is a brilliant essay on this, the adolescent battleground of reputation being the perfect place to test it.  The theme is stated right from the start with Cameron, whose army-background means that he is starting at a new school for the ninth time.  This accumulation of continually inchoate selves, the sense of the itinerary and the unfinished, plants seeds of ambiguity and doubt into a mechanically constructed plot of elegant closure, undermining the outcome not only of Cameron's subplot, but Catherine and Patrick's too (although not the pleasure we derive from such outcomes).The main issue of reputation centres on Catherine and Patrick.  The former is a very hostile, intelligent young woman, exasperated with her jock contemporaries and the fetishisation of shallow values.  It may seem misogynistic to suggest that these very valid objections are just a smokescreen for the usual fear of sex, but it's not neccessarily sex per se Catherine rejects, but the egotistical male-gratifying power games that seek to put her in a very inferior place.This is a marked improvement even on Shakespeare, and the resolution of her plot is not a climb down, but actually enabling, couched in terms of possible creativity and independence, as Patrick gives her a guitar to form a band, something she earlier said would annoy her dad.  This is a uniquely open ending - she has already ruptured family ties by accepting a college place on the East Coast - what if she actually does form a band?  If she doesn't, will Patrick follow her to Saint Laurence?  Will she outgrow him?Remarkable in a Hollywood movie, the male lead exists mainly to  reflect and extract elements of the female lead's character, to push her plot.  And yet it is his plot that distills the conflict between what you are taken for, and what you do.  We aren't told until near the film's end over the 'truth' of Patrick's life (after all, we only have his word); up until then, we are forced to hold in tension the seeming connection between his actions (going out with a girl to make money) and his negative reputation, and its opposition to his likeable personality and evident desire.  This ambiguity casts further doubt on the ending.The rest of the cast brilliantly mirror this theme, from the staid careers officer who writes erotica, to the hipster teacher who loves Shakespeare. The film's very existence is called into ethical question by the discussions on the exclusionary literary canon.Because it parallels a second interesting tension in the film, one of class. As in AMERICAN PIE, every character is fantastically rich, with huge houses and their own cars, all except Patrick, whose reputation is rooted in a criminal underclass.  There is a tacit contrast between haves and haves not, conspicuous consumption and the disturbingly unknown that is quite surprising in such a good-natured comedy.And it is scrupulously good-natured and fair.  All the secondary characters are given depths and insecurities, even the silliest (Joey), while the blossoming of Bianca from a trivial beauty into a very complex, self-aware young woman is one of the film's great achievements.  The fairy-tale school setting adds to the 'unreal' flavour of the plot, as do the snatches of Surrealism (playing golf into an American football sportsground; the scene with the marvellous Stratford dad doing his exercises).The humour is remarkably clever and verbal, easily co-existing with the expected slapstick fun.  The Shakespearean use of ritual spaces (eg Prom Nights) for the playing out of social anxieties is compelling, as is the wonderfully uncontrived gender reversal in the expected fight.

Indeed, a lot of the big Asian names are bringing their skills to America, from directors like John Woo to stars like Jackie Chan.  This marriage of all-out Hong Kong action wildness and Hollywood-size budgets and special effects can lead to greatness when done properly, anybody who's seen THE MATRIX knows that.  But unfortunately, many films are less successful. The problem with a movie like ROMEO MUST DIE is that the people behind it don't seem to understand what they've got.  They cast Jet Li, arguably the most electrifying martial arts expert in the world, but only to bury him in an alternately tedious and epileptic B-movie.There are two major problems with the picture.  First, way too much time is spent exposing the boring, conventionnal plot, with all its predictable twists and double-crossings.  Director Andrzej Bartkowiak does try to spend time with the characters, but he fails to make it much interesting and it just makes for plenty of slow, fat dialogue scenes.  Delroy Lindo is pretty good as the Black boss, but the rest of the cast isn't great ;  Aaliyah should stick to singing, she doesn't have much screen presence.  As for Jet Li, he's cool and charming, but he's not given much to do outside the action scenes which, surprisingly, are the movie's other problem.Bartkowiak suffers from the Michael Bay syndrom, apparently, and he feels the need to craft the action scenes like music videos,with blink and you missed a shot editing and whooping hip hop over the soundtrack.  That's plain stupid  Jet Li is already so exciting with his gravity-defying spins and kicks that you just have to set up continuous shots and let the man do his thing.  Constantly cutting back and forth is just distractive and frustrating.  We still get to see Jet Li kick some ass in style, but if you've seen some of his 'real' movies, this is a letdown.  It's like comparing the fights in Jackie Chan's DRUNKEN MASTER 2 to those in RUSH HOUR.  Some people seemed impressed by the use of X-ray shots, but that trick is lifted right out of the Sonny Chiba 70s classic THE STREETFIGHTER, so it's old news to connoisseurs.  Overall, ROMEO MUST DIE is modestly entertaining ( a Jet Li flick can't be all bad ), but it remains so-so at best.  Wait for the video.

However yesterday I went to watch an excellent film called The Green Mile. I won't say too much about it but read on.......The acting in this movie was really realistic and very down to earth. What could of turn out to be another 'Shawshank Redemption' actually was one of the best prison type movies I have ever seen!The basic story sounds like it going to be a violent prison film about a man who has raped then killed two small girls (aged 8). However the movie had a lot more than just that! The key elements that makes this movie so great are 1) You really start caring for some of the characters that are on death row awaiting to die on the electric chair. Has anyone ever done missionary work within a prison. Then you will know what I mean? 2) The christian element in this movie added a dimension so lacking in the Shawshank Redemption. It's amazing how many people meet spiritual awareness in this environment in reality in America! 3) It shows that even when God gives you a spiritual gift it is how you use it to help others that really counts. 4) The movie shows that a spiritual gift can be a burden more than a status symbol. 5) The movie is also about ageism and what people think about when they reach to a good old age. In this respect it was similar to The Straight Story which I highly reccommend as well.The little bits of sexual scenes were good as well! Personally, I think that with most modern movies they treat sex in the wrong context, have this just added to the picture's quality. However I was very pleased with these scenes because it was in context of HOW God wants sex to be like i.e. within marriage!I also loved Duncan Clarke and he should win best supporting role in the oscars!This prison movie was really thought-provoking and went beyond the stereotypical lines of preaching to people and really made me and my friend think about our own lives.There is a very nasty scene during the movie (perhaps the most horrible I have ever seen), but this just added to the drama and the knowledge that killing people is often wrong as two wrongs do not make a right; and often enough it is people in power that are the evil ones who pick on the poor and lonely.In conclusion, YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW.

I'm a big movie fan, but this was the only movie I saw more than once in the theaters last year.For those of you that haven't seen it yet or will again, I want to concentrate on the quality of the amazing amount of work that went into the animation in this film, the amount of personality put into characters.The characters that were established in the first movie are drawn a little finer here, showing the better angels of their nature Woody's loyalty and sense of responsibility to his fellow toys, Buzz's loyalty to Woody and his support of the other toys.  The personality animation they gave Andy's puppy when it bursts into his room and starts playing with Woody was incredible, being both puppyish and human, as if the dog shared the away from humans life the toys possess.When I saw the first movie, I was amazed that I kept forgetting that I was watching an animated feature, and so it was in this case. The character of Al, the guy that steals Woody from the cash box during the yard sale, is a caricature of a short fat man but is so lifelike in movement and skin texture, it just adds to the suspension of disbelief that draws you into the movie. Once the movie gets to the place where Woody finally meets the other members of The Roundup Gang (and my favourite character, Jessie, voiced perfectly by Joan Cusack, is introduced), the real magic becomes apparent if you watch the characters that aren't speaking in some scenes. For instance, when Woody accuses Jessie of wrongdoing and the two of them have a fight (and Jessie kicks Woody's butt, too... Poor Woody can't seem to fight very well) Stinky Pete the Prospector breaks it up and scolds them. When you see this scene, watch Woody and Jessie. Their facial expressions, Jessie's especially, tell you volumes about them.The scene where Jessie tells her story of abandonment to the tune of When She Loved Me is one of the most touching scenes I've seen on film in a long time. The character is so likeable that to see her owner outgrow her and relegate her to a Salvation Army truck is heartbreaking. The shot of her peering in dismay through a hole in the box she's left in as the camera pulls away from the spot (ironically just down a dirt road from the place she and her owner had once played) left the entire theatre silent, except for a few sniffles.The key to a movie, ANY movie, is for the audience to identify and feel empathy with the characters, to draw you in to share their hurts and triumphs.

Toy Story 2 succeeds in spades as the toys make you laugh, cry and cheer in equal measure.

OK, so it was pretty profane. However, this movie was very underrated, and was a great film! I'll mention some points. POSSIBLE SPOILER!!!  Martin Scorcesse has many gifts, but one of them is knowing how to put the perfect music in a scene. The songs in the movie were perfect in every scene. Especially House of the Rising Sun at the end, when everyone got whacked. Another point was great acting. Deniro should have been at least nominated for an Oscar, and Sharon Stone did a very good job. The best acted scene in the movie was when RD went to that restaurant, and met SS after she tied up their kid. Deniro was SO good in that scene. It's brief, but great!!  ANOTHER POSSIBLE SPOILER!!! Also, the violence was brutal, especially at the end. Where you see about 5 people get shot in the head. Nasty. Also... BIG SPOILER!!!  is when Pesci and his brother were beaten to death with the bats. Very bloody, and gross. However, I REALLY love this movie, and I would recommend it to everyone!!!

The best movie of the eighties and perhaps, the most entertaining movie ever made. What makes this movie is the incredibly funny script, an ingenious story and excellent performances by the entire cast. Without doubt, a classic, that will always be remembered and looked back on, even in a hundred years time. This is Robert Zemeckis' best movie, with huge thanks to Spielberg as well. By far the best of the trilogy, although II and III are both great (100 % for I, 85 % for II, and 90 % for III).
