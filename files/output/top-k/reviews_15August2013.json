It's actually closer to 2199 and humans are being controlled by machines, they have them stuck inside a program that simulates real life called The Matrix while they feed on them for energy. It's up to a group of people fighting the system and a new recruit, Neo (Keanu Reeves), to free the people from enslavement.Director Darren Aronofsky thought that The Matrix redefined Sci-Fi movies, and I agree, what it did has yet to be matched by modern science fiction films that tend to lean towards visuals and give no importance towards action and fight choreography like what we can see here. The use of slow motion is perfect, it's used to highlight the action and give the viewer the feeling that he's right in the middle of it, unlike modern action movies with all the shaky cams.The underlying themes it deals with are what makes it far superior than any other action or science fiction movies and leaves the audience with something to talk about. It deals with some of the same things Stanley Kubrick dealt with in 2001 A Space Odyssey in the 60's, they're themes that are even more interesting now that we live in a society that depends on technology and for that it's a movie that's way far ahead of its time.I'm not even going to mention the sequels, I see The Matrix as a stand-alone feature so I'm just going to ignore they even exist. As Quentin Tarantino said, the sequels ruined the mythology to it, I couldn't agree more, but I think that when you forget the sequels even happened it's a masterpiece.It's hard to see how Hugo Weaving didn't get more recognition for his performance as Agent Smith, he plays one of the most terrifying villains of all time, his screen presence is always felt and the way he delivers his lines (specially when he says Mr. Anderson) is something that would fit perfectly in a horror film.If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it to anyone it to anyone, specially whoever liked Wall-E, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, Inception, Equilibrium, Dark City, The Wolverine, Twelve Monkeys, Minority Report, Sin City, and Looper.

Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz.Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule.To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him.

Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the lives of those connected to them.One subplot involves Kline's love\/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are experiencing the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work. There's an early scene where the potential other woman (Mary-Louise Parker) comes into his office at work and puts her hand on his. It's a simple yet potent scene. Is it wrong for Kline to have feelings for this woman? Should he risk destroying his marriage by pursuing a more intimate relationship? And, if he does commit adultery, can he still change his mind before it's too late? Will he?That's just one subplot amongst many. Some reviewers feel there are TOO many stories going on. I suggest they stick to lighter fare, like maybe RV (giggle).Anyway, some themes explored include- Miraculous life-saving encounters. - White\/black relations. - The rich\/working class\/poor divide. - Homelessness. - Why do kids join gangs\/become hoodlums? - The challenges of a 20-year nigh romance-less marriage. - The drive to improve one's living standards. - Does violence in film escalate violence or is it simply a reflection of society?

It bespeaks of real life and doesn't come off contrived at all. Take for example the teenager's driving lesson He makes a serious mistake and then pulls over. After his father explains a few things he attempts to start the vehicle which is ALREADY running. We've all done that. Another example would be Steve Martin's beautiful redhead girlfriend Vanessa (Sarah Trigger) She's calm, happy and pleasant one moment but then suddenly starts crying (obviously provoked by a statement). A rambling and uncomfortable emotional rant ensues. It's real. Another example would be McDonnell's reaction when her son asks if she and Kline are getting a divorce. Completely shocked, she asks, Why would you ask that?! Do we seem like a couple on the verge of divorce? She KNOWS that her son wouldn't ask such a question unless he sensed there were problems in the marriage on some instinctual level. These are just three minor examples off the top of my head.I've heard some complain that there's no humor. Did we see the same movie? There's actually quite a bit of humor or, at least, amusing and light-hearted moments. (How could there not be with Steve Martin in the cast?). Even though the picture is essentially a serious drama I busted out laughing, snickering or smiling on quite a few occasions. The film delivers in this department. Plus it's realistic humor, not contrived.Scanning through the reviews you'll note that Grand Canyon is a love it or hate it piece. I love it. The acting is, for the most part, great and you really come to care for the characters; you care about the outcome of each of the story lines. One reviewer commented that Grand Canyon is a depressing film; he couldn't be more wrong. Yes, there are some disconcerting story elements, but watch it till the end! Other reviewers criticize Steve Martin, who has a beard and plays a filmmaker.

Some things you simply have to read in-between-the-lines, others are left to the imagination. It also provokes you to ponder the numerous issues it addresses for DAYS afterward.

It was directed by an amateur filmmaker at the time, Sam Raimi and had a budget of only $375,000. So we have a director who has basically no training whatsoever and only made amateur short films prior to this, a budget of only $375,000, and a cast of actors who were just friends of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and had no acting experience prior hand. This should have been a recipe for disaster but instead we got a fun, original, atmospheric, well-shot, and spooky horror film that proves once again that small budgets can still make great films. But why is that? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. This film tells a very simple story about a group of college friends who decide to stay in a cabin together for a few days but end up encountering all sorts of demons when they open up the Book of the Dead. It all sounds very basic and simple but it works because unlike most movies, the story isn't really the meat of this movie. Most movies would have the story continually develop the characters but here, the story is just used as a setup for all the scenarios this movie throws at us. So in a nutshell, the story isn't especially deep and complex but it's not a problem because this movie really isn't about the characters, it's about the horror and that's what this movie delivers.This movie's horror is very effective because of the way it's shot. Sam Raimi uses a lot of POV shots for the demons in this movie and it makes the forest seem really creepy because you can tell there's something out there but you don't see it, your imagination fills in the blanks for you and it makes it way scarier than if they just had some sort of optical printer effect or an animatronic because you picture whatever scares you to be in the forest. So the fact that this movie had a baby-size budget actually made it better because it allowed Raimi to think of more creative ways to create chills rather than just throwing in some cheap special effect. Kinda like Spielberg did with Jaws.While the film is a horror film, it still has a campy feel to it which makes it more fun than if they played it completely straight. The demons are very over-the-top here with all their manic laughs and depraved faces but it makes you feel like a kid again watching this movie and that's always a good thing.The sound design is also quite good in this movie. It creates an eerie mood with the strong wind blowing outside and the quietness in the cabin, it's really spooky! This makes for a good movie to watch late at night, all alone in your room in the dark, with no sound other than the movie. That's probably the best way to watch it.The special effects here are actually pretty well done for such a small budget. They look cheesy but that's what makes it fun.

It was directed by an amateur filmmaker at the time, Sam Raimi and had a budget of only $375,000. So we have a director who has basically no training whatsoever and only made amateur short films prior to this, a budget of only $375,000, and a cast of actors who were just friends of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and had no acting experience prior hand. This should have been a recipe for disaster but instead we got a fun, original, atmospheric, well-shot, and spooky horror film that proves once again that small budgets can still make great films. But why is that? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. This film tells a very simple story about a group of college friends who decide to stay in a cabin together for a few days but end up encountering all sorts of demons when they open up the Book of the Dead. It all sounds very basic and simple but it works because unlike most movies, the story isn't really the meat of this movie. Most movies would have the story continually develop the characters but here, the story is just used as a setup for all the scenarios this movie throws at us. So in a nutshell, the story isn't especially deep and complex but it's not a problem because this movie really isn't about the characters, it's about the horror and that's what this movie delivers.This movie's horror is very effective because of the way it's shot. Sam Raimi uses a lot of POV shots for the demons in this movie and it makes the forest seem really creepy because you can tell there's something out there but you don't see it, your imagination fills in the blanks for you and it makes it way scarier than if they just had some sort of optical printer effect or an animatronic because you picture whatever scares you to be in the forest. So the fact that this movie had a baby-size budget actually made it better because it allowed Raimi to think of more creative ways to create chills rather than just throwing in some cheap special effect. Kinda like Spielberg did with Jaws.While the film is a horror film, it still has a campy feel to it which makes it more fun than if they played it completely straight. The demons are very over-the-top here with all their manic laughs and depraved faces but it makes you feel like a kid again watching this movie and that's always a good thing.The sound design is also quite good in this movie. It creates an eerie mood with the strong wind blowing outside and the quietness in the cabin, it's really spooky! This makes for a good movie to watch late at night, all alone in your room in the dark, with no sound other than the movie. That's probably the best way to watch it.The special effects here are actually pretty well done for such a small budget. They look cheesy but that's what makes it fun.

That's always a bad sign.Finally it seemed like something interesting was happening. The hero had the bad dude by the lapels..... he was actually showing a smidgen of character, a bit of personality & gumption!!! Oh joy of joys!!! But it was short lived. He climbs into a car with the baddie and off they go and off the viewer goes back to snoozeville. Cue the seemingly endless monologue in the car from boring bad guy - the world's most annoying road trip. He's telling gormless bland inanimate hero some yawn-fest story about his lame past and eventually an even more boring exposition of how he kidnapped the mans fortunate girlfriend (I say fortunate b\/c she at least was saved having to put up with this mind-numbing drivel) and his voice just goes on and on and I'm yelling OH SHUT UP!! at the screen.

Hero says hiyuck!! Dat sounds like a cool idea! and scoffs down the drugged drink and gets killed. What absolute nonsense. The ending wasn't chilling or clever or any of those other things people are saying. It was just stupid. No-one would do that. It makes no sense at all.

And don't believe the hype - it's just people thinking it MUST be good coz it's foreign, has subtitles, has a lot of footage of people doing nothing of any real interest, is really depressing and has a sad ending.

The specific genre of the Logan's Run is a futuristic dystopian\/Sci-Fi film (Just in case if you don't know what dystopian means in our current era  A dystopia is a community or society, usually fictional, that is in some important way undesirable or frightening.). The movie was made on a big budget of $9,000,000 - a budget similar to the well known Sci-Fi 2001  A Space Odyssey (1968).This futuristic story takes place in the year 2274 (23rd century). The survivors of a holocaust now live within an isolated city called Domed City. There men and women are only allowed to live until 30-years old due to population control and limited resources. At 30 the people have two choices They can either take part in a extermination ceremony called Carousel where they are promised a rebirth or they can go on the run and escape to outside the Domed City.Michael York portrays the main protagonist named Logan 5, who is a Sandman (police assassin). His main job is to terminate and hunt down all Runners who refuse to be exterminated on Carousel and escape to outside the city. Logan finds a symbol and the computer, that controls all life in the city, gives him a secret assignment find and destroy a mysterious place called Sanctuary by disguising himself as a runner. He must also erase the last four years of his life from the crystal on his pawn. Logan ends up on the run himself and hunted by his partner and best friend Francis 7. He and a beautiful woman named Jessica 6 (portrayed by Jenny Agutter) end up working for an underground resistance group helping all Runners search for Sanctuary escapes. They manage to escape from the Domed City and find themselves in a devastated Washington D.C, where they discover another world. Realizing there is much to live for, Logan begins to question the system. It's at this point in the film that they discover and befriend an elderly man (played Peter Ustinov).Farrah Fawcett, then recognized as a blonde sex symbol, is cast in this film in the supporting role of Holly, a woman who works in the face surgery department.

Here's a moment of the movie that shows an unrealistic and outdated visual effect Logan and Jessica look at the Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, which showed an art painting effect style. It would have been better if the Abe Lincoln statue had been made by the film production team. Today I find films from the 1970s, showing an art painting effect style, to be very outdated.The way that most of the cast played their characters was actually not bad at all. If anybody is big into science fiction, you will be entertained by the acting performance of the characters. The concept of the performance of the movie is pretty much the same way as the acting from the old 1930s & 40s Sci-Fi short subject films just like Flash Gordon. The way the cast spoke their lines and acted out on their characters mimicked the earlier style of Sci-Fi shorts.The film score that Jerry Goldsmith composed for the film, I found really catchy. Mostly the sounds and chorus of the score are what make the score so catchy. The moment during the score when it sounds epic is when Logan and Jessica get out of the ice cave into the outside world. For Sci-Fi fans, who wants to watch pre-Star Wars films, I recommend this picture. There are other great Sci-Fi pictures that came out before George Lucas released Star Wars - like Metropolis (1927), The Time Machine (1960), and 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968).I give that film a 3 out of 4 stars.

Yeah. His worst must be so wretched that it beats out all of the most incompetent, dismal and unscary horror flicks ever gathered together into one lump sum.From my perspective - There was just so much predictability and stupidity about Suspiria's less-than-frightening story that I don't exactly know where start off with my complaints.But, you can bet that there's one thing for sure - This utterly shallow picture took the likes of Witchcraft\/Horror movies to a whole new level of dumbness like you wouldn't ever believe possible.For one thing - Suspiria (which certainly took itself and its artsy\/fartsy-ness way too seriously) contained, in its uncensored state, no gratuitous sex or nudity, whatsoever.

The central figure of this American Revolution is Benjamin Martin, who couldn't have had a better incarnation than Mel Gibson, the eternal hero of 'David vs. Goliath' causes.There' such sincere poignancy in Gibson's performance that he carries the whole film with the same confidence and pride as if it was the stripes and stars banner. In fact, the same film without him would have lost half of its effect; the role was tailor-made for Mel Gibson. And The Patriot has the perfect mix of action (the battles are as gruesome and realistic like Braveheart) and emotion. I even wonder why the film didn't get as many accolades as Braveheart or its rival of the same year Gladiator, both have their share of thrills, Gibson had nothing to envy on Russel Crowe, much more his archenemy, played by Jason Isaacs, is probably the only villain to match Joaquin Phoneix on the field of awfulness.Action and sentimentality indeed, the film was both spectacular and surprisingly moving. It's like The Patriot tried to embody the two pillars of patriotism, muscle and heart we fight for the country, but there's no fight without a heart to drive the spirit. We got the message on Saving Private Ryan but Mel Gibson's presence is here to remind us that the film borrows more from Braveheart than Spielberg's WWII epic. The comparison with Braveheart is even more inevitable because the enemy is the same, only this time, they're not incarnated by their king, but by one colonel, who's not less ruthless and cruel, but you can tell, they wanted to avoid attacks on historical accuracy, by showing that not all the English acted that way.But Emmerich isn't a man of restriction and wisely enough, wouldn't trade thrills for objectivity, and Lord knows a movie like The Patriot couldn't have afforded objectivity. The more hateful the antagonist is, the more you support the hero, and even if he fights for a just cause, it's for the hero we care. We cared for Scots because it was William Wallace's people, not because we were eager to support them, the same goes for Americans. Granted they're the good guys in the film, but it's their personification by Gibson that creates our empathy, and it works precisely because he is unenthusiastic about the Revolution. This reluctance echoes the same plot of Braveheart when Wallaces states he doesn't believe in violence, but making violence undesirable doesn't prevent it from happening. You know the rule, there are two ways to die in Mel Gibson's films, to be family or wife (he played widowers in more than 15 films, including the 'Lethal Weapon' and 'Mad Max' series) or kill his family or wife. That's the trigger to awaken the fierce beast and reopen the concealed wound. Benjamin Martin, the ex-veteran of the French and Indian war, coerced by his comrade and friend Chris Cooper to vote for the levy to support the Continental War, refuses first because he's got seven children and can't afford principles. It doesn't take much for a movie fan to guess what kind of action will definitely make any English soldier an enemy for a man who adores his children more than anything. It even subtly questions the roots of a patriotism which is less made of abstractions, but as a sort of society's collective dream starting on its core family.But that's it, with Mel Gibson, no matter how predictable a plot point is, the acting wins our hearts, and it's impossible to resist to his on-screen charisma. What follows the turning point is a magnificent display of bestial savagery, but just because we root for the father as we despise the villain, just because Colonel Tavington (Isaacs) killed his son and ordered the soldiers to shoot the wounded Continentals, we savor the first vengeance. Watching the 'tomahawk ambush' isn't a sadistic delight, but the emotionally satisfying pay-off of a patient build-up and the sign of even more thrilling sequences to come. And still, The Patriot, and that's why I enjoyed it more than Gladiator, doesn't overplay the 'serious' card, this is not just an action film, there are characters, there is a spirit, and even some with guiding the action.Indeed, there are many cute and moving moments that would have felt awkward in other typical action films, a sweet romance between Benjamin's idealistic son Gabriel, played by a young Heath Ledger and a sweet courageous girl whose father's deafness creates some funny moments. There is a subplot involving two stolen dogs, Martin's cute little girl who never spoke since the death of Martin's wife and who's responsible for a particularly moving scene (again, we know she will speak but it doesn't make her shining moment any less powerful). There is also the solid supporting presence of Ledger, Cooper and Tcheky Karyo as the grouchy but reliable French (holding some grieves against the British). The Patriot reveals Emmerich's capability to see beyond the limits of its patriotic plot.Inevitably, the criticism it faced concerned Robert Rodat's screenplay and the portrayal of British soldiers, betraying the same superficiality I denounced in Saving Private Ryan, but while it ruined Spielberg's film, because it was supposed to be realistic, it remarkably fits with The Patriot because the film doesn't have the same pretension, and easily avoid the 'propaganda' trap.

I guess those who read Stephen King's original novel and noted all the deviations will stand on the second category. But it doesn't make any difference for me, since I've never read Stephen King, I can only base my judgment on my personal appreciation of the film, yet what I read about the novel confirmed a few regrets.For instance, there is a moment in the film where the 11-year old Brian tries to kill himself out of the guilt to have started the whole mayhem. After buying a Michael Mantle card dedicated to him, from Leland Gant, the mysterious new antiques stores owner, as a return, he's asked to commit two little pranks that eventually lead to the death of two women. Normally, in a true horrific King's film, he should be the third symbolical victim, to highlight the devilish manipulation he was victim of. But the hero of the film, the Sheriff played by Ed Harris, stops him at the last second. Now, what does 'knowing that he survived' add to the film? The relief that a kid's life was spared? You know there's a problem when a film doesn't have the guts to kill a child, especially when it's unfaithful to the novel.And that kind of sugarcoating is even more surprising from a film that is not afraid to shock the viewers. Let's get back to the two women who died, the hillbilly farmer and the shy waitress (played by a scene-stealing Amanda Plummer), they absolutely hate each other, we never know why but it doesn't matter, Vilma has something against Nettie's dog, and Nettie hates her in retrospect. Leland Gaunt know about their history, he even gave Vilma an old toy she broke after an argument with her late husband, and then, he exploits Brian's debt to make the two women kill each other. Brian throws apples (Nettie is renowned for her delicious apple pies) at Vilma's house, and in exchange of an old jacket that will revive the spirit of the 50's, the town's drunk has a more disgusting favor to accomplish, regarding Nettie's dog.The outcome of this part is extremely shocking, in less than ten minutes, we have the terrifying sight of a bleeding skinless dog gazing at a screaming Nettie followed by a horrific cat-fight, ending to (naturally) both women cutting themselves to pieces in the most gruesome way, worthy of the greatest horror flicks. The problem is that the sequence I described happens to be the highlight of the film, and it's never as shocking and frightening ever after. We're intended to believe that the rivalry between two religious members, that the prejudices between the deputy officer and the local mayor 'Buster' Keeton (J.T. Walsh) will lead to something, but strangely enough, it never adds up to the horror reached during the first part, and that's why the climax doesn't come as satisfying as it should have been, especially from a horror film.What lacked in Needful Things were a true direction and a better storytelling. Anyone could have seen that coming a peaceful town like those cherished by Stephen King, even named Castle Rock, with the same iconic lighthouse and autumnal foliage, turning at the end into an urban battlefield, with people trading one item of personal worth in exchange of a deadly favor, following the eternal selling-soul-to-the-devil cliché. What do we have in between? A succession of situations that only fill time before an anticlimactic confrontation. Indeed, we already know Gaunt is the Devil, and then we have to wait for the moment the Sheriff will figure that to see how he'll handle it. And it's only when Gaunt is confronted, during the last five minutes that the film gets more interesting. And the last exchange between Max Von Sydow and Ed Harris is more chilling than the overdose of pyrotechnics and special effects, displayed for the sake of cheap thrills.I guess this is the mark of some wannabe directors eager to prove their talent by using special effects, while a much subtler and simpler directing would have served the story. Why make so obvious that Gaunt is the devil, by trying to suggest it through his mundane attitude and a few devilish innuendo. The devil's disguise couldn't have fooled us, so why not playing the game straighter from the start? How can a mousetrap provoke a better effect than a woman getting a cleaver on the forehead?

But it doesn't make any difference for me, since I've never read Stephen King, I can only base my judgment on my personal appreciation of the film, yet what I read about the novel confirmed a few regrets.For instance, there is a moment in the film where the 11-year old Brian tries to kill himself out of the guilt to have started the whole mayhem. After buying a Michael Mantle card dedicated to him, from Leland Gant, the mysterious new antiques stores owner, as a return, he's asked to commit two little pranks that eventually lead to the death of two women. Normally, in a true horrific King's film, he should be the third symbolical victim, to highlight the devilish manipulation he was victim of. But the hero of the film, the Sheriff played by Ed Harris, stops him at the last second. Now, what does 'knowing that he survived' add to the film? The relief that a kid's life was spared? You know there's a problem when a film doesn't have the guts to kill a child, especially when it's unfaithful to the novel.And that kind of sugarcoating is even more surprising from a film that is not afraid to shock the viewers. Let's get back to the two women who died, the hillbilly farmer and the shy waitress (played by a scene-stealing Amanda Plummer), they absolutely hate each other, we never know why but it doesn't matter, Vilma has something against Nettie's dog, and Nettie hates her in retrospect. Leland Gaunt know about their history, he even gave Vilma an old toy she broke after an argument with her late husband, and then, he exploits Brian's debt to make the two women kill each other. Brian throws apples (Nettie is renowned for her delicious apple pies) at Vilma's house, and in exchange of an old jacket that will revive the spirit of the 50's, the town's drunk has a more disgusting favor to accomplish, regarding Nettie's dog.The outcome of this part is extremely shocking, in less than ten minutes, we have the terrifying sight of a bleeding skinless dog gazing at a screaming Nettie followed by a horrific cat-fight, ending to (naturally) both women cutting themselves to pieces in the most gruesome way, worthy of the greatest horror flicks. The problem is that the sequence I described happens to be the highlight of the film, and it's never as shocking and frightening ever after. We're intended to believe that the rivalry between two religious members, that the prejudices between the deputy officer and the local mayor 'Buster' Keeton (J.T. Walsh) will lead to something, but strangely enough, it never adds up to the horror reached during the first part, and that's why the climax doesn't come as satisfying as it should have been, especially from a horror film.What lacked in Needful Things were a true direction and a better storytelling. Anyone could have seen that coming a peaceful town like those cherished by Stephen King, even named Castle Rock, with the same iconic lighthouse and autumnal foliage, turning at the end into an urban battlefield, with people trading one item of personal worth in exchange of a deadly favor, following the eternal selling-soul-to-the-devil cliché. What do we have in between? A succession of situations that only fill time before an anticlimactic confrontation. Indeed, we already know Gaunt is the Devil, and then we have to wait for the moment the Sheriff will figure that to see how he'll handle it. And it's only when Gaunt is confronted, during the last five minutes that the film gets more interesting. And the last exchange between Max Von Sydow and Ed Harris is more chilling than the overdose of pyrotechnics and special effects, displayed for the sake of cheap thrills.I guess this is the mark of some wannabe directors eager to prove their talent by using special effects, while a much subtler and simpler directing would have served the story. Why make so obvious that Gaunt is the devil, by trying to suggest it through his mundane attitude and a few devilish innuendo.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family"},{"date":"15 August 2013","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. The Third Man is set in Vienna, The Man Between in Berlin and Odd Man Out in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in The Third Man only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American stars. It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word man in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of The Third Man is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of  writer pulp Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh lighting, expressionist black-and-white cinematography and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was The Lady from Shanghai, directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a forged passport and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous cuckoo clock speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. The Third Man is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's The Long Memory and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's Brighton Rock, also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 August 2013","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples.

It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word man in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of The Third Man is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of  writer pulp Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?) The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh lighting, expressionist black-and-white cinematography and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was The Lady from Shanghai, directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor. There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a forged passport and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities. The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous cuckoo clock speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely. Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. The Third Man is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's The Long Memory and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's Brighton Rock, also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10\/10 ","genre":"Film-Noir, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"15 August 2013","score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples.

That film has something else in common with this one. The term romantic comedy is often used to mean any boy-meets-girl love story with a happy ending, regardless of whether or not it is particularly humorous. Roxanne however, is a romantic comedy where the comedy is at least as important as the romance, and I think that the same holds good for Mannequin. Admittedly, the style of humour is very different in the two films. Roxanne, loosely based upon a classical French drama, is characterised by a much more intellectual, verbal humour, whereas in Mannequin the emphasis is much more upon slapstick and a very broad character-based humour. Yet both films never lose sight of the fact that the principal aim of a comedy is to amuse. According to Michael Gottlieb, the film's director and writer, he got the idea for the story when, walking down Fifth Avenue, he thought he saw a mannequin move in a department store window. It has, however, always struck me that part of the inspiration must have been One Touch of Venus from the late forties, another supernatural fantasy in which a young shop assistant falls in love with a statue which magically comes to life. The main character is Jonathan Switcher, an aspiring young artist, who finds it difficult to hold down a job until he finds work as a window dresser at Prince & Co., a large and long-established, but financially struggling, Philadelphia department store. While working there he falls in love with a beautiful blue-eyed blonde named Emma Hesire. There is, however, a catch. Emmy (as she is known) is originally from Ancient Egypt and has been transported to the Philadelphia of the 1980s by some capricious Egyptian gods. (I know that blonde hair, blue eyes, being called Emma and the ability to speak perfect English with a Canadian accent are not attributes normally associated with Ancient Egyptian womanhood, but as the above synopsis might suggest this is not a film which places a high premium on realism). There is a further catch. The same capricious gods have transformed Emmy into a mannequin. She can come to life for Jonathan as long as he is the only person who can see her. When anyone else is around she has to turn back into a mannequin. Emmy has one further attribute not normally associated with Ancient Egyptians or, for that matter, with mannequins. She has a genius for designing shop-window displays and gladly uses this skill to assist Jonathan in his work. The displays they produce together are so brilliant and attract so many customers that they radically improve the company's financial position, much to the disgust of the store manager, Mr Richards, who is secretly part of a conspiracy to run the company down so that a rival can acquire it at a rock-bottom price. The film narrates how Jonathan and Emmy are able to frustrate this conspiracy while at the same time coping with the difficulties in their romance caused by Emmy's turning back into a mannequin. Andrew McCarthy, like a number of his fellow Brat Packers, was widely regarded as a rising star during the mid-eighties, although his career has been rather patchy since. The least brattish of the Brat Pack, he was often cast as good-looking, clean-cut romantic heroes, his Jonathan here being a good example. Mannequin is a rare example of a Hollywood older woman-younger man romance where the age difference is not turned into a major plot point or obstacle to the love of the two characters. Ignore the fact that Emmy is supposed to be about 4,500 years old; the glamorous, sophisticated thirty-something Kim Cattrall is clearly more mature by several years than the boyish twenty-something McCarthy. The film was successful at the box office, but the critics mostly disliked it. (Rita Kempley called it made by, for and about dummies.) I, however, have always had something of a soft spot for it. Certainly, it is based upon an absurd premise and many of the characters are one- dimensional caricatures. It certainly will not win many awards for political correctness, relying as it does on stereotypes like the outrageously camp and effeminate gay man and the arrogant, preening and sex-obsessed Frenchman. Many of those characters do, however, generate a lot of laughs, especially Meshach Taylor's flamboyant window dresser Hollywood Montrose, G. W. Bailey's paranoid and officious security chief Felix Maxwell, James Spader's smoothly hypocritical Richards and Carole Davis as Jonathan's bitchy and snobbish ex-girlfriend Roxie. (In 1987 Spader was a relatively unknown actor, not the big name he was to become after his performance in Sex, Lies and Videotape a couple of years later). The film, in fact, is a lot better than One Touch of Venus, a botched attempt to transfer a Broadway musical from stage to screen while excising a lot of the music which made it a hit on Broadway. The central idea may seem silly, yet it is no sillier than a lot of fairy-tales which have been a beloved part of European culture for centuries. A mannequin coming to life is no more absurd than the idea of a frog turning into a handsome prince or a princess falling asleep for a hundred years after pricking her finger. Mannequin is essentially a modern-dress fairy-tale which (unlike some other modern-dress fairy- tales such as Pretty Woman) keeps the element of magic. Like all good fairy-tales it ends with virtue rewarded and vice punished and a wedding for the beautiful princess and her handsome prince. (It is, I think, no accident that Jonathan and Emmy work at a store called Prince & Co). The tale is told with enthusiasm and good-natured humour which makes the film enjoyable watching.

Mannequin is essentially a modern-dress fairy-tale which (unlike some other modern-dress fairy- tales such as Pretty Woman) keeps the element of magic. Like all good fairy-tales it ends with virtue rewarded and vice punished and a wedding for the beautiful princess and her handsome prince. (It is, I think, no accident that Jonathan and Emmy work at a store called Prince & Co). The tale is told with enthusiasm and good-natured humour which makes the film enjoyable watching. Mention should also be made of Starship's catchy theme song Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now. 6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"}]
