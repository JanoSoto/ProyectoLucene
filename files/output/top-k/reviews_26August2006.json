This movie aims for success on so many levels that if it was perfect it would deserve at least a 12.

The more levels you can appreciate the movie on, the more rewarded you will be as a viewer.You don't need to be into sci-fi...as long as you can live with it, imagination-wise, there will be plenty of humor for you. Every main character is funny, and so much of the humor is universal--based on tensions between characters, or the fish-out-of-water premise, or the naivete of the Thermians--that any comedy lover should enjoy this movie. And with outstanding performances by terrific actors in what amounts to about 10 main characters (once you include the nearly-perfect Thermian leads, and Brandon) there is plenty of humor for anyone who likes to laugh.If you *are* into sci-fi, you will be served up delights in layer upon layer. It doesn't just spoof Star Trek...it produces a fantastic ricocheting of spoofiness and loving, laughing tribute. With the original Galaxy Quest show being the Star Trek spoof, the lives of its stars 18 years later is a spoof in itself, as they re-live their sci-fi personas on stage at conventions and at opening ceremonies for high-tech stores. (By Grabthar's Hammer...what a savings.) Meanwhile, the world of the Thermians is yet another spoof of the original spoof--a real-world, functional version of the show's fictional environment. (A great laugh on that level comes when Daryl Mitchell's Laredo sees his control board on the real version of the Protector. Look -- this thingie!) And before you know it, the movie's plot has become yet another spoof--and by this time it's a spoof of both Star Trek and Galaxy Quest at the same time. And the actors whose lives had become spoofs of the fictional show which is a spoof of our real show start end up living out dramas that appear to be pulled straight from episodes of their old show (which seem heavily inspired by classic Star Trek episode models). (A great laugh on this level is when Sam Rockwell's crewman #6 Guy starts freaking out when he realizes they are living out the episode where his expendable character died.) Then, once this movie has wrapped itself around itself like a hilarious, inventive rope, it takes a deep breath and a giant bounce, grabs its own tail, and attempts to bring the whole package home in a super-satisfying ending sequence that works on every level. Which it does.And before you come away from this review thinking that with all that spoofing, the movie must be farcically ridiculous...well, that's the truly amazing part. With all the layers of absurdity that make up the movie, it's remarkably realistic (considering the premise) and heartwarming.This is not Spaceballs- or Scary Movie-style spoofery. This is some sort of amazing magic spoofery which manages to interlace itself seamlessly into a real story about characters we care about. It spoofs the Star Trek body of work while simultaneously matching or exceeding the best of it. It mocks the wholesomeness and false camaraderie while also embracing it. It takes utterly cynical characters and brings them on a transformative voyage that is as preposterous as it is hilarious as it is real and rewarding.At the same time, you could scrape all that out of the way and just watch this movie for the funny moments, and you'd still have something that's more satisfying than 9 out of 10 comedies.Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy!

If you had asked me then, I would have said that Hellraiser was a bore, a collection of great gore surrounded by seemingly interminable exposition. As a man, however, I am able to appreciate its subtlety. This does not mean Hellraiser is a great, brilliant film, but it does mean that it has a lot more merit than what Ebert gives it credit for. That said, just as I have said with countless other films, if you have only seen Hellraiser on VHS, you have not really seen it at all. This is one film where seeing the points at which steel enters flesh, or ink marks skin, is really appreciated. Anchor Bay have outdone themselves on the DVD, which is especially mesmerising to behold on a Plasma TV of a hundred and six centimetres. Stephen King was right. Clive Barker is the future of horror, with all the usual clichés and stupid devices nowhere to be seen.Based upon Barker's novella The Hellbound Heart, Hellraiser is a story of how far we will go in order to achieve satisfaction, and what it will cost us if we go too far. Unfortunately, the first error Clive makes is in the lack of detail he goes into regarding Frank's first encounter with the cenobites. Granted, he was limited to a very small budget, but The Hellbound Heart's description of the moment when Frank realises his grevious mistake is far more satsifying in the end. Not that the first images we see of the cenobites aren't satisfying in themselves. Barker's decision to join the opening sequences to the rest of the film with the classic image of Doug Bradley in full makeup resetting the box was one of the smartest made during the 1980s. As Frank is driving his sister-in-law to murder men so that he might rebuild himself, one perfectly understands his motivations for this truly despicable behaviour. And therein lies the true key to building a compelling antagonist. We are repelled by Frank because we know we might do the same in his position.Fortunately, Ashley Laurence gives us a protagonist we can like. During the opening scenes, we cannot see her as anything but an ordinary twenty-something girl. Towards the end of the film, we see an ordinary twenty-something girl who suddenly finds herself in a very messed-up situation. Her attempts to bargain with the cenobites are almost painful to watch, and for a good reason. She never breaks character, even in the most uncomfortable situations, which makes it all the more a shame that she only seemed to resurface for a sequel. Sean Chapman and Andrew Robinson round out the circle as the brothers around whom the novella revolved. While the good brother as Andrew portrays him is never quite developed enough to make one care about his fate, Sean develops Frank so well that one almost wishes he could escape the fate that he has brought upon himself. When Andrew suddenly takes the walk on his character's brother's wild side, such is the nuances of the acting on display that one immediately realises what has happened, and is even shocked by it in spite of how telegraphed it is.Which brings me to the real star of the film. Doug Bradley, a friend of Barker's from high school plays and the like if you listen to the audio commentary, was offered his choice of roles on the production. Had he not been offered the cenobite with the most lines, he has more or less said, he would have chosen the part played instead by Andrew Robinson. And that would have been a waste of such great talent. Where other film killers were either mute or too prone to mistaking themselves for comedians, Bradley gives us a monster who is so matter-of-fact. When he indulges in humour, it becomes refreshing due to how dry it is. You have to really be listening to him to get it, thus the film rewards the audience for paying attention. Bradley has since gone on to perform in a seemingly inordinate amount of sequels, including the masterful second episode, but he is never in finer form than is the case here. When he tells Ashley Laurence's character that he will tear her soul apart if she is trying to pull a fast one, the words ring in the memory like being told one has cancer.Special mention must be made of the various effects. Whilst the special visual effects, particularly at the end of the film, are strictly low-fi, the makeup effects throughout the rest of the film are so brilliant they make the film almost as much as the performances of Laurence, Chapman, Robinson, and Bradley. Sure, the pillar of wood with the chains and bodyparts nailed to it was a bit silly, but you will never notice it amidst all the suffering the rest of the film displays to us. When Andrew Robison improvised the line Jesus wept, I just had to laugh. Take it from someone who has regularly suffered the psychological equivalent of what goes on in Hellraiser Clive Barker really knows how to put his characters through pain. And that is the great advantage that the first two Hellraiser films have over those that have followed. The audience cares enough about the characters that what becomes of them is truly satisfying to watch. It could even be argued that everyone in the film, from Frank to Julia to the myriad of strangers, gets exactly what they deserve.For these reasons, I gave Hellraiser an eight out of ten. If nothing else, it is a great example of what can be done on the cheap.

Re-Animator is a very goofy film and is not exactly intelligent either. I'm not going to pretend that Re-Animator is well made either because it is far from a well made film. Yet there is something very cool about Re-Animator maybe the fact that the very fake gore looks so funny and I can respect the level of creativity because this was before special-effects were filling up the market. Re-Animator is a very iconic film and has a strange nerdy feel throughout it's short running time.Re-Animator has this great B movie feel to it, think Evil Dead (a better film by the way) but with scientists. The movie is very well known for it's level gore, which is definitely is, yet the gore is very fake and so funny that you won't be as disgusted as you would be if it wasn't comic. I think it is great that Re-Animator has so much comedy in it and the whole detached head and body scene is so imaginative and irresistibly hilarious. Still the film keeps you very entertained and provides a lot of intense scenes of clumsy science. Re-Animator feels somewhat like a cartoon that's not sure if it wants to shock you or make you sit back rolling around in hysterics. The film is not scary, but is creepy at certain times and you'll always know what's going to happen next.The acting is another thing that makes the film so funny and the fact that almost every line uttered is cheesy brilliance. I love the way all the actors actually seem very attached to their roles, yet you know they are probably taking the whole thing as a joke. There's something very amusing about watching film basically about an inept scientist who tries to create a cure for death. Not only does the film manage to just shock you from the opening scene, it also manages to hold up the atmosphere throughout the film. The film definitely is an all rounder in the technical categories even if it does look very cheap. The make up is highly detailed and shows a lot of time and effort. At least Re Animator has a level of intelligent direction to it.Being the kind of movie lover who's not a great fan of horror films and tries to avoid them because of the often awful repetitiveness. If you can except that really Re-Animator is a comedy and not a gore fest then you might overlook some of the more intense sequences as highly amusing examples of kitchen gore. Yes Re-Animator is dumb, yes Re-Animator is over the top and yes Re-Animator has a certain style and guilty pleasure level to it. Not for the faint hearted, but recommend for fans of quirky horror movies and great for a group of friends who just want to sit back and be entertained.

The film is not scary, but is creepy at certain times and you'll always know what's going to happen next.The acting is another thing that makes the film so funny and the fact that almost every line uttered is cheesy brilliance. I love the way all the actors actually seem very attached to their roles, yet you know they are probably taking the whole thing as a joke. There's something very amusing about watching film basically about an inept scientist who tries to create a cure for death. Not only does the film manage to just shock you from the opening scene, it also manages to hold up the atmosphere throughout the film. The film definitely is an all rounder in the technical categories even if it does look very cheap. The make up is highly detailed and shows a lot of time and effort. At least Re Animator has a level of intelligent direction to it.Being the kind of movie lover who's not a great fan of horror films and tries to avoid them because of the often awful repetitiveness. If you can except that really Re-Animator is a comedy and not a gore fest then you might overlook some of the more intense sequences as highly amusing examples of kitchen gore. Yes Re-Animator is dumb, yes Re-Animator is over the top and yes Re-Animator has a certain style and guilty pleasure level to it. Not for the faint hearted, but recommend for fans of quirky horror movies and great for a group of friends who just want to sit back and be entertained.

Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense. It's a must-see-once kind of movie, even if you find that you don't like the movie.And the cast is probably one of the best reasons to see it. It's really got the best crop of stars and character actors from Warner brothers and beyond. Bogart and Bergman have their spotlight on them here at full blast and they each deliver impeccable performances in roles that aren't too unexpected, but never less than stylish and dramatic. Then there's Peter Lorre, Peter Greenstreet, and of course Claude Raines who probably gives if not his most memorable performance one of his most striking. It's rare that an actor is given such a part that really fits him and still keeps a hold on the viewer so many years later. From the story intrigue and deception and danger involving the Nazis, the heroism and sacrifice that gets involved, and at the core of it- after the club which Bogie owns- is the love triangle that gets resolved in a somber way that makes for a sensational ending. In fact, it's main goal is to be sensational, and for the most part it's truly successful, from its 'a kiss is just a kiss' song to the sweet one-liners.

I'm not going to say there wasn't any comedy in this movie because there was. There were moments of total hilarity due to an hysterical Bill Pullman who was really in top comedic form. The problem is, when those moments were NOT happening the movie just wasn't very good. It was a great premise but there were a lot of things about the movie overall, that I did not enjoy.This movie was strongest in the beginning, where I thought it was going to be a movie similar to Bridget Jones Diary. But I felt the movie went downhill fairly quickly. I guess this is what one would call a black comedy but as with many of this genre, I felt the movie was to focused on the meanness and not so much on the comedy. When Pullman's character first starts unraveling it's OK but after awhile it becomes a bit of overkill. The movie just becomes way to cruel, as more and more bad things happen to Ellen's character. That's the focus of the movie really, not the comedy. It's almost like the movie's seeing how many awful things can happen to Ellen'c character, and how much of her life can be destroyed etc etc. It didn't make me laugh, it made me a bit dazed and frankly I just wanted the movie to end. Throwing ants and gum on someone, and that person losing their job etc etc is not what I consider to be funny. The truly funny moments existed when Pullman was on screen because, as utterly annoying as his character came to be, he was hilarious. So yes there were a few moments where I laughed out loud.But those moments did not make the movie, for me, a great one. Another thing I didn't like was that the movie became way to over the top, a Virtual cornucopia of melodrama. Inga & Bob,rather then being funny, were a bit obnoxious. The whole wedding storyline was way to much. And the movie felt so LONG. I mean I know it wasn't but it FELT like it was.Ellen was very good as the lead though and Pullman, as mentioned was REALLY good and should probably have his own comedy television show. In a way I think I would have liked this better as a straight on comedy without the mean element or as a romance where Pullman's character did NOT change but stayed Normal. Or maybe even as a thriller or a film Noir. Basically I just felt this movie didn't work as a black comedy. I wouldn't consider this one of the worst movies ever made however. I would not recommend it either.

I know it naturally goes that way-- with the reason always being, 'well its the original...it started it all' and such, but as far as to what the story is about and the actual character of Freddy Kruger, the others don't even compare. Don't get it twisted, the Freddy we've all come to love in the sequels is cool... funny, witty, but remember-- that version of Freddy is the Sequal Freddy. In the original, the idea of Freddy's character is a much more frightening concept then smart-alec, ingeniously imaginative and creative killing machine he has evolved into. Think for a moment what Freddy is... what he was before he was burned alive by a mob of angry, vengeful parents. I think Freddy as a sick, little, psychotic pedophile is much scarier, realistic, dirty and all things bad. He is weird little man, with a weird little laugh, spending his time alone fantasizing, plotting and eventually carrying out his twisted urges to kidnap and hurt little children. Although it has never been officially established in any of the films I don't think it is absurd or out of line to believe Freddy did more than just kill children. Whether he literally molested those children sexually or not I think its safe to bet that he achieved some sort of sexual stimulation from hurting them. In the original, Freddy is darker, not just in character, but also is the way they lit him. You hardly saw his disfigurement in bright sharp tones... he was always in the shadows, and although he did speak and had a few darkly humorous quips, (in contrast to a few famous killers that came before him), his words were few and far between and definitely not of the stand up comedian stock. Freddy is a phantom, a supernatural evolution of what he once was as a mortal man, and I like to imagine what he was while I'm watching what he is. He was a deviant, a perverted, sick bad man who is even sicker and badder as a spiritual entity. p.s. while the make up appliances giving Freddy that stretched, burnt look is classic and much admired by this fan, I always loved the darkness of his flesh in the original. I'm saying though, ever leave a hot dog on the grill too long.. it goes well beyond the fleshy red color... blackened and charred--just like Freddy's heart.

The Mothman Prophecies is one of the great horror films of our time &#150; matching the eerie tones of isolation and psychological deterioration from The Shining and delivering intelligent thrills instead of cheap scare tactics. It's a daring move for a film called The Mothman Prophecies not to actually feature any visuals of the titular creature, but that's exactly the case here &#150; the film falls back upon old-fashioned chills rather than modern-day thrills. Of the decade so far I would rank it as one of the finest of its genre without hesitation.The film purports to be based on a true story, and although numerous facts are twisted (not least of all that the actual events depicted in the film took place forty years ago and the protagonist of the film, strictly speaking, never really existed), it will easily appeal to those Mothman buffs out there as well as it will to regular audiences. The movie has some nice in-joke references (such as the fact that one character's name, Leek, is Keel spelled backwards &#150; the name of the author of the book Mothman is based upon) and Pellington clearly did his research prior to filming.The movie stars Richard Gere as a Washington reporter who loses his wife (Debra Messing) in a freak car crash. Two years pass and after a long day of work in the office and perpetual unrest, he sets out for a quiet drive to Baltimore. A couple hours later he finds himself hundreds of miles away in Point Pleasant, West Virginia &#150; a town experiencing bizarre happenings that somehow relate to the passing of his wife. People are seeing strange things men in black, demonic beings and a strange winged creature with blood red eyes.The Mothman Prophecies lets everything up to the viewer's imagination &#150; when the reporter gets a telephone call from a man named Indrid Cold who seems to have infinite knowledge and an alien voice, Pellington doesn't draw conclusions. Is Indrid the Mothman? Is Indrid from another world? We don't know &#150; making the proceedings all the more eerie.Some Mothman enthusiasts have claimed the film really doesn't focus enough solely on the Mothman, and tries to turn into a supernatural thriller rather than a documentary-style production on what actually happened in Point Pleasant in 1967. But to be fair, trying to compile all of the insane legends of the town's history into a single film would be disastrous. There exist many other odd events that occurred within the town during the time period of the Mothman sightings, but some of them are downright silly (such as author John A. Keel's alleged contact with extra-terrestrials and the theory that the Mothman is an escaped alien test subject the government had captured). Pellington takes the high road and lays the basics out on the table, and let's viewers draw their own conclusions.Perhaps the most intriguing thing about this film is the fact that Pellington does, in fact, turn his film into a psychological thriller rather than a true horror film. Except for the sloppy ending (which stinks of Hollywood interference), this is a dark, edgy, realistic and un-nerving movie. Like Kubrick's The Shining, it puts you inside the mind of a man driven to the brink of insanity &#150; in this case, fueled by the death of a loved one and pure obsession. There's an interesting twist towards the end of the film that provides some poignant reflection for Gere's character, when he is confronted with the possibility of speaking to his dead wife through the aid of Indrid Cold. But he's left with a big question what if it's not really his wife? How do you want to remember your wife? another character asks him. It's a very effective scene.Gere delivers a fine, surprisingly powerful performance as a grieving man &#150; the character is loosely based on Keel, but there are a lot of dramatic additions, such as the internal conflict involving the death of his wife and his spiritual link with the Mothman himself. But these are not distracting threads &#150; it provides a strong connection between Gere and the Mothman\/Indrid Cold. This connection really drives the psychological tension of the film.Directorially this is a very promising example of Pellington's visual finesse behind the camera. Evoking Hitchcock, Kubrick, Polanski and other great artists, Pellington becomes, in many ways, the true star of this picture. The fragmented visuals accompanied by the creepy score by Tomandandy results in one of the finest horror-thrillers in recent memory &#150; a film that works on many levels and, despite some flaws (mainly towards the finale), is a perfect example of why directors are just as vital to a film as the story itself.

There is no longer a sole Jack Nicholson who needs to facilitate the film all by himself, but an all-star ensemble cast of a police force.Three cops from this police force are at focus, the ambitious Exley (Guy Pearce), the sly Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and the brutal White (Russell Crowe), all working for the internally stormy LAPD. They are investigating a series of murders in the city that all seem to be strangely linked, glossed over and above all merciless. L.A. Confidential is a self-describing title &#150; the affairs that propel the film are all hush-hush and you feel it in a tense, film-noir atmosphere build up to an engrossing crime thriller.The narrative flow is steadily set at a patient and careful pace, enticing the viewer with just a hint of foreshadowing of corruption and murders &#150; it rarely dishes out huge doses of spontaneous violence. When it does feature bloodshed, it is at a time so carefully construed that it becomes effective for the story, like the violent showdown with Exley in the suspects' hideout house. That is another thing L.A Confidential does better than Chinatown, in which it was all mood and no culminations. Here we have well-placed, sweaty action.Atmospheric, suspenseful and often exciting &#150; and while certainly glossy in a Hollywood glamour days style, this particular part never outshines the characters or template plot. Visuals are placed in the backseat to make room for the all-star cast. So, my hat's off to you, Curtis Hanson, for carving out such a balanced and entertaining product. The curse of 1997 ensured that L.A. Confidential never got to take home the big awards. Titanic is this curse, and it completely swallowed all the big titles are the Academy.But I am not so sure I would have awarded L.A.

It doesn't get ultra-sappy, it won't make you laugh until you cry, nobody has to fall in love with anyone and nobody has to die a horrible, unjust death. There isn't even a tragic death we sing about.

The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of cool and authoritative, Rick is in the private area of his establishment.

One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a no nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside. The arrogant big-shot shouts, What!? Do you know who I am!? Rick,\/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!Next, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the Letters of Transit which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story. But before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, You despise me, don't you? To which Bogie replies, Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.It would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes.

I wasn't to familiar with the Jason flicks other then seeing part 1, 2 and part 6, but this one looked really interesting to me at the time. Mainly, because Jason is suppose to take Manhatten. The whole thought of it seemed like a lot of fun and was a good time to take advantage of the body count. Of course, as all of us Jason fans know, this movie was a big let down. Jason is in New York for the last 30 minutes of the movie and certainly doesn't take Manhattan.For those of you that don't know the storyline on how the heck Jason even gets to Manhattan, here it is. There is a High School trip on a cruise boat heading out towards New York. Jason, still underwater from the last film, awakens once again and boards the ship. Of course, he starts killing off the High Schoolers one by one in various different methods. About an hour into the film the remaining people on board decide to ditch the boat and head for shore on a row boat. And were do they end up? In Manhattan of course! Some how, Jason has followed them to Manhattan (I just can't see Jason swimming) and starts stalking them on the streets and alleys of New York.This really could have been a fun film, with the whole change in atmosphere and what not. There are a lot of problems with the film, though. Of course, what I stated above in my first paragraph about Jason only being in the City for about 30 minutes. This didn't really give Jason enough time to go on any real rampage. Sure, he kills some dead beat heroin addicts and and a few other people, but I wanted to see Jason really tear up New York and make them remember the name Jason Voorhies. Instead, he just decides to terrorize the last remaining people from the ship.Also, the music for the movie was pretty bad at times dating the movie. The nice thing about the other Jason flicks is a great and unforgettable soundtrack. What we get here is a lot of hair rock. But, they may have done this trying to change the format. It just doesn't work, though. Instead, it adds an extra bit of humor to this already silly film.I think with this movie it is important not to try and take it so seriously. Yes, this is a poor excuse for a Jason flick, but, it certainly is a laugh riot at times. And I think that is what you have to do. Ignore the fact that Jason can magically teleport about and laugh about it instead. Laugh at how silly Kane Hodder looks with his heavy breathing. And laugh at the death scenes, as they are quite funny even if they aren't all that bloody. And finally, laugh at how stupid Jason looks without his mask on.I have to defend this movie as a horror fan and as a Friday the 13th fan. Certainly, it is not a good movie, but it is still a lot of fun. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember pretty well seeing previews for this flick back in the late 80's.

Jason is in New York for the last 30 minutes of the movie and certainly doesn't take Manhattan.For those of you that don't know the storyline on how the heck Jason even gets to Manhattan, here it is. There is a High School trip on a cruise boat heading out towards New York. Jason, still underwater from the last film, awakens once again and boards the ship. Of course, he starts killing off the High Schoolers one by one in various different methods. About an hour into the film the remaining people on board decide to ditch the boat and head for shore on a row boat. And were do they end up? In Manhattan of course! Some how, Jason has followed them to Manhattan (I just can't see Jason swimming) and starts stalking them on the streets and alleys of New York.This really could have been a fun film, with the whole change in atmosphere and what not. There are a lot of problems with the film, though. Of course, what I stated above in my first paragraph about Jason only being in the City for about 30 minutes. This didn't really give Jason enough time to go on any real rampage. Sure, he kills some dead beat heroin addicts and and a few other people, but I wanted to see Jason really tear up New York and make them remember the name Jason Voorhies. Instead, he just decides to terrorize the last remaining people from the ship.Also, the music for the movie was pretty bad at times dating the movie. The nice thing about the other Jason flicks is a great and unforgettable soundtrack. What we get here is a lot of hair rock. But, they may have done this trying to change the format. It just doesn't work, though. Instead, it adds an extra bit of humor to this already silly film.I think with this movie it is important not to try and take it so seriously. Yes, this is a poor excuse for a Jason flick, but, it certainly is a laugh riot at times. And I think that is what you have to do. Ignore the fact that Jason can magically teleport about and laugh about it instead. Laugh at how silly Kane Hodder looks with his heavy breathing. And laugh at the death scenes, as they are quite funny even if they aren't all that bloody. And finally, laugh at how stupid Jason looks without his mask on.I have to defend this movie as a horror fan and as a Friday the 13th fan. Certainly, it is not a good movie, but it is still a lot of fun. 7\/10 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"26 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember pretty well seeing previews for this flick back in the late 80's.

The three lead characters - played by Stanwyck, Lancaster and Begley - don't have a likable bone among all three of their bodies. Even at a brief hour-and-a-half as a feature film, and with flashbacks, it still reveals it was more appropriate in its shorter, original radio version, less than one-third of this length. It reminds one of those disappointing stories, today, in some full-length movies, which are over-long, and seem more appropriate to skits on shows, say, like Saturday Night Live, or in half-hour (read 22-23 minutes) sitcoms. This is likely the reason why so many popular t.v. success-story personalities have done poorly on the large screen. In addition to their being unlikable and unsympathetic, there may be less chemistry between\/among these lead characters, in whatever array compared, than just about anything ever put on celluloid. Finally, Barbara chews more scenery than a horde of beavers could consume - one is surprised the bed, telephone and end table remain in-tact from this metaphorical assault. (Burt and Ed Begley are no strangers to gnawing the scenery, either.) I saw a tape of this film, again, at a friend's home - shortly after I'd seen Will Smith, Hackman and Voight in Enemy of the State. I found myself wishing that this film would have ended with the three leads in the bedroom, pulling weapons, and opening-up on one another - the way Voight's bad-guy feds and Will Smith's gangster acquaintances did on one another at the climax of that film.
