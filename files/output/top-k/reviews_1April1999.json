[{"date":"1 April 1999","score":"","review":"  Today I went to see this film for the second time.  I first saw this film in the second week of December 1998, after reading a short article about it. Back then, I was anxious to see the film starring the then unknown (to most people) Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes.  This time around, I was once again mesmerized by Cate Blanchett's performance as Elizabeth I, and I was enthralled by the film's stunning beauty (particularly its cinematography). The film itself seems somewhat flawed--I don't know why.  Yet, it's still an impressive and enjoyable film to watch.  The cinematography of this film is spectacular and unprecedented.  I love the use of bright light and of bold color in certain scenes  in the film.  My favorite scene in the movie is the moment when Elizabeth has just found out that her sister Mary has died, leaving Elizabeth to become the new queen.  That scene is probably the best example of the cinematographer's use of bright light and bold color...I love the look of the green color of the hills in that scene. But more importantly, this is Cate's film.  She's amazing in this, her star-making performance.  Her portrayal of Elizabeth I was brilliant.  I will always consider this to be one of the best performances ever. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 April 1999","score":"","review":"  Today I went to see this film for the second time.

This is a warm, admittedly sentimental movie, that just plain old makes you feel good.  Today, that is not such a bad thing.I agree with the previous post about what a great scene it is when the general walks in.  But the scene that moves me even more, and to me is a great piece of camera work, is when the cast begins singing White Christmas again (after the large doors have been opened to expose the snow).  As they sing, the camera pulls back and over the tables to show different people at each table rising to toast each other.  It is a remarkably  poignant scene for me.  Friends toasting old friends.  I tell you it brings a tear to my eye every time and makes me want to go out to dinner with friends and toast them to let them know what they have meant to me in life.  Something like this actually happened.  On my god parent's 50th anniversary, we took them for a weekend at the Lodge at Pebble Beach in Carmel.  During the dinner, someone came in and played I'll be Seeing You for them on the piano as they danced.  Wasn't a dry eye in the house.That may be a little deep for such a light movie, but it is what makes is work for me.  Any movie that makes you appreciate the important people in your life is all right in my book.  I give it 9 out of 10.
