Although it is not really true (contrary to what has sometimes been reported) that this is the first instance where a director made considerable use of slowly-fading camera-shots towards the end of a scene, Stevens arguably extended the expected boundaries of the technique up to that time.

Every now and then the dialogue appears too theatrical; the adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel has not been entirely successful in this regard. It is notable how George Stevens here, as with his later, perhaps more widely known film GIANT, managed to rise above the soap-opera-like tendencies in the script and turn out a film which still appears relatively modern, its time of making taken into consideration. Just as with GIANT, however, this accomplishment must also in A PLACE IN THE SUN be equally attributed to a remarkable cast; in this case, Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and, to some degree, Shelley Winters. I find it hard to call Clift's performance as George Eastman his crowning achievement, simply because he was so good in nearly everything he did throughout his career, but I may say so much as that his interpretation of the troubled individual provides me with one of these rare, rare instances where I am left wanting to grasp every single gesture and delivery of a line, obsessed with a desire to understand what this person really is about. Is he a villain or a victim of circumstance, or both? I was not sure the first time I watched the film several years ago, and if anything, I feel even less able to give a definitive answer now; reading the novel has helped me to understand what the author originally had in mind, but Clift's interpretation of the character is so acutely subtle, seemingly contradictory that it deserves to be analyzed also out of context with its origins.Also Elizabeth Taylor is given more to do than just being beautiful in her first starring role as an adult; the edgy unpredictability which would coin most of her performances in the future is very much present here, and the chemistry between her and Clift is dazzling (as every movie-buff will know, this was partly a result of their off-screen relationship).

Clift, on his part, was nominated for a second time, and the fact that he (or Marlon Brando) did not win may be viewed as proof that the Academy Awards should, perhaps, not be taken so seriously after all (which is not meant as an insult to Humphrey Bogart, who did win that year).

Not only does this movie tell you the story of a gypsy folk, but it reveals once again as so many movies do and did before, that our problems, though so specific to our culture and lifestyle, are universal after all.The movie is about a young boy, Perhan, and his story of growing up and finding his way. He grows up living with his old grandmother and handicapped younger sister - his mother died when giving birth to him, and his father is unknown (he was a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with his mother). Their uncle Merdzan also lives with them. Merdzan is the family's troublemaker. He is a gambler.Perhan has telekinetic powers, and his grandmother is a healer.Perhan's best friend is his Turkey. He mimics the turkey's sounds, and they seem to understand each other. There is also a girl Perhan likes very much Azra. But, being the boy of an affair, the mother refuses to let him marry her daughter.One day, Ahmed, a wealthy Gypsie sheik, comes to Perhan's village. Merdzan plays cards against him, but loses and comes home to look for money to repay the men. Not finding any, he accuses the grandmother of hiding it, and in his rage lifts the house's walls up. The following morning, when Perhan, his grandmother, and his sister return to the house, they find out that their uncle boiled Perhan's turkey.Perhan's grandmother gets called to Ahmed's house - she is a healer, and she is asked to heal Ahmed's sick son. She does so. In return, she asks for Ahmed to take Danira to a hospital in Ljubiljana to heal her leg and pay for it. Perhan comes along and promises his grandmother not to leave her, but ends up going to Milan instead because he can't stay at the hospital.Perhan begins working for Ahmed, and his quest for making money in an honest way soon dies and he begins stealing. Other kids work for Ahmed, begging for money on the streets. Eventually, Ahmed appoints Perhan boss of his crew when he is double-crossed by his brother.Ahmed then sends Perhan on a mission to find children to work for them. Perhan returns to his old village, where he finds that Azra is pregnant. He still marries her, but only under the condition that she sell the child after its birth, not believing her that it is his. Perhan experiences further disappointments when he finds out that Ahmed is not as he promised building a house for him, and his sister Danira was not healed, but instead disappeared.Azra, still telling Perhan their child is his, dies on their wedding night after giving birth to a boy (while levitating in the air). It is Ahmed who leaves with the child.Perhan finds out that his sister is being used by Ahmed to work for him. He searches for her. After four years, he finally finds her in Rome. She leads him to Perhan Jr., whom he now accepts as his son. He takes both Danira and Perhan Jr. with him, but when boarding the train, tells them to go ahead without him. His son gets mad at him, telling him he knows he will not return, but Perhan leaves (Cross my gypsy heart), promising to buy him a present - but instead goes back to Ahmed's house to make him pay. Using his telekinetic powers, he kills Ahmed with a fork, but the bride Ahmed was just getting married to, shoots him.The movie ends with Perhan's funeral, and Perhan Jr. taking the coins off his dead father's eyes, and running away.Watching this movie was a mesmerizing escape into another world. It is a dark and harsh reality, full of poverty and crime, and people trying to survive - but it is contrasted by the believes and dreams, and magic, of its characters.

It takes you into another time and space, and lets you forget about your daily life, captivating you in the story of those beautiful yet tragic characters.

He grows up living with his old grandmother and handicapped younger sister - his mother died when giving birth to him, and his father is unknown (he was a Slovenian soldier who had an affair with his mother).

This review will not focus on the positive and negative things, big and little; there are plenty of other reviews here that will do that. This is a professed Star Wars fan's initial reaction from over a decade ago when I saw it, that hasn't much changed since.The original film was the VERY FIRST film I ever saw when it was first out in theatres. I was a mere nine months old, but my parents said I loved it. Like everyone else who grew-up on Star Wars, I was also caught-up in the hype and would have severed a (minor) appendage in order to see it first. So on opening day, I went to see it after work with some like-minded friends.I remember the movie was something like thirty minutes in (somewhere around the underwater Gungan scene) and I was thinking, When is this thing really gonna start? By this point in the originals, the sand people were causing havoc, Imperial Walkers were about to start something in the snow and Luke was escaping the ultimate monster in the basement.Maybe because this is the beginning of the whole saga, the pieces have to be set-up first, I remember thinking. Okay, I'll give it time.Then we got to the pod race almost half-way through the movie. Now we're talking! I thought, THIS is Star Wars! And it was truly breathtaking. It lived up to what Star Wars had been before, but it didn't last long. The story moves soon after to Courescant and devolved into C-SPAN. Political maneuvering, Anakain's college acceptance interview, blah...blah...blah...Then there was the ending. Everything felt forced, except for the lightsabre duel. Between this and the pod race, it made the movie. The pure physicality of it made me tingle. But yet even here, there was something missing; tension. Here were two jedi squaring off against a really cool bad guy, Darth Maul. This guy was the Boba Fett of the prequel trilogy; cool baddie, too little screen time. We all knew that Obi Wan was gonna live, so that released some of the tension, but that wasn't quite it. In the original, we had Obi Wan vs. Vader; former teacher taking on his old student and dying in the process. In Empire we had Luke avenging his fallen buddy and in Jedi it was the re-match, now knowing the family connection. In Menace, it was like the interstellar Don King had just made a match, they combatants showed up and cameras rolled. It was a sight to see, but the tension created by emotion just wasn't there.The movie ended and we left the theatre. I felt strangely numb to it all. Maybe it was me? I speculated. Maybe I'm on an off day? Maybe the hype prepared me for more than this could ever truly deliver? Maybe. But as we were all walking out, these were guys 'n gals that loved Star Wars like I had. We looked forward to this like Christmas morning, yet Santa Lucas brought us socks. Bulky, itchy socks. But we had to act like we loved it, lest we be run out of town.Each of us went to see it again in the days following, but went alone. Each of us. We all felt the same way, but wouldn't admit it to one another until a few weeks later. One of us bravely asked the rest if we MAYBE didn't really like the movie all that much. Episode I became the highest grossing movie of the year and with the entire saga and is one of the most financially successful movies ever made. Know why? Everybody had to see it multiple times just to know for sure that the reason it wasn't so good wasn't because of our over-hyped nostalgia.The bottom line is this; its not a bad film. Its not a great film, but it is entertaining and quite a spectacle. It does not, by a long shot, live up to the standard set by the original trilogy. Could it ever? That is a good question and up for debate. But when Episode III came out, that was the one that I had waited since the new films were announced to see. I consider it to be the third best of the entire saga, better than Jedi. So the excuse that the new films could not live up to the original I feel is not true.

Both the characters and the background and environments of the movie are pretty good looking. It's certainly not one of those cheap and simplistic animated movies. You could tell lots of time and effort got put in this movie, unfortunately it did not all work out that well. The story- and character development, the music, the songs, its overall message. It's all still really lacking, which makes this a movie you could easily do without.Really not a bad animated movie but it still has far too many weak points in it to considerer this a recommendable one.6\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"10 February 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a beautiful and touching movie!It shows three estranged sisters who come together when one of them is dying of cancer. The other two sisters struggle to comfort her, trying to overcome their differences and the fact that they had grown apart. Their relationship and being together is very awkward, and it is only their maid, Anna, who is able to comfort Agnes and truly embrace and mourn her death. After her death, Agnes shortly returns as a ghost and reveals that all she wishes from her family is love and care, but flashbacks of the family members reveal the problems each one of them is dealing with, which tragically make it impossible for them to really come closer. Maria, the youngest, remembers her failed marriage; Agnes remembers how she was envious of her youngest sister to be so close to their mother while she remained distant to her; and Karin struggles with the memory of a dysfunctional marriage and self-harm.While being together, the sisters do not manage to get past their conflicts with each other, and though they each reveal that they would love to be closer to each other, their differences and pasts in a way only move them further away from each other with every failed attempt. The tragic moment at the end is when we get to hear what Agnes wrote in her diary that having her sisters with her is happiness, and she couldn't wish for anything better; that she feels profoundly grateful to her life.This movie is heartbreaking in its portrait of the life of three sisters each of them has experienced so much pain, and there is so much regret between them - but they never talk about it, all those feelings remain unsaid between them, and therefor so much that they secretly long for remains undone.For me, the beauty of this movie was also the depiction and story of the three sisters. Each character in this beautiful movie has a different personality, as can be found in every single family. Agnes longed for a closer relationship to her mother but had to watch her youngest sister get the affection of their mother that she longed for when she was small. Now she is in agony, and this is only intensified by her faltering attempts at reconciling her sisters. Maria is the more bubbly character in the family, it is easier for her to express herself, but she is very emotional, and also indecisive. My favorite character is Karin. She is portrayed as a very strong and rather cold and repressed woman, not saying what she feels very easily. She is very detached and one feels like she is putting up a lot of defenses. She may come across as the most unlikeable of the three sisters, the least loving. But throughout the movie, we learn to understand that she is not cold at all. In fact, she longs to be touched. But she cannot handle physical contact, because she was deeply hurt and she went through a lot, she was so deeply hurt that she did self-harm. Karin was my favorite character in the movie. We have a lot of similarities, and I could find myself in her the most finding it hard to express one's feelings; craving to open up to someone and allowing someone to come closer, but having been too hurt and being scared of being hurt again - in a way - finding it hard to trust anybody after having been hurt by somebody one trusted; and using self-harm as a way of expressing what one couldn't say&#x85;This movie is a beautiful depiction of what you really find in a family. It is no glorification of family, but maybe in fact the bare and naked truth dysfunctional relationships and the pain that comes with it, and the regret that comes with not saying things you would have loved to say, that maybe could have changed things.A truly deep and moving, beautiful movie!

The story is told in flash back and tells of a time some time after the events of the previous film; we hear how the Earth has been ravaged by war and its cities destroyed by nuclear weapons. In the country a group of apes and humans live together under the rule of the wise chimpanzee Caesar. There is some dissent however; a gorilla called General Aldo is not happy that they are living with humans and believes that as the soldiers the gorillas should rule. Caesar doesn't see him as a threat and till MacDonald; one of the humans tells him about recordings of his parents which tell of how ape society destroyed itself and the world in the future. To learn more Caesar, MacDonald and an Orang-utan named Virgil return to the city to see the recordings. In the city they meet a group of humans and are lucky to escape alive. The humans believe the apes pose a threat so follow them back to Ape City with the intention of wiping them out; what follows will determine the future of civilisation on the planet.The plot of the story wasn't bad but the way it was told was not up to the standards of the previous films; to be honest it felt more like a cheaply made television film rather than the final instalment of a once fine film franchise. The Ape City could more accurately be described as an Ape Village and the numbers involved in the final battle made it look more like a minor skirmish. The antagonists were very much pantomime villains; Aldo was flagged as a bad guy from his first scene where he doesn't want to learn to write and carries on that way right up until he breaks their primary law regarding apes never killing other apes. The humans from the city are if anything even worse. The acting was adequate but not up to the standard of the earlier films; even from people who had appeared in those.

Box-office really didn't hit any records here in the U.S.-of course that year we had 'Aliens','Ferris Bueller', just to name a few classic megahits being released on top of each other. The film begins with a beautiful yet haunting shot of a man on a crucifix washing over and down gigantic waterfall. This is what we come to learn is a ritual for the dead held by the native Indians in South America circa 18th century. The dead man is one of their local missionaires who try to teach and bring religion to the local natives rather than hunt or enslave them which was what wonderful people of moneys would do at the time. With Ennio Morricone's amazing music we're introduced to the new priest that will be his replacement sent to the natives to continue the Church's Mission to humanize the indians. This is one of the major plot points and arguments the movie holds throughout with elegance. The sub-plot is actually the character of Mendoza (wonderfully played by De Niro) whose fall from grace after murdering his brother (that's right it's Aidan Quin as his brother) who was having an affair with Medoza's wife. At this point the film's redemption tale begins where Mendoza will have to choose which path he will have to take to feel the power of God. The Spanish and Portugese Armies come hammering down in on the natives with only the brotherhood to help. I know people feel the ending is a big downer but the message is so powerful that you have to look past the violence against humanity and see that the two heroes of the story never gave in.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"10 February 2012","score":"","review":" Just think of all the conventions it gets in, and skewers the one-track mind male (Harry); the sensitive and practical female, repulsed yet intrigued by said male (Sally); the emotionally unsettled mistress playing the field (Carrie Fisher, who keeps an index card file of available men); the live-ins who can't commit (Sally and her ex-boyfriend); women's concern with middle age and their biological clock (I'm gonna be 40, weeps Sally. When? asks Harry. Someday.); the male's tendency to skip out after making love; the horror and unpredictability of blind dates; and, in a scene which is almost passe to mention anymore, women's ability to fake orgasm. The way this film jumps from one familiar convention to another would be embarrassing if it weren't for the fact that each one is handled with such economy, humor and grace.Billy Crystal acquits himself well as Harry - predictably, perhaps, as it's a part tailor made for a standup comedian. Still, seeing him in this after years of half-baked movies and fawning Oscar presentations, it's a revelation how glib and unlikable he can allow himself to be . . . and *still* be likable. Yo, Billy, if you're listening out there try incorporating some of Harry's darker shadings and more egocentric traits into your future roles; it gives you a more complete palette to work from and keeps you from being too generic and schticky. And your charm and humor will always shine through anyway.If Billy needs to edge a little bit closer back to Harry, though, Meg Ryan needs to get Sally completely out of her system.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"10 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have always loved the conclusion of Roger Ebert's review It is a movie about adults, whose lives have dignity and whose choices matter to them. And it is also one hell of a thriller. Indeed, Peter Weir's Witness appeals on a primal basis as a thriller, and a great one while the romance and the immersion into the Amish community are only one of these layers that convey the comfortable feeling that we're watching something different.Cinema is sometimes like cooking, with the same ingredients, you can either make a delightfully exquisite plate or a vulgar sandwich and what makes Witness great is that it brings to the screen something new by using familiar elements. The hero is John Book, a man who has neither the physical super strength, nor the cynical detachment of the typical leading cop, yet he manages to appeal because he exudes a sense of dignity, of competence, and attachment to his line of duty, without falling in any stereotypical trap. This has something to do with Harrison Ford's performance, a subtle and powerful incarnation of a character who, more than anything, is profoundly human and doesn't try to be an archetype. With such a solid character, Witness already gains our heart.But a character doesn't make a film, the plot also is a masterstroke of simplicity and genius. It opens with Rachel, a young Amish widow played by Kelly McGillis, and her young 8-year old son, Samuel, the young Lukas Haas. Coming back from a family visit, little Samuel witnesses a horrific murder in the toilets of Philadelphia's train station. A gentle-looking man carrying a notebook, is killed by two others, one of them is the fierce looking Danny Glover as officer McFee. What follows is intense and suspenseful on a Hitchcockian level, as it uses a clever trick to make Samuel miraculously escape from the menace of Glover's character. Twenty years ago, I was shocked by the slashing, but it was the convincing sign about McFee's mercilessness, no doubt a little kid wouldn't discourage them for a bonus murder.The toilet scene alone illustrates the symbiosis between the engaging atmosphere of the film and its intelligent writing, winning Oscars over masterpieces of originality such as The Purple Rose of Cairo or Back to the Future. After the murder, Book questions the kid and tries to get the maximum of information. The film could have contented its audience with Samuel saying that the man was black like Book's partner, and a big guy, not a 'schtumpig', then Book would have deducted that McFee was the one; I don't think it would even have been perceived as lazy writing. But the film offers us one of the most memorable silent tracking shots when Samuel is slowly pacing through the police office and then pauses when he recognizes McFee's face in a newspaper. Then, there's something in Ford's look where he sees what he sees, and think what he thinks, the moment when Samuel points his finger is pure genius.Book quickly understands that poor Samuel is a more important witness, that McFee killed a cop who was getting some seriously damaging elements for his career, after sharing this information with his superior Chief Paul Schaeffer (Josef Somer), Book is coincidentally confronted with McFee, and nearly escape from an attack. With enough to time to take the boy and his mother to the Amish Camp, Book finally faints from the loss of blood due to a bullet wound, and must be cured by the Amish. The film then plunge us into the austere and respectable Amish community, with enough patience to develop the relationship between Rachel and John, and Book's progressive integration, undermined in a few instances, all extremely memorable, when John and Rachel dance together, their unforgettable frenetic kiss under the rain, when she shows her body naked to her and of course, one of the most satisfying punches in the face when a young tourist prick gets his comeuppance.If a great movie features at least three great scenes, with the punch it makes three with the killing and the recognition of the killer, yet they're not even the highlights of the films. It's also interesting to note that this scene isn't gratuitous and will be the pivotal moment that brings the attention of Schaeffer and the two other corrupt cops. By acting according to his principle, Book makes the confrontation finally possible, a necessary mistake because somehow, he couldn't hide forever, that's against his nature, his sense of dignity. Not a hero, not a cop, he's also man, and it's interesting how the film uses Ford's notorious carpenter's talent for the rising barn scene, as it really enriches his character by portraying him as a man with other talents than using guns.It's indeed without a weapon that John manages to escape and finally defeat the three cops coming to him, in an unforgettable climactic scene where, another surprise, the bad villain receives an instant and quick death while the most horrifying and painful was reserved for a sidekick in one of these scenes that are impossible to erase from memory, the silo death where the villain receives tons of corn on his head. It was so beautifully shot that I really felt like he was suffocating and coughing snots and blood. No room for clichés till the end where finally Schaefer is forced to leave his gun, after facing a whole community of Amish standing for Book, the film is beyond the eternal hero vs. villain shootout, this is the kind of maturity and confidence that deserves respect.So many memorable scenes to list them all, a dazzling cinematography and gripping atmosphere Witness is a heart-pounding experience on many levels, that I never forgot since I was 10? If only because it taught me something about the Amish community, and I can't conclude without quoting Ebert again, yes, it's one hell of a thriller.

In my film class, we had learned that Bergman used red in this film to be representative of the human soul.

It was as if their surroundings were a representation of what they felt inside, and I believe it is true because of the theme of touch in this movie. There is so much giving in the form of touch and it is such an outside form of giving a part of your soul to your surroundings, that we are allowed to understand much more how the sister's surroundings are linked to their souls.

We had learned in mu film class that Bergman wanted his actors to understand his characters' feelings, not show what they thought the character would look like from what they felt.

So don't look for Lawrence but rather a violent but principled Sancho Panza and you will enjoy the film.British,Japanese and Borneo as a battleground works as well as any other setting from WW11 and less done to boot.Fine acting by Nigel Havers as a Lawrence type,Capt. Fairbourne really complements Nolte as this American deserter from Corregidor survivors after being beached on Borneo and seeing the soldiers he escaped with die.He then survives in the jungle only to be captured by headhunters,and here's the romance,is loved by a native and he thus learns there way and becomes freeto lead his comanchesas KING !!!Great stuff if not for that damned old war !!! The darker issue of re-colonizing after the war is also delved into although not as much as one might wish.Do yourself a favor and see it,for they really don't make um like this anymore.

The screenplay for this USA-England co-production which premiered at the 53rd Venice Film Festival in 1996, was written by Australian screenwriter Laura Jones. It tells the story about Isabel Archer, an independent woman from New York who after the death of her father visits her aunt Lydia and her wealthy uncle Daniel Tuchett at his estate near London. During her stay she socializes with an elder woman named Madame Serena Merle and some young men who one by one asks her for her hand in marriage. When Isabel's uncle dies, she inherits large parts of his estate and decides to travel the continent. In Florence she encounters an American expatriate named Gilbert Osmond who charms her with his knowledge and articulacy. Though having declined several proposals of marriage due to her ideals, Isabel agrees to marry Gilbert and starts a new life with him and his young daughter Pansy in Rome.This visually notable and dialog-driven period piece from the mid-1990s which draws ardent milieu depictions, is a detailed study of character about an 18th century feminist protagonist, driven by her personal choices, who seeks out and confronts her destiny while trying to maintain her integrity, but finds herself the victim of a deceitful and manipulative conspiracy. Jane Campion's second adaptation of previously written material is more of an in-depth and atmospheric character drama about a woman who is torn between her values and desires than a passionately romantic love story like The Piano (1993). Shot in England, USA, Turkey, Italy and Australia and acutely and distinctly directed by the brilliant filmmaker Jane Campion who has created several remarkable female character portraits since her feature film debut Sweetie (1989), this subtly narrated fictional tale is beautifully photographed by English-born New Zealand cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh. This lyrical epic which focuses on themes such as independence, freedom, love and betrayal, is distinguished by the prominent production and costume design by the director's frequent collaborator Janet Patterson and has a fine score by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar which reinforces the shifting atmosphere. Nicole Kidman, John Malkovich and Barbara Hershey delivers fine acting performances in this historical costume drama which gained, among other awards, the Pasinetti Award for Best Film at the 53rd Venice International Film Festival in 1996 and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress Barbara Hershey and Best Costume Design Janet Patterson at the 69th Academy Awards in 1997.

Most of his films have fairly slow paces which can sometimes be enjoyable and can other times be challenging; however, my initial reaction to the pace of this film was incredibly tedious, boring, and *really* tried my patience to the point where it was not an enjoyable experience in any way. So, I watched the whole thing, went to bed, then watched it the next night after reading a bit of historical context into Buffalo Bill. It helped a *great* deal with the multi-tasking of following some the historical context of what was said in the film while simultaneously enjoying the individual subtleties of the cast's improvisation. The eclectic cast is really wonderful even at their most subtle as in most Altman's films. I particularly enjoyed Will Sampson, Geraldine Chaplin (my favourite role of her's here), Burt Lancaster, and, of course, Paul Newman...even Harvey Keitel was great. If anything, one should take in the cast of this film and I encourage anyone to do a Google search of some kind just to get a bit of historical context of Buffalo Bill before watching, as I did, if you don't know too much. Certainly, by no means, is this film up to par with other Altman masterpieces like 3 Women, but worth two viewings if you are interested in seeing most of his films.
