Anyone who has ever taken acid, read Philip K.

I laughed out loud at this film, just because it was so outrageous and so spot-on. This film is great. This film is cool. It is better than the Matrix, by a long shot (I didn't fall asleep in Existenz, for a kick off action\/special effects films bore me stupid, and despite a plausible philosophical gloss, that is exactly what the Matrix is). Existenz is gross, it is disturbing, and it is funny. David Cronenberg has done some shonky stuff (Rabid) and some works of genius too (Videodrome is another one worth checking out, as is Stephen King adaptation The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favourites. I can't remember the ending- which is a good thing, cos it means I can watch it again. Or perhaps I never watched this film at all. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe it 'really' happened to me. I don't know. At any rate, it is now seamlessly stitched into my overall illusion of reality, and I'm glad.

It was the first movie since Jurassic Park to totally take me out of my stiff theater seat and transport me into a place of pure magic. Right from the opening scene with the Jedi taking control of the situation and putting their lightsabers to good use, I knew I was in for it. I think this episode is a constant joy, constant magic and excitement, and it has it's fair share of mystery and emotion too. It's an all around great film, and a great Star Wars film - and I honestly - ESPECIALLY now, don't think Lucas could of started the story off any better. People complain about it being kid friendly and overly happy and all that, but it's mainly for contrast reasons - it's the whole point. I expected the galaxy to be a more happier and lush place, I expected a more lighthearted atmosphere, ...and that's what it gave. It's the Pride Lands before Scar (the Empire) takes over. You can't introduce a world that's going to fall apart and be shrouded in darkness, in a six part saga no less, all dark and creepy right off the bat; where would the emotion come from when everything actually does go to hell? Exactly, It'd be nonexistent.That subject aside, I have to go against the majority when it comes to this movie. I'm as dazzled, amazed, moved, and awed by the atmosphere as I watch this movie as I am with the others. In some cases, more so. Ridiculous? If you call me that, I can't stop you. I'm just enhancing the idea of how much I in fact like Menace as the start of this treasure of a saga.One of the main reasons why I wasn't disappointed came from plain logic I knew before Episode I came out that we'd get a lighter film, with a lot of exposition and slow pace setting up the saga. It was pretty obvious to me that that's what we'd get in Episode I. We wouldn't get another Empire Strikes Back or a Jedi - we'd get a starting point of a six part story that acts as a set up. I walked out of Menace thoroughly satisfied while people next to me asked From Empire to this ? That's just missing the point. I'll say it bluntly A majority of people totally, and still are, missing the point. That's why Menace is so blasted. No kidding it's not like Empire, no kidding it's not like the originals. I mean it is, where it counts - humor, action, and style and everything that makes Star Wars so fun - but again Menace isn't a hardcore dive into the fast moving meat of the story like Empire and Jedi are, along with Revenge of the Sith. This is why Sith so favored. People are like ohhh this is what should of been the first time!. Sorry, but no. You don't start a six part story off like a bat out of hell immediately getting to the things that people really want to see. Everything Menace offered, while bashed, were extremely necessary and Sith wouldn't of been half the finally, Star Wars is back in full swing movie if it wasn't for this so called inferior and lame film. I just don't think people understand how it is you should start an epic story properly. This is why I put Menace proudly next to the latter films and call it a perfectly told saga.On the subject of the often bashed Jake Lloyd, you know, it may come as no surprise but I thought he did great. Again, it's all about contrast. This movie needed to establish that Vader was once just... a pure innocent child like anyone else. That alone is very emotional to me. He was a complete 180. It much relates to serial killers. They didn't start off as evil monsters, but were more so made that way, and also made some very bad decisions. I thought Jake nailed Anakin as Lucas intended the character to be at this stage. Sure, things like Now this is podracing! cannot be done well ...by anyone; however I know where Lucas was going with this kind of thing. Even so, you won't hear me say everything Lucas writes is perfect. However, when we're treated to each and every conversation between Qui Gon Jinn and Shmi or and Anakin and Shmi ...perfect is a word you'll hear me utter tons. The conversations in this movie are fantastic. Much like Prisoner of Azkaban, some of this episode's strongest moments come out of simple conversation, and of course both films scenes are both aided by the masterful John Williams. The scene where Anakin runs back to his mother as he's about to leave to become a Jedi is one of the most powerful and heart wrenching moments in the entire saga, not to mention the utter brutality of emotion to follow just seconds later. After seeing Episode II, and soon Revenge of the Sith, this scene will be unbearable. Phantom Menace lacks emotion? What a gravely mistaken statement.To conclude my newest review, I think it's a complete triumph of imagination and superior storytelling. It's treated so unfairly that it's just amusing to me more than anything else.5\/5 out of a solid 5\/5 saga.

This film did not disappoint me in that regard.For those who would compare Tombstone to this film, I say they are two completely different stories, as is obvious from their titles! Tombstone is the story of the shootout in Tombstone, with most of the action and plot development centering around those few seconds in history. It is an enjoyable and entirely watchable movie, but is more about how good Kurt Russell,Val Kilmer, and Sam Elliot look in those long black coats and black pants.It is a Hollywood version, portraying Wyatt Earp as what we would like our heroes to be.Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp on the other hand is a movie about exactly what it purports to be--the life and character of the man. It tells his whole story until 17 years after the events at the OK Corral. And I have to say it is a very good characterization. I really liked that besides being MUCH more historically correct than Tombstone, Costner's Earp was a flawed hero--if even a hero at all. The incidents in Earp's early life that were less than heroic, and in fact downright illegal were related without varnish. It was made clear to me in this film that Earp was a shady character and a rough customer in many ways--not a larger-than-life good guy.The film even portrayed the fact (well-documented in history) that his sister-in-law and others in the family thought Wyatt could be an arrogant, cold bastard sometimes! The genesis of the love affair between Josie Marcus and Wyatt Earp was told in a much more realistic and much less romantic light. They cheated--she on John Behan, he on the woman he had considered his wife. Even the possibility that the historical portrait of Earp's common-law wife Mattie as a pathetic dope-fiend arose after the fact, to let Earp and his lover off the hook, and to foster the good guy myth, is touched on in this version.I did not watch this movie in the theater, and might have found the length a little hard to bear in that setting, but on DVD, I had no problem remaining riveted to the story as it unfolded. It is an epic version of the important events in Earp's life that shaped the man, and should not be confused or compared with other movies (no matter how great!) that center on 15 seconds in history.Tombstone vs. Wyatt Earp---why not watch them both?

They cheated--she on John Behan, he on the woman he had considered his wife. Even the possibility that the historical portrait of Earp's common-law wife Mattie as a pathetic dope-fiend arose after the fact, to let Earp and his lover off the hook, and to foster the good guy myth, is touched on in this version.I did not watch this movie in the theater, and might have found the length a little hard to bear in that setting, but on DVD, I had no problem remaining riveted to the story as it unfolded. It is an epic version of the important events in Earp's life that shaped the man, and should not be confused or compared with other movies (no matter how great!) that center on 15 seconds in history.Tombstone vs. Wyatt Earp---why not watch them both? Just don't simplistically expect the same things from them, as clearly stated by the titles, they are two different stories.

It had so many WONDERFUL elements but the overall package was hopelessly baffling because it appeared as if the writers had no idea WHAT type of film they wanted to make. At first, the movie seemed quirky and comical when one of the characters imagined seeing grandma getting up out of the coffin during her own funeral while the statue of Jesus comes to life. I was excited, because I like surreal movies like Happiness of Katakuris or Raising Arizona. BUT, just as quickly as these images came, the movie completely changed direction. This sort of thing happened again and again in the movie--as if the film had eight different writers who combined their stories without creating decent segues to join the stories. Comedy, philosophy (not the fun type--the life is futile and then you die type), sex, love, lesbianism, anti-church rhetoric, ultra-feminism, child prodigy stuff, sexual abuse, murder, etc., etc. all thrown together do not make ONE coherent film but either many separate movies or one big mess. How this film got the Oscar for Best Foreign Picture, I am uncertain, as it had too many holes and left me so unsatisfied. Perhaps it was a slow year. Or, perhaps AMPAS (the Oscar people) just have contempt for traditional morality and so they are rewarding this film for its stand against traditional values. A final note although these many story elements are perfectly acceptable for adult fair, this is NOT a film for kids as the subject matter is VERY mature. Also, I was deeply disturbed by the families portrayed in the film because apparently, NOTHING was private or adult in this extended home. Two examples come to mind the one scene where EVERYONE is making love like sex-crazed weasels so loudly that the little girl yelled at them to be quiet so she could get to sleep AND the scene where this same person (now an adult) is debating whether or not to have an abortion--while each child in the family tells her their opinion! This is sick and the family demonstrates a complete lack of reasonable boundaries. I'm not suggesting adults need to be prudes, but the idea of putting kids in these situations seems abusive and disturbing. If these types of situations are thrust on kids, what's next--showing them step-by-step photos of a prostate exam?

Once the basic premise was set up -- 4 concubines who fight over their shared husband -- the story was a fairly straightforward woman vs. woman in-fighting tale that could have been set in any era at any time.Unfortunately, unlike Anne of Green Gables, or Anna and the King, which has plenty of nasty people but a protagonist you can root for, Raise the Red Lantern didn't present an interesting protagonist. Mostly the leading woman blows up at people and takes self-destructive actions or lets them happen rather than moving the plot forward.

On the run from the law, he teams up with a buddy\/co-worker of his played by Keith David & together they arm themselves with grenades & guns of all kinds & together they become outlaws, picking off aliens by the dozens. While attempting to expose the aliens true faces & hidden agendas, in an effort for society to fight back & reclaim this world from the invaders. Based on a short story from the early sixties, director JOHN CARPENTER has updated the story to modern day & seems to have had a ball in writing the script & it's not hard to see why, THEY LIVE is arguably one of John's top five best films! Carpenter seems to revel in poking his salty finger into they eye of the ruling class, especially those of the Regan era & makes several points of interest regarding the ruling class treatment over the poor & less fortunate (In fact the very next year B movie horror director BRIAN YUZNA would explore a similar avenue with his 1989 splatter effort SOCIETY) several times throughout the film & in particular during it's opening credits, Carpenter presents to us a city over filled with street people & the unemployed & struggling lower class people, who flood the unemployment offices looking for work, while the rich & powerful live it up in their high class lifestyle, attend conferences, talk about the stock market, chat in fancy restaurants etc. In a way, it's kind of an interesting action movie take on INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, it's not exactly a new idea, but it is done with an enjoyable twist. The idea is kind of humorous though, as Carpenters hero is given a glimpse of the real world & that it's really black & white & all the aliens have done is colourized it for us. The film shifts gears about midway, dropping the political satire & sci-fi angle for a straight up shoot-em up action film, with aliens taking the place of the usual human bad guys. RODDY PIPER is a likable hero & plays NADA well & this is arguably Piper's best film, he's both fun & funny & really makes his character interesting. In fact, one can almost relate his character to that of Snake Plissken in Carpenters ESCAPE FROM NEWYORK\/L.A. & Destination Willams from the directors mediocre, GHOST OF MARS, both are loners, & both by each films end, help expose & bring down a corrupt system & that's another thing I liked about the ending, it leaves it wide open for fans who have seen it, to draw their own conclusion on how things would go now that the alien race has been exposed & the public will realize that they have been had, will a war break out between man & alien? will man win the war & reclaim society yet again? or have the aliens truly conquered mankind with their technology, to the point they are fully able to take control of man & enslave him? The ending itself with the death of the hero's is awfully downbeat after such a fun ride & MEG FOSTER all though performing well as a middle class woman caught up in the madness & who befriends Nada, is wasted in a role that could so easily have been written out, since her character has only fifteen minutes of screen time & barely fits the story at all, since there is no time to really bring her character into the films main plot, since she arrives midway in the film for ten minutes, before showing up in the final five minutes. There was no time for her & Piper's character to really interact & flesh out the idea of a possible romance that was gelling between the two. Well acted & directed, with great stunts & some pretty good action sequences, THEY LIVE is deserving of it's high praise & cult status. Good make-up effects with the aliens as well.

The ending itself with the death of the hero's is awfully downbeat after such a fun ride & MEG FOSTER all though performing well as a middle class woman caught up in the madness & who befriends Nada, is wasted in a role that could so easily have been written out, since her character has only fifteen minutes of screen time & barely fits the story at all, since there is no time to really bring her character into the films main plot, since she arrives midway in the film for ten minutes, before showing up in the final five minutes. There was no time for her & Piper's character to really interact & flesh out the idea of a possible romance that was gelling between the two. Well acted & directed, with great stunts & some pretty good action sequences, THEY LIVE is deserving of it's high praise & cult status. Good make-up effects with the aliens as well. Highly recommended to fans of the genre!**** stars ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"16 September 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Then WWF superstar ROWDY RODDY PIPER, stars as an out of work, drifter named JOHN NADA, who caught up during a police raid one night on an abandon church housing a small group of revolutionaries, discovers a pair of sunglasses that the group is manufacturing, confused over why they were so overprotective & secretive about them, he soon learns upon putting them on, that these are no ordinary glasses, but rather a pair of special specs that allows one to see the ruling class for what they truly are, Aliens in disguise! who use subliminal messages seen on billboard, TV & radio or anything for that matter that carries any kind of slogan to control the thoughts of lives of others, completely enslaving the population into mindlessly obeying & consuming the products they offer. On the run from the law, he teams up with a buddy\/co-worker of his played by Keith David & together they arm themselves with grenades & guns of all kinds & together they become outlaws, picking off aliens by the dozens. While attempting to expose the aliens true faces & hidden agendas, in an effort for society to fight back & reclaim this world from the invaders. Based on a short story from the early sixties, director JOHN CARPENTER has updated the story to modern day & seems to have had a ball in writing the script & it's not hard to see why, THEY LIVE is arguably one of John's top five best films! Carpenter seems to revel in poking his salty finger into they eye of the ruling class, especially those of the Regan era & makes several points of interest regarding the ruling class treatment over the poor & less fortunate (In fact the very next year B movie horror director BRIAN YUZNA would explore a similar avenue with his 1989 splatter effort SOCIETY) several times throughout the film & in particular during it's opening credits, Carpenter presents to us a city over filled with street people & the unemployed & struggling lower class people, who flood the unemployment offices looking for work, while the rich & powerful live it up in their high class lifestyle, attend conferences, talk about the stock market, chat in fancy restaurants etc. In a way, it's kind of an interesting action movie take on INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, it's not exactly a new idea, but it is done with an enjoyable twist. The idea is kind of humorous though, as Carpenters hero is given a glimpse of the real world & that it's really black & white & all the aliens have done is colourized it for us. The film shifts gears about midway, dropping the political satire & sci-fi angle for a straight up shoot-em up action film, with aliens taking the place of the usual human bad guys.

No, seriously, this is a great movie, even through many re watchings. I loved the soundtrack, I loved the sets and scenery, I loved the action choreography, I loved the costumes and makeup--you could almost smell the sweaty men! It never fails to make me cry, either.I also loved the story, and I have to, regrettably, emphasize the term story. There has been so much acclaim for this movie, and it is so universally loved, that it borders on sacrilege to question anything about it. It is undoubtedly one of the most watchable film epics ever made. Mel Gibson really knows how to take a storyline and morph it into a totally absorbing and memorable film experience. I left the theater crying over the loves won and lost, yet exalted by the sheer heroism and hope the character engendered, even in death. It made me want to yell with Mel,Albanach go bragh! (Scotland forever!) Having gushed over everything from the look, the sound, the feel,and the virtual smell of the movie,I still have to question just a couple of things. I realize that the screenplay takes a lot of liberties with the historical facts, and to be honest, the historical facts are mostly shrouded in mystery.Yet, I can't help but wonder why the facts had to be distorted SO much in the name of success at the box office. If in the story, Wallace needed a love interest after his wife died, why did they choose the real historical figure of Princess Isabella of France, yet place her in England and involved with Wallace at the time she was only about 9 years old, still in France, and not even yet married to the Prince of Wales, Edward II? The romantic plot device of her illicit pregnancy with Wallace's child, and her subsequent revelation of it to King Edward I on his death bed is complete historical nonsense! Good Ol' Longshanks lived on after Wallace's execution for several more years--and I think genealogists would be quite surprised to know that the child who was to become Edward III was sired by a Scottish rebel who had been executed years before Princess (later Queen) Isabella was probably even fertile!!! Oh well! Despite these flaws in historical accuracy, it is still an extremely satisfying movie experience. And besides, I realize I am probably in the minority in even caring about the historical facts.The obvious fact is that Gibson has taken an obscure Scottish hero, and a period in history, and brought them to life for many who probably never would have heard of William Wallace otherwise. If he has sparked interest and further study on the topic through his film,wonderful. If not, he has without doubt entertained us and touched us with this version of Wallace's story.
