The movie Shrek, is about a ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) who everyone thinks he is ugly and mean. Until one day when he met Donkey (Eddie Murphy) who liked him a lot and didn't care whether Shrek was ugly or not! So then these fairy tale characters come on Shrek's property by Lord Farquad. So then when Shrek and Donkey go to talk him, Farquad then sent him to go rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). So then when Shrek finds out that Fiona is in love with Shrek, Shrek goes to stop her from marrying Farquad, who just wanted to marry her just to become king. So then Shrek and Fiona are now married! I thought the entire movie was just fantastic, hilarious and enjoyable for people of all ages.BOTTOM LINE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY GOOD!
