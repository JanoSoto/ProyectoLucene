[{"date":"3 December 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Election has gotten the praise of many and it is all deserved. Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein, and Mark Harelik all give great performances. Alexander Payne's direction is great, Jim Taylor and Payne's screenplay is near perfection.They portray these essential losers and all around shallow individuals to a perfect t.Reese Witherspoon is Tracy Flick the Miss Good Girl who is extremely smart, hard working, and knows who to sleep with.Chris Klein plays Paul Metzler and he is, well, he is good natured, but he lives in la la land and is a complete moron. And he stole his sisters girlfriend. Weird family.Matthew Broderick is Jim McAllister. Well, he is the most screwed up of them all. He has a good life. He has a good job, loving wife, and all that good stuff. Sure it is a little dull but most everyone's life is a little dull. But he isn't pleased with good. So he throws his life away. He is bitter and resentful, even if he is right. He is Kevin Spacy's character in American Beauty minus the balls.And this movie circles around them and a few other losers. It follows them through the school election for class president.As we watch this dark comedy and laugh at all these miserable beings destroy their lives and\/or those around them, I can't help but wonder if that is healthy.Anyway, I think Election is a good movie. But I just didn't enjoy it. I liked no one and perhaps that is the point. Unlike Rushmore I couldn't look and see something redeemable about these people, nothing for me to at the very least like them in some small way.So, I give Election a 6.5. It gets 5 points just for the talent of it but only a 1.5 for entertainment. But most fans of dark comedy will like this, I just got bored to be perfectly honest.
