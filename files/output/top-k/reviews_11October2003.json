Sofia Coppola is the first.In all three, the story plays a role, but never the central role any more than what you eat  has to do with why you are alive. Each of us as watchers have a similar choice to make, a  choice that determines our lives in film.Our man Roman has decided to take the third way. If he was starting when his father did,  the `third way' filmmakers would be the French New Wave guys, plus the early Fellini.  Except for the genius Kubrick, who in 1968 made a film set in and called `2001' that was  itself a third way film, and which concerned the battle among the three ways.Kubrick's three `ways` are three completely independent cosmologies who tussle for  control over the film the humans, the machines, and some undefined supernatural  consciousnesses. It is a masterpiece of self-reference.Now along comes Roman and makes a film in 2001, set in 1968 about a science fiction  film. It deals with the same three agents, this time as discrete films the human diary of  Paul, the scifi film and the wrapper film.That scifi film stands for the style piece.

The role seems to be perfect for Carrey, who is famous for being the `rubber-faced' comedian of Hollywood.  In his true breakout role, Carrey plays bank teller Stanley Ipkiss.  We all know people like this so friendly and nice that they become nothing but doormats&#133; and then are too nice to even ask us to stop.  However, after being tossed out of a nightclub one night (and being humiliated in front of his dream girl, played by Cameron Diaz), he finds a mysterious mask floating in the river.  It may seem like an ordinary mask for now, but when Ipkiss puts it on, his inner-self is released.  Finally, he's able to be as free-spirited and cartoon-like as he's always dreamed (we learn early on he's a huge cartoon fan).  He now has the power to do whatever he wanted&#133; but not before taking some revenge on those who make him miserable.     I watch this movie for two main characters Ipkiss and his faithful dog Milo.  When the Mask is on the screen, the audience cheers.  When Milo is on the screen, they cheer even louder.  When Milo puts on the Mask&#133; well, you get the idea.  As usual, Carrey is an utter delight, letting loose in this role and bending it to his will.  It's this type of comedy that die-hard fans fell in love with, not to mention creating future roles including `Liar Liar', `Me, Myself and Irene', and `Bruce Almighty'.  I still laugh like crazy when Ipkiss puts on the mask.  For the record, if a person is not a fan of cartoons, then they are not going to like this movie.  It includes plenty of references to classic cartoon characters (not to mention a fitting tribute to Tex Avery's Wolf).  I'm an avid cartoon fanatic, so this was a movie that was right up my alley.  If you're an fan of the old animated slapstick, then I recommend this movie with 5 neon stars!  If not&#133; well, best try your luck somewhere else.

Jeff Bridges portrayal of the Dude is so great, that he will only be known as the Dude on his tombstone.

This is always bound to fail.The actual film itself is of a new breed slowly coming into the mainstream. It is that of the fantasy world, science fiction and computers.To enjoy this film you need to enjoy these genres.  Without this kind of trust in a film you are bound to start questioning its merits.  That aside, the true sci-fi fan will relish in delight with this one.  The storyline is totally off the ball, the scenes spooky and slightly off centre and the plot totally adverse to the norm.The acting talent is also at the better end of the British market although the dialog might cause some to question that.  The dialog itself is not conventional and might upset some viewers who find it totally unrealistic and non-believable.

Both movies are very unpredictable and very scary and both films follow right after the other and both main cast in The Fly\/Fly II have love interests(Fly I,Goldblum and Davis,Fly II,Stotlz and Zuniga)which is pretty cool.All in all The Fly series is a fantastic series of the 80s(which was a great decade I might add).In MY opinion there will never be movies like this again,they are classics,a real thrilling horror series.When the last time you got scared of a movie???Heres a tip DON'T WATCH THEM IN THE DARK!!!The Fly part 2 has a great beginning much like its predecessor with a great promo.You get to know Seth's(Goldblum in Fly 1)son Martin(Stoltz) as he goes on with life much faster than everyone else.You feel sorry for him as well much like Goldblum in the first movie.You also feel sorry for Beth (Zuniga) as she trys to help martin.Yes its true Strathis (Getz)reprises his roleThere are lots of doctors and security guards you just hate because of what they do to martin.Once martin evolves into the Fly,all hell breaks loose.You never know what is going to happen next.This is really one heck of monster movie and you won't believe what you'll see!By the way,listen to music score by Christopher Young,it really makes this movie even better.When you here the main title theme you think holytoledo,this is really gonna be good and you know what?It is, I suggest you buy buy the score,you'll love it!The film is great,like the other a bit sad but very good. The Fly II is an excellent horror movie! The acting by Eric Stoltz was really good! The part with the dog was sad but you can tell its animatronic. The real horror begins when Martin discovers the camera in his room! His transformation is really gruesome. I think the fly monster is one of the most terrifying monsters ever! I just love the score by Christopher Young! The music is beautiful, dark, and aggressive! My favorite part is the main titles! It is one of the greatest songs ever composed in My opinion! I liked in the main title how the credit says the Fly II in nice and bright blue letters! The Fly II is My favorite of the Fly movies and even though Jeff Goldblum acted superbly in the first, the sequel has some big time moments! Speaking of Goldblum, he has two archive footage scenes in the film! Some of today's horror movie are very good but there hasn't been a movie like the Fly II since it came out. In My opinion, if your looking for a great horror movie then this is it! Horror movies just ain't made like this often!Movie Nuttball's NOTE As you know I love the music and in fact I adore the score to the Fly II! There is a special edition CD of the score. It contains the score of the Fly and the Fly II! If you are a fan of the scores I recommend that you get it! It is well worth the buy!

This movie really proves that horror is the most powerful genre in cinema...it contains the creepiest thriller moments and a good amount of touching drama. A horror role model and one of the better efforts in the genre ever. Made in 1976, The Omen had several groundbreaking aspects and it still stands after more than 25 years. Like its even more famous predecessor ( sort of ),The Exorcist uses the Christian Religion as a basic plot. If you add a few sensitive side aspects to that like child death, armageddon and politics I assure you'll be pinned to your screen for a good 110 minutes. Gregory Peck, although normally not a routine horror actor, gives away a terrific performance as Robert Thorn. He's an American ambassador who can't manage to tell his wife ( a good Lee Remick ) that their son died while giving birth. He accepts to adopt an orphan that was born on the same day and he decides never to tell his wife. When the boy - Damien - turns five, he's going through some...euh...changes ! It seems that Damien is the unmitigated Antichrist. The son of Satan himself, sent to the earth on 6am on the 6th day of the 6th month, to take over the world and to annihilate every quoin of the Christian belief. When it comes to atmosphere and tension, The Omen satisfies the most critic horror fan. The story develops itself like a sort of mystery that needs to be revealed. It's filled with surprises since you get the idea that nobody is safe in The Omen...You fear that every character can die at every moment and that fascinates you so much...The film isn't very bloody but that certainly doesn't bother you. The tension of it overrules the most beautiful gory scenes. And I have to mention the great use of music. I admit I am a sucker for loud, biblical and opera-like sounding music but I can't believe that someone is left cold with this music. The score leads in some of the most breath-taking scenes I've ever seen. Overall, The Omen is a must see and not strictly for horror fans. The whole myth about the Antichrist and his birthmark - IF it is a myth of course...- is one of the best stories ever written.

Starship Troopers is escapist entertainment. Its not something that is particulary intelligent but its something thats sure to get the pulse racing. Paul Verhoeven is not a great director but I don't consider him a bad filmmaker. The violence in his other films is present here but its not gratuitous in my opinion. Surely not all of Starship Troopers is good. The action is much more interesting than the attempted love story or love triangle. In fact, the love story is very much a distraction. Paul Verhoeven is not a director known for crafting love stories and this part of Starship Troopers illustrates why. However, the action is so intense and exciting you'll forget all about the love triangle. Every battle scene with the bugs represents a highlight. One of the biggest battle scenes near the end of the film aided by very impressive visual effects is the best scene of the film and one of the best action scenes in a sci-fi film. In fact, the action is so good here I could compare it to the action in James Cameron's Aliens. Even though what I just said about the film, comparing to Aliens is a huge compliment, this is a vastly inferior film. WHY? Because Aliens didn't have a love story in it with a filmmaker that has no idea what the hell to do with it. Paul Verhoeven shows skill behind the camera during the action scenes. However, both Cameron and Verhoeven are two directors that feel very at home in action\/sci-fi films. Anyone who has seen a Verhoeven movie, knows that in most cases acting is not a big strength. He is more interested in the look of the film than performances, so its no surprise theres nothing outstanding here. However, Casper Van Dien and Dina Meyer give credible performances. Jake Busey is funny at times. Denise Richards is actually ok here. Michael Ironside gives a solid performance and has the films best line. Starship Troopers is an entertaining film. Like I said, Starship Troopers is flawed but overall you will have a pretty good time watching it.
