Manni (Bleibtreu) frantically calls Lola (Potente), who has the wildest color red hair in history. She was supposed to pick him up but didn't arrive in time. Because of that, Manni had to take the subway and lost the 20,000 marks he picked up to bring to a mobster. He has twenty minutes to replace it or it's curtains. If Lola can't help him, he's going to rob a nearby grocery store.Lola starts running. On the way, she stops at the bank where her father works. She finds her father with another woman, who has just told her father that she is pregnant. Dad tells Lola that he's not coming home ever again, and he doesn't give her any money. Lola keeps running.Director\/writer Tom Tykwer has taken up the question -- is our fate always the same, despite the decisions we make? Or do the decisions we make shape what happens to us? How much is fate, how much can we control? The film goes on to show three twenty-minute sequences of Lola running and, depending upon what she decides to do, depending on whether her timing is just right or a little off to reach Manni, different things happen that decide the ending. The sequences are done in real time, not compressed as many films are.Underneath Lola's running is this amazing rhythmic beat written by Tykwer and two others - Running One, Running Two, and Running Three. It is fabulous.This is an exciting, suspenseful, compelling film, one of the best ever. Potente doesn't get to do much but run. The poor woman could not wash her hair for seven weeks of filming because if she did, the insane color would fade. A wig might have been a good investment. Bleibtreu has the emotional role, and he's excellent. Both of them have the youthful energy necessary for such a thrilling movie.See it! It's great. And that rhythm is hypnotic.

That, unfortunately, was my problem with Dying Young a movie that I was hoping would stir my emotions, since I am usually a sucker for pictures like this. Dying Young stars Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott, the latter as a young man sick with leukemia, the former as his nurse. As you would expect, it's a Florence Nightingale tale with the two falling in love. But the fault does not lie with its two stars, and not at all with its director, Joel Schumacher, but with its writer, Richard Friedenberg.The screenplay is rather limp, playing with the rhythms of conventional melodrama far too often, and without any real zing. A movie can get by with being conventional, if a lot of heart is poured into it by the storyteller. But that is not the case here. Gifted as they are, Mr. Scott and Miss Roberts do not have a whole terrible lot to work with. She is hired by him, he takes a shine to her (could any man not?), she resists him but pities him, and then warms up, and voila! They're sleeping together. But that was all that I could sense from the picture. The two stars steaming up the screen every once in a while. They did not seem to have a real relationship. I cared a little more whether Mr. Scott's character lived or died, but even at the end, I couldn't have felt less on the question of whether or not the couple would be able to come together again. As if we didn't already know and expect. The script also touches on some good subjects. Chemotherapy, for instance and how it can help kill cancer, but also make life for the patient a nightmare. However, the narrative does not develop these moments to register an appropriate impact.Thankfully, the movie makes the wise choice of limiting scenes with the leading lady's mother. First of all, the dialogue is silly (she actually tells her daughter to move back in with her boyfriend, even though she caught him in bed with another woman, just because he paid the bills) and Ellen Burstyn's performance is sheer ham-acting.Telling the story in a solid narrative also seems to be Mr. Friedenberg's weakness. For the movie is told with a lot of big lumps to bounce over. Take for instance, a rather oddball scene with Vincent D'Onofrio. Of course, being a romantic drama, there has to be a secondary character to make the leading man jealous. Anyway, Mr. D'Onofrio brings them a television set, and they watch Jeopardy. The sequence proceeds to them trying to outguess each other on what the answers are, and just when it seems it might be leading somewhere, it all ends. The moment is nice enough, and grabbed my attention, but when it cut off, it left me wondering just what on earth the point of it all was. Yes, it did more or less resurface twenty minutes later at a predictable dinner scene, but not registering with much impact. And speaking of which, Miss Roberts' decision to run away from the hospital to the country house is rather awkward. Given the fact that the characters are not romantically involved yet.And just what was the point of Miss Roberts running into her ex-boyfriend in a bar? Where to or from did the scene come from? Director Schumacher is to be commended. Except in a couple of jump cut scenes at the beginning, in which we see Mr. Scott suffering from chemotherapy, he does a solid job of directing. Most lovely are his moving images at a country house the couple move into about midway through the picture. A scene in bed between Mr. Scott and Miss Roberts is handled wonderfully, with the camera swishing away from them just as they start to kiss and fondle each other, and then finding the mirror across the room. He also does something that I consider wise. Avoiding the sex scene. He shows us the beginning, and the end, but not the middle. Evidently, he had more faith in the story than the screenwriter.Not to say that Richard Friedenberg's screenplay is a hack-job piece of work. It's adequate enough, but not impassioned. The few tender moments are generated by Mr. Scott and Miss Roberts, and thanks to Mr. Schumacher's fabulous directing. And the movie as a whole is not bad by a long shot. But by the end of it all, it did not seem to matter what became of either character, and I did not feel as if I had gotten to know either of them. As a result, their relationship did not seem to amount to a whole heck of a lot. It's a great idea, with good intentions and good acting, but not much heart. Maybe the original novel by Marti Leimbach works better. I would be interested in finding out.

It is a small film; one might even call it intimate, since the bulk of its hour-and-thirty-nine minute run time is devoted to the developing friendship between Daisy Werthan, a modestly wealthy retired Jewish schoolteacher (Jessica Tandy in the last role worthy of her, for which she would become the oldest winner of the Best Actress Oscar) and her African-American chauffeur Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman, without a doubt my choice for the greatest American actor still living and working in the business today; he was nominated for the Oscar as well, but I doubt anyone could have beaten Daniel Day-Lewis in his rather gimmicky turn as Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT).But I digress. The plot is easily summed up in just a few words the aging Miss Daisy, while attempting to drive to the market one day, has an accident with the car that is completely due to her own absent-mindedness but which she, in her typically stubborn way, attempts to blame on the car.Her devoted son Boolie (Dan Aykroyd in one of the best character roles he has ever had) fears for his mother's safety and decides that she must have a chauffeur. The headstrong Daisy vetoes the idea, giving as her reason a half-hearted protest that servants (and in this context in the South this means Negroes) steal things and can't be trusted. This despite the fact that she's had an African-American maid\/cook, Idella (Esther Rolle in a performance of surpassing dignity), for decades. Obviously what Daisy fears is the loss of her independence; certainly she does not mean what she says about African-Americans; we sense it even as she says it.Boolie is not so easily swayed, however. Very much his mother's son, rather than butt heads with Daisy, he gets round the obstacle she puts up by hiring the chauffeur himself and paying his salary. Enter Morgan Freeman. He isn't young, either, but he needs a job, and he is no fool, either when an incident involving a stuck elevator attracts Boolie's attention to the man, Hoke quickly sizes up the situation and realizes that for once in his life he is actually in a position to hold out for better pay. And he will do this to Boolie a couple of times.Hoke shows up at Miss Daisy's home, but she will have none of him. She can't physically throw him out, and given that he was hired to perform a service, she certainly can't call the cops, so she chooses to ignore him at first, only speaking to him to remind him in an irritable tone that he isn't wanted. When she finds him occupying his time by cleaning her crystal chandelier, she tells him, You leave my things alone! An amusing line made even more so by Daisy's knowledge that she is stuck with him so long as Boolie is paying the bills, and by Hoke's response a softly-spoken yas'm after which he continues to work.My favorite moment comes when Daisy decides to walk to the store. In a flash Hoke is behind the wheel and as he drives slowly next to her, she says to him, What do you think you're doing? To which he responds, I'm trying to drive you to the store! Faced with an inevitability, Daisy finally gets in the car.All this happens fairly quickly, because director Beresford and writer Alfred Uhry are anxious to get to the relationship. Once in that car, she tacitly acknowledges that she is stuck with him, and though she acts cranky about it, she does not really put up a fight.The rest of the movie covers, over the course of several decades, the growing and developing friendship between the old lady and the servant. Discovering that he is illiterate, she takes it upon herself to teach him to read. On a long road trip from Atlanta to Mobile, Hoke pulls over to relieve himself at the side of the road (after delivering a blistering speech to Daisy about his manhood and humanity when she tries to stop him). Alone in the car, Daisy grows increasingly fearful and calls out Hoke's name twice. And later on, she speaks what may be the defining line of the film You're my best friend. She takes his hand when she says it, making a potentially maudlin line deeply significant and real.This is a beautiful film Beautifully photographed, sensationally acted by the entire cast (special mention must be made of Patti LuPone, screamingly funny as Boolie's wife Florine; I don't remember if she was a shiksa or simply an assimilationist, but Daisy can't stand her she celebrates Christmas with the gaudiest decorations you can imagine, and she certainly is a woman to whom money and status are important), and crafted by director Beresford into a flawless gem of a film that positively sparkles. Tandy, a national treasure, delivers one of her greatest performances, and Freeman, in the difficult role of servant, not only retains his dignity and his manhood, but captures our hearts as surely as he captures Miss Daisy's.A must-see.

On a long road trip from Atlanta to Mobile, Hoke pulls over to relieve himself at the side of the road (after delivering a blistering speech to Daisy about his manhood and humanity when she tries to stop him). Alone in the car, Daisy grows increasingly fearful and calls out Hoke's name twice. And later on, she speaks what may be the defining line of the film You're my best friend. She takes his hand when she says it, making a potentially maudlin line deeply significant and real.This is a beautiful film Beautifully photographed, sensationally acted by the entire cast (special mention must be made of Patti LuPone, screamingly funny as Boolie's wife Florine; I don't remember if she was a shiksa or simply an assimilationist, but Daisy can't stand her she celebrates Christmas with the gaudiest decorations you can imagine, and she certainly is a woman to whom money and status are important), and crafted by director Beresford into a flawless gem of a film that positively sparkles. Tandy, a national treasure, delivers one of her greatest performances, and Freeman, in the difficult role of servant, not only retains his dignity and his manhood, but captures our hearts as surely as he captures Miss Daisy's.A must-see.

He has 2 daughters - Lauren Bacall (Vivian) and Martha Vickers (Carmen) - and it transpires that they are both drawn to the thrill of danger. Bogart solves one case but is then hooked into sticking around and poking his nose into other situations which seem to have been lurking around for a while. He is not welcome.This film is nicely shot, for instance, the depth in the greenhouse-type room where Bogart meets with Waldron draws you into the house. The dialogue is snappy and funny (both Bacall and Vickers tell Bogart that he is short) and sustains a consistency throughout the whole story. However, the film is slightly too long and I can understand those who think the film a little over-complicated. I was able to follow about 90%but I had to concentrate for the full 1 hour and 54 minutes, and this is quite a demand on the viewer. The story just seems to keep going, so just run with it.The cast are all effective and Lauren Bacall sings a really cool song after 1 hour when we see her in the nightclub and we realize, for the first time, that she is also a problem girl. Up to that point, Vickers is the bad girl who is always getting into trouble. You wonder what will happen in the final confrontations and I am pleased to say that the ending wasn't the cliché that I was expecting given the title of the film. I have no idea what the title means.Overall, it's a bit complicated but make an effort with it and it's not bad. Like Humphrey Bogart, I even felt sorry for Elisha Cooke Jnr (Jones) in his role as a messenger.

I wanted Dumbo, but my sisters won out, and we got Cinderella. They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while I sulked in the back of the room playing with my Star Wars action figures.A lot has changed since then. My love of the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and I now have two young nieces. I like to showcase Disney to them as much as I can, and we recently watched Cinderella together. With my newfound appreciation for all that is Disney, I watched Cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw.From the beginning of the movie, though, I didn't quite understand why Cinderella was trapped in such a horrible predicament. Why was she such a slave to her stepfamily, and why couldn't she just run away? I wasn't too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I found myself becoming immersed in the story. Maybe the eye-catching animation or the fun-loving characters drew me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listening to songs like Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo and A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes sort of whisked me back to the theme parks. I can picture myself in that carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe-inspiring Cinderella Castle.Something about this movie just evokes the magic of Disney. That may make many people scoff, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like Cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass slipper - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - embody why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world.While Cinderella may not be the strongest story, it is sort of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents that fun, idealistic, and fantasy-like wonderment we held when we were kids. I imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it does represent all that I love and admire about the Company.My IMDb Rating 10\/10. My Yahoo!

You know who you are.Our heroes are Jay (played by Jason Mewes, a real life stoner), an archetypal pot-head moulded after Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Richmond High, and Silent Bob, his chubby hetero life-mate. Our duo get into crazy adventures, run into equally odd characters, and of course eventually emerge victorious. Smith satirizes his Miramax financiers (via many Ben Affleck and Matt Damon jokes), Hollywood conventions (a monkey subplot pokes fun at Hollywood market researchers and dumb Going to Hollywood parables), treats his geeky audience to much female eye-candy, and of course many Star Wars, superhero, comic-book and filmdom in-jokes (everything from Scooby Doo to American Pie), all the while rolling out a string of big Hollywood cameos (including directors like Wes Craven and Gus Van Sant), the best of whom is probably Chris Rock, who plays an angry movie director (modelled on Spike Lee) who advocates pro-white slavery. The film is consistently funny if you like this type of humour, but lacks the gravity of Smith's best films (Chasing Amy and Dogma).The buddy\/stoner comedy has been around since the 1970s (the Cheech and Chong movies), but few have any artistic merit. Robert Altman tried to make a high-brow stoner movie with O.C and Stiggs, but that misfired completely. Perhaps the classiest films in this genre are The Big Lebowski and Bad Santa, both written by the Coen brothers. These ultra low-brow genres are typically avoided by auteurs.Unlike Smith's other films, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back flows well, seems less dialogue\/monologue heavy, has about a thousand more jokes and keeps these jokes flowing hard and fast. The film's last act in particular, inspired by Pee-wee's Big Adventure, offers a barrage of giggles.8.5\/10 &#x96; Worth multiple viewings.
