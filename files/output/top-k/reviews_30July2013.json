The tempo right from the start of the film isn't too bad as it does set a nice tone to the film and kind of signifies what sought of film this will be. In some parts the acting of Marlon Brando as the 'Don' and Al Pacino as Michael do put up good performances which again add's to that verisimilitude to not only the story but to the other characters that are within this film. Although these small film aspects can add to your experience of watching the Godfather, non of this excruciates from the fact that these good factors do have harsh limitations which evidently create more problems throughout the duration of the film.Even though I did say from the start that the tempo and the duration of the scenes and music is perfect in introducing the characters and some of the story aspects, this is all it does unfortunately. As it gets near enough to the middle point of the film, the whole story and tempo falls flat on it's face and in most parts of when they are talking to some other gang leaders does emphasise this point that sometimes in the film, some of the story elements don't really add up to which personal for me creates a lot of boredom.

I find that the Italia sequence is a complete waste of time and primarily add's to this excuse of being nearly a 3 hour film which really it shouldn't be. This sequence just kills the flow and intensity of what will eventually happen; it postpones the inevitable in some fashion. Although again I did say that the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is exceptionally fine, the majority of their performances not only add's to this lack of entertainment, but in a sense just makes me want to never watch this film ever again.

Without this film, the superhero movie genre would never have even started. Yes, there were some films that helped the genre along the way such as Tim Burton's Batman, Blade, X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman Begins but this is the first superhero movie that had a huge budget, was serious in tone(with the exception of the Lex Luthor bits), and was a huge blockbuster. So knowing that, you probably already seen this film or at least know a bunch of scenes and lines from it. But with that being said, does this film still hold up after all these years? In one word, yes. Yes, it's a little corny and dated in spots but overall it still holds up and here's why. Firstly, it's an epic. Most superhero movies today are very basic in plot structure and feel very small in scale(Iron Man, Thor, Captain America) but this film has a huge long plot and although it doesn't have a lot of action, it still fells like an epic because of the way it spans over years of his journey becoming Superman. In fact, we don't see Christopher Reeve until at least 45 minutes into the film, and yet, this film isn't boring. The first act in the film is the story of how Krypton gets destroyed and how Jor-El sends his son, Kal-El into planet Earth. What really works about this act, is that we don't just see him launch the ship to Earth and then the planet explodes. Instead, we see the drama that Jor-El and Lara face as they realize that planet Krypton is approaching its doom and how there's nothing they can do about it. The scene where they decide to send their son to Earth is a very touching scene and it's great that the writers chose not to have them just send him away quickly as the planet's exploding to make it more exciting. The second act in the film is the story of Kal-El, or Clark Kent as he's named by his foster parents Jonathan and Martha Kent having problems fitting in with his amazing abilities(super strength, speed, hearing etc). He wants to show the world what he can do but Jonathan wants him to keep it a secret and moments later, he dies of a heart attack. I like how while this act is dramatic, it doesn't feel too much of a downer like Man of Steel did. We get some fun stuff along the way too like when Clark runs with his super speed as fast as a train. After Jonathan dies, Clark discovers the Fortress of Solitude which is a replica of Krypton where Jor-El's consciousness reveals to him where he came from and what he was destined to do on Earth, to inspire hope in others as Superman. This scene has a bit of 70s cheese to it with the space effects going on as Jor-El's educating Clark but I love the shot of him flying out of the Fortress as Superman.The third act is when Clark finally becomes Superman, stops a bunch of crimes, gets romantically involved with Lois Lane, and has to stop Lex Luthor's scheme of blowing up lands and taking them over. Not only does he develop the identity of Superman but he also has the alter ego of Clark Kent, a shy and clumsy reporter of Daily Planet. One thing that's different with this Clark Kent than with the previous George Reeves Clark is that he isn't a confident, upstanding guy like George was which I prefer. I mean, think about it. When all he has to disguise himself is a pair of glasses and a different way of combing his hair, he needs to create a different personality for himself. So this provides a far-fetched but entertaining way of making the audience believe that he can actually fool people like that. Christopher Reeve really shines as Superman, he's confident, charming, witty, handsome, and intimidating when he's dealing with Lex Luthor. The scene where he's interviewed by Lois is really clever and charming and results in a romantic flight set to a great John Williams score. But how's the villain?Lex Luthor in this film has often been criticized by fans for being played by Gene Hackman in a comedic and goofy tone but you know what, I think he's hilarious! His arrogance for his intellect and his interactions with Ms. Tesmacher and Otis is just comedy genius in my opinion. But this is a villain all up to taste, if you don't like villains that are played for laughs instead of menace then this movie might not be for you. But I think he fits perfectly into the tone of this film.So those are the things I love about this movie but here's some things that bothered me. The film is essentially about responsibility and Jor- El even tells Clark in the Fortress not to interfere with the course of human events but he ends up spinning the Earth backwards to turn back time to save Lois from the earthquake caused by Lex's missiles. I wouldn't mind this even though it's not scientifically accurate but it bothers me how he gets no consequences from this. I also think that while the special effects looked great for the time, it doesn't look that great today. But it is 35 years old now so it's expected.But overall, this is a great film and I highly recommend it to all comic-book fans, film fans, or just casual movie-goers. Just don't expect to see the modern Lex Luthor on film. If you want that, then watch Superman The Animated Series instead. I give it a 8\/10.

He wants to show the world what he can do but Jonathan wants him to keep it a secret and moments later, he dies of a heart attack. I like how while this act is dramatic, it doesn't feel too much of a downer like Man of Steel did. We get some fun stuff along the way too like when Clark runs with his super speed as fast as a train. After Jonathan dies, Clark discovers the Fortress of Solitude which is a replica of Krypton where Jor-El's consciousness reveals to him where he came from and what he was destined to do on Earth, to inspire hope in others as Superman. This scene has a bit of 70s cheese to it with the space effects going on as Jor-El's educating Clark but I love the shot of him flying out of the Fortress as Superman.The third act is when Clark finally becomes Superman, stops a bunch of crimes, gets romantically involved with Lois Lane, and has to stop Lex Luthor's scheme of blowing up lands and taking them over. Not only does he develop the identity of Superman but he also has the alter ego of Clark Kent, a shy and clumsy reporter of Daily Planet. One thing that's different with this Clark Kent than with the previous George Reeves Clark is that he isn't a confident, upstanding guy like George was which I prefer. I mean, think about it. When all he has to disguise himself is a pair of glasses and a different way of combing his hair, he needs to create a different personality for himself. So this provides a far-fetched but entertaining way of making the audience believe that he can actually fool people like that. Christopher Reeve really shines as Superman, he's confident, charming, witty, handsome, and intimidating when he's dealing with Lex Luthor. The scene where he's interviewed by Lois is really clever and charming and results in a romantic flight set to a great John Williams score. But how's the villain?Lex Luthor in this film has often been criticized by fans for being played by Gene Hackman in a comedic and goofy tone but you know what, I think he's hilarious! His arrogance for his intellect and his interactions with Ms. Tesmacher and Otis is just comedy genius in my opinion. But this is a villain all up to taste, if you don't like villains that are played for laughs instead of menace then this movie might not be for you. But I think he fits perfectly into the tone of this film.So those are the things I love about this movie but here's some things that bothered me. The film is essentially about responsibility and Jor- El even tells Clark in the Fortress not to interfere with the course of human events but he ends up spinning the Earth backwards to turn back time to save Lois from the earthquake caused by Lex's missiles. I wouldn't mind this even though it's not scientifically accurate but it bothers me how he gets no consequences from this. I also think that while the special effects looked great for the time, it doesn't look that great today. But it is 35 years old now so it's expected.But overall, this is a great film and I highly recommend it to all comic-book fans, film fans, or just casual movie-goers. Just don't expect to see the modern Lex Luthor on film. If you want that, then watch Superman The Animated Series instead. I give it a 8\/10.

Before Sunrise was not a Box Office smash by any means, being independently made as well, it's kind of shocking that it spawned two sequels. But this is one of the rare times in our society a sequel was put into production because the audience they spoke too wanted more for the intellectual stimulation and embracing romance. It reached to a section of fans and critics ate it up. Thankfully, the team came backing punching the audience more with each film.Stupid people talk about people, averagely smart people talk about things, intelligent people talk about ideas. This quote has always fascinated me and is held true in each of the Before movies. Topics discussed here is what people should be talking about, not the latest petty gossip in their circle of friends. The key to total connection in a relationship is the talking about the mysteries of the world, human nature, and one's personal beliefs; that's what all three Befores cover beautifully. The trilogy's most pure nature is a collection of conversations between two people developing a romantic relationship through what they learn about each other. The dialogue was so engrossing that the entire first hour flew by and I hadn't written a single note on my legal pad. A movie where practically nothing happens would sound like a bore in theory and could even be a disaster in the wrong hands, but here it captivates the viewer.Each conversation the couple has, I identified with their thoughts; they may have been ideas I had at one time, a conversation I actually had with someone else, or something I've never thought of before that makes total sense about love, life, and personal psyche. This is what a great love story should be. This is what a great movie should be. This is how a great movie representing the building of a romantic relationship should be. The truth is, love means different things to us at different stages of our lives and the different stages of a relationship change the mood of said relationship, which is why all three movies make sense and are necessary.After I concluded my time with this Before Sunrise I thought, there's no way it could get better than this. Before Sunrise isn't just an introduction to the trilogy, it's a elegant tale of how a romance is first realized. Practically the characters have just become functioning adults in the world and in your twenties, there's still so much one doesn't understand about the life. The naiveness is captured, but with an intoxicating courtship. The screenplay is wonderful, featuring some magically written conversations that transcend the viewer into the souls of the characters. The romance has the most zest of the three films. Rating 9\/10Grade AWatching character dive head first into conversations about life has never been so mesmerizing as it is in the Before trilogy. Communication is something lacking in society today, the Before trilogy shows us how a successful relationship is built through talking. Julie Delpy and John Hawkes are transform into their roles and especially knock their performances over the fence in the last two films. The collaboration between two leading actors and the director, Richard Linklater, writing the later films results in a tightly told story that unfolds without fault. One thing that marks these films different from most lack of cuts within a scene. Many scenes in the Before trilogy run un-interrupted for ten minutes or more. It's very hard thing to do, but it's done with natural grace. With Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight we feel closer to life, love, and ourselves. The Before trilogy is like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.

One reviewer said that the film doesn't mention sonoluminescence (it does, explicitly), others say that certain things aren't explained ie the explosion in the warehouse. Well d'uh! Hydrogen is not an inert gas and is highly flammable (mentioned a LOT in the film) and people complain about lack of plot then demonstrate they didn't understand it anyway! Chain Reaction is a science-heavy sci-fi chase film where two people who barely know each other are framed for something they didn't do and go on the run. Suspension of why didn't they just go to the FBI and explain aside, it's a ripping good fairly intelligent yarn which isn't dumbed down so it's not all spelled out, especially Shannon's character (Morgan Freeman) who throughout is ambiguous in who's side he is actually on. Aspects of the story are insidious - an environmentally friendly fuel that would revolutionise the world and a Government Agency wants to suppress it and an idealist is labelled a dreamer for wanting to make a difference. It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing\/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves. The plot is as simple or as complex as you want. On the surface it's a simple on the run film, but the political conspiracy aspects and science-stuff make it a deeper story, which not being spelled out adds to the mystery. Reeves of course is excellent at the action, and plays resourceful convincingly and easily; I liked his dogged determination to rescue Lily and clear their names. Rachel Weisz's Physicist the too serious Lily is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma).

It's isn't too hard to believe that is a possible scenario. Okay some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall the performances were perfectly fine. Freeman of course is superior. Dr Alistair Barkley (Nicholas Rudall) was also a lovely actor and character, although not well known, and his monologue at the beginning is just superb and emotive - clearly the writing\/screenplay was very good except for the repetition of everyone's names during conversation, that really gets on my nerves.

Rachel Weisz's Physicist the too serious Lily is a bit weak, a bit of a drag on the survival given that everything is done for her but perhaps that is more realistic, women don't miraculously turn into gung-ho running leaping shooting and fighting survivalists, but I do expect her to do something but her emotions are very real especially regarding Chen (Tzi Ma).

Fans of the film hated this and in a later cut of the film the narration was removed. It does seem logical that a movie which has so many mysterious elements shouldn't reveal all its secrets in the first thirty seconds. But in this case the narration probably served the film well. Because what is going on in this film is very weird, exceedingly bizarre and not particularly easy to comprehend unless you have some solid base of initial knowledge to fall back on. And there are still enough twists, turns and impactful surprises to make the film very compelling. Giving the audience a little help at the beginning paid off. Otherwise by the time the film finally fully revealed itself many people may have been too lost, too confused, too frustrated to appreciate what they had seen. And there is so much to appreciate.It also must be said that having the story laid out in such detail early on allows the audience to accept that story much easier. It is a story which requires tremendous leaps of faith. Without sufficient grounding the story may ultimately have proved to be just too strange for many people to take. Even with so many of its secrets given away right at the start the story still manages to grab you. A man wakes up in a bathtub. He can't seem to remember anything. His forehead is bleeding. There's a dead woman on the floor. And then the phone rings, someone tells him he needs to run away now because they are coming to get him. Who are they? Who knows? Anyway, the man flees and the movie kicks into high gear very quickly. The man is John Murdoch. Or is he? It becomes clear very quickly that nothing in this city is exactly what it seems. John Murdoch is not the only person here with vanished memories. He doesn't really know who he is. Nobody does. But nobody besides John realizes anything is amiss. It is up to him to unravel the mystery. What he discovers will shock both him and us. The film packs quite a dramatic punch and raises serious questions about humanity. What makes us human? This film's mysterious Strangers need to know the answer to that question.It is the Strangers who drive the plot. They can manipulate the physical environment of the city, creating new buildings and changing the form of existing ones in mere moments with just the power of their minds. And yet none of the humans ever notice anything has changed. And it is not just the buildings the Strangers change, they have a rather insidious, invasive way of changing the people themselves. Then the Strangers sit back and see what happens. The humans, unknowingly, are their lab rats. John however is resistant to the efforts of the Strangers. Not only that he apparently shares their powers. With the help of a police detective he sets out to find the truth and to give the citizens of the city back their humanity, give them back a sense of who they really are.Rufus Sewell does very well with the challenging role of John Murdoch, a man who does not know who he is. Sewell captures the original bewilderment well and then grows with the character as John finds the strength and determination to put an end to whatever is going on here. William Hurt plays the detective who ends up assisting John, Jennifer Connelly plays John's wife. They both end up very confused and Hurt and Connelly give very good performances as their characters try to figure out what the heck is going on here. Richard O'Brien is appropriately creepy playing the film's most prominent Stranger. Perhaps the only misstep comes from Kiefer Sutherland playing a doctor mixed up in the activities of the Strangers. Sutherland plays the role with a stammer which becomes distracting and annoying very quickly. It's a little bit of weirdness the film didn't need, it adds nothing to the character and the film's plenty weird enough already. But that quibble aside the film generally works very well. It is a fascinating, intriguing, thought-provoking story. Visually the film looks spectacular with wonderful set design and brilliantly executed effects. Perhaps the film goes a little overboard with the effects near the end. The story gets somewhat left behind as things wrap up with a big visual effects blowout. You can't help but think this very smart film deserved a little bit smarter of an ending. But the film ultimately is more than satisfying enough.

We had to study this film in English and I actually got quite excited. This is an astounding movie and is done so well. Jim Carrey plays the main character, Truman Burbank (True-Man). Truman lives what he thinks is a normal life. He has a wife, a home, a friend he's known for most of his life and a desk-job at an insurance agency. What he doesn't realize is that he is actually a star in a 24 hour, live show which is showed all across the globe which documents like a soap-opera his life.The whole film tackles the themes of the power of the media and even religious themes about the God if you look hard enough as Truman starts to realize that his life is different from everyone around him. The script is more than perfect, the dialogue is wonderful and there is an excellent mix of heart-warming stuff as well as some comedy to lighten the mood (a necessity). The film is not too long, which is a good thing because a considerable length for a movie like this could ruin it. The acting is another stand-out along-side the excellent script. Jim Carrey does a great job and I can see how they casted him instead of another normal actor (Yes, Jim, you're not a normal actor). All the actors do a good job but keep an eye out for the man who plays Truman's friend, Marlon, who does amazing and a few scenes you would see why. There's nothing more I can really say about this film, it's thought-provoking, it's wonderfully scripted and acted. It has a few funny scenes to lighten the mood but overall its serious. I must say that it is not a popcorn film but it is also a film which is worth more than one viewing. Watch it twice in a week and you will understand a bit more of the themes and nuances which help create this world. This is the type of movie which really leaves an impression on you after you watch it. I promise you, this movie is not forgettable and you will be left thinking about it hours after the credits appear.

This movie is so bad, I will not even call it a movie. Nor will I give it a rating. Smokey 3 is just 85 minutes of stupid lines, horrible attempts at acting, and the lamest stunts ever put on celluloid. Now allegedly, Jackie Gleason was supposed to somehow play both Sheriff Justice as well as the Bandit. I'm not sure how that finished product would have looked, but it couldn't possibly have been any worse than the final product they came up with here.The story deals with Big and Little Enos (Enis?) challenging the retiring Sheriff Justice to a pretty lame bet. Instead of trucking Coors Beer or a pregnant elephant across the South, he has to drive a PLASTIC SHARK from Florida to Texas as part of a promo for their new fish restaurants or something. I won't waste any more time on the plot. Just trust me... its stupid. You can tell that Jerry Reed was a fill in after the initial dailies were a bust. He doesn't appear for a while, and many of his scenes seem totally arbitrary. Actually the whole 85 are kind of arbitrary. All we see are a series of boring stunts and detours to ridiculous locations. The stunts are about as original as driving an old Pontiac through whatever they could stack up. Ice, eggs, sand, flowers, Cuban refugees... you name it. There are detours to swinger hotels, nudist colonies, construction sites, etc. None of it is interesting. Even the nudity is laughable. Its like watching an old episode of Benny Hill with flabby early-80s nude people frolicking amidst quick editing cuts. The Trans Am was a weak-looking car by then, too. There is also a truly tasteless scene where a truck full of drunken Klansmen harass two black chicken farmers who sound as stereotypical as Amos and Andy. The mustache Cletus has is a fake-looking porno-stache. And if you want to see Colleen Camp look sexier in something funny, watch Clue.It was so bad that I forgot how it even ended. I think Cletus gives the fish to Sheriff Justice so he can keep his badge and collect $250,000. I hope Gleason was paid a hell of a lot more than that for appearing in this swill. Ughhhh! Worst film ever. Zero stars.The Hound.
