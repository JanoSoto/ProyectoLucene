Upon first watching the film, I was sceptical and half expectant of it being mildly overrated. The film is as close to flawless as any other film I have yet watched, and that includes some IMDb favourites, such as fellow masterclasses Shawshank Redemption and the first two Godfather movies. The screenplay and directing of the film is sensational. I have not yet read the book, or seen a play adaptation, but it is something I would very much want to do. The scripting is quickly-paced, but this never becomes it's downfall and simply adds to the sheer insanity of the film itself. Though, the velocity of the film itself does halt when need be - thus, making the more tragic, dramatic scenes even more touching and heartbreaking. The directing, from the excellent Milos Forman, is also something to shout about very much. An Oscar well deserved! Though, the film's stand-out of many strong points is the acting. Within a large and extensive cast, there is not a single bad actor and a handful of outstanding ones. Jack Nicholson, playing the hot-tempered convict Mc Murphy, and his usual psycho routine are as convincing as ever. As is, Louise Fletcher in her role of Nurse Ratched, without a doubt one of the greatest film villains of all time. She's callous, unpredictable and a role not many actresses would be able to succeed in doing so to any positive effect. Of course, the supporting cast, (and the nuts as Mc Murphy playfully dubs them) are outstanding. It's brilliant to see pre-stardom talents, such as Christopher Lloyd, Danny DeVito and the undermined Brad Dourif really go into there roles. Some lesser known actors, such as Sydney Lassick as the child-esque Cheswick, William Redfield as the opinionated Harding and the mesmerising performance of Will Sampson as the unforgettable Chief. All the latter three actors, sadly, passed away within years of the film's release.In short, an unbelievably great film - if you were to watch any, make it this one!

His name was Mikhail Suverov and he worked for the Russian mob. To get to the truth about his life, he travels to New York City, specifically the Little Odessa area. While there he must fight gangsters, as well as double-dealing FBI agents. But just about everyone thinks he's Mikhail. Luckily his brother's girlfriend Alex (Henstridge) is along for the ride. Now Alain has to make it back to France in one piece, but not before causing some major Van Damage in the big apple! Maximum Risk is from the good old days when Van Damme movies went to the theater. Thus, it has a high-quality look and feel, and seems to have a decent budget behind it. It's nice to see the high production values used well by the great Ringo Lam, who would later team up with Van Damme again for Replicant and In Hell (2003).It must be in Van Damme's contract to be in movies where he plays two roles. Most actors never get this chance, but Van Damme has. FIVE times. The movies being Double Impact (1991), Maximum Risk, Replicant (2001), Timecop (1994) and The Order (2001). Just why he feels there aren't enough Van Dammes currently on earth, outside of ego, has yet to be explained. To further emphasize his double life, here, in Maximum Risk, Van Damme seeing his reflection is a theme throughout the movie. Glasses, windows, picture frames, and of course mirrors are all employed for psychological purposes. But really this movie is an entertaining thriller that is palatable for general audiences. You don't have to be a Van Damme or martial arts freak to enjoy Maximum Risk.Say what you will about him, but Van Damme has more emotion than Chuck Norris. Or Don The Dragon Wilson. Speaking of Wilson, just as his Bloodfist movies are all 80 minutes, it seems another contract demand of Van Damme is that his movies be at least 100 minutes. Maximum Risk is no exception, so naturally there's some filler, but not much. And a classic cliché is on display the wacky taxi driver is on show once again, but at least this time he has a more substantial part to play than usual.Following another JCVD rule, there has to be a scene where he gets nude or semi-nude. Why, we don't know. Here it's the time-honored bathhouse fight, also seen in such movies as Red Heat (1988) and Showdown in Little Tokyo (1991). But at least there's some Natasha Henstridge nudity as well to right the ship. Henstridge, in only her second-ever movie role (after Species, 1995), looks great, and it's sad to see her end up in Scott Wiper crud like A Better Way to Die (2000), but hey, you gotta make a living.Maximum Risk is solid, undemanding entertainment seemingly made to make the careers of Van Damme and Ringo Lam go over well with larger audiences.

Another noteworthy aspect of this film was its content, specifically the subject matter of the film's main storyline World War II. While this film was at times light and funny - namely the character of Van Meer and his nonchalant responses about birds, and life when being asked very poignant, weighted questions about impending war- overall, it dealt with very serious subject matter, which in my opinion, it did an excellent job of handling. Obviously with this film being made in 1940, America was not engaged in the global conflict yet, but hopefully for those who watched it during that time, this film stood as a call to action against the atrocities taking place in Europe and Asia. The on location shots were excellent, as were the sets and set designs. This is perfectly expressed at the end of the film with the airplane crash scene. As a viewer, I felt for the characters on that plane, which clearly means that both the acting and design of the setting was very believable and true to life.

The gods of time were always against me with this one&#x85; I'd always turn over when it was half way through, or there would be something else I wanted to see on the other side, but I finally bagged & tagged it today! A film of great scope with a lot of action and adventure, it keeps you guessing until the end. I enjoyed it, with a few reservations, but more of that after this brief summary.Late one night, a shadowy figure visits reporter, Rudyard Kipling, in his office in India. The visitor is Peachy Carnehan, and he is there to tell Kipling a tale. He reminds Kipling that they had previously met three years ago when he had witnessed a contract between Peachy and his colleague, and friend, Daniel Dravot. The two men, latter-day confidence tricksters, had recently left the army in India and had decided to go and seek their fortune in the little-known land of Kafiristan. The contract stated that they would abstain from alcohol and women for the duration of their adventure&#x85; amongst other things. They set off and after a torturous journey they finally arrive. Having scared off some natives with their rifles, they are surprised to find a Ghurkha living in one of the villages. He was the only survivor of a geological expedition several years earlier. This man, known as 'Billy Fish' would act as interpreter for the pair. And so they begin their rise to power by persuading the leader of the village to let them train their men so they can defeat all his enemies. Things continue in a similar vein until Daniel is hit with an arrow that doesn't kill him in a battle. Word of this gets back to the holy city of the region and the pair is summoned. I won't say any more because what happens next is key to the whole plot & I don't want the Spoiler Police raising an army and chasing me down.Very well made a beautifully shot, but you wouldn't expect anything less from the likes of John Huston. Great performances all round, particularly from Sean Connery as Daniel Dravot and Michael Caine as Peachy Carnehan, they seemed to spark off each other really well. It's a shame they haven't made more films together on this evidence. Also worthy of note were Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling and Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish.There is some great dialogue in this film and it is delivered with great aplomb by both leading actors. They are supposed to be common men; non-commissioned officers of her majesty's army, and that's just what they speak like. Very much an old-fashioned adventure film, it really delivers on that front. I mentioned there was a problem with it though, and it's that it's just too damn long, you could easily lose thirty minutes of the running time from the beginning and the film would be just as good, if not better (in my book).

The gods of time were always against me with this one&#x85; I'd always turn over when it was half way through, or there would be something else I wanted to see on the other side, but I finally bagged & tagged it today! A film of great scope with a lot of action and adventure, it keeps you guessing until the end. I enjoyed it, with a few reservations, but more of that after this brief summary.Late one night, a shadowy figure visits reporter, Rudyard Kipling, in his office in India. The visitor is Peachy Carnehan, and he is there to tell Kipling a tale. He reminds Kipling that they had previously met three years ago when he had witnessed a contract between Peachy and his colleague, and friend, Daniel Dravot. The two men, latter-day confidence tricksters, had recently left the army in India and had decided to go and seek their fortune in the little-known land of Kafiristan. The contract stated that they would abstain from alcohol and women for the duration of their adventure&#x85; amongst other things. They set off and after a torturous journey they finally arrive. Having scared off some natives with their rifles, they are surprised to find a Ghurkha living in one of the villages. He was the only survivor of a geological expedition several years earlier. This man, known as 'Billy Fish' would act as interpreter for the pair. And so they begin their rise to power by persuading the leader of the village to let them train their men so they can defeat all his enemies. Things continue in a similar vein until Daniel is hit with an arrow that doesn't kill him in a battle. Word of this gets back to the holy city of the region and the pair is summoned. I won't say any more because what happens next is key to the whole plot & I don't want the Spoiler Police raising an army and chasing me down.Very well made a beautifully shot, but you wouldn't expect anything less from the likes of John Huston. Great performances all round, particularly from Sean Connery as Daniel Dravot and Michael Caine as Peachy Carnehan, they seemed to spark off each other really well. It's a shame they haven't made more films together on this evidence. Also worthy of note were Christopher Plummer as Rudyard Kipling and Saeed Jaffrey as Billy Fish.There is some great dialogue in this film and it is delivered with great aplomb by both leading actors. They are supposed to be common men; non-commissioned officers of her majesty's army, and that's just what they speak like. Very much an old-fashioned adventure film, it really delivers on that front.

Dean's passionate devotion to telling the truth, warts and all, is very much in evidence here, particularly in contrast to the falsity of others, foremost, the radio and cartoon-voice actor Jim Backus as Dad, who tries-- how he does!--but fails miserably to come anywhere near Dean's burning truthfulness and pain. Some of the other standard supporting actors are wooden, too, in the then Hollywood and Broadway tradition of just hitting the marks and saying the lines. Amazingly, however, once child-actress now adult Natalie Wood, who often fakes it, sometimes comes very close to what Dean did so naturally, while baby-faced Sal Mineo (never as good) holds his own. Bravo! Director Nicholas Ray had all these young actors, among them young Dennis Hopper, improvise at length and rehearse before shooting, and their work helps. It's a very flawed film, but some of it is first-rate. Ray at his best. Well worth a visit, if only as a brave attempt at telling the truth about American family values, unusual for its times.

Probably the best of the genre is the German film Das Boot offering a look at a naval disaster in the offing from the enemy point of view. K-19 is of similar bent, and just as in Das Boot, the viewer may find himself secretly cheering for the bad guys to find a way out of peril. Yet they're bad only by accident of nationality, following orders of supreme commanders who consider human life throwaway in service to the Fatherland.Based on actual events as recent as 1961, I see that other reviewers who have knowledge of the historical K-19 found it to be more fiction than fact. Putting that aside, I still found the story to be a gripping drama once it became apparent that the crippled sub could be saved only at the expense of ultimate human sacrifice. That there are such men who find their duty to their fellows, their comrades, and not their nation is what becomes inspirational with effective story telling.If you're used to seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo or Indiana Jones, his characterization here as the Russian naval captain may startle you with it's bluntness and lack of compassion. As the hard driving commander, he rides herd on his crew to perform in drill after relentless drill, subliminally preparing them for the disaster that will eventually befall the ship. As the XO, Liam Neeson's Mikhail Polenin is the sympathetic executive officer the crew can relate to, thereby setting up a clever twist when Polenin refuses to take part in the mutiny. The idea that Vostrikov would have sacrificed the crew to avoid triggering a world war was an element that added unexpected nuance to the story.My main takeaway from the picture is an idea I've had all along about the way peoples of different nations can live peacefully together if simply left to their own devices. Good war films project that message, it's the men at the top calling the shots for their own motives who make life miserable for the rest. Taken to it's extreme, competing goals of world domination point the way to mutually assured destruction.

The BEST part was near the end of the interview when the host asked him to pick his two favorite films of Sci Fi and Horror. King thought a few seconds and said it had to be the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and mentioned the scene when Dana Wynter reveals herself to have been taken over and yells for the others to get Kevin McCarthy. He says it was the major influence in his life how scared he became as a young man and still sees it as a huge influence. The other was his choice for absolute worst, and it thrilled me, because I could never find anyone to agree.It was THE SHINING. He had said that Kubrick ruined his book and they disagreed about the ending which Stanley changed based on his own religious views.Nicholson's adlib Here's Johnny! was a farce and King wrote was public about S.K.'s interpretation but commended him of the effects.
