Sure, it isn't as good as Beauty and the Beast, but I think it is definitely one of my favourite Disney movies. It is beautifully constructed, with some of the best animation sequences of recent times. The music score is just delightful. How can I ever forget the animated sequence to A Whole New World? Perfect. Jafar is one of Disney's finest villains, voiced with relish by Jonathan Freeman. Unfortunately, like Shere Kahn, he was another Disney villain that was ruined by a DTV sequel. Aladdin and Jasmine's romance is so believable, and while people have said they are bland, they do appeal to you soon enough. And for me Jasmine along with Esmeralda is one of the sexiest female Disney characters. I actually found it hard to tell what was computer animated, whereas there have been some movies that make a mess of that. I want to guess what is computer animated. The best aspect of this movie, is a hilarious performance from Robin Williams as the Genie If he hadn't ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script could have won an Oscar- that said his genie was a perfect match and fitted with the story very well. Some people say the movie starts off slow. But with the songs and animation, that really isn't an issue. The movie also spawned the best DTV sequel, the King of Thieves. 10\/10.

Only you and the movie know what happened, and the movie's not telling. Such a movie is the original Friday the 13th. By rights, this movie should have been good. Obviously I wasn't expecting a Citizen Kane or a Gone With the Wind, but when one considers that Friday the 13th has spawned eleven various sequels, mash-ups, and remakes which, taken together as a franchise, have grossed nearly $500,000,000 worldwide, that might raise the expectations slightly. Those numbers would make any movie studio proud, and such a cinematic juggernaut has to be based on an incredibly strong foundation, right? The answer is not so much, actually. Watching the first film, one gets the sense that the sequels are basically unplanned pregnancies that just sort of happened, and not the result of careful planned franchise-hood.Truly, I gave it every chance to succeed.

Stop criticising it, because it is unfaithful to the book. There are some parts of the book, that just wouldn't work, like the character of Clopin, if he was the same as he was in the book he would be too frightening for kids. Don't get me wrong, it is an amazing book, but a very complex one as well. Of course, it is more adult than most Disney movies, but it means it is mature, and I found it a dark, powerful, poignant and really chilling film, if in comparison to other Disney movies is slightly disappointing. The IMDb rating for this movie is far too low, it deserves a 7.0 to be honest. The animation is fantastic, so crisp and smooth. Notre Dame has never looked so magnificent, even in real life. The highlight was Quasimodo saving Esmeralda from getting burnt at the stake, accompanied by a hauntingly-beautiful Dies Irae. The characters are also well done, and so is the theme-driven story, and the themes are very mature and complex. Speaking of the characters, I know all of them had changed, but they were so well-developed, unlike Black Cauldron. Quasimodo was poignantly voiced by Tom Hulce, and his character is possibly the most sensitive character in Disney history. Esmeralda was brilliantly voiced by Demi Moore, who brought a little bit of herself into the role. She is feisty and beautiful. When you look into her eyes, you instantly know how wrong Frollo is about her. I have always loved her hair, but her chief beauty are her eyes, a beautiful colour and filled with such sadness. Frollo is a very complex villain, and the sinister timbre of Tony Jay's voice flawlessly matched that. The sequence in front of the fireplace was a definite highlight and gave me goosebumps, as well as his death scene. He looked evil! Then there is Clopin, a very underrated and relevant character. Paul Kandel voiced him marvellously and his singing was out of this world. Pheobus was the most changed character, but Kevin Kline was really funny here. I liked the gargoyles, they were very funny. However, my only criticism about this movie, is to do with them. I liked their song Guy Like You but it was misplaced. It should have been put there 20 minutes earlier, not when Paris is burning down. The songs are on the whole just brilliant, and the score so powerful and emphatic! The magnificent opening is the best beginning to a Disney movie. Out there is very heartfelt, and Topsy Turvey is great fun. God help the Outcasts is hauntingly beautiful. The only song I had a problem with was the song in the Court of Miracles, because I couldn't hear a word they were singing, and I loved Someday and Heaven's Light. Some bits made me laugh, but there were plenty of scenes that made me cry, especially when Quasimodo thinks Esmeralda is dead, and he is seen comforting her body. Really poignant!

The highlight was Quasimodo saving Esmeralda from getting burnt at the stake, accompanied by a hauntingly-beautiful Dies Irae. The characters are also well done, and so is the theme-driven story, and the themes are very mature and complex. Speaking of the characters, I know all of them had changed, but they were so well-developed, unlike Black Cauldron. Quasimodo was poignantly voiced by Tom Hulce, and his character is possibly the most sensitive character in Disney history. Esmeralda was brilliantly voiced by Demi Moore, who brought a little bit of herself into the role. She is feisty and beautiful. When you look into her eyes, you instantly know how wrong Frollo is about her. I have always loved her hair, but her chief beauty are her eyes, a beautiful colour and filled with such sadness. Frollo is a very complex villain, and the sinister timbre of Tony Jay's voice flawlessly matched that. The sequence in front of the fireplace was a definite highlight and gave me goosebumps, as well as his death scene. He looked evil! Then there is Clopin, a very underrated and relevant character. Paul Kandel voiced him marvellously and his singing was out of this world. Pheobus was the most changed character, but Kevin Kline was really funny here. I liked the gargoyles, they were very funny. However, my only criticism about this movie, is to do with them. I liked their song Guy Like You but it was misplaced. It should have been put there 20 minutes earlier, not when Paris is burning down. The songs are on the whole just brilliant, and the score so powerful and emphatic! The magnificent opening is the best beginning to a Disney movie. Out there is very heartfelt, and Topsy Turvey is great fun. God help the Outcasts is hauntingly beautiful. The only song I had a problem with was the song in the Court of Miracles, because I couldn't hear a word they were singing, and I loved Someday and Heaven's Light. Some bits made me laugh, but there were plenty of scenes that made me cry, especially when Quasimodo thinks Esmeralda is dead, and he is seen comforting her body. Really poignant! In conclusion, a brilliant movie, with one of the most poignant endings in an animated film. 9\/10, though it was so close to a 10.

What we have instead is two versions of Emma that came out within a year of each other. The Gwyneth Paltrow (GP) version and the Kate Beckinsale (KB) version. Both are feature film length with the GP version being approximately five minutes longer. So how did it do? Well the important thing about cramming a five hour story into 1 hour fifty is to know what to leave out and what to keep in obviously. There are several aspects of the story that must be brought to the viewers attention. First is that Emma is a match maker and both the GP and KB versions did this. Second is that Emma takes Harriet Smith under her wing and again both versions managed this. Thirdly that Miss Bates is a bit of a chatterbox and both versions managed this and then there is a divergence. An important part of the story is the arrival of Frank Churchill and his seemingly indifference to Jane Fairfax and his caring for Emma. In the KB version this is accurately portrayed with him seemingly reluctant to call on Miss Bates hence Jane Fairfax and his adverse comments about Jane's complexion and his hints that Jane had a thing for Mr Dixon. However in the GP version it was barely touched on and he did not appear to favour Emma over Jane. For instance he sang with both Emma and Jane and at the picnic he sat by Jane and not Emma whereas in the KB version he only sang with Emma and at box hill he sat with Emma. Another telling divergence is that Harriet Smith's liking for Mr Knightly is not properly shown to us in the GP version. In the KB version at the dance we see Harriet quite clearly being blanked by Mr Elton and then Knightly seeing this and making a point of dancing with Harriet and Harriet's happiness that Mr Knightly did dance with her. In the GP version we saw the blanking but it was not made clear that Knightly then danced with Harriet himself. This is important because it reveals why Harriet thinks that Knightly cares for her. I gave the GP version 7 out of ten because of Sophie Thompsons portrayal of Miss Bates. The scene at box hill when she is insulted by Emma was brilliant. I had a tear in my eye when Miss Bates realised she had been insulted by Emma. So while the GP version of Emma was good in my opinion the KB version is superior because it does bring out the points in the story that need to be brought out.

Whereas the first version was true to the book, Boris Sagal's version is simply loosely based on the novel. A couple of concepts were changed such as the antagonists no longer being vampires but zombie-like victims of biological warfare. Vampires in 1972 were really no longer a concept for horror films. The other reason is that Neville had to be a morally ambiguous character. In the book it turns out in the end that really he was the monster or that fighting monsters turned him into a monster. Neville in The Omega Man is an officer who was actively involved in developing biological warfare and so his personal hell seems to be a fitting punishment. The film is very much about innocence vs. experience. Neville remains in the city and kills his oponents in meaningless fights because tha's all there is left in his life. His life is validated by having an oponent- an almost Kafkaesque concept. So naturally, when he meets a group of survivors they are children. Some critics thought that his was a document about American fixation youth and being young. In fact, they plan to go t a new Eden but there is no place for Neville, because he is -as one boy puts it- hostile. So although in the end we see him as crucified (and more or less resurected through his blood) he is more like Virgil who lead Dante to the gates of paradise but was not allowed to enter himself. The film is very well written in terms of creating sympathy for Neville and then bit by bit deconstructing his character. Neville is very complex, a scientist, a ruthless killer and yet a man who recites poetry and loves art. Heston gives an overall fine performance. There is one beautiful scene where Heston plays chess against a bust of Caesar and you really wonder if he is aware of the fact that he is playing both sides. Visually the film is very well made In the first 9 minutes we just watch Neville driving through LA and as a prime example of showing vs. telling without any dialogue we begin to understand what has happened so that the following flashback really is unnecessary and relatively crude for such a well made and well written film. In spite of the technical limitations of the early 70s Sagal manages to create a feel of emptiness about LA that is masterfully executed. On the other hand the film does have some incredible holes in the logic and some continuity bloopers. But all in all I would say that The Omega Man is a highly underrated film which works both as an action film and as a statement on the human condition.

Upon a second viewing of Blowup only yesterday on the TCM channel, however, I have discovered something new, and it is this There is wonderful, cruel irony in Thomas enlarging his b&ws and yet becoming ever more puzzled by what could be a mystery in his life of ennui. It's, like, totally Hitchcockian.It is as though David Hemmings' Thomas channels Jimmy Stewart's character in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, carrying out his photographic skills as second nature while trying to play P.I. Not only are both men good at their job, but also they possibly could be risking their lives. As Stewart was in Rear Window a decade earlier, Thomas is faced with the unknown -- with that which cannot be seen but indeed can be intuited. Think of that classic image of the young\/old lady If you stare long and hard enough, you perceive what you want. Yeah, it's called a self-fulfilling prophecy.Yesterday, when I watched Thomas examining certain elements of his blowups, immediately my mind turned to certain scenes in Rear Window where Stewart sees what *could be* evidence of a crime already committed. In both films, however, the viewer is not let in on the facts of the case and, thus, does not know *if* a crime was committed. In both films, the elements of time and lighting are other characters, just not included in the credits.Also, as an artist, during my second viewing of Blowup I relished in the realm of illusion symbolized by the film's bold colors and the use of drugs (including nicotine) as props to reinforce the illusion. Not that I have ever taken an illegal drug in my life, but this second time around watching Blowup gave me the feeling that Antonioni was taking me on a psychedelic trip. The beautiful part, baby, is throughout Blowup I connected with the metaphysical crisis that Thomas experiences as an artist in need of a self-assessment of his worth as an adult human being.After vicariously suffering through his mental defrag while he deconstructs each chunk of a photographed mystery, I thirsted for visual relief. I also needed mango sorbetto, and once seated in front of the television again, I welcomed Antonioni's mini-masterpieces of distraction. In no particular order, I was mesmerized by moving colors in the form of the female models tumbling with Thomas as he pulls off their costumes among the purple paper in a well-edited, living-color orgy sequence. Progressive jazz courtesy of Herbie Hancock and his ensemble transform a curt and fleeting mystery lady (played by Vanessa Redgrave) into, literally, a smoking woman. Remarkably, Redgrave manages to resemble Anouk Aimee in Claude Lelouch's Un Homme et Une Femme, thanks to her mannerisms and, perhaps, the movie's hair stylist and makeup artist.The most delicious distraction for this voyeur, er, viewer, was one that provided insight into Thomas' solitude. It's a scene that magnifies his alienation, an existence that is more stripped-down than mere loneliness, and for him it occurs outside of his fashion-and-photography sphere. I am referring to the scene in which Thomas comes upon his painter friend making love with the latter's girlfriend, Patricia (portrayed by Sarah Miles). Thomas' eyes lock onto Patricia's while she squirms beneath a bright duvet and moans toward climax (either a true or fake one, in keeping with the film's shifting theme). It is the one moment in the film that I nearly sympathize with this Peeping Thomas because it's a painful glimpse into unrequited love. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the absurd angle of the painter friend, who appears absorbed in his own ecstatic abstraction instead of engaged in the erotic action.Blowup is located at the intersection of minimalist thriller and surreal character study. That is my compliment to the late great Michaelangelo Antonioni. Anytime I can catch this addictive 1966 film on my cable lineup, I will delight in its visual diversions from everyday, black-and-white existential angst.

The beautiful part, baby, is throughout Blowup I connected with the metaphysical crisis that Thomas experiences as an artist in need of a self-assessment of his worth as an adult human being.After vicariously suffering through his mental defrag while he deconstructs each chunk of a photographed mystery, I thirsted for visual relief. I also needed mango sorbetto, and once seated in front of the television again, I welcomed Antonioni's mini-masterpieces of distraction. In no particular order, I was mesmerized by moving colors in the form of the female models tumbling with Thomas as he pulls off their costumes among the purple paper in a well-edited, living-color orgy sequence. Progressive jazz courtesy of Herbie Hancock and his ensemble transform a curt and fleeting mystery lady (played by Vanessa Redgrave) into, literally, a smoking woman. Remarkably, Redgrave manages to resemble Anouk Aimee in Claude Lelouch's Un Homme et Une Femme, thanks to her mannerisms and, perhaps, the movie's hair stylist and makeup artist.The most delicious distraction for this voyeur, er, viewer, was one that provided insight into Thomas' solitude. It's a scene that magnifies his alienation, an existence that is more stripped-down than mere loneliness, and for him it occurs outside of his fashion-and-photography sphere. I am referring to the scene in which Thomas comes upon his painter friend making love with the latter's girlfriend, Patricia (portrayed by Sarah Miles). Thomas' eyes lock onto Patricia's while she squirms beneath a bright duvet and moans toward climax (either a true or fake one, in keeping with the film's shifting theme). It is the one moment in the film that I nearly sympathize with this Peeping Thomas because it's a painful glimpse into unrequited love. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the absurd angle of the painter friend, who appears absorbed in his own ecstatic abstraction instead of engaged in the erotic action.Blowup is located at the intersection of minimalist thriller and surreal character study. That is my compliment to the late great Michaelangelo Antonioni. Anytime I can catch this addictive 1966 film on my cable lineup, I will delight in its visual diversions from everyday, black-and-white existential angst. The virtual walk-through in Thomas' duplex alone is a hippie trip at a safe distance.After nearly 50 years since Blowup was released, it's still not every artist who can afford an interior designer to infuse his or her vain existence with a groovy dose of mad, mod colors. So if Blowout doesn't appear on your cable lineup in months to come, get thee to a vintage shop and ... dig it.

Most of the reviews and even plot synopsizes blatantly reveal the events occurring during the last fifteen minutes of the film, and that really can't be the point since the first hour and an half mysteriously builds up towards that. I simply dropped an eye on the plot keywords and already the movie was more or less ruined to me, so I'll do my extra best not to reveal too much but that is difficult, seeing that even referring to similar films might be saying too much. The Stepford Wives is a fresh and engaging Sci-Fi\/suburban black comedy, adapted from a novel written by the same guy who also thought up Rosemary's Baby and The Boys from Brazil (what further recommendation do you need?) and atmospherically taking place in the typically 'small town with a dark secret' setting. The pacing is rather slow and director Bryon Forbes patiently takes the time to draw the characters and the town's mentality, so this honestly isn't the ideal film for horror fanatics swearing by violent 70's trash & exploitation. On the other hand, if you appreciate moody ambiances and unusual concepts, I can warmly recommend The Stepford Wives. Housewife and amateur photographer Joanna Eberhart is a bit overwhelmed when her husband Walter suddenly decides to leave Manhattan and settle in the suburban dream called Stepford. She tries to adapt but simply doesn't fit in with the other women in town, since they are so frustratingly docile and obedient to their husbands. While the male population of Stanford gathers in exclusive clubs and do whatever they please, their wives can only talk about cooking and cleaning. Joanna eventually does befriend a couple of other newly-arrived women, but when their personas also abruptly change, she's convinced there's something very wrong in this town. The plot, build-up and denouement bear some obvious resemblances to another milestone in the Sci-Fi genre; released first in the late 50's and once again in another and equally impressive version during the late 70's. Can't really state the title, but people with only a moderate interest in the genre will already know which one I'm referring to. But nonetheless, this movie definitely has its own solid character and personality (pun intended) and multiple sequences &#150; especially near the end &#150; are stupendous. Terrific acting performances from Katharine Ross and Paula Prentiss and the masterful musical guidance from Maurice Small contribute to the great power as well.

Strike' stomach is killing him all the time because of the stress. They never say it out right in the movie but it has to be a ulcer eating away at his stomach lining. Clockers is a real smart movie about human side of drug dealing. As much as people hate drug dealers they are human. What Spike did was show that human side of a society boogey man. Anyone that has been forced in to a situation can relate. My brother joined the Army knowing he might have to shoot at people. It still don't prepare you he wrote me. I've watched Clockers damn near a hundred times. The knowledge Spike is dishing out is real to its core. There were big names in this like Harvey Keitel but the real deal was lesser known actors coming thru hard. Hassan Johnson has a small part. You might know him from The Wire. Hassan lights it up every single time he on camera. Spike discovered him I guess. Like Oliver Stone there are people that love or hate a Spike Lee joint.

I was always trying to figure out what was the characters true motive behind certain actions.I also was anxious to see what was going to happen next which was a gift in a romance film. The angles and shots of certain objects and body parts was a good way to tell the story without it being so obvious what was going on. The cinematography was brilliant and the other elements of this film complimented it very well like the costumes,set design, music, and color schemes of the film. Ms. Chan's costumes revealed so much about her character and insecurities inside because she always dressed up and presented her self in a beautiful way to make sure people did not feel sorry for her loneliness. Her dresses reminded me of a soldier's armor because of the long neck and two sleeves and she seemed to be well covered and protected but beautiful. The music was so slow and at some points it dragged the film along to help us understand the frustration of two people in love holding back their passion for one another. It creates a frustration so you can relate to what the characters are feeling. The use of color made it gloomy in their apartment building which helped me understand that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan's mysterious emotion for each other is about the only excitement around in their life and surroundings. Very artistic and challenging to watch because it challenged me to be patient and allow the love story to unfold and it grieved me of how I expect in a romance film for two people to fulfill their selfish desires regardless of their immoral choices for the false illusion of love which is emotion.

I have seen this movie on many occasions, and it never fails to amaze me. The kids shown in this movie are just what they should be; not sugar-coated, obnoxious, whiny or arrogant. The movie is family-friendly, and not in a bad way either.The setting takes place in the early 1960s. A kid named Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood and soon gets involved with a group of baseball buddies in some hilarious, memorable moments. Throughout the movie, he narrates how he got into the biggest pickle, and how it was one of the biggest summers of his early life. Benny Rodriguez, the neighborhood hero, accepts him into the Sandlot, and he soon learns of the sport of baseball. Then, he hears the tale of 'The Beast', who the kids fear that he might eat them and take their beloved sport away. At first, Smalls doesn't believe the story, but soon realizes that he fears 'The Beast' just as much as they do. In a string of hilarious scenes, the boys will do anything to save their pals and the Sandlot.A turning point in the movie is when Smalls takes his stepfather's autographed Babe Ruth baseball to continue on with the game. After he whacks the ball into the yard of 'The Beast', he soon fears that the ball may be history. The boys devise a plan to bring the ball back, even if it means being inside the territory of 'The Beast'.Because I don't want to spoil too much, the movie in itself is one that you'll come back for again and again. It captures that childhood innocence almost perfectly, and it contains that feeling that is rarely felt in other childhood films. Anyone who grew up in Southern California during the 1950s and 1960s should feel right at home when they watch this film. Even though the film wasn't actually filmed there, it still depicts the era in which it was cast.The Sandlot also reminds us of the days when kids would play outside during the long summer days, before the world became indulged in video games, text messaging, and surfing the Web. The actors in here all give a solid performance, at the very least above average. They aren't really well known, but just as with everything else, not all famous actors are good and not all child actors are bad. To make a long story short, the Sandlot is a well made film that will entertain kids and adults alike.Despite seeing the movie several times, I still enjoy it for what it is. Although it's not perfect (what movie is?), I highly recommend this movie for those nostalgic of simpler times and those obsessed with baseball.8 out of 10.

From first frame to last, this magical movie transports you to a world that most humans have almost forgotten, where real feelings and sensations are the stuff of life. And death! All with food as the basic ingredient.The film revolves around the basic plot of the hero arriving to save the damsel in distress but frequently branches off to individual nuggets, pearls of wisdom, just plain weirdness, flights of fancy and pure hokum that would serve no purpose in any other setting but here serve to provide the most satisfying cinematic meal I can ever recall. No kidding.The references throughout the film mix a reverence of Japanese and European food culture, nods to the western film style and many other in and no-so-in jokes that sometimes only become clear after the third, fourth or fifth viewing. It's a keeper and you will come back to it - and for sure it a GREAT date movie, or just one to share with good friends. Oh, but it's no Disney flick. If I'm painting too rosy a picture, it should be noted that there are real tragic moments in this film too - the scene where a young mother dies just after cooking her last meal for the family and then the distraught father makes their even more distraught kids eat 'Mom's last meal while it's hot' lives long in the memory. There are also moments of bladder-loosening humour and I won't spoil the jokes by telling them here. It's a living film.Bound to appear on the favourites list of anyone who sees it. Such a shame that it has not had more exposure. I first encountered it on UK's channel 4 TV sometime around the late 80's. I was utterly mesmerised and spent many a year trying to locate a copy on VHS and eventually gave up. I asked so many people if they had seen it and - err, no never heard of it. So when I saw a dodgy Chinese DVD copy with subtitles on eBay - well I just had to throw away my morals and buy it! Glad I did.For example I just lent this to a friend who had never heard of it and the response came back 'F***! where in the hell has this flick been hiding? It's a total killer!'
