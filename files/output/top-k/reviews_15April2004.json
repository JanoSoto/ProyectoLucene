Massacre, inspired in part by the real life of serial killer Ed Gein, tells the horrifying story of five teenagers who are on a drive through the Texas country. They pick up a hitchhiker, which naturally turns out to be a bad idea. He cuts one of them (doesn't kill him), and then gets out. They stop by a house and encounter the cannibalistic family that lives there.From what I just described, you'd expect this film to be another slice and dice horror movie because it has such a narrow plot. That is not so with this film. What you end up getting from this film is a grueling experience in sheer terror. The cinematography is eerie (as to match the tone of the film and heighten the experience) and adds new dimensions to a one-sided and (typically) empty genre.One of the many reasons Massacre works is because of the extreme, macabre nature of the film. The events unfolding in front of us (the dinner scene, Marilyn Burns's chase through the woods with Leatherface right behind her) occur in such a surreal and frightening fashion that we have to step back and ask ourselves, Is this stuff really happening? I know I asked myself that question several times during my first viewing of this film. Tobe Hooper made one of the best and most influential horror films in 1974 and certainly one of the most memorable movie maniacs of all time - Leatherface. Leatherface is played to grisly perfection by Gunnar Hansen (his face is never actually seen). He is just so convincingly played as both an idiot and a cold-blooded killer; it's a shame that he was skipped over by the Academy.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best horror films I have and probably ever will see.

I'm not saying that story line in Blade Runner is bad, it's far from it.

Immediately you are immersed in a dark, bleak, yet hypnotically beautiful world of the future.

It does everything right; it's visually stunning, even now after 20yrs ; acting is brilliant, especially Rutger Hauer; and it also has one of the best movie sound tracks.

They picked Supergirl as something fun and unthreatening.  I have been hooked on film ever since!  Supergirl is a hugely under-rated movie, and while I can take on board some of the negative comments you read here, I also think they're a bit harsh.  Come on people (you know who you are), it's a fantasy film!  If it played the same as Superman (another great), there would be no point in making it in the first place.  Sure the magic angle is slightly odd, but what the hell, it's a fun film which doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't go in for over the top slapstick either (take heed Richard Lester!!).  And of course the effects are a little dated, it is 20 years old after all (though many still look great).  Jerry Goldsmith's score it beautiful and lyrical, as it should be, becoming triumphantly heroic when it needs to (The main theme is tremendous, even with the eighties electronic whooshes and eagle squarks).  Helen Slater is gorgeous in the lead role, and considering this was her first major role, she does a commendable job.  Then there's Miss Dunaway first rate as always-you can almost see the scenery going down her throat, but that's part of the charm of the character.  All the actors come off well, and if you ignore some bits and pieces (there's still some huge plot holes even in the Directors Cut!) you should have a great time.  It would be interesting to see a remake that perhaps didn't stray so far from the source mythology (was the omegahedron in the comics?), but on the other hand, the eighties was a different time, and perhaps today's climate (whether the world could use a super-hero or not) is not right to relaunch the poor girl to Earth. One of my all time favourites, and I'm glad to see so many other fans on the IMDB.  Let's lobby Anchor Bay for an official Region 2 version.  My TV can't broadcast NTSC signals, so have to watch it in black & white, or in jerky (but colour) vision on a slow laptop. Peace.  Out.

They picked Supergirl as something fun and unthreatening.  I have been hooked on film ever since!  Supergirl is a hugely under-rated movie, and while I can take on board some of the negative comments you read here, I also think they're a bit harsh.  Come on people (you know who you are), it's a fantasy film!  If it played the same as Superman (another great), there would be no point in making it in the first place.  Sure the magic angle is slightly odd, but what the hell, it's a fun film which doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't go in for over the top slapstick either (take heed Richard Lester!!).  And of course the effects are a little dated, it is 20 years old after all (though many still look great).  Jerry Goldsmith's score it beautiful and lyrical, as it should be, becoming triumphantly heroic when it needs to (The main theme is tremendous, even with the eighties electronic whooshes and eagle squarks).  Helen Slater is gorgeous in the lead role, and considering this was her first major role, she does a commendable job.

It's so sad yet so happy, I love the way Benji (Higgins) looks, his theme song in the movie, his name, everything! One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Benji falls in love with Tiffany and the part when he ran in slow motion to save Paul and Cindy, that scene I almost bawled my eyes out. I first seen it on T.V. and I started watching it like in the middle of it. Then one day I rented it, and boy I'm glad I did. Then I got the story line better then I just cried and cried and cried! I have my stepsister to thanks because she told me it was on T.V. and I just love dogs. Oh I know what your thinking and yes I am obsessed with this loveable dog.

I am convinced after seeing the flick, that PT is probably a genius of some kind.  He wrote the screenplay in two weeks.  Plus, I note that he is one of those directors that recycles his actors!!!  Many Boogie Nights alum were present and accounted for.  I think Phillip Seymour Hoffman is amazing.  And, I am convinced that John C. Reilly is off the charts great.  He has been consistently good in everything I have seen him in from The Good Girl to Chicago...even The Perfect Storm. Finally, without question, this is Tom Cruise's finest work and that Oscar nom was duly warranted. This is truly an amazing film.

However, although the Rambo name was later seen on action figures and cartoon shows, and the back end of tireless jokes referring to his weapons and seemingly superhuman abilities; the John Rambo character that was originally introduced to us was complex and intriguing.  The message behind First Blood is a familiar, yet engaging one....which made the film great.  Very low-key in its approach, it gets straight to the point  Vietnam veteran returns to the country he fought for and loved, only to be looked down upon and chastised.  The characters in First Blood take it to another, more despicable level; namely picking on him for no reason and driving him to the point where he snaps (understandably) and wreaks havoc on the town.  What I love about First Blood is how realistic it is.... everything that happens is in the realm of possibility; no suspension of disbelief needed here. It's more of a drama than the other two sequels; the pacing is great.  Stallone turned in a great performance as the withdrawn, spooked Green Beret vet who just wanted to live a normal life and try (albeit impossible) to forget about his horrific experiences in the war (Vietnam).  You can't help but feel sorry for him throughout the movie.  He first tries to reach out to the only thing that he knows 'back in the world' (his good friend who he fought with in the war), only to find out that he's since died of cancer.  To make matters worse, its suggested that he died from the gases consumed during the war.....even at 'home' Rambo can't get away from the war.  With nothing else to turn to he wanders, minding his business when he's pushed by the local police to the point where he snaps and goes on a rampage.  The last scene between him and Trautman is beautifully depressing, as Rambo finally breaks down.  It's a wonderful story, helped by Stallone's great performance.  He was able to balance the killing machine side with the helpless, sensitive side of the character flawlessly.  Definitely one of Stallone's best films, a classic in my eyes. ***1\/2 out of **** stars.
