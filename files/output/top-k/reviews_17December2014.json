Well, in this movie Amelie does that same exact think just that in a very peculiar way I think, and placing other's problems and lives first than hers. On this love adventure you will Amelie would do everything that is necessary for her to find love and figure out who she really is. Her normal daily life of skipping rocks and working in a coffee shop will have a huge turn upside down and that will change her life for the better. And that truth is that Amelie is such a normal person such as me or whoever is reading this, and I think that is what makes this movie very personal with the watcher. The story of this film is portrayed in a very well matter, with the help of our fellow narrator who introduces the film very fast but in a very detailed way. Amelie Poulain was raised by her parents in France, and she was home-schooled by her mother ho was a teacher. Unfortunately for Amelie's family her mother died in an accident and that left Amelie alone with her father, and when she was old enough she left her house and moved to the city. In the city the narrator introduces many characters to us, for example, Amelie's co-workers, and neighbors. There are other characters of the movie like Nino who are not introduced at all by the narrator, they only just appear in the movie leaving the watcher wondering who the character is. This technique of giving small details on some characters is very typical of European cinema, and that is one thing we need to remember while watching the movie, the fact that is comes from a different culture. I think that the cast for this movie was very well chosen because most of the characters, if not all, portrayed their roles perfectly. The characters are introduced by the narrator very vastly giving the watcher all of their characteristics, or some characters are not introduced until the end of the movie with actions from other characters. For example, the role of the main character, Amelie, is performed by Audrey Tautou and she does a perfect job on the role. Many times throughout the movie the watcher can see and feel Amelie's emotions and she does not express them clearly but based on her gestures and actions the watcher can imply how she feels. European movies are also known to make the watchers wonder and think, and that is an example of how it is done in Amelie. All of the characters seemed very natural in speech and manner I did not find even one character who did not convince me. the strong emotions are also very well done and acted by the other characters, not only Amelie. Photography in the movie is also very well done and it is also done in a very peculiar and specific manner. There are different camera movements and shots in the movie but what is very interesting in this movie is the color. Amelie uses a lot the color yellow, and when I say a lot I mean it, the movie makes it look like if Amelie's world is yellow through her eyes. At the end of the movie the colors change and the movie starts to be filled with color, and that is because the color symbolizes Amelie's change in her life some would say and I might agree on that although I am not very sure.The photography of this movie helps it picture Paris in a way nobody has ever scene in it in a film. I think that the settings were simple but they kind of helped the watcher focus in what they needed to pay attention because in some movies the settings can distract the watcher from the film itself. The settings of the movie help act out the scenes because they are very simple so the audience wouldn't get lost at any time, or confused with the scene. I really do not mind those simple scene because like I said before the movie comes from France and probably all of the directors and producers had to fund the sets. The director of this movie was Jean-Pierre Jeunet and he really was key to the movies success. As I said before because of this movie coming from France maybe he had to put some money out of his pocket to make it possible to film it. He is the mastermind after all of those little details of the transitions (which are kind of weird when you see the move at first), the music, and the colors. I think that he could handle pretty well all types of scenes, the ones of love, the ones of comedy for example. The edition that the director made of this movie was also great and when you see the movie you will understand that there are many touches he adds for the movie to feel almost like a fairy tale. There are many more reasons why you should see this movie, but the web page only lets me write a thousand words. I would give this movie a 4\/5 stars and I really recommend it for watchers who want to see a foreign movie. Also I recommend it because when the movie finally ends and Amelie gets her life together, you start thinking about your own life and if you really know yourself. That thinking that happens at the end is different for everyone and who knows you might end up turning your life around like Amelie.

So Taylor and this other guy escape the Higher humans prison cell and when they make their way out the Apes attack and it ends with them blowing up the world, basically killing all life.

Wouldn't they know that going into an underground church where there's something that's still functional that obliterates almost everything in the area be more feared then worshiped, another thing that bugs me is that the bomb is worshiped in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY as Christianity. Isn't every religion meant to be celebrated differently? It just doesn't add up.Aside from that ranting and even more things to complain about this movie is not without it's benefits. The sets of the underground cave are really well done and the make-up is better then ever and the cinematography works for what it's trying to do.So it's not entirely awful it just has some really big problems that just detract from the enjoyment of the movie.

The effects were not as good back then; there was no color; the actors seem to still be adjusting to the studio; the directors and producers did not yet have a century of experience to draw from. However, for the first time, watching Metropolis, I feel like lowering the bar is not necessary&#x85;well, most of the time.The story has its good and its bad moments. It is very sci-fi adventure and has many modern elements like a person's evil double or the final physical fight between the villain and the protagonist. Watching this film, a bunch of other movies flashed before my eyes, from Blade Runner to Matrix to Judge Dredd. The setting is a dystopian future, with extreme difference between the ruling and working classes. It is a theme that countless other movies would later pick and which eventually developed into an artistic style called cyberpunk. As the center for the story this is not particularly exciting because it is the most simplistic and worn-out theme for a sci-fi movie today, except&#x85;back in 1927 it may have been closer to reality than it is today and not nearly as worn out yet, at least not on film.Either way, the film does interesting stuff with its story, sending the main character on an adventure through the futuristic city. The movie introduces strong Christian themes, but they are modified to fit the story and the futuristic setting and work really well.In the second half of the film the story takes a few unpleasant turns. At one point, the film decided to skip a whole scene and instead give the viewer a title card explaining what had happened &#x96; a choice that comes out of nowhere and does not repeat itself. Furthermore, believability issues arise, like when the enraged masses suddenly forget about their children being in danger. The ending also feels rushed and not very plausible. These strange story points come across much better if you take the film as an abstract piece and its events as symbolic, but the movie does not play it like that. Its characters are straight with real motivations.The acting is interesting. The leader of the city is played by Alfred Abel and this guy is phenomenal. He does so much with just his eyes alone.But sometimes the characters overact, especially the character who plays the crazy scientist. Arms are swinging around and fingers are inventing more extreme ways to bend at the joints, which feels unnecessary though it was quite normal for the time of silent movies.The best thing about Metropolis is probably the way it looks and it looks great even by today's standards. It is hard to take your eyes off the art. The sense of scale is stunning. The sets are huge and the makers took full advantage of the available room, making them look even bigger than they are. The movie has special effects, half a century before the first computer effect. The fact that the film is in black and white does not even seem like a limitation. If Metropolis was released today, it would probably also be in black and white because it suits this film and its themes very well.The scale, the architecture, the way the lights reflect in the irises of the actors. This movie is must-see even if you do not care for the story. It is amazing that this was made in the Weimar Republic that had only recently come out of an economic black hole.Do some of the things look a bit artificial? Well, yes. Propeller bi-planes show up and obviously feel a bit outdated. The robot design is archaic. But even the things that look dated still fit perfectly with the artistic style of the film. As for the music, the Germans have not lost touch with their roots. Heavy tubas and big drums give an epic and heavy feel to the machine city. Sometimes there is a distinct melody, other times the tune can get a bit generic, but it remains effective.Metropolis is a film that is ahead of its time. Replace some of the older props, add voices and you have yourself a modern sci-fi film. There may be some issues with the effectiveness of its story, especially in the 2nd half, but overall it was is a very interesting watch.

The effects were not as good back then; there was no color; the actors seem to still be adjusting to the studio; the directors and producers did not yet have a century of experience to draw from. However, for the first time, watching Metropolis, I feel like lowering the bar is not necessary&#x85;well, most of the time.The story has its good and its bad moments. It is very sci-fi adventure and has many modern elements like a person's evil double or the final physical fight between the villain and the protagonist. Watching this film, a bunch of other movies flashed before my eyes, from Blade Runner to Matrix to Judge Dredd. The setting is a dystopian future, with extreme difference between the ruling and working classes. It is a theme that countless other movies would later pick and which eventually developed into an artistic style called cyberpunk. As the center for the story this is not particularly exciting because it is the most simplistic and worn-out theme for a sci-fi movie today, except&#x85;back in 1927 it may have been closer to reality than it is today and not nearly as worn out yet, at least not on film.Either way, the film does interesting stuff with its story, sending the main character on an adventure through the futuristic city. The movie introduces strong Christian themes, but they are modified to fit the story and the futuristic setting and work really well.In the second half of the film the story takes a few unpleasant turns. At one point, the film decided to skip a whole scene and instead give the viewer a title card explaining what had happened &#x96; a choice that comes out of nowhere and does not repeat itself. Furthermore, believability issues arise, like when the enraged masses suddenly forget about their children being in danger. The ending also feels rushed and not very plausible. These strange story points come across much better if you take the film as an abstract piece and its events as symbolic, but the movie does not play it like that. Its characters are straight with real motivations.The acting is interesting. The leader of the city is played by Alfred Abel and this guy is phenomenal. He does so much with just his eyes alone.But sometimes the characters overact, especially the character who plays the crazy scientist. Arms are swinging around and fingers are inventing more extreme ways to bend at the joints, which feels unnecessary though it was quite normal for the time of silent movies.The best thing about Metropolis is probably the way it looks and it looks great even by today's standards. It is hard to take your eyes off the art. The sense of scale is stunning. The sets are huge and the makers took full advantage of the available room, making them look even bigger than they are. The movie has special effects, half a century before the first computer effect. The fact that the film is in black and white does not even seem like a limitation. If Metropolis was released today, it would probably also be in black and white because it suits this film and its themes very well.The scale, the architecture, the way the lights reflect in the irises of the actors. This movie is must-see even if you do not care for the story. It is amazing that this was made in the Weimar Republic that had only recently come out of an economic black hole.Do some of the things look a bit artificial? Well, yes. Propeller bi-planes show up and obviously feel a bit outdated. The robot design is archaic. But even the things that look dated still fit perfectly with the artistic style of the film. As for the music, the Germans have not lost touch with their roots. Heavy tubas and big drums give an epic and heavy feel to the machine city. Sometimes there is a distinct melody, other times the tune can get a bit generic, but it remains effective.Metropolis is a film that is ahead of its time. Replace some of the older props, add voices and you have yourself a modern sci-fi film. There may be some issues with the effectiveness of its story, especially in the 2nd half, but overall it was is a very interesting watch.

In the movie the main character, Amelie starts experimenting her first love adventures. Throughout the movie we can see that she is kind of trying to figure out how she really. She has a very hard time trying to deal with the real life. This is because of her parents, mostly her dad that since she was a child he always said she had mental problems or something in her brain. She lived a very isolated life since she was a child until she had a separate life from her dad. The narrator takes a very important job in the movie because he explains to the watcher what is happening and he also introduces the characters at the beginning of the movie. The movie is very well structured in the way that the movie has a good line tension and keeps the audience very interest in it. As other french movies, love is something very predominant in it. This movie is not just a love stories as other movies of love. It is like a young character trying to get into a relationship and finding the right person for it. They make the movie very interesting because it is not just about her love story but, she is also in the love adventures of other people. She helps other people like the guy in the café, where she works. Watching the movie in french makes the movie very original and romantic. The characters of the movie make a good roll on it but the actor of Amelie is outstanding. We can see that the character of her father is not important for the movie. The relationship between Amelie and her father has not been the best so the character in the movie is like a boring guy who lives in his own world. Reading the subtitles of the movie because it was in french was a different adventure from how I normally watch movies. Reading and hearing the french accent along also made like a magic touch to the movie in which the language makes the movie feel very romantic. From my point of view, i really enjoys the movie in many ways.

It involves an experiment by the gung-ho Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson, who bears an odd resemblance to Clark Gable) to capture and record any supernatural activity in a 90-year old mansion called Hill House. In the opening narration, Markway spins a yarn about Hugh Crain, an old miser who built the house for his bride who died in an accident only moments before laying eyes on the place. Crain, despite the tragedy, moved himself and his daughter Abigail into the house where they both lived a considerably miserable existence for the rest of their lives. The house, which we are led to believe was simply born bad, seemed to have an effect on several people who have occupied it's space, not the least of which were Crain's second wife who died from a nasty tumble down the stairs and Abigail's caretaker who went mad and hanged herself.Markway, who approaches his experiment with all the gusto of a game hunter planning an African safari, carefully selects three people to spend the weekend in the old Gothic manor with him. They include Eleanor (Julie Harris), a troubled young woman who witnessed a poltergeist disturbance as a child and has led a haunted life ever since. Theodora (Claire Bloom), a clairvoyant socialite who is secretly in love with Eleanor but keeps it bottled up, and Luke (Russ Tamblyn), a non-believer who stands to inherit the house and is happy to make wisecracks about all this supernatural hoo-ha.The character dynamics are set in place pretty early on but most of the focus is on Eleanor, who has spent several years waiting hand and foot for her sick, demanding mother. Now that her mother is gone, Eleanor wishes to break free and find a life of her own. She's too troubled, really, to inhabit a place like Hill House which has a history of working a sort of psychological torment the emotionally fragile. We spend a great deal of the film hearing her internal monologue as her sense of self-preservation, at first, tells her not to go to the house and keeps telling her this all through the film. She is convinced that the entire house is evil, that it will consume her but somehow she cannot turn away.The personal drama in Eleanor's head is well-written, helping us understand the massive toll that the house has on someone with a troubled mind. We can see that in the architecture of the house both outside and in. Driving up to the place, Eleanor's inner monologue tells her that the house is staring at me and indeed we see two veranda windows that look like big ugly eyes. Added to the effect are dark clouds that seems to always hang over the place (Wise's cinematographer took the image of a clear sky and reversed the negative so that clouds would appear black).The exterior of the house shows us a wide, forbidding old manor that defies anyone to approach. While it seems well-made it seems like a fortress, a place designed carefully but not exactly welcoming. The interior of the house seems to have no specific plan, every inch of the place is over-decorated. There are rooms that are expansive but seem strangely abstract. Markway explains that Crain designed the place to suit his mind. Looking at the blind corners and confusing layouts, the place seems to have been designed to trap the inhabitants because with so many twisty hallways and empty dead ends it seems very easy to get lost. Even Eleanor's bed looks like a cage with a canopy like a net ready to drop on her.There are specific details to the house that are brilliant, like the strange angelic statuaries, silent, ghastly and ghost white, not the least of which is a bizarre statue of a saint out the conservatory that seems to be a symbol of Crain's obsessions. There is a spiral staircase that isn't firmly mounted to the wall and seems designed to be a booby trap. At the top is a dizzying upper landing that seems designed to pull someone back down the hard way.Using the web of architectural confusion in the house, Wise is able to mount the scary scenes simply by observing the house's strange layout. The first disturbance take place in Eleanor's bedroom as she and Theo hear a bizarre, rhythmic pounding that moves toward their door, then over their heads, then back down to the door where there is a bone-jangling smashing sound. It is all done with light and shadow and sound. We never see any ghosts, but we feel their presence outside the door. Later there are voices that seem to come from the room next door and we, the viewer, strain to hear what is being said (closed captions don't help). Most unnerving is that this male voice sounds like a strange incantation followed by a small child crying. What's going on? Our minds fill in the blanks.The fact that we never see the ghosts in The Haunting is a plus, we hear the pounding and the voices when we are in Eleanor's room and so when she leaves the room and we see those white statues, we somehow expect that one of them will be a ghost. The black and white photography and the choice to shoot at odd angles work on our minds, we see things in the shadows and in the corners and we aren't sure if we're seeing something supernatural or not. The use of light and shadow here is brilliant feeding on those expectations even when they come to nothing.

Theodora (Claire Bloom), a clairvoyant socialite who is secretly in love with Eleanor but keeps it bottled up, and Luke (Russ Tamblyn), a non-believer who stands to inherit the house and is happy to make wisecracks about all this supernatural hoo-ha.The character dynamics are set in place pretty early on but most of the focus is on Eleanor, who has spent several years waiting hand and foot for her sick, demanding mother. Now that her mother is gone, Eleanor wishes to break free and find a life of her own. She's too troubled, really, to inhabit a place like Hill House which has a history of working a sort of psychological torment the emotionally fragile. We spend a great deal of the film hearing her internal monologue as her sense of self-preservation, at first, tells her not to go to the house and keeps telling her this all through the film. She is convinced that the entire house is evil, that it will consume her but somehow she cannot turn away.The personal drama in Eleanor's head is well-written, helping us understand the massive toll that the house has on someone with a troubled mind. We can see that in the architecture of the house both outside and in. Driving up to the place, Eleanor's inner monologue tells her that the house is staring at me and indeed we see two veranda windows that look like big ugly eyes. Added to the effect are dark clouds that seems to always hang over the place (Wise's cinematographer took the image of a clear sky and reversed the negative so that clouds would appear black).The exterior of the house shows us a wide, forbidding old manor that defies anyone to approach. While it seems well-made it seems like a fortress, a place designed carefully but not exactly welcoming. The interior of the house seems to have no specific plan, every inch of the place is over-decorated. There are rooms that are expansive but seem strangely abstract. Markway explains that Crain designed the place to suit his mind. Looking at the blind corners and confusing layouts, the place seems to have been designed to trap the inhabitants because with so many twisty hallways and empty dead ends it seems very easy to get lost. Even Eleanor's bed looks like a cage with a canopy like a net ready to drop on her.There are specific details to the house that are brilliant, like the strange angelic statuaries, silent, ghastly and ghost white, not the least of which is a bizarre statue of a saint out the conservatory that seems to be a symbol of Crain's obsessions. There is a spiral staircase that isn't firmly mounted to the wall and seems designed to be a booby trap. At the top is a dizzying upper landing that seems designed to pull someone back down the hard way.Using the web of architectural confusion in the house, Wise is able to mount the scary scenes simply by observing the house's strange layout. The first disturbance take place in Eleanor's bedroom as she and Theo hear a bizarre, rhythmic pounding that moves toward their door, then over their heads, then back down to the door where there is a bone-jangling smashing sound. It is all done with light and shadow and sound. We never see any ghosts, but we feel their presence outside the door. Later there are voices that seem to come from the room next door and we, the viewer, strain to hear what is being said (closed captions don't help). Most unnerving is that this male voice sounds like a strange incantation followed by a small child crying. What's going on? Our minds fill in the blanks.The fact that we never see the ghosts in The Haunting is a plus, we hear the pounding and the voices when we are in Eleanor's room and so when she leaves the room and we see those white statues, we somehow expect that one of them will be a ghost. The black and white photography and the choice to shoot at odd angles work on our minds, we see things in the shadows and in the corners and we aren't sure if we're seeing something supernatural or not. The use of light and shadow here is brilliant feeding on those expectations even when they come to nothing. This is an example, like Polanski's Repulsion, (my favorite film of 1965) of a film that achieves mood and tone. Here is a movie that creates fear out of our expectations.

Since the first scene of the movie one as the audience immediately feels attracted to this movie. Which is a different type of movie rather than the typical Hollywood style one. The movie has a narrator which narrates and explains the events and the characters present. Amélie lives a really unique or rather weird childhood, where her father is a doctor and is really cold with her or more likely distant, and she is homeschooled and is taught by her mother whom is later killed in a terrible and unlikely situation. Amélie expects for her situation with her father to get better but it doesn't, so as soon as she is old enough she leaves home and sets off to live on her own and get to know all the things she was prived for when being a child. Amélie sets her life goal to be helping people, she aspires to be some type of hero to people. As the movie unravels we get to know lots of characters, Amélie helps lots of this characters including Georgette the cigarette clerk in the coffe shop Amélie works in, she makes Georgette fall in love, then one of the most important characters in the film and who's purpose we learn towards the end of the movie is Nino who Amélie helps as well though he is later involved romantically with Amélie. The acting in general was great the two characters previously mentioned do a great job acting, since it is kind of a magical or fantastical film it is probably really difficult or more like a challenge to get into character with the characters being portrayed, so the actors playing this characters did a marvelous job.I believe that the plot of the movie is this way because it has a further message rather tan Amélie wanting to help others. I believe she is scared and she is scared of her own problems and reality, which will also result in her lack of given love as a child. I recommend this movie to teenagers 15 and older, not younger due to some sex scenes present in the movie. Yet overall the movie is really age appropriate though it can be sometimes confusing to understand. Also there are some crude scenes like when the mom is killed by someone committing suicide.

Now Harry and Marv are back as they went from being the Wet Bandits to the Sticky Bandits, try to get revenge on Kevin as Kevin deals with them again as he saves Christmas and stopping them from stealing the money's charity that were suppose to be donated to the children's hospital by Ducan's Toy Chest. Okay, I'll admit that this movie is not as good as the first one but I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. I've seen sequels that are worse than Home Alone 2. Heck, I think the third and fourth are worse than the second; the fifth I did not seen and would not have any desire to give it a watch. I think, in my humble opinion, Home Alone 2 is a fun sequel than any of the Home Alone sequels that got made. I thought John Hughes did a fine job with the script as well as what Chris Columbus had to do for directing it. John Williams' music is just as good as the first one, and the cast did great. Macaulay Culkin really does well as he did in the first. Even Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern both still made a great chemistry together. Of course, you got to have Tim Curry who is indeed a lot of fun. Brenda Fricker was good too, but she is just another version of Roberts Blossom from the first movie (forgot to mention that Roberts Blossom is also really good in the first one). I thought some of the slapstick in the movie were really good, but some were flat; the movie does have some fine humor, but weren't as good as the first. I really do love some of the shots in New York along with some of the Christmas scenery that are in this movie. I understand some of the similarities that were done in the first one, but it wasn't 100 percent carbon copy. You still get some things that are different. I would have mind if they have tried something new, but I do give it a pass because I was already entertained enough with this movie. I do wonder why Kevin's family is watching It's a Wonderful Life in Spanish when they are in Florida as the movie they are watching should have been in English. In the first one, the same movie they are watching is in French which makes sense because they are in Paris. However, you can make an argument if the reason they are watching It's a Wonderful Life in Spanish is that there weren't any Christmas movies to watch so they ended watching this movie in Spanish because its a Christmas movie. If its true, then I get it but that is just me. Also, not sure if I'm wrong or not that Kevin's father should have just checked on Kevin on how is he doing as they are running to catch their flight to Florida. It's your call on that. Lastly, I wish if the family would stop treating Kevin like garbage as for what they did in the first one. Should have learn their lessons. With that said, I don't think the movie deserves to be ignore because I think it deserves the attention as what the first one did; the third; fourth and fifth movies are the ones that need to be ignore. That's just my opinion on that. Home Alone 2 Lost in New York is a fun movie, but its not that bad; I still think its fun, entertaining, and still has that Christmas feeling as what made the first one so good about it. Not sure if I put this in the underrated category, but I know its not as bad as what everyone makes it out to be. I say give it a chance! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.

Such begins the life, loves and whims of young Scarlett O'Hara in this Civil War-era story. Why is there another review to add to the already many reviews of this granddaddy of all movies? As I saw this for the umpteenth time recently, it crossed my mind that I hadn't reviewed it and to give a heads up for all those young enough to have never seen it or been introduced to it by their parents and are interested in seeing this long movie. What's so great about this movie, anyway? To begin with, author Margaret Mitchell was not your average girl growing up at the beginning of the 20th century. She was an independent creature who possessed a determined mind and a different outlook on the way things are supposed to be. To say she was a tomboy was to put in mildly. She was nicknamed Jimmy, by those who knew her tomboyish ways and she loved the nickname. She was also called Peggy by her mother, which was a nickname for Margaret. She loved writing even as a young girl and would be writing constantly in her diary. Years later, the idea came to her for a novel when she recalled from her youth the time her mother took her to all the plantations and lands that once were prosperous during the pre-Civil War days and how the people lived and how they lost all they had when the war came, and it intrigued her how the families and generations must have endured that terrible inevitable war. Her mother's point in telling all this to young Peggy was to instill in Margaret a survival instinct. Drawing on her own husbands and beaus, Margaret conceived of the leads of Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. And even the young girl's name was not Scarlett in the beginning, but Patsy. Taking three years, she wrote laboriously until she got her draft the way she wanted it, somewhat. She began her story with the end and wrote backwards. So she knew what her vision and her message was, even from the first word. Given the fact Margaret Mitchell was an independent person, the book's ending is not totaling surprising. It was really all about survival, no matter what. But what plagued her throughout writing was her first chapter. Not feeling completely satisfied, she shelved it, despite her insistence of her second husband and a publisher. When girlfriends heard of this novel, one of them made a remark that would change not only film history, but book history Margaret, you wrote a book! You? I didn't know you had it in you. With this anger and almost uncontrollable rage of being put in her place, Margaret got her draft and gave it to her publisher friend. Although he said it needed work, he was in awe of what he read. Despite the fact Americans were in the midst of the depression, Gone with the Wind took them by storm. Due to its bulkiness, it cost $3, and Margaret was impressed that anyone would spend $3 for it, given the hard times. Gone with the Wind broke all book records and still today sells hundreds of thousands of copies each year. With the name change to Scarlett encouraged by the publishers, Gone with the Wind was an extravaganza that debuted on December 15, 1939 in Atlanta, Georgia with most of the cast there, except for the black supporting players. Winning 10 Oscars for Vivien Leigh as Scarlett, Best Picture and Best Director, this has been the definitive example of story-telling splashed on film. Director George Cukor started production but was replaced by Victor Fleming who was credited and who received the award. Ben-Hur would later break the record for the most Oscars, but it's Gone with the Wind's characters and their real flaws and dreams that have kept this film alive and in the hearts and imaginations of generations ever since. Upon seeing again, it occurred to me that once you have seen a movie over and over, sometimes it feel like you're just seeing it automatically, having it all memorized. But the magic of Gone with the Wind is that you are transported to another time that is made so real and so vivid that you never feel bored or unaffected with what you're watching. There are too many good actors in this to go into that, but suffice it to say that neither Clark Gable nor Leslie Howard wanted to be in this film, Clark for fear he could not live up to the young ladies' expectations of a Rhett Butler and because it was essentially a woman's film and Leslie Howard felt that Ashley was weak and Leslie Howard had a reputation as a ladies' man. And, the role of Scarlett O'Hara was the role of a lifetime, and that's another story of how they were filming the burning of Atlanta when in walks Vivien Leigh. End of discussion. Why should anyone today, new generations and you watch this film &#x96; because it shows you how to write films, how to develop strong characters, because it is part of our culture that shows what we came from and where we may be going in the future. That's just a few reasons. For sheer entertainment, nothing can really top this &#x96; no words are big enough or opulent enough &#x96; to describe the experience of watching Gone with the Wind, especially for the first time. It's cinematically beautiful, majestic, stirring, and stupendous. Well, less is more, so suffice it to say, I would recommend Gone with the Wind to anyone serious about watching good films and interested seriously about making movies. Margaret Mitchell left quite a legacy &#x96; the dreams, the hopes, the drive of a young woman who influenced the world.

This film also does a good job in raising my interest in football, because these are the kind of inspirational stories I love.David Anspaugh's film is about a young adult named Rudy who aspires to play football for Notre Dame. But there are many factors standing in his way such as his lack of athleticism, living in a town where everyone works for the steel mill, lack of support from his family, and not able to afford an college education. But one day when he is finally admitted to Notre Dame, Rudy proves that he has what it takes to follow his dreams.The acting is very good. Sean Astin, in his pre-Sam days, gives a very strong performance as Rudy. The great Ned Beatty likewise delivers a great performance as Rudy's father. Charles S.

As the title suggests it is the fabulous destiny of Amélie but is it really destiny?I believe that it wasn't her destiny rather her way of trying to play hard to get. Throughout the movie Amélie leaves clues that allow this man that she loves find her and make him love her by the little things that she does. She is making him work to find her and along the way solving the little mysteries that he wanted to discover. For example, the bald man that kept appearing up in his photo album and no one knew who he was. When Amélie broke the photo booth on purpose she led her love there and he found out that the mystery man was just the maintenance man. The face that her love expressed was priceless and although he didn't know who Amélie was he knew it was her.In my opinion this movie was a little hard to understand and was a little out of my taste.

Murray Abraham gives a brilliant portrayal of a brilliant man who let his own insecurities drive him into hating the gifted composer who became a legend in death while his own legacy was pretty much dissolved thanks to Mozart's rise to immortality.The life of Mozart (the wonderful Tom Hulce), as seen through Salieri's eyes, is one of why is this crude man so talented while I can't even get my own operas revived? In his lifetime, Mozart wasn't praised, but Salieri had great financial success. Even that didn't appease him, so what does one artist do to another to ensure that they don't succeed? Drive them to death, of course! In a plot twist straight out of the classic Gothic horror, Salieri disguises himself in an evil looking masked cape which Mozart's own deceased father had worn, and hires Mozart to write a requiem. The twist of Salieri's scheme? He intends to take claim for writing the requiem-for Mozart's own funeral! On the surface, Salieri is not an evil man. He's actually pretty decent all around, but when this young upstart comes into the midst of the royal court he works in, Salieri and the other members of Emperor Joseph's court are livid. The madness takes over when Mozart has an affair with the star of his Turkish opera whom Salieri loved. On the opening night, Mozart's engagement to another young lady (Elizabeth Berridge) is announced, which upsets diva Christine Ebersole and alerts Salieri to their affair. Pretending to be Mozart's only friend in the court, Salieri becomes amazed, impressed and even touched as he watches him work. But the evil of envy is a stronger emotion and this leads to the deed that threatens to destroy Salieri's soul.Eccentric Mozart is presented here as a sort of punk rock Mozart, seeing something in opera besides fat women chewing up the scenery with their sometimes shrill voices. Indeed, his operas are very touching, and are staged with the opulence of the most magnificent musical theater. These shows are fully staged musical dramas which happen to be totally sung through, making the old fashioned style of opera seem totally pretentious. His operas like The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute are all lavish fantasies or tragedies, and are brilliantly recreated here with the Academy of St Martin in The Fields. Mozart didn't just appeal to the royals or aristocracy, but the gallery as well, poor people who desperately wanted escape. Escape is what you get here, especially with a shot of some genuine Vienese pastries. Elegant, funny, sad, touching and profound, this adaption of the hit Broadway play is probably the most deserving Best Picture Oscar Winner of the past 40 years. Even at over 2 1\/2 hours long, it moves at a fast pace, taking the viewer into a visual eyefest of what life during the pre-days of the French Revolution was like in Europe. In fact, King Joseph (Jeffrey Jones) happened to be Marie Antoniette's brother, and mentions briefly the issues going on with the French people. Poor Mozart isn't some obnoxious show-off fool; He's given many different dimensions that make him truly likable and interesting. Salieri isn't a one dimensional villain, either. His motivations are totally identifiable even if his actions aren't. Not bad for a stage actor whose most remembered film role prior to this was as an effeminate gay bath house customer in The Ritz.

When the film was being advertised, several people were either excited for it, or skeptical due to Street Fighter being a total stinker, and since the film was rated PG-13, which meant the violence and gore from the game had to be toned down to appeal to the then-young MK fan base. Thankfully, all expectations were surpassed as Mortal Kombat actually turned out to be, believe it or not, a good video game movie. Upon its release, the film was, surprisingly, a box- office success, making it the first video game adaptation to be successful both financially, and with fans, despite mixed reviews from critics (although Gene Siskel gave the movie a thumbs up). To this day, it is considered one of the better game to film translations. Now, it's time to find out why that is the case.The film succeeds by sticking to the plot of the first game while incorporating elements from Mortal Kombat II. The plot itself is very similar to Enter the Dragon (which I consider to be the greatest Martial Arts film ever made), but with a supernatural twist to it, which is rather refreshing, and helps it stand on its own. Unlike Street Fighter where the focus was on Guile instead of Ryu and Ken (the original protagonists of that franchise), this movie centers mostly around the Mortal Kombat game's original protagonist; Liu Kang.All of the characters from the first Mortal Kombat game (as well as a few from MKII) are present in the film, and are given appropriate development, and screen time. The casting is also spot-on. This is one of the few adaptations of a video game, comic book, and cartoon show (at least one of the few I could think of) where all of the actors are cast perfectly. Christopher Lambert, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are especially great as Rayden and Shang Tsung (respectively), they deliver the right amount of charisma without chewing the scenery. Linden Ashby also plays a great Johnny Cage since he brings the character's cocky personality to life, and delivers some of the best humor in this movie. But my favorite casting choice in the film has to be Robin Shou as Liu Kang. Not only is Liu my favorite character in the games, but Shou looks very much like the character, and makes you feel for him by showing his impulsiveness, and guilt over the death of his brother. It's a shame he didn't receive more starring vehicles after this movie, because I feel he is a capable actor, and Martial Artist. He definitely has more of a personality than Steven Seagal.While the movie is rated PG-13, and doesn't contain the large amounts of gore from the game, it does make up for this area with the large amounts of Martial Arts action. The fight scenes are very well done, and often emulate more of the Hong Kong style of fight choreography, which was a refreshing change from most American action films prior to this. They also incorporate several of the special moves from the game, such as Liu Kang's bicycle kick, Scorpion's spear that comes out of his hand, etc., and they manage to make them look believable, and not embarrassing, unlike Street Fighter.The person who directed this movie is Paul W.S. Anderson, and if that name sounds familiar, that's because this is the same man who would later go on to butcher Alien vs. Predator, and the Resident Evil movies. Despite his more recent efforts, he does a solid job directing this film. One of the strong points of his direction (aside from how well he filmed the fight scenes) is how he handled the movie on a technical, and design level. The cinematography, set designs, and lighting are stylish, and keep in touch with the game's dark, and mystical atmosphere. The special FX in the movie are also pretty cool, granted, they aren't exactly Terminator 2, or Jurassic Park, but they work fine for a film released in 1995. Though not everything is CGI, the character of Goro is a puppet, which still looks good to this day, and was created by special FX masters Alec Gillis, and Tom Woodruff, Jr., Overall, Mortal Kombat is still a fun film to watch. It made up greatly for Street Fighter, and in my opinion, it still is one of the best video game movies (right up there with Street Fighter Assassin's Fist). It may not be Oscar winning material, but it is one of my personal favorite movies, and as a huge fighting game fan, I couldn't be any more proud of it.
