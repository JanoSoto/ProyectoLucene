The next thing you know, you are being warped through a wormhole to the other side of the known universe. And after all that, you arrive to your destination, and what do you say? What a rush!? That's line in Stargate that gives the perfect example of what is wrong with the movie. The filmmakers had an enormous opportunity to create a whole universe, but end up rehashing old action movie cliches and one-liners, instead of exploring the possibilities. Certainly, in a more intelligent film, the reaction of travelling across the universe would be much greater, and far more profound. All can give thanks to the Emmerich and Devlin team, who obviously believe that if you have lots of special effects, who needs a plot? Stargate had the potential to be a film like Contact, a film filled with wonder that explored discoveries that would affect people all over the world. But no.Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an expert of Egyptian archaeology and hieroglyphics who is hired by the military to decode the writings on a mysterious artifact in the form of a stone ring known as the Stargate. I guess the military already read the script since they were ready to enter the Stargate before Dr. Jackson arrived to decode it, and there was no way for them to discover its purpose by themselves. What is also remarkable is how fast Jackson decodes the writings, and an expedition is under way--all in just a few minutes. The preparations for such an extensive and unexplored travel are handled on the same level as any of the adventures found at Disneyland. One of the crew members is Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a curious case, since the first time we see him, he is sitting in his dead son's room with a gun in hand as if he's going to kill himself. At that same time he is admitted, surprisingly, back in the military.After arriving on the other side, they discover an Egyptian civilization that is ruled by Ra (Jaye Davidson), the Sun God.  Dr. Jackson, is able to communicate with them, although I'm sure their language should have changed drastically from the Egyptian language 4000 years ago. Not much goes on here, except the usual boring scenes in which the military guys try to blend in the new culture, the scientist falls in love the beauty, and everyone plots rebellion against their evil masters. We also learn that Col O'Neil's mission was to blow up the Stargate along with himself. What about his wife we saw earlier in the film? Does he care how his wife is going to feel, especially after they lost their son not long before? Does the military really send suicidal people on secret missions, even for the purpose of killing themselves along with destroying a prized possession?Let's go down the list of a few cliches in this movie (1) the loser scientist who's hired for a special mission (Notice how when everyone walks out of his lecture, the one person who is interested hides and waits in the car outside, mysteriously, instead of just walking right up to him?), (2) a suicidal soldier in need of redemption, (3) a group of scientists talking a bunch of mumbo-jumbo about writings that they obviously know nothing about, (4) the love story between two unlikely people, who can barely communicate with each other, (5) a piece of jewelry with sentimental value, (6) a bomb with a read digital readout, (7) the action climax where all the good guys beat up the bad guys,  and (8) the old line Tastes like chicken.The filmmakers obviously wanted (and have pretty much stated so) this film to be confused with great classics like Lawrence of Arabia, simply because of the desert setting, I guess. If this film wanted to be an action film, why did it need to drag us all the way across the universe, only to end up in a fight with the bad guys? If it wanted to be a grand epic, why didn't it explore how the discovery of a Stargate could change the world? If a Stargate was actually discovered, do you think the military would be so casual in destroying it? Not a chance! It would be highly protected, and I'm sure many people would think of exercising the possibility of using it for colonization on other planets. What a difference the Stargate could make for humanity! The film, however, doesn't seem to even see this.The acting in this film is mediocre. This film is perfect for Kurt Russell. He's used to playing such shallow roles. But I haven't a clue as to why Jaye Davidson, after The Crying Game, would want to take part in this lame story. James Spader is also capable of much better roles. This film was just a huge waste of great potential. Indeed, its story is so cheesy and bizarre that I'm sure we'll be seeing it on Mystery Science Theatre 3000 in the next 20 years. This is a story that Edward D. Wood Jr., the worst filmmaker of all time, would have loved to film, and possibly could have written himself.

F. Murray Abraham, Oscar or no Oscar, has no idea what he's doing. Gary Busey turns up, goes mental, and then exits (a stupid mistake as he's the most interesting character). John C.

It lacks cynicism and irony.  As you can see from many of the other comments, it was not well received by many.  Why?  I'm not sure, really.  I loved it tremendously.  It isn't for King Arthur purists who think that 'Le Morte D' Arthur' is the ONLY version of the Arthurian legend out there (as if legends can have only one version!).  First Knight is a visually beautiful, sentimental, and well crafted romantic adventure, told from the point of view of Lancelot, in this version a wandering sellsword.If you are looking for the mysticism, the magic and the tragedy of Camelot...you'll be disappointed.  This is a more optimistic telling of the tale.  It is also more streamlined.  There is no lady of the lake, no Merlin, no Excalibur, and no Morgana.  If you want to see all that, go and rent Boorman's Excalibur (1981), also a very good Arthurian legend, but very different from First Knight.  It is a much darker and more savage rendition of the tale, and the ending is also more grim and brooding.Here, you have only Arthur, Lancelot, Guenevere, and a villain who is essentially Mordred, known as Malagant (they even refer to him as a prince). It focuses on the love triangle and the final battles between Arthur and Malagant, which lightens the burden of storytelling considerably from Excalibur, which can be quite thick with plot at times (not that this is bad, it's just different).  I found myself not really missing all the magic and myth of the story, and enjoying First Knight for its strength  it is romantic, intelligent, and energetic.  The performances are all good (though the men are a bit old), and the music is simply gorgeous.If you don't mind that the legend has been toned down, but only to focus on a tighter storyline with fewer characters to encumber it, you will like First Knight.  If you have a problem with big movie star names playing ancient characters (Gere distracted many with his performance, but I felt he did a great job), or if you don't like deviations from the 'real' legend of Camelot, you probably won't enjoy this adventure\/doomed romance for what it is.

It lacks cynicism and irony.  As you can see from many of the other comments, it was not well received by many.  Why?  I'm not sure, really.  I loved it tremendously.  It isn't for King Arthur purists who think that 'Le Morte D' Arthur' is the ONLY version of the Arthurian legend out there (as if legends can have only one version!).  First Knight is a visually beautiful, sentimental, and well crafted romantic adventure, told from the point of view of Lancelot, in this version a wandering sellsword.If you are looking for the mysticism, the magic and the tragedy of Camelot...you'll be disappointed.  This is a more optimistic telling of the tale.  It is also more streamlined.  There is no lady of the lake, no Merlin, no Excalibur, and no Morgana.  If you want to see all that, go and rent Boorman's Excalibur (1981), also a very good Arthurian legend, but very different from First Knight.  It is a much darker and more savage rendition of the tale, and the ending is also more grim and brooding.Here, you have only Arthur, Lancelot, Guenevere, and a villain who is essentially Mordred, known as Malagant (they even refer to him as a prince). It focuses on the love triangle and the final battles between Arthur and Malagant, which lightens the burden of storytelling considerably from Excalibur, which can be quite thick with plot at times (not that this is bad, it's just different).  I found myself not really missing all the magic and myth of the story, and enjoying First Knight for its strength  it is romantic, intelligent, and energetic.  The performances are all good (though the men are a bit old), and the music is simply gorgeous.If you don't mind that the legend has been toned down, but only to focus on a tighter storyline with fewer characters to encumber it, you will like First Knight.  If you have a problem with big movie star names playing ancient characters (Gere distracted many with his performance, but I felt he did a great job), or if you don't like deviations from the 'real' legend of Camelot, you probably won't enjoy this adventure\/doomed romance for what it is.

Well, perhaps not. There are at least two stunning scenes - the murder of the security agent is Hitchcock at his best; taut, exciting and disturbing, and the scene where the plot is explained to Paul Newman on a blackboard is both funny and touching. But, we demand more from a thriller - and particularly a thriller from Hitch - than two good scenes. We want action, suspense and involvement. How could anyone be involved with Julie Andrews, still in her Maria Von Trapp mode and irritatingly toothsome? Too much of the film seems lazy and tired, as if Hitch had given up on it half way through. Worth seeing for Hitchcock fans, who will enjoy one or two distinctive touches. But otherwise, an enormous disappointment. Even the ending is hopeless.

The reviews before me did a much better job than I could.I am disheartened, however, to know that it made a ton of money and will encourage Hollywood to spew out more swill like it, instead of thought-provoking science fiction like Contact and Blade Runner because those type of films don't make as much money.To those of you in power in Hollywood, PLEASE LISTEN! Read these reviews and learn. If you're going to spend a lot of money on terrific special effects and a star-studded cast, spend some money on a terrific science-fiction writer (for a change) and let him\/her write what he\/she wants with no or little studio interference. A science fiction movie can have great effects, great cast, lots of action, AND smarts. And it can make money too, if you promote it right.

My father purchased it shortly after release, and it survives today among my collection of '70s and '80s rock LPs.  When NBC broadcast '2001' in the mid-'70s, I didn't know I would have to wait through many years of pan-and-scan cable TV showings to finally enjoy it in the most impressive environment of all an IMAX theatre.Back around 1990, the IMAX RiverCenter in San Antonio presented a science fiction series in its unique facility.  Running on a modified projector designed to expand the original image as large as possible onto the IMAX screen, '2001' was deeply affecting and mesmerizing.  Stanley Kubrick's artistry and craftsmanship are realized in amazing fashion in '2001', which to this day stands at the pinnacle of movie making.  His marvelous adaptation of music, and the use of long camera shots, disturbing sounds, prolonged silence, routine-sounding dialogue, average-looking characters, and highly-realistic visual effects set an extraordinary example.  In the days before computer imagery, when models, matte paintings, in-camera tricks, and other conventional methods were all a director had to use, this movie went beyond the state of the art.  It also went much deeper than normal thought, challenging the viewer to examine his purpose and place in a world which now seems so small in a universe of endless mystery.  '2001' will be enjoyed by many, hated by some, and studied by many generations to come.I strongly recommend you buy or rent '2001 A Space Odyssey' in widescreen format, find the biggest television possible, and view it alone or with a quiet companion without interruption.  You won't regret it.
