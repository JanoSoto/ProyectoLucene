I first saw the film when I was 17 years old. How did I hear about it? It was reviewed, and recommended highly, by Siskel & Ebert in 1991, and I eventually caught it on video a year later.It's a great film, a powerful film, a healing film, about the power of listening, truly listening to one another. I've seen it six times now, and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing. But why the poor reviews for this movie? Maltin's movie guide gives it two out of four. Too melodramatic, too much coincidence, too sappy, are the expressions that I read the most. Yes, there is melodrama in this story, and yes, there is a lot of coincidence, too. But it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple. For all of the plot that exists in Grand Canyon, such as drive-by shootings, a police chase, an earthquake, a love affair, a woman's discovery of a baby in the bushes, another shooting, a near accident by a new driver, and worldly advice from a homeless man, this movie wins because of the smart performances by Kevin Kline, Steve Martin, Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Danny Glover, and Jeremy Sisto. It also succeeds because of Lawrence Kasdan's skillful direction and writing. You know that this isn't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves Kevin Kline being harassed by four black youths. Danny Glover plays a tow truck driver who assists the Kline character, but not before he gets harassed too, by the leader of the bunch. Listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to Glover,Are you afraid of me because of me, or because I have a gun?.Grand Canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another. Steve Martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind. I think his character is a warning that the good can carry us forward, that idealism is a virtue, but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon.I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new releases at the video store. But with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents, I plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it, Grand Canyon is something special. If you loved Magnolia, another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes, you'll love Grand Canyon, too.

I think one word in that sentence is off. The word 'genius' should be replaced with 'mess'. Pi does contain all the said elements, but this movie is just too silly to be taken seriously.Many people have commented that this film's storyline borders on illogical towards the second half. I would go as far as to say it is laughable. Whatever intrigue they had generated was completely demolished once the second half reared its ugly head. Self-aware computers? The 216-letter name of God? Please, there are real uses for number theory, you don't need to invent stupid ones. Don't expect the plot to win you back after that till the end. The chase scenes aren't particularly intense (mostly because you can't see what's going on) and the story just gets sillier and sillier. In fact, if I didn't think the ending was great (truly a saving grace, even though it's a copout), I would have hated this movie. Instead, the ending shed a new light on the past 85 minutes and reassured me that what I thought was laughable indeed was intended to be. However, I don't think the film is brilliant or even clever for having done this; I still had to subject myself to 85 minutes (or at least 40 minutes) of meandering plot just to appreciate the ending, and I don't think it was worth it.With that, we get to the technical side. The film is shot in black and white and the camera work is very shaky. Add this to an overall bleak setting and you get cinematography and mood perfect for the film. Unfortunately, it's not the kind of thing that's bearable for 85 minutes. I enjoyed the first few paranoiac episodes, but as they got longer and more frequent, I started to get overwhelmed by the headache-inducing camera work (as Max must have been). One thing that was always spot on however was the music. Most of the music used in the film is techno, and it always suits the film, whether during a subway scene or a paranoiac episode. Probably the highlight of the film and I would recommend the soundtrack.One last thing I thought it was funny when Saul explained to Max about Archimedes and the displacement problem.

When the possible threat of violence at the `Miss United States' beauty pageant surfaces, the F.B.I. meets the challenge by sending in one of their own agents, Gracie Hart (Bullock), undercover as one of the contestants.  There's one slight problem, however; Gracie is the right agent for the job, but she'd be more comfortable wearing a championship WWF belt than striking a pose in a swimsuit.  Not to worry, though, because pageant organizer Kathy Morningside (Candice Bergen) has just the man to transform her into the beauty she must be, and he has all of two days in which to do it.  The man of the hour (and the Professor Higgins to Gracie's Eliza) is none other than Victor Melling (Michael Caine), who has made a career out of grooming young ladies for the formidable task of competing in the arena of the Most Beautiful.  But with Gracie, he has his work cut out for him.  She's good with her dukes, has a penchant for pizza and beer, has a walk more like John Wayne than a future Miss U.S. and snorts when she laughs.  All of which adds up to a good time for the audience, if not for Victor, as he goes to work. \tThe story, while not altoghether original, is entertaining fare that is handled well by director Petrie and is, most importantly, what a comedy should be  Funny.  For a comedy to work, a number of elements have to come together and gel; in this case, it's a combination of a concept that is credible, dialogue that is clever and gets laughs without being forced, some good physical bits (including a sparse use of slapstick that is effective), and a pace that keeps it all fresh as the story unfolds.  What really puts this one over, however, are the stars, Bullock and Caine. \tThe winsome Bullock demonstrates her versatility by pulling out all the stops physically, while creating a character that is totally believable, abandoning the safety net of the glamorous, girl-next-door, America's sweetheart type to make Gracie a very real, earthy person.  And with all that goes on, it would be easy to ignore the emotional development she brings to the character as well, but it is there; by the end of the film we see a different Gracie, one of changed attitude and broadened horizons.  And it works because Bullock makes it sincere and genuine, which makes Gracie an endearing, memorable character.  The same can be said of Michael Caine's performance as the effeminate Victor.  With his usual charm, he plunges into Melling's skin and paints him with fine strokes of nuance and wit, while managing to avoid stereotype as he creates a character that is uniquely his own.  And the fact that Caine and Bullock play so well off of one another takes the movie to a higher level on that regard alone. \tNotable in supporting roles are the likable Benjamin Bratt , as Agent Eric Matthews, who watches Gracie's transformation with great interest; William Shatner, doing a camp turn as Stan, the `Bert Parks' of the Miss U.S. Pageant; Heather Burns, as Cheryl, `Miss Rhode Island;' and Bergen, who gives a winning performance as Morningside, the former beauty queen.  Rounding out the cast are Ernie Hudson (McDonald), Wendy Raquel Robinson (Miss California), Diedre Quinn (Miss Texas) and Melissa De Sousa (Miss New York).  A funny, feel-good movie, `Miss Congeniality' is a satisfying comedy that will make you laugh and leave you with a smile on your face, with performances by Bullock and Caine that are worth the price of admission alone.

A funny, feel-good movie, `Miss Congeniality' is a satisfying comedy that will make you laugh and leave you with a smile on your face, with performances by Bullock and Caine that are worth the price of admission alone.  For a solid evenings entertainment, check this one out; you'll be glad you did.  I rate this one 8\/10.   \t       \t ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"30 December 2000","score":"","review":"  I had great expectations on this film as Jim Carrey had the leading part and it was directed by Milos Forman; a man who's responsible for making two great classics One flew over the cuckoo's nest (still his very best work) and Amadeus.

Over the years, Jim Carrey has had some excellent performances in several amusing films, but I've always had more respect for Danny DeVito.  I'm not sure why actually.

His acting is so naturally that I'm always looking forward to see him in his films, with the exception of his boring character in Batman returns (where he plays the Penguin Man).

But things start going the wrong way after the great Elvis-imitation.  From that moment on, the film will never be as funny anymore as it was in the beginning. The whole concept of the film is clear to me though.  The comedian Andy Kaufman is rather boring than entertaining towards his audience as simply nobody finds him or his so-called humor amusing.  But in spite of that, they haven't lost faith in him.  They're even prepared to stay seated for a very long time; hoping that after being bored for hours a spark of amusement will appear.  Eventually, the audience shrinks till only a few are left. This aspect may sound funny to you, but unfortunately Andy Kaufman succeeds in boring the 'fictional' AND the 'realistic' audience as well.

When writers are in charge, we have scripts about writing, like `Wonder Boys or `Finding Forrester.' When actors are in charge, the plot device is usually about acting. That's why so many Shakespeare plays have people in disguises.If you are a film actor in Hollywood, you have a hard choice to make. For someone like Bullock, you can either become a personality or an actor, a real actor. Kate Winslet has chosen to be a real actor. Sandra wishes she could be, but we won't give her a chance. It has little to do with talent, its just a matter of whether the personality is marketable. If it is, we force these folks into a box. So she (and Roberts and Ryan, and so so many other women) are mere personalities.As an aside I really admire Brad Pitt who is in this for the long run, and who seeks out adventuresome, risk-taking roles just because the draw to be a relatively worthless personality (like say Harrison Ford) is so great. And he needs to work hard to avoid it.What we like about Bullock is what we think she is `really' like, perky and fun, so we refuse to see her in dramatic roles. The good side is that you make oodles of money as a personality. The bad side is you are reduced to a barking seal, for instance in Julia's case forever working that smile. These people hate their box (unless they are really, really dumb, but we won't mention names). And the game is risky because the big movies that depend on these `openers' have to be different in some way. So the problem is how to have a familiar personality in a slightly different vehicle.You can see just how the wheels turned for this film as Bullock tried to get ahead. This time instead of Sandra's character being a pretty airhead, we'll have her play a character pretending to be one! That way, we can make fun of the box, people will come, and we can show the actual process of acting. Along the way of making fun of the box, we can poke fun at the viewers, who here literally gather around a screen and gawk.To drive the inside joke home, get Candice Bergen to play the conservative Texan villain who is behind the airhead enterprise.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"30 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Although I've only seen two films he's directed, I feel fairly confident in saying that Shekhar Kapur is a big hammer kind of craftsman. There are some directors who know that if they use a little hammer, the nail will come in just as straight, but there won't be as much noise. Jim Jarmusch is a good example of a little hammer kind of craftsman. He draws very little attention to himself, moves very slowly, and gets to a quality ending, almost without fail. Kapur, as a big hammer filmmaker, does his darnedest to make sure that everything that's onscreen is clear. He leaves virtually nothing to the intelligent viewer's imagination, nothing to figure out. When he finds a good symbol, he uses it over and over, almost until it loses are meaning. When he has themes that can be literalized, he makes sure he does it, rather than letting viewers read into the text. It's all there in its heavy-handed glory. As a little hammer fan, I've found both Elizabeth and Bandit Queen, to be slightly less than fully satisfying. However, just as I could appreciate Elizabeth for the wonderful performances, I found much to enjoy in Bandit Queen.Bandit Queen tells the true story of Phoolan Devi who, with the help of the media, gained a Robin Hood-esque notoriety in a small province of India in the 1980s. The film begins with Devi being married to a much older man at 11, not for money or for love, but because the man needs laborers at his house. The husband rapes her, the first of a series of rapes in the film. She runs home but, having aged a few years, she runs into trouble with the upper caste, the Thakurs when she turns down the advances of a rich man's son. She's sent away to cousins, where she first encounters a troop of bandits, led be Vikram, who kinda takes a shine to her for her spirit. But again she is sent home (the movie's plot is almost entirely composed of back and forths), only to be again kidnapped, this time by the bandits and this time for bounty. When Vikram kills the head bandit for raping her, Phoolan Devi gains full stature as a member of the Bandits until their Thakur head is released and all heck breaks loose. It's all very upsetting. The second half of the film is a vengeance drama, as Phoolan leads a mini-revolution against the Thakurs until she gains the attention of India's national government and she's arrested. But not before she becomes a hero, setting a completely new standard for female empowerment in the country.Should I be bugged by the genre of supposedly feminist films where the female protagonist goes it on her own, but really needs a man to untap her power? And that once that man untaps the power, he inevitably gets to both benefit from her power and her sexuality?  Or should that not bother me? When Vikram and Phoolan raid a transport car, for example, Vikram first tells the passengers that they've been raided by Phoolan Devi's gang. Then he tells them that they've been robbed by the beautiful bandit. First he names her and then he takes away the name to objectify her. Later, when a Thakur boss flirts with her, Vikram tells her to shoot anybody who touches her. Is he telling her to protect herself, or is he protecting his investment? These are just a few of the sexual incongruities of the film. Kapur's need to produce drama and romance undermines the female empowerment at the heart of his tale.And as I've mentioned, Kapur is not a subtle director. This film features a half dozen scenes of marriages. All of the marriages are related in some way to bloodshed. Obvious enough for you? Ditto with the number of baths characters take. Basically whenever a character is about to embark on a new direction in life, they bathe. Almost as if bathing equals rebirth. Could be. I'd compare these images with the haircuts which bookend Elizabeth. Kapur seems desperate to make sure that you get what he's doing, so he takes all of the guesswork out of it.Still, the story is enriched by the triangulation of the story lines. Just as Phoolan Devi will always be an outcast because she's a woman, she will always be an outcast because she's of a lower caste. The minor problem is that she can't get anybody to be outraged with her about the gender thing, but getting people offended by the class disparity is a breeze. There's a proration of disabilities here that is probably very telling. Kapur is also very effective at handling the Bandit Queen as a decidedly rural phenomenon.

There are some directors who know that if they use a little hammer, the nail will come in just as straight, but there won't be as much noise. Jim Jarmusch is a good example of a little hammer kind of craftsman. He draws very little attention to himself, moves very slowly, and gets to a quality ending, almost without fail. Kapur, as a big hammer filmmaker, does his darnedest to make sure that everything that's onscreen is clear. He leaves virtually nothing to the intelligent viewer's imagination, nothing to figure out. When he finds a good symbol, he uses it over and over, almost until it loses are meaning. When he has themes that can be literalized, he makes sure he does it, rather than letting viewers read into the text. It's all there in its heavy-handed glory. As a little hammer fan, I've found both Elizabeth and Bandit Queen, to be slightly less than fully satisfying. However, just as I could appreciate Elizabeth for the wonderful performances, I found much to enjoy in Bandit Queen.Bandit Queen tells the true story of Phoolan Devi who, with the help of the media, gained a Robin Hood-esque notoriety in a small province of India in the 1980s. The film begins with Devi being married to a much older man at 11, not for money or for love, but because the man needs laborers at his house. The husband rapes her, the first of a series of rapes in the film. She runs home but, having aged a few years, she runs into trouble with the upper caste, the Thakurs when she turns down the advances of a rich man's son. She's sent away to cousins, where she first encounters a troop of bandits, led be Vikram, who kinda takes a shine to her for her spirit. But again she is sent home (the movie's plot is almost entirely composed of back and forths), only to be again kidnapped, this time by the bandits and this time for bounty. When Vikram kills the head bandit for raping her, Phoolan Devi gains full stature as a member of the Bandits until their Thakur head is released and all heck breaks loose. It's all very upsetting. The second half of the film is a vengeance drama, as Phoolan leads a mini-revolution against the Thakurs until she gains the attention of India's national government and she's arrested. But not before she becomes a hero, setting a completely new standard for female empowerment in the country.Should I be bugged by the genre of supposedly feminist films where the female protagonist goes it on her own, but really needs a man to untap her power? And that once that man untaps the power, he inevitably gets to both benefit from her power and her sexuality?  Or should that not bother me? When Vikram and Phoolan raid a transport car, for example, Vikram first tells the passengers that they've been raided by Phoolan Devi's gang. Then he tells them that they've been robbed by the beautiful bandit. First he names her and then he takes away the name to objectify her. Later, when a Thakur boss flirts with her, Vikram tells her to shoot anybody who touches her. Is he telling her to protect herself, or is he protecting his investment? These are just a few of the sexual incongruities of the film. Kapur's need to produce drama and romance undermines the female empowerment at the heart of his tale.And as I've mentioned, Kapur is not a subtle director. This film features a half dozen scenes of marriages. All of the marriages are related in some way to bloodshed. Obvious enough for you? Ditto with the number of baths characters take. Basically whenever a character is about to embark on a new direction in life, they bathe. Almost as if bathing equals rebirth. Could be. I'd compare these images with the haircuts which bookend Elizabeth. Kapur seems desperate to make sure that you get what he's doing, so he takes all of the guesswork out of it.Still, the story is enriched by the triangulation of the story lines. Just as Phoolan Devi will always be an outcast because she's a woman, she will always be an outcast because she's of a lower caste. The minor problem is that she can't get anybody to be outraged with her about the gender thing, but getting people offended by the class disparity is a breeze. There's a proration of disabilities here that is probably very telling. Kapur is also very effective at handling the Bandit Queen as a decidedly rural phenomenon. He does an excellent job of showing how decentralized the Indian government is, both geographically and culturally.

I kept wishing that all of these talented actors had split up and decided t do two or three really good movies instead of one hideously dully piece of garbage. You've got three Oscar winners Angelina Jolie, Nicholas Cage, and Robert Duvall. There are a handful of familiar indie-film faces James Duvall, Timothy Olyphant, and Giovanni Ribisi.

And then you've got a couple classy actors who seem to specialize in stealing scenes Chi McBride, Will Patton, and especially Delroy Lindo. Oh yeah. The talent onscreen is impressive. However, Gone In Sixty Seconds highlights the principle flaw of the Jerry Bruckheimer school of filmmaking.The strategy in Bruckheimer's recent action extravaganzas is to fill the screen with as much talent as possible, pay a half dozen hip screen writers to produce catchy dialogue, and then hand the film over to a director with no experience. To be fair, Dominic Sena has actually made a movie previously (the moody Brad Pitt film Kalifornia). It only looks like he hasn't. This is perhaps because rather than hiring talented and experience technical people, Bruckenheimer has entrusted the look of this film to a cinematographer and production designer clearly not up to the task of producing a coherent film. What's up on the screen is a chaotic mess for which there's too much blame to accurately passed around. Gone In Sixty Seconds looks like an overblown car commercial. And in reality, I guess that's all it is.Working from the general theme of H.B. Halicki's 1974 minimalist auto theft picture, Scott Rosenberg certainly hasn't added anything by way of plot. Basically Memphis Raines (Cage), the now-retired greatest car thief in the world, returns to LA to help his brother out of a jam. Recycling the hoariest device known to writers, Raines must get the old gang back together for the heist of their lives, stealing 50 cars in 1 night. Oh my! It's just that pointless. And it's even more counter-intuitive. Every single action in the film prompts a response of Oh, surely there was an easier way to do that. There isn't a single action in the entire film -- not a single motivation, character, or sequence -- that feels the slightest bit real. Or understandable. If you take it all on faith and just wait for car races and things blowing up, you're still liable to be disappointed. With the exception of the amusing final chase, which takes up the last twenty minutes of the film, everything is run of the mill. And yet, this film made 100 million at the box office, while a fresh, exciting, well written film like Ronin, which featured some of the best car chases in decades, was a disappointment. It's all kinda sad.Everything is strangely lit. The photography is frequently just ugly. None of the one-liners have any pop. And the actors are just stranded. Cage sleepwalks. Duvall cackles pointlessly. And beyond looking kinda hot, Jolie does nothing at all. Ribisi comes closest to acting, but then again, I could just be confusing performance with bad facial hair.

The cinematography was excellent, the darkness and all that grey and black remembered me a lot of writer Andrew Kevin Walker`s other well-known work, Seven. It just didn't rain as much as in Seven. Nicholas Cage` search for the truth and the emotional change he goes through were very interesting to watch, thrilling. His scenes with the murdered girl`s mother were the best of the whole movie. The performance of Amy Morton as Jane Matthews especially stood out here. The movie gets very good the moment Cage's character, PI Tom Welles, teams up with Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a clerk in a porn shop, Welles pays for helping him finding information in the s\/m scene and the porn industry, a world completly alien to Welles himself.The two characters have a certain, very interesting way of dealing with each other, especially because Max turns out to be a totally different kind of person to what everyone would expect him to be at first. Max California turns out to even have a certain kind of innocence around him, something Welles has already lacked right from the beginning of the movie. But if you know at least a few Hollywood-made movies, it`s nearly needles to say that in a world supposed to be as bad as the one we see in 8mm, innocence can't survive. No surprise here, when still innocent and nice Max gets brutally murdered (while standing in front of a cross! Don't you dare to miss the deeper meaning here!) after half of the movie, just so Tom Welles can fulfill his descent into darkness. Oh please!At that moment, 8mm turns into being just totally stupid. The first half of the movie, when everything was mostly about Welles, searching for the truth and Max helping him and both of them moving more and more into the darkness that is the porn industry in the eyes of He-who-killed-off-the-Batman-movies Joel Schumacher, everything was fine and very dark in a still fascinating way. That is, because we didn't have to see too much of the ridiculously stereotype bad guys who are supposed to give the darkness a real face. Here we have a movie, that COULD have been really scary if the bad guys would have been very normal and everyday guys. Instead, what see here are a bunch of bad guys who are that bad it wouldn't have made a difference if they'd have We are evil signs over their heads. And Super-Bad Guy Machine turns out to look like your friendly, four-eyed, living-with-his-mother kind of neighbour. Gasp! Wow, that's something totally new. I haven't actually seen that in a dozend other and better movies before and was therefore of course expecting Machine to have little horns and a tail. Oh please, again!What really made me frown was the end of the movie. I could accept somehow that Welles brutally killed off one of the bad guys and then burned the evidence of what he did. I could also accept him to go after Machine because it was just the natural thing to do for a hero in a Hollywood-movie. What I CAN`T accept about the end of the movie is, that Welles kills Machine in front of the man's house and then is able to just walk away without ANYONE asking any questions, without the murder on Machine or any other of the bad guys ever leading back to Welles. And it's not as if there wasn't any evidence. And what the hell happened to Max? Did Welles just leave him there in front of the cross, with his throat cut? Or did he actually call anyone to give his friend a decent burial?And then there's also the thing with the disturbing pictures a lot of people mentioned in their comments.  I can't say that I'm good in watching dark movies. They usually make me feel very uneasy and most of the time I have to close my eyes if there's too much blood involved. But no uneasiness here. All I could think all through the movie was, that Joel Schumacher was just using those pictures of death and nakedness (Gasp! Naked people. Please AGAIN!! We see worse than that in usual german TV at 10 pm). Most of the time they didn't seem to be a real part of the movie like in Seven, they were very often just meant to make people think Oh god. Look how sick some people are. and to explain why Welles more and more turns into the dark and brooding hero who at last commits murders, too, at the end. And so I was grinning about those supposed-to-be disturbing pictures. I don't think that's what Schumacher intended.So what I think is Good performance by Nicholas Cage, especially when fighting over if or if not to tell the mother of the murdered girl about what happened to her daughter. Good performance by Joaquin Pheonix. The character of Max could have turned out to be very dull, too, with the wrong actor. Thankfully, they had Pheonix. VERY good performance by Amy Morton. Good cinematography at the beginning of the movie. Ignore the bad guys and turn off the movie the moment Max dies, to spare yourself a few ridiculous fight and death scenes and some actions by the hero that just makes you think a big Huh??. Then go and rent the spanish movie Tesis (english title Thesis) which deals with the subject of snuff movies, too, but unlike 8mm actually IS disturbing and makes you think a lot about what people are capable of.

The movie gets very good the moment Cage's character, PI Tom Welles, teams up with Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), a clerk in a porn shop, Welles pays for helping him finding information in the s\/m scene and the porn industry, a world completly alien to Welles himself.The two characters have a certain, very interesting way of dealing with each other, especially because Max turns out to be a totally different kind of person to what everyone would expect him to be at first. Max California turns out to even have a certain kind of innocence around him, something Welles has already lacked right from the beginning of the movie. But if you know at least a few Hollywood-made movies, it`s nearly needles to say that in a world supposed to be as bad as the one we see in 8mm, innocence can't survive. No surprise here, when still innocent and nice Max gets brutally murdered (while standing in front of a cross! Don't you dare to miss the deeper meaning here!) after half of the movie, just so Tom Welles can fulfill his descent into darkness. Oh please!At that moment, 8mm turns into being just totally stupid. The first half of the movie, when everything was mostly about Welles, searching for the truth and Max helping him and both of them moving more and more into the darkness that is the porn industry in the eyes of He-who-killed-off-the-Batman-movies Joel Schumacher, everything was fine and very dark in a still fascinating way. That is, because we didn't have to see too much of the ridiculously stereotype bad guys who are supposed to give the darkness a real face. Here we have a movie, that COULD have been really scary if the bad guys would have been very normal and everyday guys. Instead, what see here are a bunch of bad guys who are that bad it wouldn't have made a difference if they'd have We are evil signs over their heads. And Super-Bad Guy Machine turns out to look like your friendly, four-eyed, living-with-his-mother kind of neighbour. Gasp! Wow, that's something totally new. I haven't actually seen that in a dozend other and better movies before and was therefore of course expecting Machine to have little horns and a tail. Oh please, again!What really made me frown was the end of the movie. I could accept somehow that Welles brutally killed off one of the bad guys and then burned the evidence of what he did. I could also accept him to go after Machine because it was just the natural thing to do for a hero in a Hollywood-movie. What I CAN`T accept about the end of the movie is, that Welles kills Machine in front of the man's house and then is able to just walk away without ANYONE asking any questions, without the murder on Machine or any other of the bad guys ever leading back to Welles. And it's not as if there wasn't any evidence. And what the hell happened to Max? Did Welles just leave him there in front of the cross, with his throat cut? Or did he actually call anyone to give his friend a decent burial?And then there's also the thing with the disturbing pictures a lot of people mentioned in their comments.  I can't say that I'm good in watching dark movies. They usually make me feel very uneasy and most of the time I have to close my eyes if there's too much blood involved. But no uneasiness here. All I could think all through the movie was, that Joel Schumacher was just using those pictures of death and nakedness (Gasp! Naked people. Please AGAIN!! We see worse than that in usual german TV at 10 pm). Most of the time they didn't seem to be a real part of the movie like in Seven, they were very often just meant to make people think Oh god. Look how sick some people are. and to explain why Welles more and more turns into the dark and brooding hero who at last commits murders, too, at the end. And so I was grinning about those supposed-to-be disturbing pictures. I don't think that's what Schumacher intended.So what I think is Good performance by Nicholas Cage, especially when fighting over if or if not to tell the mother of the murdered girl about what happened to her daughter. Good performance by Joaquin Pheonix. The character of Max could have turned out to be very dull, too, with the wrong actor. Thankfully, they had Pheonix. VERY good performance by Amy Morton. Good cinematography at the beginning of the movie. Ignore the bad guys and turn off the movie the moment Max dies, to spare yourself a few ridiculous fight and death scenes and some actions by the hero that just makes you think a big Huh??. Then go and rent the spanish movie Tesis (english title Thesis) which deals with the subject of snuff movies, too, but unlike 8mm actually IS disturbing and makes you think a lot about what people are capable of.

It proves that if you really want to accomplish something, it can be done; no matter what.Richard Gere is very good in this particular role and he should have had an Oscar for his acting.  He's had multiple good performances (in Pretty woman and Internal affairs), but he's never done anything better than this.  Louis Gossett Jr. and Debra Winger are good as well, but David Keith is not always convincing in my opinion.The story is almost never uninteresting as director Taylor Hackford guides us beautifully through the whole two hour-lasting process by adding some original twists now and then.  Although good camera positions are out of the ordinary, Hackford keeps a precise mix between the events IN and OUTSIDE the navy.  Those are two different lives, but both are lived by the same person.  While (outside the navy) Richard Gere is going out with his girlfriend and has to stand up for himself because, being a marine, he isn't always welcome everywhere, (inside the navy) he undergoes the drills and discipline of his superior and the numerous of challenging tests in order to become a good marine.What I liked most about this film was how everyone (who wanted to join the navy) disliked Louis Gossett Jr. at first for being very strict, but when they eventually HAD become a marine they were very thankful for his efforts, because they realized that without him (and his severity) they'd never got this far.And of course, Joe Cocker's great ballad 'Up where we belong' is worth mentioning.  You can hear the theme throughout the entire film, but the actual version with Cocker singing comes at the end when Gere carries Winger in his arms.All in all, this is definitely one of the better romantic films made in the last 20 years!
