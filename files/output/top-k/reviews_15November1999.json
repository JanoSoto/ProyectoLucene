For years other countries like Japan have understood that it is not the medium in which a film is created, but the story behind it that counts. Antz has taken that concept to the U.S. and I am very happy that they did.  I have nothing against Disney animation.... as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of it, but Antz is definitely not a Disney film.  It is an adult film that children may enjoy.  It is aimed at the adult, but marketed for children.  Woody Allen was his typical neurotic self.  Sly Stallone played one of his best roles in years. And Christopher Walken was great as usual. Check it out if you get the chance.  P.S. This movie may not be a great idea for extremely young children.  There are a few brutal war scenes which might scare a young child (the termite battle for those of you that have seen the movie).  You may want to view it before showing it to a child, just to make sure it isn't too violent for them.

The book spent much more time covering Adele and Ann's struggles to make ends meet than the film did.  You see the lights go out and hear that they have very little money, but do not really see many sacrifices in the film.  Even the loss of electricity is explained as a forgotten bill rather than as an inability to pay.  It is never clear how they make it when Adele is between jobs.  The one-time sale of a prized possession doesn't come near to rectifying the financial obligations at the end of the picture.  Why not allow Ann to earn money as a television actress as she did it the book rather than make her a grocery store employee who would be able to save very little?  The one-night stand with Dr. Spritzer and Adele's unrealistic hopes about it do not make sense to me except in their desperate need for steady income.  All the film allows is that Ann needed braces.  How can you have Natalie Portman play Ann and expect anyone to buy that one? The emotional traumas and the bond between Adele and Ann do work except in the end where it is hard to tell who is more devastated.  At best they have a codependent relationship where Ann has at least as hard a time functioning without Adele as Adele does functioning without Ann.  It is Adele who plays the unforgivable trump card of abandonment on occasion and risks her relationship with Ann by her life choices.  Ann can't get 50 feet from her Mother without caving in.   I found it hard buying that the Ann shown in the first two-thirds of the film really wanted what she got in the end.  The most affecting performances for me were when they interacted with other people and when they comforted each other.  The carpet salesman, the dam painter, Peter, and Benny added a little life to the picture.  The whole scene in the restaurant where Adele finds the first workable apartment and Ann falls apart with the finality of it was beautifully played.  The casting audition and the phone call to Ann's Father were heartbreaking as were Adele's fears of being shut out of Ann's life. Every time Ann and Adele made connections the film took off.  The personality conflicts along the way felt like sitcom window-dressing.The promos talked about how Ann was practical and Adele was irresponsible, but the film didn't show Ann taking care of anything that Adele missed.  She groused about her Mother's lame attempts at levity when things were bad but never came up with better answers.  The only thing Adele did that made me angry was her abandonment of Ann when she couldn't handle the criticism.  Otherwise, the film gave her a full-blooded understandable existence.  Ann, on the other hand, was a cipher.  What did she want besides friends, escape from her Mother, and an understanding of why her Father left her?  You never learn what makes her tick or what she possesses that draws Peter to her in the first place.  I wish the film had enlivened her role with actions, thoughts, or desires separate from grousing about her Mother or laughing at Peter's lame jokes.

For those of you that have seen this film, you all know what I am going to say is the gospel, for those of you that haven't, if you ever see a film for a singular performance, see two films. One is Tombstone because of Val Kilmer and the other is Pulp Fiction for Rhames.  His portrayal of Marcellus Wallace is one of the greatest performances in the history of motion pictures.  His mannerisms, his dialect, his virility, his coolness and his ruthlessness all should have given him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year, even over Samuel Jackson.  Just think back to some of this lines, some of his actions and some of his facial expressions.  This is the epitome of greatness and if I could pick 5 performances in the history of film that are the embodiment of powerful interpretations and believability, this would easily be up there. Just look at the scene when Jules talks to him after the Marvin problem. Jules is freaking out and Wallace calmly responds  I'm on the m*****f***a, go back inside and chill them niggas out, I'm sending in tha Wolf.   As he delivers the line he is serenely sitting in his backyard with his cool shades covering his malicious eyes and he is wiping his mouth with an expensive hanky.  His delivery is perfect and when you listen to him you don't think this is a ruthless killer, he is just a guy next door with a very nice house.  And what makes it even better is that they are two gangsters talking about alleviating the Bonnie situation before she gets home.  These are two bad ass criminals that are in the business of killing people and they are attempting to save a man's marriage by removing a dead body from the garage.  That is just dripping with contradictions, but it works because of the writing and because of the delivery, mostly by Rhames. Another scene that demonstrates his grasp of his character is the rape scene.  When he finally gets around to his comeuppance against  Billy Boy , he spits out his dialogue with such venom that while you are cheering his triumph, you are actually worried for Zed and his soon-to-be-living-his-shortass-life-in-agonizing-pain-rapist situation.  And then when he talks to Butch, he is fair and thankful for Butch's assistance but cannot forget how Butch betrayed him.   Oh that what now.  I'll tell you what now.  There is no me and you.  You leave town tonight and when you be gone you stay gone.  You lost all your L.A. privledges.   Ving Rhames is my favourite part of the film ( besides the ridiculously intelligent and original script ) and quoting him is now a daily regimen at work with my other friends that like the film.  I think Tarantino is so smart for casting Rhames in this role and what it makes it that much better is knowing that Rhames is one of the most humble men in Hollywood, remember when he gave back his Emmy to Jack Lemmon as he tearfully said that he hadn't paid enough dues yet and Lemmon was one of his idols?  The man can do no wrong in my eyes.  He is one of a kind.As for the rest of Pulp Fiction, this is a film that will often be imitated but never duplicated.  That is an old cliche but it is so true in this case. It is completely original and without a doubt, what makes it so original and so great is simply the writing.  What other film can have gangsters talking about foot massages and the importance of them just before they are about to perform a hit.  What other film can describe in great detail what a pilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all before entering into a room to ramble on about the Bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with extreme prejudice.  There is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film.  Pulp fiction takes violence and surrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some strange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared car with domesticated products that are located under Jimmy's sink, oral pleasure, speaking Bora Bora, getting day jobs as opposed to robbing banks, being cool like Fonzie and five dollar milkshakes.  How and where Tarantino thought of this script is beyond me, all I know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that I have seen Pulp Fiction.  I can understand why this film was passed over at the Oscars for Forrest Gump, but in most people's opinion this was the best film of 1994.  I loved Gump and Shawshank Redemption but I also loved Pulp Fiction and if it would have won Best Picture that year I would have been just as happy.  Pulp Fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be remembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200 years ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) Pulp Fiction is going to be one of them mentioned.  When you can have Christopher Walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have Travolta and Jackson talk about walking the Earth like Kane in Kung Fu, have Eric Stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a shot to an O.D-ing Uma Thurman, have Harvey Keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 800 AM and then appear on the scene to solve problems have Tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy stuff his wife buys, have Bruce Willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have Ving Rhames talk about having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and pop a cap in someone's ass if he shows up in Indo-China and have it all make sense, well you have something special.  Pulp Fiction isn't a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true film fans.  This may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life and they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some Hollywood films.  This is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen and paper.  It redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and a half hours. I did, immensely, and I think most people will, and have.  If you really have not seen this, then you are robbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film.  This is easily one of the best films ever made.  How anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and I can't see how you can truly call yourself a film fan if you can't see the brilliance of this film.

What other film can describe in great detail what a pilot for a film is and then talk about a man that fell through a four story window and develop a speech impediment, all before entering into a room to ramble on about the Bible and how tasty the burgers are before executing them with extreme prejudice.  There is a simple and definitive answer to that question, no film.  Pulp fiction takes violence and surrounds it with every day conversations with people that seem to be in a different world yet they jump through some strange porthole and into ours by discussing things like blueberry muffins, how good coffee is, cleaning a blood smeared car with domesticated products that are located under Jimmy's sink, oral pleasure, speaking Bora Bora, getting day jobs as opposed to robbing banks, being cool like Fonzie and five dollar milkshakes.  How and where Tarantino thought of this script is beyond me, all I know is that my film life and even my life is richer now that I have seen Pulp Fiction.  I can understand why this film was passed over at the Oscars for Forrest Gump, but in most people's opinion this was the best film of 1994.  I loved Gump and Shawshank Redemption but I also loved Pulp Fiction and if it would have won Best Picture that year I would have been just as happy.  Pulp Fiction is one of the best films ever made and it will be remembered into the new millennium and my bet is that when film people are talking about the best films of the last 200 years ( when it is about to turn 2100 ) Pulp Fiction is going to be one of them mentioned.  When you can have Christopher Walken talk with a straight face about hiding a watch in a place that was not meant to store medal, have Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth talk seriously about robbing a restaurant, have Travolta and Jackson talk about walking the Earth like Kane in Kung Fu, have Eric Stoltz shout at his wife to find his little black medical book before he gives a shot to an O.D-ing Uma Thurman, have Harvey Keitel appear in a full tuxedo at 800 AM and then appear on the scene to solve problems have Tarantino appear himself as a guy that knows the difference between gourmet coffee and the crappy stuff his wife buys, have Bruce Willis decide what weapon he is going to use to stop the bad guys, have Ving Rhames talk about having a guy pop out of a bowl of rice and pop a cap in someone's ass if he shows up in Indo-China and have it all make sense, well you have something special.  Pulp Fiction isn't a movie, it is an experience, it is a gift to true film fans.  This may not be for everyone as some people forget this is a film and they think it is a documentary on life and they get offended because it is not about love and honesty and morals and all that other crap that exists in some Hollywood films.  This is a film that takes all that you have ever known about film and bludgeons it to death with a pen and paper.  It redefines what is acceptable and what is off beat and all it asks you to do is enjoy this film for 2 and a half hours. I did, immensely, and I think most people will, and have.  If you really have not seen this, then you are robbing yourself of one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of film.  This is easily one of the best films ever made.  How anyone can disagree is beyond my understanding and I can't see how you can truly call yourself a film fan if you can't see the brilliance of this film.

When it became director heavy it really lacked.  What I mean by that is the technique of film became more important that than the integrity of the story.  Stone used so many silly and pretenscious shots that it took away from the experience of the movie.  That is the same with Michael Mann's The Insider.The Insider is an interesting film about an interesting topic. I'm not sure if I would invest more than 70 million dollars into it, but it is an interesting topic.  The story and the two great lead actors are the strength of the film.  But what is almost an abomination is the work done by Michael Mann.  Sometimes a film has such strength in it's script that it can survive on that alone.  Think of work by Tarantino or Kevin Smith.  They usually have material that is strong enough that you don't need a lot of camera work or an infinite number of camera movements to capture the essence of a scene.  The Insider is directed like a it is made by a guy that is fresh out of film school and wants to use every technique he ever learned and that means using 25 different angles for one scene in a room.  The Insider has more close-ups and over the shoulder two shots that I can recall any movie having in quite some time.  And that became boring and cumbersome after about 15 minutes.  Whatever point was trying to be made had been done in overdrive.  Close up of Crowe and his kids= he loves his kids and their life and safefy is at stake.  Close up of Crowe= he is in imminent danger.  Close up of Crowe and his wife= they are in danger and they are on shaky ground.  Close up of Pacino=  I don't know what, it could mean anything, maybe Mann is obsessed with close ups of actors.  But they were not needed in this film.  I got tired of them, I didn't need to see every pore on Pacino's face, every wrinkle on Crowes forehead, every hurt expression on Crowe's wifes face magnified twenty times.  Movies have directors so that they have direction but that does not mean that I need or want to know that they are there behind the screen and off to the right of what is happening on screen.  I've always thought that a film works better when the presence of a director is not felt.  When you can look at a screen and feel like you are peering into someone else's conversation, then that is the best kind of film making.  Spielberg is a master of it, Tarantino and Smith are as well and even a guy like Robert Zemekis is wonderful at doing that.  But Michael Mann seems as though he is unsure of himself as a director of films that are laden with dialogue so he compensates his ineptitude by using every shot he possibly can.  This is the biggest problem with the film, but it is not the only problem.  As interesting as the film is, in subject matter that is, it is really quite boring and slow.  There were many times that I groaned silently and wanted the film to end.  But it just kept going.  And I also felt that as good as Pacino was, he wasn't allowed to act, he was always just waiting in the background to do or say something.  The times when he was allowed to show emotion were the best parts of the film.  There is a scene in the office of 60 Minutes when Pacino is allowed to explode after his character has been told that his story is not going to air.  Here he blows and tells them how foolish they are and how much of a corporate puppet they have become and I will bet good money that when Pacino is nominated for an Oscar, when they show the clip that showcases his talents for the Oscar at the ceremony, it will be this piece that they show.  He really excells for about five minutes in this one scene.  But that's all there is, really.  The rest of the film he just sort of waits in the shadows to do anything memorable.  I don't know how you make a film like this better, with the subject matter and all, but I know one way to do it is to let Pacino loose and another way would be to get a better director.  I mean let's face it, no matter how good your subject matter is, if it is something that you can make into an A&E Special, perhaps it shouldn't be on the big screen for 150 mintues.  Overall this is an unsatisfying movie and one that I don't really think redeems itself.  I had seen Dogma the day before this, and as I stood in line, freezing on a blistery Saturday afternoon in Toronto, waiting for the Pokemon kids to get their tickets in front of me for their beloved film, I commented to the cashier that I was probably the only one seeing something else besides Pokemon.  He told me that I was probably right, except Dogma was selling out as well.  I wish I had gone to see that again.  It too was quite long ( about 2 hours in length ) but it was funny and enjoyable along with being interesting.  The Insider and Michael Mann should take lessons from Dogma and Kevin Smith.

If only I saw a trailer, I'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes.But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he write it as well?

This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood.The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. It's even covered with clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? Hollywood obviously did not believe so. Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. Why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. Just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. The traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps. I did not laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes.But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one.

Still, it is not a mindless shoot em up which most sci-fi movies are these days, so overall I enjoyed it.Like all Star Trek movies Insurrection has a convoluted plot that involves various pseudo scientific details and Star Trek concepts and in jokes. Meaning, it helps to have seen the TV shows to better understand what is going on. This is probably the main obstacle to why Star Trek movies have never been blockbusters. Now about the plot. This may be a spoiler so, you have been warned. The basis of the film is greed and robbery. The Ba'ku who live on a beautiful planet are a defenseless culture who have something valuable, a special form of energy called metaphasic energy which reverses aging. The bad guys, the Son'a, want to kill the Ba'ku for it. The Federation proposes a forced evacuation of the Ba'ku so the Federation can share this valuable thing with the Son'a. Captain Picard insists on a compromise that would allow the Ba'ku to continue their life on their planet and for the Son'a and the Federation in cooperation with the Ba'ku to use the metaphasic energy of for an anti-aging treatment.You might have been confused by that paragraph but being a Star Trek fan this was pretty routine. Insurrection is about a Star Trek idea called the prime directive which means the Federation is not supposed to interfere with the cultures of other planets. Is this interesting enough to be a good movie? It could have been if presented in a more clear and unusual way.   Besides the complicated plot, the main problem with Insurrection is that the Ba'ku are pretty boring. They look like people from California living in a hippie commune. If you compare this to the planet Tatooine in Star Wars you can see that the Ba'ku planet could have been more exciting. Another problem is the typical love affair between the Star Trek captain and one of the cute aliens. A pretty worn out plot twist.So, why did I like Insurrection?

What was all the controversy about? This is a beautiful film but it is definitely not for the Bible purists. This film requires an open mind, especially in the beginning of the film which seems to be pure conjecture as very little is known of Jesus' live before he began his earthly ministry.The film becomes more interesting when Jesus begins his ministry and we start recognizing more familiar events as recorded in the Bible. The film reflects a more realistic version of everyday life in the middle east, the musical score adds to the overall feel. This is not your typical big hollywood production Jesus movies that tend to follow the Bible word fo word. As Christians we believe Christ to be both divine and human. This film really brings out the human side of Christ and for the purist it may prove to be a problem but the film does not detract from the divine nature of Christ. Instead, the film shows a man much like ourselves, struggling with decisions, looking for answers. The film captures the political climate of that era as he is confronted with a multitudes of people, each one it seems with different agendas then what he is trying to teach.The spirituality of the film grows and grows as you become involved with the  different characters. My favorite line in the film occurs after Jesus disrupts the money changers outside the temple and begins explaining to the people around him that God is a spirit that is in everyone. When the priests come out of the temple to see what is happening he says to them, Do you think God is only for you? God is not an Israelite! The political and spiritual climate of the film is highlighted when Jesus is sent to Pontius Pilate. Pilate says to Jesus that he is more dangerous then the zealots because he tries to change ideas and attitudes. This was one of the very things that Christ was trying to teach some of his disciples. It does no good to get rid of Rome, if the heart remains corrupt, only another ruler just as bad will take the place of the Roman.The most controversial part of the film is the last twenty minutes. Christ is tempted away from his mission but in the end it is Christ who is victorious over Satan. When Christ is returned to the cross the message seems to be saying to us that there is hope for all of us.

It does no good to get rid of Rome, if the heart remains corrupt, only another ruler just as bad will take the place of the Roman.The most controversial part of the film is the last twenty minutes. Christ is tempted away from his mission but in the end it is Christ who is victorious over Satan. When Christ is returned to the cross the message seems to be saying to us that there is hope for all of us.  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"15 November 1999","score":"","review":"  After hearing and reading all the controversy surrounding this film I was somewhat puzzled. What was all the controversy about? This is a beautiful film but it is definitely not for the Bible purists. This film requires an open mind, especially in the beginning of the film which seems to be pure conjecture as very little is known of Jesus' live before he began his earthly ministry.The film becomes more interesting when Jesus begins his ministry and we start recognizing more familiar events as recorded in the Bible. The film reflects a more realistic version of everyday life in the middle east, the musical score adds to the overall feel. This is not your typical big hollywood production Jesus movies that tend to follow the Bible word fo word. As Christians we believe Christ to be both divine and human. This film really brings out the human side of Christ and for the purist it may prove to be a problem but the film does not detract from the divine nature of Christ. Instead, the film shows a man much like ourselves, struggling with decisions, looking for answers. The film captures the political climate of that era as he is confronted with a multitudes of people, each one it seems with different agendas then what he is trying to teach.The spirituality of the film grows and grows as you become involved with the  different characters. My favorite line in the film occurs after Jesus disrupts the money changers outside the temple and begins explaining to the people around him that God is a spirit that is in everyone. When the priests come out of the temple to see what is happening he says to them, Do you think God is only for you? God is not an Israelite!

Any one who says this movie is a masterpiece clearly has no right reviewing films. This film, if I can call it that, is more calculated and commercial than any piece-of-garbage summer flick to come down the pipe in quite some time. It almost makes Godzilla look heartfelt. Lucas has sold out big time, not that he hadn't done so earlier, but this is really reaching new lows. Perhaps George should take a little time to examine why he started making films so long ago. Make a statement, for God's sake put your heart fully into something. What do the words Jar-Jar mean to you, well thats the entire movie as far as I'm concerned. The Phantom Menace is Jar-Jar. One big fake cartoon made to entertain the slow-witted and create toy-consuming zombies of us all. Do you really believe there is a shred of dignity left in the series after this tired piece of crap. It is a shame, I actually respected good-old George for a period of time.

On a pure gut level, I found the film very effective, in a way I'm sure the filmmakers intended.  The improvised, home movie nature of the film generates an authentic feel to the proceedings, despite lapses in logic (like why Heather would continue shooting when in a life-or-death situation). A couple images stayed with me long after the film ended, like the unbundling of the twigs, and Mike standing in the corner of the house at the end. I also like the fact that the characters, particularly Heather, start out very cocky and self-assured and become emotional and vulnerable by the film's end.But I was also left wanting so much more. There simply was not enough background on the legend before the scary stuff started happening. Adding another ten or fifteen minutes of setup in the town would have helped tremendously.  Even when they're in the woods, a scene or two of Heather reading from the witch cult book would have helped flesh out the situation. Other viewers have suggested a framing device of a mock television special to help establish the situation more, and I think that would have been a good idea. Despite the intensity of some of the later scenes, I was never able to fully appreciate their predicament because I never fully understood the threat.So in the end the film feels half-baked . . . great technique, but rushed, as if the details hadn't been fully thought out by the time of the shooting. Too bad . . .  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 1999","score":"","review":"  Finally got around to watching TBWP (on video, with the lights off), and I'm still sorting out my feelings on it.
