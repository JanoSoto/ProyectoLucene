As with previous movies that I have seen, such as Blade and Mystery Men, also by former music video directors, the use of color to capture one's attention is utilized extremely well.

Baz Luhrman takes his directorial style to new heights with this soaring story of love.  At the heart of the movie is the simplest idea.  All you need is love. Now...for the cynical moviegoer...this won't be enough to sustain your interest for two hours.   But for the moviegoer who loves to believe in love, this movie delivers. Set admist the very un-romantic setting of a french brothel in 1900 is a story of true romance.  AND IT'S A MUSICAL!!! Firt...a note on musicals...the theory behind musicals isn't to be cheesy as many moviegoers feel.  It is said that characters in musicals sing and dance because they have to.  They've expressed all of their emotions in speech and need a new platform to convey their feelings.  So they sing...they sing for life...for love...and for the world.  Granted...it gives the performer a chance to show off his abilities...to wow the audience with a number or two. But it is meant to express the charcters inner feelings.That's what Moulin Rouge does.  Going with the convention of using modern day lyrics in 1900 France...the musical numbers explode from the screen. Baz is a master of eye candy...but beneath his candy is feeling...passion and romance.  Maybe the lead vocals were doctored.  To quote history...Audrey Hepburn did not do all of her own singing in MY FAIR LADY and that is considered a masterpiece.  Entire characters vocal tracks were dubbed in THE KING and I and even recently in EVERYBODY SAYS I LOVE YOU  a nice musical as well)  Drew Barrymore was obviously overdubbed.  Those stars of movie musicals inthe past weren't the greatest singers either...but they emoted...just like Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor. This is coming from a person who is not an avid musical fan.  I hate the cheesy MY FAIR LADY's and GIGI's and anything with Rodger or Hammerstein in the title.  I like the musicals that speak to the audience in a real way. Like Cabaret...or Chorus Line.  Moulin Rouge spoke to me.  It created a world where love is possible...and not only possible...but wonderful. Where love can make you sing. Visually the movie is like nothing before.  Baz exploits all the best of cinema.  With his quick takes, and moving camera, and extreme close-ups you see all the little sublties in a not so subtle movie.To pause on that...the movie isn't subtle.  That isn't its intention...the musical from 1960 and before isn't subtle.  Its not supposed to be.  TO use current lyrics is brilliant by Baz.  It allows the viewers to be connected and still experience a musical.  Something which is foreign to modern movie-goers. Baz is trying to recreate the musical...which is needed. There is talk of RENT and CHICAGO being movies.  I hope they are.  So few people view the theatre anymore...and what better way to expose them to it but to bring it to the movies. Back to the movie...to truly experience the movie you have to let yourself go...accept the blatantness of the movie and allow all of its conventions to surround.  It is more than a two hour music video...it is a simple story of love...where every emotion is so great...the characters must sing. The characters will carry you away.  Ewan is moving as the lost poet with love in his heart...and Kidman is appropriately fetching and sensistive. They float this movie up into the moonlit scenes that much of it takes place in. I'm hoping the academy doesn't look over Jim Broadbent who steals everyscene he is in...like the Emcee of Cabaret Broadbent embodies the feeling of the Moulin Rouge.  He is the abandoment of the club...but more than that he is its heart.  John Leguizamo...who may become a Baz staple...is very scene stealing and very effective. In sum...the cast shines...the movie shines...and you will want to talk about it after it is over.  See the movie which EXPLOITS (in a good way) all that cinema has to offer.

The title character is played by Sissy Spacek, who, under the circumstances, does very good things with her character. Carrie's mother has raised her under a constricting environment of fanatical religion and strict discipline. As both the novel and the movie open, we meet Carrie White, a high school senior who has a very complex body; she is telepathic-contains the ability to move objects with her mind-and she has never had a period. Now, I know I am becoming graphic in my explanation, but this is an important aspect of the story. The audience assumes from the implications and plot points that Carrie has had a rather cloudy history as a person and student. Her neighbors look away as she passes, her fellow students pitch tampons at her when she experiences her first vaginal bleeding in the school showers. These are the only things that develop Carrie White as a character-the rest is up to you to assume. In a movie where the main character kills countless presumably innocent individuals due to unkempt rage and years of building aggression, we better be able to understand her, but  the movie does not provide us with the right material.The problem with Carrie is not so much a problem with the movie itself, but a problem with the novel by Stephen King, and the adapted script by Lawrence D. Cohen. I read the novel before I saw the movie. I obtained a videocassette copy for critical screening to compare the two arts. I hated the book. Stephen King confused his simple, one-line story with frequent scientific rationalizations of the occurrences within the actual novel. It is like he didn't trust the reader with his idea, and felt the need to provide us with factual evidence that the story could actually happen. This distorts the narrative, and provides the reader with nothing but more questions. I like the movie better than the book because it is more visual. Although King wrote some vivid, picturesque scenes in his vastly popular work, Carrie makes for a much clearer screen presence because it is not so jumbled with awkward ideas and interceptive explanations. However, I still dislike the movie. Screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen does not alter King's depiction of the characters-one of the biggest problems with both the movie and the book. The character's in Carrie both in the movie and in the book, are all one-dimensional and stereotypical. The mother is a religious fanatic obsessed with finding forgiveness in everything her daughter does; the kind hearted counselor befriends Carrie, boosting her confidence to where she actually has the courage to accept a young man's invitation to the upcoming prom; the spiteful schoolgirls, obsessed with self-image and popularity, vow for revenge against Carrie, when Carrie herself was simply a victim of cruelty; need I go on? The character's are all seen in one light, and one light alone. The kind counselor never does anything mean. Carrie's mother sees everything as a sin against the Lord. Even Carrie herself is over the top in shame, hopelessness, and confusion. I never cared about any of the characters, therefore, instead of being terrified and involved when the film's disappointing but violent climax transpires, I was left analyzing my thoughts of why I didn't care in the least about what happens.Carrie isn't a terrible movie. I liked the scenes at the prom and beyond; it has a good sense of style and momentum. It proves that Lawrence D. Cohen has a mind of his own, instead of using identical material to the novel. But it is overrated, tiresome, and often boring. This is not a scary movie-just a violent, abhorrent one. It contains all the necessary ingredients to make for a tantalizing, suspenseful motion-picture-but it never delivers. There are avid horror principles here, but Carrie doesn't seem to understand what to do with them.

These are the only things that develop Carrie White as a character-the rest is up to you to assume. In a movie where the main character kills countless presumably innocent individuals due to unkempt rage and years of building aggression, we better be able to understand her, but  the movie does not provide us with the right material.The problem with Carrie is not so much a problem with the movie itself, but a problem with the novel by Stephen King, and the adapted script by Lawrence D. Cohen. I read the novel before I saw the movie. I obtained a videocassette copy for critical screening to compare the two arts. I hated the book. Stephen King confused his simple, one-line story with frequent scientific rationalizations of the occurrences within the actual novel. It is like he didn't trust the reader with his idea, and felt the need to provide us with factual evidence that the story could actually happen. This distorts the narrative, and provides the reader with nothing but more questions. I like the movie better than the book because it is more visual. Although King wrote some vivid, picturesque scenes in his vastly popular work, Carrie makes for a much clearer screen presence because it is not so jumbled with awkward ideas and interceptive explanations. However, I still dislike the movie. Screenwriter Lawrence D. Cohen does not alter King's depiction of the characters-one of the biggest problems with both the movie and the book. The character's in Carrie both in the movie and in the book, are all one-dimensional and stereotypical. The mother is a religious fanatic obsessed with finding forgiveness in everything her daughter does; the kind hearted counselor befriends Carrie, boosting her confidence to where she actually has the courage to accept a young man's invitation to the upcoming prom; the spiteful schoolgirls, obsessed with self-image and popularity, vow for revenge against Carrie, when Carrie herself was simply a victim of cruelty; need I go on? The character's are all seen in one light, and one light alone. The kind counselor never does anything mean. Carrie's mother sees everything as a sin against the Lord. Even Carrie herself is over the top in shame, hopelessness, and confusion. I never cared about any of the characters, therefore, instead of being terrified and involved when the film's disappointing but violent climax transpires, I was left analyzing my thoughts of why I didn't care in the least about what happens.Carrie isn't a terrible movie. I liked the scenes at the prom and beyond; it has a good sense of style and momentum. It proves that Lawrence D. Cohen has a mind of his own, instead of using identical material to the novel. But it is overrated, tiresome, and often boring. This is not a scary movie-just a violent, abhorrent one. It contains all the necessary ingredients to make for a tantalizing, suspenseful motion-picture-but it never delivers. There are avid horror principles here, but Carrie doesn't seem to understand what to do with them.

What this movie lacks in special effects it makes up for in plot and detail.  This film shows both sides of the attack and puts little spin (as far as I can see) on the events that unfolded in 1941.  What makes this movie so great?  First, the Japanese speak Japanese, not English.  Second, the events that lead up to the attack are real (again, I am not a history major so I don't know everything that happened).  Third, real planes!!!  Many modern war movies decide to please the English-speaking audiences and all the dialogue that is needed is done in English rather than in the native tongue of the character.  Tora! Tora! Tora! uses both English and Japanese, adding another layer of realism to the film.  For all of you who can't read subtitles, learn to.  It might get a little tiresome, but after a while it becomes second nature.Unlike some war movies that use a famous battle as a backdrop, this film builds up to the battle with precision.  There is not false story woven into the plot to attract viewers, it is a truthful account of what happened.  This movie also gives justifications for what happened.  Pearl Harbor just throws out Yamamoto's quote about 'waking a sleeping giant,' but this movie gives the detail that this was because the Japanese ultimatum was handed in after the attack took place instead of before.  Done in the 70's, this movie used real planes and real stunts.  Modern movies tend to computerize many of the attacks and squadrons.  This movie uses real planes doing real things.  Does it really matter if the pilots are flying in front of a screen?  And, how many times do you need to see flaming fuselage rush at you?  A classic war movie, dated by many of today's standards, this film is excellent in showing the build-up and attack on Pearl Harbor.  If you want to see a movie about the attack, watch this movie, but be prepared to not see any fancy special effects.  It might look like a regular PBS documentary on what happened, but it is still good.  If you like to see what really happened - without Hollywood hype shoved in your face - then this is a movie to see.

You spend the $30.00 bucks; between admission, popcorn and two cokes, on this should-have-been- brilliant-why- look-at-the-cast movie. Always be wary of any movie the studio tags as a zany comedy. Zany? Billy Zane better be one of the stars or chances are higher than Kevin Spacey's real hair line it's a clunker of titanic proportions! Case in point this, zany, dare I say whacky, comedy!Though there are some brilliantly funny scenes-mostly at the hands of Star Martin Lawrence's, costars! Sorry, Martin seemed zoned out when not doing his signature frantic comic routines. The scene-stealer of the evening was William Fichtner. A big-ole-smit here at Blunt Review. But, it wasn't his unusually mapped good looks this time that had me all apple pie ala'mode giddy-with-glee each time he appeared, but his character was like a breath of fresh shtick comedy. Fichtner plays a Peroit- meets- Liberace-meets-Guffman Boston police detective, named Alex Tardio, whose sexuality is all over the board. In less capable hands this too could have been unoriginal and trite. WTWTCH is all about penis envy. Or, perhaps just a plain old battle of juvenile male egos, lacking only, the comparisons of penile size. Though Lawrence does go there briefly...Robber Kevin (Martin Lawrence- who has skin so beautifully smooth it looks almost like those clay-mation dolls from the Nestea commercials) is caught fist-full-o-lute by a billionaire, in the billionaire's home mid, robbery. This billionaire, Max Fairbanks (Danny Devito), decides to hoodwink the hood and tells the cops the robber has one last trinket still due return... A ring, on his finger. The cops remove the robber's ring and give it over to the richer robber. The games begin.See this tacky ring was a gift from Kevin's new soul mate Amber (a simply gorgeous Carmen Ejogo).

He picks up a wheelchair-bound girlfriend (Marisa Coughlin) who gets her jollies by being caned in the legs with a bamboo stick.

Critics don't just hate Freddy; they seem personally hurt by the film, as if Green had made the picture just to upset them and get their goat.

Therefore, his film can be regarded as something of a great success. Personally, I agree with many of the critics who have described Freddy as surrealist.  There is no attempt to integrate this action into anything resembling the real world.  Gord is not a human being, but rather a collection of characteristics.  Green plays him as a bizarrely aggressive man-child, a mishmash of helplessly repeated words and phrases, slack-jawed willful stupidity, and screaming, utterly pointless hysterics.  Frankly, I admire this approach to the characterization.  After seeing so many recent comedies ruined by the filmmakers' need to make their characters both laughable and likeable (most recently with the stultifying Joe Dirt), it is refreshing to see Green so willing to come off as annoying, hateful, cruel, UNLIKEABLE.

The film suffers from too many muddy visuals, and many moments just lie there on the screen, wriggling when they should fly.  Still, the film does what it is supposed to.  Half the time you're laughing, the other half just staring at the screen in goggle-eyed shock.  You may hate Freddy, you may love it, but either way, you have to admit that you've never seen anything like it before.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 June 2001","score":"","review":"  Over the past couple of years, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have proven themselves to be extremely adept at creating `popcorn movies' - good, solid action films that probably aren't going to win any Oscars, but are undeniably entertaining.  The secret to making these sorts of films (`The Rock', `Armageddon') seems to be to hype up the action and to not take things terribly seriously.  Unfortunately, Bruckheimer and Bay took the same cavalier attitude in making `Pearl Harbor', a film whose very subject matter demands a certain amount of respect. By its very nature, `Pearl Harbor' should've been a film that made the audience ponder the absolute senseless horror of war . . . instead, it's a popcorn movie.  The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor is treated with so little respect is not only disappointing, it's downright insulting. SPOILERS ALERT Like `Titanic', the film `Pearl Harbor' uses a romance between fictional characters to help tell a true story.  Not a bad idea, except the romance in `Pearl Harbor' is so wooden and forced, watching it is like having a salad fork stuck in your eye.  (For those of you who thought the romance in `Titanic' was bad . . . heh, heh, wait 'til you see `Pearl Harbor'!)  The film starts with two childhood friends from Tennessee named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). After the obligatory opening childhood sequence to demonstrate how tight these two guys really are, we get to see them enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love - gee, who could've seen this coming? - with the same pretty young nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale).  Evelyn first chooses Rafe as her love interest, but when he's reported dead, Danny gets his chance. The reports of Rafe's death turn out to be greatly exaggerated, and he of course returns to find Evelyn . . . in Pearl Harbor, mere hours before the start of the bombing.Forgetting the actual bombing for a second, the romance is so witless it's funny.  I kept expecting to see Crow and Tom Servo from MST3K pop in the corner of the movie screen.  Lines like I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you scream Tori Spelling TV-Movie-Of-The-Week . . . the fact that they're in a big-budget movie like this is hysterical.  The problem is, the romance is so uninteresting that it's impossible to care about either Rafe, Danny, or Evelyn - so when the bombs start falling on Pearl Harbor, their fate really doesn't matter.  This lack of emotional investment in any of these characters turns large sections of the film into something that can only be watched with clinical detachment instead of with genuine feeling, and the fact that it doesn't really matter if the main characters live or die makes the movie, very, very boring.  As Rafe, Ben Affleck continues to demonstrate that he's little more than a good-looking store mannequin.  Kate Beckinsale, who's normally quite a good actress, puts in an equally wooden performance as Evelyn, as does Josh Hartnett as Danny.  Considering that these three are the leads of the film, that's just pathetic.As for the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself - well, even if you're willing to ignore the many historical inaccuracies, the bombing is handled with such inept direction that it's embarrassing.  Despite the fact that it technically looks very good, it's constructed in a manner that suggests adolescent glee, not somber reality.  The battle scenes of `Saving Private Ryan' were designed to evoke horror.  The sinking scenes in `Titanic' managed to evoke similar feelings of dread.  In `Pearl Harbor', there's nothing but cartoonish violence.  There's an attitude of `look how cool this is!' throughout the bombing that's completely inappropriate.  For example, during the destruction of the USS Arizona in the film, Michael Bay cuts to the reaction of a cook as a bomb strikes the ship . . . the cook gives a Buckwheat-esque reaction that belongs in a `Three Stooges' short.  When I saw this in the theater, the audience, for the most part, laughed heartily at the cook's reaction.  I'll only pose this question Should anything at all about the destruction of the USS Arizona, where thousands died in senseless slaughter, be something to laugh at?  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seems to be little more to Bruckheimer and Bay than an excuse to make an action movie and to blow things up.  They rarely give the actual bombing - and its survivors - the respect they deserve, and their few attempts to actually do so are heavy-handed and pandering in nature.  In another director's hands, the story still would've been awful, but at least the tone of the film might've been on the mark.  Hopefully, Bay will never get another change to butcher a serious subject like this again, and will stick to stuff like `The Rock' from now on. Are there positives in this film?  There's some, I guess, but not enough to make `Peal Harbor' good.  Despite Michael Bay's mishandling of the tone of battle sequences, they are technically brilliant, and the effects work is outstanding.  (However, I get the feeling Bay should be paying out some cash to James Cameron, Terrence Malick, and Steven Spielberg for so shamelessly ripping shots from their films.  Bay is apparently turning into a new version of Brian DePalma - a technically brilliant director with no style of his own.)  Cuba Gooding Jr's performance as Dorie Miller is great . . . for the ten minutes he's actually in the movie.  It's nice, but he either needed to be a more significant character or cut from the film entirely.  Ditto the smaller roles of model James King as Nurse Betty, and Dan Ackroyd as Thurman - they're excellent, but underused.  Even though their performances are great, the overall film might've been better if losing the scenes using their characters meant trimming an hour off this already bloated film.  The only small role that was both outstanding and critical to the film was Jon Voight as FDR - he was inspiring to watch, and was one of the few important characters who didn't seem to be sleepwalking through the film.If `Pearl Harbor' was a film about a completely fictional subject - like `Armageddon' - it would still be incredibly dull and mediocre, bordering on bad.  The fact that it deals with an important historical event brimming with true stories of heroism and tragedy makes the film `Pearl Harbor' even worse.  It's an insulting film that's not worth renting, let alone watching in the theater.

The battle scenes of `Saving Private Ryan' were designed to evoke horror.  The sinking scenes in `Titanic' managed to evoke similar feelings of dread.  In `Pearl Harbor', there's nothing but cartoonish violence.  There's an attitude of `look how cool this is!' throughout the bombing that's completely inappropriate.  For example, during the destruction of the USS Arizona in the film, Michael Bay cuts to the reaction of a cook as a bomb strikes the ship . . . the cook gives a Buckwheat-esque reaction that belongs in a `Three Stooges' short.  When I saw this in the theater, the audience, for the most part, laughed heartily at the cook's reaction.  I'll only pose this question Should anything at all about the destruction of the USS Arizona, where thousands died in senseless slaughter, be something to laugh at?  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seems to be little more to Bruckheimer and Bay than an excuse to make an action movie and to blow things up.  They rarely give the actual bombing - and its survivors - the respect they deserve, and their few attempts to actually do so are heavy-handed and pandering in nature.  In another director's hands, the story still would've been awful, but at least the tone of the film might've been on the mark.  Hopefully, Bay will never get another change to butcher a serious subject like this again, and will stick to stuff like `The Rock' from now on. Are there positives in this film?  There's some, I guess, but not enough to make `Peal Harbor' good.  Despite Michael Bay's mishandling of the tone of battle sequences, they are technically brilliant, and the effects work is outstanding.  (However, I get the feeling Bay should be paying out some cash to James Cameron, Terrence Malick, and Steven Spielberg for so shamelessly ripping shots from their films.  Bay is apparently turning into a new version of Brian DePalma - a technically brilliant director with no style of his own.)  Cuba Gooding Jr's performance as Dorie Miller is great . . . for the ten minutes he's actually in the movie.  It's nice, but he either needed to be a more significant character or cut from the film entirely.  Ditto the smaller roles of model James King as Nurse Betty, and Dan Ackroyd as Thurman - they're excellent, but underused.  Even though their performances are great, the overall film might've been better if losing the scenes using their characters meant trimming an hour off this already bloated film.  The only small role that was both outstanding and critical to the film was Jon Voight as FDR - he was inspiring to watch, and was one of the few important characters who didn't seem to be sleepwalking through the film.If `Pearl Harbor' was a film about a completely fictional subject - like `Armageddon' - it would still be incredibly dull and mediocre, bordering on bad.  The fact that it deals with an important historical event brimming with true stories of heroism and tragedy makes the film `Pearl Harbor' even worse.  It's an insulting film that's not worth renting, let alone watching in the theater.  Grade C-  ","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"1 June 2001","score":"","review":"  Over the past couple of years, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have proven themselves to be extremely adept at creating `popcorn movies' - good, solid action films that probably aren't going to win any Oscars, but are undeniably entertaining.  The secret to making these sorts of films (`The Rock', `Armageddon') seems to be to hype up the action and to not take things terribly seriously.  Unfortunately, Bruckheimer and Bay took the same cavalier attitude in making `Pearl Harbor', a film whose very subject matter demands a certain amount of respect. By its very nature, `Pearl Harbor' should've been a film that made the audience ponder the absolute senseless horror of war . . . instead, it's a popcorn movie.  The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor is treated with so little respect is not only disappointing, it's downright insulting. SPOILERS ALERT Like `Titanic', the film `Pearl Harbor' uses a romance between fictional characters to help tell a true story.  Not a bad idea, except the romance in `Pearl Harbor' is so wooden and forced, watching it is like having a salad fork stuck in your eye.  (For those of you who thought the romance in `Titanic' was bad . . . heh, heh, wait 'til you see `Pearl Harbor'!)  The film starts with two childhood friends from Tennessee named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). After the obligatory opening childhood sequence to demonstrate how tight these two guys really are, we get to see them enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love - gee, who could've seen this coming? - with the same pretty young nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale).  Evelyn first chooses Rafe as her love interest, but when he's reported dead, Danny gets his chance. The reports of Rafe's death turn out to be greatly exaggerated, and he of course returns to find Evelyn . . . in Pearl Harbor, mere hours before the start of the bombing.Forgetting the actual bombing for a second, the romance is so witless it's funny.  I kept expecting to see Crow and Tom Servo from MST3K pop in the corner of the movie screen.  Lines like I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you scream Tori Spelling TV-Movie-Of-The-Week . . . the fact that they're in a big-budget movie like this is hysterical.  The problem is, the romance is so uninteresting that it's impossible to care about either Rafe, Danny, or Evelyn - so when the bombs start falling on Pearl Harbor, their fate really doesn't matter.  This lack of emotional investment in any of these characters turns large sections of the film into something that can only be watched with clinical detachment instead of with genuine feeling, and the fact that it doesn't really matter if the main characters live or die makes the movie, very, very boring.  As Rafe, Ben Affleck continues to demonstrate that he's little more than a good-looking store mannequin.  Kate Beckinsale, who's normally quite a good actress, puts in an equally wooden performance as Evelyn, as does Josh Hartnett as Danny.  Considering that these three are the leads of the film, that's just pathetic.As for the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself - well, even if you're willing to ignore the many historical inaccuracies, the bombing is handled with such inept direction that it's embarrassing.
