Everything looked so utterly and incomprehensibly lame that we couldn't even imagine how someone could deliberately make that movie.Our reaction was fairly typical.  The Black Hole died quickly and for years nobody would even whisper the movie's name at Disney.  But that was long ago.

I for one LOVE it, own it, and will watch it over and over again until the VHS tape burns out, and then I will buy the DVD and a DVD player and watch that (EXCELLENT DVD version, BTW)!So why do I like it so much?  Gee, where to begin ...*SPOILERS COMING UP*...how about that sweet, sweet kung-fu fighting scene between Neo and Morpheus?(My personal fave!)  Or when Keanu Reeves shows off his Oscar-caliber acting? (I still think the only line he delivered with any real power was Hell, Yes!; whoa, that's deep). Or those incredibly chic Italian suits Morpheus & Co. wore; you know, the trenchcoats that always dramatically flutter in the wind, and the little glasses of Morpheus's that always show reflections of Keanu's bewildered face.  Or those agents which looked like the MIB but whose voices sounded like records being played backwards.  Or that truly chilling scene when Neo awakens connected to a bunch of pipes in a pool of goo in a giant robotic harvesting plant.  Or when the helicopter explodes.  Or when the building lobby is destroyed by gunfire.  Or  the jump program. Or the squiddies.  Or when Rage Against the Machine is playing really loud in the background and Keanu stands there in his Raybans and looks like King of the World after beating the crap out of everybody.  And so on and so on.I could go on forever about the fun little details.  What really made the movie for me, though, was the surprisingly thoughtful premise and the flawless execution of it.First, the concept.  Although it's not the most original, it is plotted out in a novel and complex fashion that actually makes the viewer stop and think a little bit.  The Matrix isn't insulting to your intelligence, like most other action and scifi movies to come along in recent years (like Armageddon and MI2,to name just two).  It's also (surprisingly) multilayered.  Every time I see the movie, I see a new reference or hear a new bit of dialogue that entirely changes the way I view the movie.  It manages, despite all its trappings, to really make you question what our reality is and what humanity really is.Second, the Wachowski brothers have taken their premise and run with it, creating a sensory environment that perfectly matches the story.  The story comes from the comic books and it shows, yet it succeeds brilliantly in being translated to the screen thanks to superb editing, some of the best production design since the original Batman movies, and of course the effective SFX (BTW the bullet-time camera effects are NOT new here, but they are well-utilized in the movie and really accentuated the surreal atmosphere).  Overall, the FX helped break new ground and pave a new path for the way scifi will look in the next several years (THAT's why The Matrix took the Oscar -- they didn't just use CGI retreads like The Phantom Menace--which gets too many comparisons to this movie BTW, THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT).And, for those who complain about the acting, I have just one thing to say -- this movie is NOT about acting.  ANYONE could have played Neo or Morpheus -- the Hollywood-savvy directors simply knew they needed big names or no one would watch the movie.  And, I think that Keanu was the best big-name star to play Neo, because he is smart(?) enough not to overplay the part.  Can anyone imagine Tom Cruise in this role?  Ugh.  His ego would've taken over and he would've turned the film into his own personl star vehicle.  Neo is supposed to be an Everyman, and Keanu was perfectly adequate in conveying an Everyman's confusion at being in an extraordinary station.  That said, there ARE some decent performances in the movie -- Fishburne does well and obviously has fun with his role, and the much-overlooked Carrie Ann Moss does a great job as Trinity.  She is tough but sensitive, and she does a really good job in many scenes conveying the confusion, fear, and frustration anyone would feel in her desperate situation.It's only in the last hour, when the story takes a backseat to the action, that I ever felt the movie was pandering to me.  But by then, the setup had been effective enough and I cared enough about the situation and the characters that it didn't bother me.  At that point, it's just best to sit back, smile, and watch the carnage unfold.The Matrix is not a perfect movie;  it definitely has some plot flaws and weak acting that (I hope) will be resolved or explained away in the sequels. For those reasons, it cannot get a perfect score.  However, it is one of the most searing sensory\/emotional experiences I've had at the movies in recent years, and its sheer enjoyability (and viewability) alone would make me give it a 10\/10.Oh, and I wanna be Trinity when I grow up.

Overall, the FX helped break new ground and pave a new path for the way scifi will look in the next several years (THAT's why The Matrix took the Oscar -- they didn't just use CGI retreads like The Phantom Menace--which gets too many comparisons to this movie BTW, THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT).And, for those who complain about the acting, I have just one thing to say -- this movie is NOT about acting.  ANYONE could have played Neo or Morpheus -- the Hollywood-savvy directors simply knew they needed big names or no one would watch the movie.  And, I think that Keanu was the best big-name star to play Neo, because he is smart(?) enough not to overplay the part.  Can anyone imagine Tom Cruise in this role?  Ugh.  His ego would've taken over and he would've turned the film into his own personl star vehicle.  Neo is supposed to be an Everyman, and Keanu was perfectly adequate in conveying an Everyman's confusion at being in an extraordinary station.  That said, there ARE some decent performances in the movie -- Fishburne does well and obviously has fun with his role, and the much-overlooked Carrie Ann Moss does a great job as Trinity.  She is tough but sensitive, and she does a really good job in many scenes conveying the confusion, fear, and frustration anyone would feel in her desperate situation.It's only in the last hour, when the story takes a backseat to the action, that I ever felt the movie was pandering to me.  But by then, the setup had been effective enough and I cared enough about the situation and the characters that it didn't bother me.  At that point, it's just best to sit back, smile, and watch the carnage unfold.The Matrix is not a perfect movie;  it definitely has some plot flaws and weak acting that (I hope) will be resolved or explained away in the sequels. For those reasons, it cannot get a perfect score.  However, it is one of the most searing sensory\/emotional experiences I've had at the movies in recent years, and its sheer enjoyability (and viewability) alone would make me give it a 10\/10.Oh, and I wanna be Trinity when I grow up.  That girl kicks some!VERDICT  9.5\/10 -- Matrix 2 & 3 can't come soon enough!

Bruce Willis plays the straight man as a contract killer with a sense of humor.  Willis is always understated in his comedy roles, which was perfect considering Perry's antics.  Mostly Bruce just looked tough and smirked a lot.  Matthew Perry was full of energy and spontaneity.  He tended to go overboard at times, but he produced a lot of great sight gags and frenetic humor, which more than compensated for his excesses.  Michael Clarke Duncan once again makes a tough guy affable.  I always enjoy his work.  Natasha Henstridge took her role far too seriously, playing it more like a gangland drama than the comedy it was.  Amanda Peet's main purpose in this film was to take her top off and create a distraction.  In that regard, she succeeded nicely.  Rounding out the cast was Rosanna Arquette, whose French accent was terrible, but she was amusingly nasty in the villain role.Overall, this was a good comedy for people who enjoy inane low brow humor.  I am one of those people so I gave it a 7\/10.  However, for those looking for a snappy plot and intelligent dialogue, this film will probably disappoint.

ONE, was that I'd been duped by yet another Hollywood Summer Blockbuster campaign.  TWO, was that director Wolfgang Petersen (and I'm assuming that English is not his first language) has absolutely no ear for what sounds stupid and what doesn't.  This film is indeed strange in its ineptitude considering that Petersen has made several good and one quite excellent film.  However, dialogue does not a movie make. As they say, It's the story, Stupid.  More to the point, it's not quite the tale (a very intriguing and true one) that makes this film bad; it's the storytelling itself.  The fault lies completely in good ole' Wolfie's lap. The actors certainly achieved enough realism and warmth in their portrayals (with one glaring omission...more on that later), and Lucasfilm subsidiary and legendary FX house,ILM certainly held up their end of the deal with spectacular (but not perfect) stormy wave visuals.I am stuck then with a puzzle.  How could a major motion picture of such consequence manage to let scene after scene go by without giving us much more information about the characters than we get in their introductory scenes?  We know that Diane Lane loves Wahlberg and is worried, but that's all we get.  We know that Clooney is feeling the weight of command baring down on him.  Again, that's pretty much all we get.  Not only is this what we get, it's EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECT !!!  I sat in dismay as opportunity after opportunity was wasted.  No more info on the characters came, and boredom set in quickly.  This character deficit is made only more puzzling by the alternating subplot involving Karen Allen and a private boat being rescued that only managed to pull us away from the story, which I'd assumed was about the Andrea Gail and it's characters.We do, however, get the myriad cliches the endless close-ups of Diane Lane staring longingly out to sea with swelling strings underneath; the crusty old seaman in the bar; the waving child on the shore; Clooney's boss from Hell; the two men who hate each other (inexplicably) then end up as pals when one rescues the other; the shark attack for almost no reason at all. The whole film seemed to be done by the numbers.Which now leads me to a striking and disturbing cliche that even Hollywood has largely outgrown.  The character of Alfred Pierre, the one black fisherman with an accent (I'm assuming he's from Haiti) played by Allen Payne seems to have no opinions, almost no lines, and virtually nothing to do.  To understand the near impossibility of this is to know that the story plays out mainly on a boat with just a few guys.  All of them have storylines except Pierre.  ALL OF THEM !!!  Threadbare storylines, but storylines none-the-less.  In an early scene in the bar, he is introduced literally AS HE IS EXITING THE SCENE (to have sex with a woman), and that's that.  We assume he likes to have sex.  Then he gets on the boat with the rest of the guys and that's all we ever know about him.  Keep in mind that he's there for the entire film, being blasted with water cannons in front of a green screen along with his fellow castmates, so it seems all the more odd.  Imagine if ONE of the Brady kids just sat there week after week while EVERYONE ELSE had something to say and do.  The tragedy here is that Alfred Pierre died right with the rest of these men, and there is sadly no tribute to him what-so-ever.  Indeed Allen Payne the actor couldn't even use footage of this movie on his reel because he's practically an extra (for two hours!!!?).  AMAZING!!!To sum up, this is a film of astounding technical prowess and similarly astounding ineptitude.  It's loud.  At times, it's actually startling.  The sheer force of the visual effects keep it from being completely boring, but ultimately it's a huge, wet mess.

If you are like me, you usually read these comments after seeing the movie, so don't mind spoilers.The ending isn't bad, and it does provide a semi-plausible explanation for how the whole killing spree started, although it curiously makes no reference to killers or events in Scream 2.But why oh why are horror movies not aloud to have any suspense anymore (other than guessing who the killer is after weathering a storm of red herrings)? Almost every time the killer appears in all of the Scream movies (and all the other horror movies of recent years, the audience can see the killer in the background slowly coming forward. It's like there's a rule that says victims can be shocked, but not the audience.The other unwritten rule is that every time some doofus wanders off by themselves, they will be killed within two minutes. Can't somebody (who isn't the star who HAS to survive) ever wander off, face the killer, but then manage to get away?Can't a director and screenwriter put in a little effort to provide some suspense and terror other than wondering who is next to die, and who the killer will be 90 minutes after it starts?If Scream 3 had broken these rules even a couple of times, it would have been much more scary. A truly scary film like Deep Blue Sea at least breaks some of these rules to provide some true shocks, fear and surprises.And speaking of true scares, for those of you who liked the Drew Barrymore opening in the first Scream, you should see the movie this is copied from When a Stranger Calls, which opens with a terrorizing of a babysitter that has you white-knuckled, even if the rest of the movie is a let-down.And (SPOILER HERE), I thought it would have been really a good twist to conclude the trilogy if one of main characters had at least been the killer or supporting the killer, such as if Gail Weathers turned out to be the mastermind because of some deep secret history with Sydney. The half-brother director angle was mildly interesting.All-in-all not a bad movie, with some funny moments, but no scary ones scripted in, and would it really have been that hard to do so? The slasher movie would be so much more interesting and scary if you didn't have WARNING! SLASHING AHEAD! BE PREPARED! messages everywhere.
