As it is, I started out liking it OK, then over the course of the movie found myself liking it less and less, then actively disliking it more and more. By the end, I was really sorry I had shelled out ten bucks for the DVD. At this point, I don't even know if I'll bother to go back and check out the commentary track.Joe Dante is a reasonably talented director, John Sayles's screenplay mostly (*mostly*) avoids the aggressive stupidity of the average genre B-film, and most of the male actors are old pros (Paul Bartel is terrible; to be fair, I think that for some reason I don't understand, he's actually trying to be terrible). The women, of course, were hired for their looks, and they do fine on that basis.Still, it doesn't work, for several reasonsIt doesn't come close to transcending the genre clichés. Gee, evil military men, shortsighted gummint scientists, stupid cops, greedy businessmen, and a pompous and annoying authority figure. Ho-hum. Look if you do exactly what other movies do, in exactly the way they do it, your movie isn't transcending the clichés. It's clichéd.One exception to the above is that Bartel's annoying authority figure is not, as genre convention would dictate, a self-serving coward. Indeed, in one scene he is actually permitted to display considerable physical courage in saving other people's lives. So never let it be said I'm unwilling to give credit where credit is due.Worse, the piranhas kill in patently impossible ways. One character bleeds to death after the piranhas eat the foot which he dangles in the water. The next victim dies when the piranhas pull him out of a boat by his hand. The problem with all this is that when the victim felt the first nip, he would yank his hand or foot out of the water, and piranhas (even evil mutant warmongering gummint piranhas) are just not big enough to stop it. This isn't a matter of choice. If you've ever accidentally touched a hot stovetop burner, you'll know what I mean. Your hand jumps away from the burner by itself; no act of will is involved. It's pure reflex. It might be possible to *intentionally* place your hand on a burner and leave it there while it sears your flesh off your bones, but if you're not expecting the pain, you'll pull away.So we are forced to watch characters make *literally* superhuman efforts to let the piranhas eat them. It just looks stupid, no matter what the intentions of the filmmakers were. After this, it becomes impossible to take the film seriously on any level. If they wanted to do this kind of thing, they should have played it for laughs--on the other hand, given the level of the comic relief in this film (hey, Cletus, those pants hit that cop in the face, hyuk, hyuk), maybe that wouldn't have been such a good idea.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTThen, the film's first big setpiece mass attack includes (toward the beginning) a piece of business so stupid that one laughs--derisively--just at the wrong moment. And it ends--in spite of the presence of at least a dozen people in the water--with only one fatality (because the rest of the potential piranha snacks were children, and the filmmakers didn't have the guts to waste a kid). In other words, these superfish can pull a grown man off a boat, but they can't manage to chomp a few small children who are already immersed in the water. What a world, what a world.Of course, in the climactic attack, the piranhas are able with very little trouble to pull full-grown adults off of air mattresses and innertubes, which makes their failure in the preceding attack look just a little bit silly.And of course there's the basic problem with 99% of horror flicks horror isn't terror. I fail to understand how anyone can claim to be frightened by gouts of red liquid which they know isn't blood (you'd think this would be a source of embarrassment, rather than pride). In order to be truly frightening, a movie must present realistic and believable characters who we actually care about, and place them in danger. The body count isn't the point. JAWS is a perfect example of what I mean.

At this point, I don't even know if I'll bother to go back and check out the commentary track.Joe Dante is a reasonably talented director, John Sayles's screenplay mostly (*mostly*) avoids the aggressive stupidity of the average genre B-film, and most of the male actors are old pros (Paul Bartel is terrible; to be fair, I think that for some reason I don't understand, he's actually trying to be terrible).

This isn't a matter of choice. If you've ever accidentally touched a hot stovetop burner, you'll know what I mean. Your hand jumps away from the burner by itself; no act of will is involved. It's pure reflex. It might be possible to *intentionally* place your hand on a burner and leave it there while it sears your flesh off your bones, but if you're not expecting the pain, you'll pull away.So we are forced to watch characters make *literally* superhuman efforts to let the piranhas eat them. It just looks stupid, no matter what the intentions of the filmmakers were. After this, it becomes impossible to take the film seriously on any level. If they wanted to do this kind of thing, they should have played it for laughs--on the other hand, given the level of the comic relief in this film (hey, Cletus, those pants hit that cop in the face, hyuk, hyuk), maybe that wouldn't have been such a good idea.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERTThen, the film's first big setpiece mass attack includes (toward the beginning) a piece of business so stupid that one laughs--derisively--just at the wrong moment. And it ends--in spite of the presence of at least a dozen people in the water--with only one fatality (because the rest of the potential piranha snacks were children, and the filmmakers didn't have the guts to waste a kid). In other words, these superfish can pull a grown man off a boat, but they can't manage to chomp a few small children who are already immersed in the water. What a world, what a world.Of course, in the climactic attack, the piranhas are able with very little trouble to pull full-grown adults off of air mattresses and innertubes, which makes their failure in the preceding attack look just a little bit silly.And of course there's the basic problem with 99% of horror flicks horror isn't terror.

The film is absolutely beautiful, and as has been noted time and again, it plays like a modern day fairy tale.  It seems, though, that some people can't understand how it's made its place at #20 in the IMDb's top films list.  So, rather than discuss the general merits of the film, as many have done, I'm going to try and address the reasons, in specific, it's reached this level of popularity.One of the most common write-offs about Amélie is that this is a romantic comedy, and romantic comedies must by their nature be inferior to other films.  Granted, there is a lot of support for this mode of thought, particularly in the form of very cliché, fluffy romantic comedies, the type you see Meg Ryan in so much.  They're fun and they're sweet, but ultimately forgettable.  But Amélie does not fit this mold.  It's about love, definitely, but it's not about the typical self-centered notions of finding that person who completes her.  On the contrary, she really discovers love through doing good things for others, affecting their lives.  She feels gratified for doing so, but for reasons she can't really understand, she's still left feeling empty.  When she stumbles upon Nino, her actions are quite playful and curious, but even when she begins to realize he might be that special someone, she refuses to act on her desires, because such self-serving acts are against her nature.  The lovers' eventual union only occurs after her neighbors, those people whose lives she's touched, conspire to return her favors.  Thus, in the end, everyone who's found love or made happy has done so thanks to the generosity of others.One of the other major complaints is about the pacing of the film, particularly that it drags in its final act.  This is understandable as it could've been packaged more neatly with a few cut scenes at the end, but I understand Jeunet's intentions and would rather keep the film as is than chop it up for salability.  Amélie and Nino aren't delayed from getting together simply so that Dufayel can make his inspirational little speech via her VCR.  No, Amélie is absolutely petrified about taking chances and especially doing so for herself, and with such an attitude, she would never find happiness.  Jeunet really drives this point in with several repeated and failed attempts.  Some people find it unnecessary and are inclined to say, I get it already!  But for those who can most closely relate--who just find it so hard to work for their own benefit--the inclusions of these scenes really adds to the effect, and drives the points home that good deeds will eventually be reciprocated, and that you must be willing to make yourself happy.There are so many reasons why I love this film and it'd be impossible to lift them all, but I beg you to give the film a chance.

Okay I'll accept that Israel was dumb enough to let a nuclear bomb get lost in the desert. I'll accept that some Arabs found it and sold it for $400. What I won't accept is that Russian scientists would help Neonazis make the bomb operational, or even the reasoning of the Nazis. Namely to get the Russians and the Americans to fight each other as times have changed. Really? So the Cold War didn't really happen? And the one Nazi with qualms tells the others he is out(what does he think will happen?)But most incredible of all is the top advisor tells the President, If they did this to make a point to stay out of Chechnya... Yes, you heard that right. I mean I know in real life Presidential advisors are dumb, but Russia nukes us to say stay out of Chechnya??!! So the President authorizes full scale nuclear war based on hearsay. God help us if we ever get a Dead Zone President such as that.I understand you have to suspend your disbelief for this stuff, but it should have some semblance of reality.Even the special effects are disappointing, as the blast is shown for about one minute, and most of it is a helicopter crashing in slow motion and an obviously fake mushroom cloud.

The plot itself has some major flaws, but the main qualm one has is though the actors and scriptwriters are paid millions here, the high budget ironically cheapens the film. The actors speak their lines very quickly and very loudly, Ben Affleck is one of those everyman megastars, but with no real talent to warrant the stardom.Morgan Freeman, a great actor, has made some real junk lately from Deep Impact to this one.

This is one of my (many) favorite movies!!Let me start this by saying that badly done CGI, like bad acting, should be avoided at all costs and should NEVER be allowed to be included in the finished product of any production.Case and point the Scorpion King from Mummy Returns. It was horrible; deplorable; and just downright nasty-looking. He was no better than the worst video game character ever drawn by an 8 year old in green crayon. Okay, that having been said, the argument in the industry is that CGI is taking jobs away from LIVE actors and giving them to computer nerds. That is simply NOT the case. Case and point again, Mummy Returns. Do you honestly believe the producers would have paid two million extras the standard SAG fees and make up artists for these two million extras, or wardrobe for these two million extras to comprise the Army of Annubis? The answer is a resounding H*LL NO! My point is that before the diversity of CGI became known, movies lacked SO MUCH in detail. You either had the omission of the army all together, or about 20 shots of the same fifteen guys, all in different costumes, trying in vain to make it SEEM as though there was an army. Either way, what you got was deplorable. CGI definitely has its place in cinema. Another prime example of excellent CGI in use is in this production, The Mummy. The opening sequence of the WORKING ancient Egyptian city of Thebes is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences I've ever experienced, but Ancient History is a hobby of mine. The only time I have any problem at all with CGI is when it's badly done, as in the example I mentioned earlier. It greatly enhances our ability to enjoy the story when the eye-candy is well done and in place. Those shots of the Army of Annubis are simply staggering. They look realistic and they are so well done as to make you believe, if only for a moment, that they ARE real.The love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun is a classic, and is as historically correct as that of Isis and Osiris, and while this is classified as a remake, I simply do not care to compare this epic to the original hit.How can you compare a true masterpiece of horror from 1932; a time when there were NO believable effects, no mastered technology of CGI, and the standard SAG fees for extras was around $6 a day. (It WAS the depression era, after all) Since the development of the technology used in Star Wars, Episode 4, A New Hope, computer effects have evolved into a true state of art. I have absolutely no beef with CGI, its use, nor the use of it over live actors. As I have already stated above, my only problem with CGI is when it is badly done.In this movie, it was NOT badly done. I loved the Indiana Jones adventure feel of this movie. I loved the fact that they took a dark and dreary (badly done, in my opinion) original campy old horror flick and turned it into an absolute feast for those of us who love the eye candy. I am also an Ancient History hobbyist, and this movie really sparked my imagination. As I've already stated, the opening scenes of Thebes were so inspiring, I was hooked from the very first moment this movie began to play on the big screen.Brendan Fraser, to me, demonstrates his acting abilities in this production, showing his agents and all those around him that he is SO much above frivolous drivel like Monkey Bone and Encino Man. I hope he never EVER has to resort to such a waste of his talents, again.Rachael Weisz is a sheer delight. Her character is totally believable, romantic, soft and lady-like while maintaining a tough interior personality. Not easily done. Bravo, Ms. Weisz!

This is a play about  plays - about how each character strives to be the playwright.

Being a mere  actor in this world is equivalent to death.What is interesting is the experiment of having EVERYONE strive to be the author of the  play with control over the others except poor Alais, whose role is ambiguous. Each  character uses a different strategy, each strategy reflecting one of the few philosophies a  writer can take in relation to his work, The two excellent precedents for this sort of  character-as-writer structure are `Alice in Wonderland' and `King Lear,' both of which  are overtly acknowledged. The lines that deal with this striving are expertly crafted. I know of no better in the sense  that terrific shifts from controller to controlled occur seamlessly. Other projects hide all  this behind emotional noise, noise which is absent in this abstract project. There is some  bluster, but it is all accompanied by reasoned dialog. Everything is explained nothing is  hidden. There is no reliance on mere emotion.It is, in other words, terrific writing, the sort that deliberately sets out to make actors  look bad by appearing to make them look good. Check towards the end when king and  queen talk about the eyes eyes in the dark that see them us watchers, but which are  seen by - by whom? The writer.Harvey and Goldman next collaborated on a project with somewhat identical aspirations,  but without the joke on the actors. I much prefer it (`They Might Be Giants') because it  comes the other way actors as writers. We can actually work with the actors. It that film,  the actors create reality by merely taking on the roles.Here, with `Lion,' it feels a little dirty.

That is manifestly clear in the dramatic artificiality of everything but  especially that 60's British Stage effect that seems so goofy now. This is a play about  plays - about how each character strives to be the playwright. None of what they claim  matters, not love, crown, power, vengeance - because they do not live in any real world,  but a deliberately acknowledged world of the stage where everyone is either a writer or a  player.All the players act like players.

I sort of liked the classical music that was playing.  The train crossed a nice bridge, but unfortunately soon after that we had to find out what was going on inside the train.  Jesse and Celine met, and while the actors did a good job playing them and the characters were likeable and sometimes funny, I found myself more interested in what was outside the window of the train.The two main characters got off the train in Vienna.  It's a beautiful city, with lots of elegant, classic buildings.  And from high above the city at one point, we could see lots of trees.  We also got to see the inside of a magnificent church. The couple crossed another nice-looking bridge and, finally, I thought the movie was about to get good. Jesse and Celine met two actors who were really funny right from the start, and quite appealing.  But we never saw those two again.  The best part of the movie for me was the amusement park.  Not that there was much to that, but the couple danced (for all of maybe ten seconds) to Boots Randolph's 'Yakety Sax' in front of a game that I believe said 'Punch Belly' with a funny-looking man painted on it.  There were several scenes with guitar-based folk music or folk rock that didn't do much for me.  I wanted the classical music back.  Or Boots Randolph.Some people might enjoy the quirky characters, such as a fortune teller, or the poet who didn't beg for money but offered to write a poem based on a word he was given in exchange for whatever the recipient felt it was worth (He had probably already written the poem).

The Shadow's club has a great looking interior dominated by silver, black and white as the fashion and good taste of the time dictated. Good taste is also present in abundance in the exterior shots, where Art Deco is shown at its best again, this time in architecture.

As if this weren't enough, there are loads of little details for the attentive viewer to discover and marvel at.Shots where black\/white\/silver dominate are contrasted with comic book style shots with highly saturated colours. Many exteriors are shot with a tele lens, which compresses the pictures, adding intensity to them.All in all, you could take just about any individual frame from the film, make a large print of it and hang it on the wall.
