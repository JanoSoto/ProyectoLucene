I thought parts of it were cool (like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man), but most of the movie was too drab for me, for some reason.  Someday I'll write a review of it, but I'm too lazy to do it right now.  Why am I talking about Ghostbusters when I'm reviewing Evolution, some of you ask?  Well, it's simple.  The same man directs both movies (Ivan Reitman) and both movies have very similar plots.  Except that, in my opinion, Evolution is better.  Basically, think of Evolution as a remake of Ghostbusters only throw out the ghosts and put in aliens, which I like because aliens, in my opinion, are cooler and more realistic than ghosts.Let me mention some bad stuff, just to get it over with because I have to do at some point.  This movie misses some serious opportunities to be funny.  Sometimes, when you are expecting a joke, there is none.  It's almost as if they really weren't trying.  Sometimes the jokes are a little corny.One last bad note some of the aliens suck.  The ending alien is a bit of a let down.  It kind of reminded me of Akira, if you've seen that movie.  There is also this cute alien who turns out to be nasty via the mouth within a mouth, a la Ridley Scott's Alien.Now on to some good stuff.  This movie is really funny in a happy kind of way.  I compare the mood of this movie to another Dreamworks alien-comedy, Galaxy Quest (a movie I thought was hilarious).  If you liked Galaxy Quest, and I think most people did, then you will like Evolution.Something else I would like to point out is how scientific Evolution is.  The movie seems very intelligent as far as talking about how the aliens evolve.  I for one and happy to see a movie that isn't completely dumbed down for the uneducated.  I like alien stuff and space stuff, so this kind of science interests me.  Overall, I found Evolution to be very intriguing apart from being funny.Oh, I want to mention Orlando Jones.  He's the black guy from those 7-Up commercials.  I love this guy.  He steals the show in this movie.  I knew the guy was great ever since I saw the first of those 7-Up commercials.  He was also in the Replacements (that lame football comedy which was also somewhat entertaining), and he's probably been in some other stuff I haven't seen or can't remember.  But let me tell you, this guy is going places.  As for the other actors, they're decent.  I like the touch of having David Duchovny on board.  Julian Moore is a good actress, but she got shafted in the character department.  She has a basic walking cardboard cutout character with little personality.  Oh well.In conclusion, please do me a favor of not going into this movie expecting a great movie.  Why do people do that?  Every movie can't be the Godfather or 2001 or Saving Private Ryan, so why don't you just shut up and enjoy the movie.  You won't look back at Evolution at the end of the summer as you favorite summer movie this year, but you're not supposed to.  Evolution was made to be entertaining, not great.  It was made to give you your money's worth and put forth an enjoyable show.  I think it accomplishes its mission.7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 June 2001","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Let me say this I was never a fan of Ghostbusters.

The movie delivers a chilling plot and story, and makes you think your being watched by the murderer in the ghost costume. Wes Craven did an excellent job on the directing. The acting was very good. Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Drew Barrymore, Courtney Cox and David Arquette did an excellent job in their roles. This movie is very creepy and very good. It makes you think there is a killer stalking you. If you are a movie person I recommend Scream, especially to horror fans. The movie is well done the acting is great, the filmmaking is excellent, and the movie is just plain great! This is a classic horror movie for anyone who has interest in horror films! This is my favorite slasher film out there. The movie is great! You should DEFINETLY rent this movie if you stop by your local video store. I'm sure any video store carrys it.

However, there the visual pyrotechnics had been at the disposal of the greatest love story ever told; the plot here is, well, NOT the greatest love story ever told.  The whole things starts off too silly to take seriously, Satine falls for Christian merely because the script requires it (who wouldn't fall in love with Nicole Kidman?), and the fact the story is being told in flashback destroys all tension as to what will happen.  McGregor and Kidman are fine both as actors and singers, but the words spewing out of their mouths are such a bewildering purree of pop culture references the mind can't process everything.   I recommend the film for Luhrman's dazzling visuals and the fine work by the actors (particularly Jim Broadbent, who should get an Oscar nomination), but the writing keeps it from being as good as it could have been.  My rating is a 6 (actually, it's close to a 7 but since it is averaging over 8 I feel I need to knock it down a notch).

She was so small she had to be lifted up to reach the microphone. She was the mischief-maker of the Kiddy Club program, called The Little Pest. Like Mitzi Green, she had an uncanny ability to imitate the voices and facial expressions of actors, actresses and other people, something she learned playing with the mirror. On stage by age five, she became a famous actress throughout the South, finally moving to Hollywood at five-and-a-half. In Hollywood, Jane began by playing in a weekly radio-revue and gave numerous stage performances for beneficial organizations.Bright Eyes was Jane's first credited movie role and led to a long-term contract with Twentieth Century-Fox. She stared in numerous movies of the thirties, and was Shirley Temple's main competition. Jane was one of the great child actresses of all times, very popular with the children of her era, and after watching Shirley's goodie two-shoes act in Bright Eyes playing against Jane's power-house comedy performance, I can see why. Shirley Temple was her usual cute, sugar-coated, man-worshiping self with everyone giggling politely at her jokes except the audience. In contrast, Jane Withers had my daughter and I laughing our heads off until we had stomach-aches. Jane in Bright Eyes was bratty, adorable and hilarously funny. Her brat act has seldom, if ever, been equaled in the annals of film.It is really a shame, and I hope the studios who own Jane Withers' many films as a child take note, that Bright Eyes is the only Jane Withers performance to survive to contemporary video.

In a published chat-room article Jane, who is still very much alive, says that she will eventually finish her book on her child star days.
