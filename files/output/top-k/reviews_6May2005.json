So sooner or later someone had to come up with the idea of making a horror movie about a mad trucker and that's exactly what they have done with this movie...Joy Ride starts with the college student Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker), who decides to drive across the country to see Venna (Leelee Sobieski), a friend who he has always been in love with. She's single now and he finally wants to tell her what he feels for her. But he has one big problem, his brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) is in jail and Lewis will have to bail him out and take him home with him. During their trip Fuller and Lewis play a joke with a trucker, only known as 'Rusty Nail', by telling him over the CB radio that Lewis is Candy Kane, a woman who is interested in meeting him. At first they have a good laugh with it, but than the joke takes a very serious turn and the trucker wants more than just an apology from the three friends...I guess the main reason why many people would give this movie a try is because of the good looking actors. Leelee Sobieski nor Paul Walker aren't exactly known for their excellent acting skills, but I'm sure most people have heard of them before and don't mind looking at them for about 1.5 hours. And I guess it's the best this movie has to offer, because the story is a bit weak, although not entirely bad. It's just one of those stories like there seem to be at least 50 others. It never offers much originality, but it certainly has some nice action and moments full of tension to offer, which eventually saves the movie.

If nothing else, this gives the director and Pearce an excuse to show off his buff bod a lot for the gals and gays in the audience.

Of course he's immediately interested in her, but she appears to be the girlfriend of the men he hates the most PGA superstar David Simms, who he knows for years and who always laughs with McAvoy because he was never able to make something of his life as a pro golfer.

I've watched Batman a number of times over the years--enough to be able to remember quite a few lines of dialogue, which is unusual for me--and I can't remember watching it before and thinking that it was anything less than a 9 or 10. Last night, however, I was very disappointed with the film. I don't know if I just wasn't in the mood for it, or if my critical eye has changed, but I feel even generous giving the film a 7 this time around. It's loaded with problems.Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren's story\/screenplay cleverly takes us back to the days when Batman was just getting started in Gotham City--he was best known to criminals, but primarily as a myth. Those who believed the myth, at least a bit, were unsure what to think--it was unclear whether the Bat Man was out to hurt or help people. A reporter for the big Gotham daily newspaper, Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl), believes the myths and continues to print stories about alleged sightings, to the ridicule of his fellow reporters. At the same time, we delve into a story about Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), a questionably insane head henchman for Gotham's complicated underworld network, which involves not only big baddies, like Grissom (Jack Palance), but the police as well. We also get to know Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), whom visiting photojournalist Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) is quickly falling in love with. Eventually all these threads and the Batman myth, plus the birth of stock Batman villain, The Joker, collide. Director Tim Burton takes his time putting them together--getting to the superhero identities are big turning points as mini-climaxes, despite the fact that by now, even those who have not seen the film know who the superheroes are in their more mundane guises, as well which actors play them here.Since my critical surprise this time around is going to result in me mostly complaining about the film, let me mention the things I like about it first. As I implied above, I think that starting Batman at this early stage of his Gotham City crime-fighting career was a good idea. I'm not quite sure that taking so long to get into the identities of Batman and the Joker was a good idea, since Batman was already such a pop culture phenomenon by the time this film rolled, and the publicity machine is so high when you have stars of this caliber involved that there was little mystery about who the Joker was going to be. Burton spends way too much time fudging around before he gets to the meat of the film--the big reveals feel more like drawn-out ritual. But wait, I'm supposed to be talking about what I like.Gotham City is a sometimes-amusing satire of the common perception of New York City, and big cities in general. Well, it's mostly amusing at the start of the film, when our token victim family tries to make it back to a safe part of the city, or the part they know, and they have to work their way through a sea of hookers and hoods to get there. Of course, they do not make it before they're brutally mugged. Big cities aren't really like that, but people who are afraid of big cities believe that they are. After this good opener, Burton mostly forgets about this particular satire mode.I also like the production design a lot. Gotham City is part New York City, part Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), and part giant factory, or the inside of a giant machine. The costumes, gadgets, makeup and so on are all fantastic. I think that Jack Palance's performance is great, although he's not in the film nearly enough. There are also a couple times when Burton's Gothic sensibilities worked for the film.There are also a few mixed blessings. The first is that Burton references a number of other films in an unusual way. There are scenes taken from sources as diverse as Star Wars (1977) and Vertigo (1958). While I also like Star Wars, Vertigo and many of the other source films, I don't quite get what they're doing here as such blatant lifts. Maybe Burton intended the film as a spoof, but that reading doesn't quite work. This is much more serious than the real Batman spoof, the 1966 &#150; 68 Adam West television series, and the lifted scenes do not play like spoofs.I'm a big Jack Nicholson fan, and I occasionally like Michael Keaton. But Nicholson this over-the-top might not be a good idea. As an actor, Nicholson tends to be over the top in other films even when he's trying not to be. That's part of what I love about him. And Keaton is appropriately moody, but oddly pouty at the same time. I kept waiting for a scene of him blow-drying his hair before heading off to a disco.The biggest flaw, though, is that Burton's pacing\/timing seems oddly off. Scenes drag on far too long, as do sections of the film. Lines are delivered at bizarre times in relation to other character's lines and actions (listen to Basinger's scream when the fake gun goes off at the end, for example), but Burton seems to not notice. There are also a lot of non-sequiturs in the script, both in individual lines of dialogue and overall, in the logic of many scenes and sequences. Fight scenes are neither blocked nor filmed well. Worse, two key performances--Wuhl and Basinger--are horrible (and Basinger must have troubles with high heels, by the way; they kept working excuses for her to take off her shoes into the script). Given the combination of the wonky pacing\/timing, the non-sequiturs, and the bad performances, much of the film is lackluster at best, and annoying at worst. A 7, or a C, is generous, indeed.

We also get to know Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton), whom visiting photojournalist Vicky Vale (Kim Basinger) is quickly falling in love with. Eventually all these threads and the Batman myth, plus the birth of stock Batman villain, The Joker, collide. Director Tim Burton takes his time putting them together--getting to the superhero identities are big turning points as mini-climaxes, despite the fact that by now, even those who have not seen the film know who the superheroes are in their more mundane guises, as well which actors play them here.Since my critical surprise this time around is going to result in me mostly complaining about the film, let me mention the things I like about it first. As I implied above, I think that starting Batman at this early stage of his Gotham City crime-fighting career was a good idea. I'm not quite sure that taking so long to get into the identities of Batman and the Joker was a good idea, since Batman was already such a pop culture phenomenon by the time this film rolled, and the publicity machine is so high when you have stars of this caliber involved that there was little mystery about who the Joker was going to be. Burton spends way too much time fudging around before he gets to the meat of the film--the big reveals feel more like drawn-out ritual. But wait, I'm supposed to be talking about what I like.Gotham City is a sometimes-amusing satire of the common perception of New York City, and big cities in general. Well, it's mostly amusing at the start of the film, when our token victim family tries to make it back to a safe part of the city, or the part they know, and they have to work their way through a sea of hookers and hoods to get there. Of course, they do not make it before they're brutally mugged. Big cities aren't really like that, but people who are afraid of big cities believe that they are. After this good opener, Burton mostly forgets about this particular satire mode.I also like the production design a lot. Gotham City is part New York City, part Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), and part giant factory, or the inside of a giant machine. The costumes, gadgets, makeup and so on are all fantastic. I think that Jack Palance's performance is great, although he's not in the film nearly enough. There are also a couple times when Burton's Gothic sensibilities worked for the film.There are also a few mixed blessings. The first is that Burton references a number of other films in an unusual way. There are scenes taken from sources as diverse as Star Wars (1977) and Vertigo (1958). While I also like Star Wars, Vertigo and many of the other source films, I don't quite get what they're doing here as such blatant lifts. Maybe Burton intended the film as a spoof, but that reading doesn't quite work. This is much more serious than the real Batman spoof, the 1966 &#150; 68 Adam West television series, and the lifted scenes do not play like spoofs.I'm a big Jack Nicholson fan, and I occasionally like Michael Keaton. But Nicholson this over-the-top might not be a good idea. As an actor, Nicholson tends to be over the top in other films even when he's trying not to be. That's part of what I love about him. And Keaton is appropriately moody, but oddly pouty at the same time. I kept waiting for a scene of him blow-drying his hair before heading off to a disco.The biggest flaw, though, is that Burton's pacing\/timing seems oddly off. Scenes drag on far too long, as do sections of the film. Lines are delivered at bizarre times in relation to other character's lines and actions (listen to Basinger's scream when the fake gun goes off at the end, for example), but Burton seems to not notice. There are also a lot of non-sequiturs in the script, both in individual lines of dialogue and overall, in the logic of many scenes and sequences. Fight scenes are neither blocked nor filmed well. Worse, two key performances--Wuhl and Basinger--are horrible (and Basinger must have troubles with high heels, by the way; they kept working excuses for her to take off her shoes into the script). Given the combination of the wonky pacing\/timing, the non-sequiturs, and the bad performances, much of the film is lackluster at best, and annoying at worst. A 7, or a C, is generous, indeed.

I've watched Batman a number of times over the years--enough to be able to remember quite a few lines of dialogue, which is unusual for me--and I can't remember watching it before and thinking that it was anything less than a 9 or 10. Last night, however, I was very disappointed with the film. I don't know if I just wasn't in the mood for it, or if my critical eye has changed, but I feel even generous giving the film a 7 this time around. It's loaded with problems.Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren's story\/screenplay cleverly takes us back to the days when Batman was just getting started in Gotham City--he was best known to criminals, but primarily as a myth. Those who believed the myth, at least a bit, were unsure what to think--it was unclear whether the Bat Man was out to hurt or help people.

The story is slow but the mixture of good old western style and drama makes the movie always interesting to watch. The movie had so many deeper meanings. The movie is set in 1901, the time when the time of the good old west was almost at its end. Only thing that stands in between of the good old west and modern times are characters such as John Bernard Books (John Wayne), an old gunslinger from the good old days. His character is coping with his inevitable coming death but also coping with the fact that the good old days of gunfights at the O.K. Corral and saloons are over for good. He basically is the only remaining person still alive from the good old days with a reputation, so when he dies the old west dies with him. In a way this also shows some parallels with Wayne's death, when he died a piece of the genre Western died with him as well.Beside 'The Duke' the movie also has some fine other great actors such as Lauren Bacall, James Stewart (also his last Western as an actor, he however later still provided one of the voices for his final movie An American Tail Fievel Goes West.), Scatman Crothers and John Carradine. Still it was kind of an odd sight to see John Wayne and Ron Howard acting in scene's together.

Or does she relate to this all too well? Diane Lane has made two films where she plays an adulteress.

She's making a killing making these kind of movies, yet her range doesn't seem real broad. Isn't that ironic- don't you think? And she doesn't seem to make a lot of films on that note.

And right there, I totally sided with Liev Schreiber- because I was acting like the hard-working good husband like he was.

The musical numbers are pretty standard fair and were nothing Marilyn hadn't done before. The film didn't make me laugh and I didn't care what happened to the characters. If anything I was only sad the talented Marilyn Monroe was a part of the film - as her portfolio shows she was deserving of far higher quality films than this. I can't recommend the film as it's not really worth your time and you probably won't enjoy it - if you just want to see all of Monroe's film's than see it, but otherwise don't bother.

There are many interesting stories about the holocaust and WWII, and I wonder what attracted Spielberg to Schindler's story so much. Well, if you saw the film you can see that what Spielberg and Schindler have in common is money and ambition. Spielberg in my point of view is a great producer\/business man. He knows how to make money (even for the Holocaust). I believe that is why Spielberg's so attracted to Schindler's character. Don't get me wrong, Spielberg has also values as well, and it is said that most of what the film has earned Spielberg donated to the Holocaust foundation. Spielberg is a franchise but I get the feeling that he cares. So in parallel to Schindler's character that evolves through the film, Spielberg uses the money he earns to make some good.Schindler is presented as a business man, who is interested in making money - actually a war profiteer. But something changes in his plan, Schindler learns slowly that the Nazi ideology is stupid and evil, and he goes on a process through the film of purging himself out of this ideology. He starts to care for his Jewish workers, and by the end of the film he even cries, not for the loss of money, but for the life he could have saved.There are many scenes in this film, created in detail, through the help of survivor's testimonies. Some of them are extremely violent or contain nudity. Those scenes, which are shot brilliantly, are required for realism and I really like them, as I believe that such appalling violence is reserved only in film and not in our life.I find Schindler's List as a visual experience one should not miss, as it helps you grasp the horror and violence of the Nazis.

It has however also often been called one of the best films of all time. Whilst it is a brilliant piece of cinema, with a superb lead performance and some excellent camera-work, it is nevertheless hard for me to agree with the claim of it as an all-time great.To start with the good things, 'Taxi Driver' is excellently directed. The whole atmosphere of the streets of New York is captured very well, both in the daytime and at night. The film has a great visual style, giving the streets a dreamlike quality, and it all feels very realistic, or at least up until the final 15 minutes. The cinematography captures De Niro's journey perfectly, with zooms, steady-cam and panning all carefully distributed and edited into the film.It is a character study of a man alone and it definitely digs deep into the protagonist. We are given an insight into his loneliness and are subjected to his social ineptitude. Some of his actions still seem a tad unrealistic, like with the movie date he goes on, but in general, Travis Bickle is quite a well written character, and De Niro plays him sensationally. Every single movement on his face is carefully observed, and it left me wondering all the time whether or not he is insane.However, this is a point when some of the quirks I have with the film occur. For a character study we get to know relatively little about Travis' background. He served in the marines and now he is a taxi driver. At one stage of the film he listens to a speech about Vietnam vets fighting for better treatment. Does this mean that Travis served in Vietnam, and did Vietnam drive him insane? We never really get to know. This is not necessarily a bad thing as such, as it adds to his mysteriousness, and the film still survives, but it did at least have me groping for a bit more.Also while discussing De Niro's high quality performance, what pops into mind is how the other performers in the film were. And that is a bit of problem in my books. Foster received a lot of critical attention at the time of the film's release for playing a prostitute so young. Yet, looking at her in retrospect she hardly does anything with her character. Or what there is of her character, and there is not all too much there, other than that she is younger than the average prostitute, and like the average prostitute, she is sort of unhappy with her work, but yet manages to get by okay. In fact, none of the characters other than Travis' are well developed or well acted. Sure, they aren't poorly written and performed, but 'Taxi Driver' does have to survive on just one good performance and one good character. And actually, considering that, the film gets by quite well.But all that said, Martin Scorsese has a memorable cameo role as a taxi passenger who might just be slightly madder than Travis. Interestingly, from what I've read, Scorsese only took the part because the actor assigned to play the character did not show up on the day of shooting, and despite that Scorsese actually gives off the second best performance in the film, right after De Niro's.A couple of other points worth noting on the negative side are the meandering nature of the film and the music. Neither of these aspects subtracts much from the film, but they do add to the charge that it is not quite a perfect film. The picture wanders around quite a bit to show the nature of De Niro's mind, but this does make it a tad tiresome to follow about. As for the music used in the film, Bernard Herrmann's score is highly memorable and great to listen to, but it is more so dinner music rather than a fitting score for such a realistically grim film.In spite of the problems that I have with the film that I have already mentioned, it is a very solid watch until the final 15 minutes. The film is all rather well put together, and if were not for the film's reputation of perfection, the points I've mentioned would be hardly worth going into detail about. But, the final 15 minutes of the film do seal it as something that I would be cautious to call perfect.The ending is not weak, but compared to the rest of the film the final few scenes are highly unrealistic. The violence and brutality is the type that you would expect in a cartoon, and what happens to Travis in the end is so unrealistic that some have their own interpretations about a sense of reality. But it is hard to discuss this without revealing details that may ruin one's first viewing of the film.At this point in time, I have only seen 8 films from Martin Scorsese, and 'Taxi Driver' is one of only four that I've seen twice. However, I would still be inclined to call it Scorsese's best film. It pretty well made all round, even if not pretty to watch, and perhaps it is one of the best films of the 1970s. There is however enough in it for me to have my reservations about saying how great it is.

In the wake of Terminator 2 this, and most sci-fi action movies look inferior, but this is a great watch for action fans, and should be seen by non-fans too as it is a good slice of entertainment.Van Damme stars as Luc Deveraux, a marine in 'Nam. His superior is Andrew Scott, played with menace by Lundgren. Their team stumbles upon a village in 'Nam where Scott goes on a kill crazy rampage, wiping out men, women, and kids, and when Luc tries to stop him, they kill each other. Flash forward to the nineties and the US Army has managed to save and restore both Luc and Scott an their team. The are now part man, part computer, easy to control soldiers with a much higher skill and strength rate than any human could have. The Army has created them for special missions and they have a flawless success rate. Veronica Roberts is a snoopy reporter who wants to follow the mysterious team, but can never get close. The soldiers are autonomous, doing whatever they are told, and with no memory of their past lives. However, as all computers inevitably turn against their masters, Luc and Scott begin to have flashbacks. Soon Scott has killed Veronica's cameraman, and Luc has saved her to become a renegade. He begins to remember everything and Scott takes control of his team with the sole objective of killing Luc and Veronica. The chase begins.Once we accept the Universal Soldier's abilities etc the story is all simple and will of course end with a final confrontation between the two stars. Between these two points there is a lot of action, gun fights, bombs, the usual, but it is done with a fair amount of skill and style. Van Damme does well as a cyborg and has little to say, but shows off his martial arts skills. Lundgren has less to say but is effectively sneering. Walker is the feisty heroine and gives a fine performance, and the rest of the cast range from grunts with guns to comedic parts. There is a good amount of humour which helps to make the film more appealing, and there is the inevitable Van Damme nudity. There are some interesting elements involving the Government's control of mindless soldiers, sending in faceless masses to do their dirty-work, but of course this is reading between the lines. Overall it is a simple, but effective and well-shot action film, and one of the best of its kind.8.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Probably both Van Damme's and Lundgren's best, Universal Soldier is one of the best action movies of the early nineties, with plenty of explosive stunts, fights, a decent story, some fine acting, and lots of great dialogue.

Flash forward to the nineties and the US Army has managed to save and restore both Luc and Scott an their team. The are now part man, part computer, easy to control soldiers with a much higher skill and strength rate than any human could have. The Army has created them for special missions and they have a flawless success rate. Veronica Roberts is a snoopy reporter who wants to follow the mysterious team, but can never get close. The soldiers are autonomous, doing whatever they are told, and with no memory of their past lives. However, as all computers inevitably turn against their masters, Luc and Scott begin to have flashbacks. Soon Scott has killed Veronica's cameraman, and Luc has saved her to become a renegade. He begins to remember everything and Scott takes control of his team with the sole objective of killing Luc and Veronica. The chase begins.Once we accept the Universal Soldier's abilities etc the story is all simple and will of course end with a final confrontation between the two stars. Between these two points there is a lot of action, gun fights, bombs, the usual, but it is done with a fair amount of skill and style. Van Damme does well as a cyborg and has little to say, but shows off his martial arts skills. Lundgren has less to say but is effectively sneering. Walker is the feisty heroine and gives a fine performance, and the rest of the cast range from grunts with guns to comedic parts. There is a good amount of humour which helps to make the film more appealing, and there is the inevitable Van Damme nudity. There are some interesting elements involving the Government's control of mindless soldiers, sending in faceless masses to do their dirty-work, but of course this is reading between the lines. Overall it is a simple, but effective and well-shot action film, and one of the best of its kind.8.5 out of 10 ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"6 May 2005","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Probably both Van Damme's and Lundgren's best, Universal Soldier is one of the best action movies of the early nineties, with plenty of explosive stunts, fights, a decent story, some fine acting, and lots of great dialogue.

Innocent love stories, historical epics, action-packed westerns and colourful musicals were the staple cinematic diet of the time, certainly not dark, disturbing and intensely violent murder thrillers like this. What probably unsettled contemporary film-goers even more was the fact that a film of this kind could come from a much-loved and revered director like Michael Powell. In modern times, the equivalent would be if Steven Spielberg were to make a graphic and reviled film about paedophilia or bestiality, consequently never being allowed to stand behind a movie camera again. When Peeping Tom hit the big screen, it was rejected by the public and crucified by the critics, and left Powell's hitherto glorious career in ruin.A film cameraman, Mark Lewis (Karl Boehm), displays psychotic tendencies as he murders women with a spiked tripod attached to the bottom of his camera, capturing on celluloid their final screams of agony. It is revealed that when he was a child, Mark was used as a guinea pig by his father (Michael Powell) in a series of psychoanalytical experiments about the symptoms of fear. Among other things, Mark's delightful dad would wake him throughout the night and shine lights in his eyes, drop lizards into his bed, and on one occasion even forced him to pose for photographs next to the dead body of his mother. As a result, Mark has an unhealthy obsession with fear and, in particular, the expression that people have on their face during moments of fear.Peeping Tom is one of the few films that still has the power to shock all these years on. Psycho, released roughly at the same time, is still a great film but its shock value has been diminished by years of repeat viewings and increasing permissiveness in the cinema. But Peeping Tom is an altogether more disturbing piece of work. Boehm is excellent as the killer whose entire outlook has been skewed by his father's experiments. Also impressive is Anna Massey as the killer's fragile and unsuspecting fiancée. Powell directs the film brilliantly, using bold and dazzling colours to disguise the horrific atrocities that punctuate his film. It is understandable that the film was met with revulsion and rejection at that time, but in retrospect it is a film of real importance and power. In a 21st century world bombarded and desensitised by harrowing images on the news and in the movies, the theme of losing one's grasp on what is and isn't morally acceptable is more pertinent than ever.

Having spanned the past couple of decades or so as an afternoon TV favourite, it's given me plenty of opportunities over the years to catch up with it every so often and witness Lua the retriever, Bodger the bull terrier and Tao the Siamese cat making the incredible journey referenced in the title all over again. No matter how archaic it could easily be dismissed as in comparison to the kind of household pet movies that get snapped up nowadays (no celebrity voice-overs here&#133;no voice-overs at all for that matter), it remains as charming and wonderful as I ever remember it being - simple, engaging, maybe even a little powerful, especially for anyone who's ever felt close to an animal companion of their own. The plot, straightforward enough for a young kid to easily follow, but never crossing the line into the overly simplistic or childish, is the perfect definition of loyalty and devotion, particularly in regards to the bond between a pet and their owner. Two dogs (one a sprightly youngster, the other an aged fellow struggling to keep up) and their feline friend get separated from the human family that's doted on them all their lives, and are compelled by their strong sense of homing instinct and longing for their two-legged pals to head off together in the direction of home - completely oblivious, of course, to the fact that it's over 200 miles away and leads mostly through a terrain of beautiful but treacherous wilderness where wild animals have the upper paw.What works so well about 'the Incredible Journey' is that the animals themselves are actually a very good set of actors (the highly expressive cat playing Tao is particularly impressive), and the film-makers show a lot of well-judged willingness to let that tell the bulk of the story in itself. Contrast this with the 1993 remake, 'Homeward Bound', which updated the tale to a contemporary setting and, inevitably, gave them celebrity voice-overs and human personalities (a handful of people embraced it for precisely those reasons, but, even if one of those voices did come from the legendary Michael J Fox, I found it a little unconvincing and distracting myself). While that particular version chose to up the emphasis on comedy, and had its four-legged trio spouting throwaway wisecracks and playground dialogue for much of the time, the original was much more confident (and rightly so) in the animals' abilities to charm and engage us with their own naturalistic merits. An off-screen narrator does explain a lot of the details that they probably couldn't have otherwise conveyed on their own, but these never feel forced or excessively anthropomorphic - they remain animals at all times, natural and convincing, and in the process actually manage to express far more depth and character than the 'Homeward Bound' trio ever could, even with their firm grasp of the English language. That scene where Bodger licks and nudges Tao so enthusiastically says a lot more about the affection they have for one another, I think, than all the throwaway gags in the world.The human actors are more of a mixed bag - some of them are good, some of them are just average - but hey, they're hardly the reason why most of us would choose to watch this movie in the first place. Things are generally a lot stronger when they're focusing on the animals, a fair exception being the sequence involving a lonely young girl who provides temporary refuge for Tao, which paves way for one of the most poignant moments in the entire film (and which the remake, oddly enough, has no equivalent scene for).Another great thing about 'the Incredible Journey' is the way in which it manages to blend both the beauty and splendour of the natural wilderness with the far rougher 'survival of the fittest' principle that drives it. The scene involving the mother bear and her cubs goes from being cute and amusing to outright towering in the blink of an eye (allowing the ever-charismatic Tao to bag one of his finest moments). The scene where Tao gets pursued by the lynx is also pretty frightening (and certainly not without its irony), and Lua's run-in with the porcupine becomes rather harrowing when the poor dog has to deal with the consequences of going after such prickly prey. Incidents which all serve as sharp reminders of just how vulnerable these pampered pets really are in a world so far out of their usual kitchen-and-fireside-rug element. Though it was the river-crossing sequence, along with the less dramatic but equally affecting scene that follows, that I'll readily admit to finding most heart-rending the first time I saw it, and on every single viewing since I can't help but feel just a little apprehensive inside as it happens.Still, while it's certainly a more daunting experience than its light-hearted remake (which reformulated most of those scenes for their comic effect), it also maintains a good balance between the danger and the warmth, and the robust appeal of its trio of leads gives it a heart of solid gold from beginning to end. Other than the animals, the scenery and the background score, there really isn't a great deal else to it when all is said and done, but those assets alone are effective enough to make it soar - indeed, the only modern creature flick that could stand a chance of outclassing it would have to be 'Babe'. Tailor-made for any pet lover, 'the Incredible Journey' is one of Disney's key live action classics, one which I've enjoyed watching all my life, and I anticipate many a pleasurable repeated viewing in the years and afternoon TV airings still to come.Grade A- ","genre":null},{"date":"6 May 2005","score":"17 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" Yep, I can still recall just how much this particular film managed to stir, thrill, rattle and enthral me when I was first introduced to it at the age of four.

Tailor-made for any pet lover, 'the Incredible Journey' is one of Disney's key live action classics, one which I've enjoyed watching all my life, and I anticipate many a pleasurable repeated viewing in the years and afternoon TV airings still to come.Grade A- ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family"},{"date":"6 May 2005","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Barbarella is quintessential cult-kitsch from cinema's finest decade &#150; the psychedelic 60's &#150; that still looks fresh and amusing, nearly forty years later. Roger Vadim's interpretation of the comic-book heroine's adventures is a feast for the eyes as the colorful designs and costumes still look splendid and exhilarating. Supposedly set around 40.000 years A.D., Barbarella is sent to the planet SoGo by no less then the President of the Republic Earth in order to bring back a brilliant (but naughty) astronaut, named Duran Duran. Before our lovely and minuscule dressed space-hottie gets there, she encounters many strange individuals and bizarre local traditions. She's assaulted by fiendish children who freak her out with vampire-dolls (by the way, this sequence gets my vote for the best part of the entire movie!), she re-discovers the act of physical love (and finds out how convenient it is when you need to get something done), falls in love with a blind angel, meets the underground revolutionary leader and eventually she's fancied by a lesbian Queen-Tyrant! Now I ask you how can you not love all this?!? This film is very comical and light-headed. The music is fantastic and no woman ever looked so sexy as Jane Fonda does here (except maybe for Raquel Welsh in One Million Years B.C. or Britt Ekland in The Wickerman). The opening sequence, in which Fonda carelessly floats around her spaceship while stripping, is one of my favorite moments in cinema ever....for obvious reasons. The supportive cast is excellent as well, with a very 'cherubic' John Philip Law and David Hemmings as the confused revolutionary leader. A special word of praise goes out to Anita Pallenberg because she manages to look equally as yummy as Jane Fonda. Alongside Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik, this is probably the coolest film of the sixties. So, in case you haven't seen it yet, don't hesitate any further.
