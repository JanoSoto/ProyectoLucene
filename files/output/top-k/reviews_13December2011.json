The first time I tried seeing it was on a 25 TV--this time it's on a 58 one and the beauty is much more obvious. Too bad I couldn't have seen this on the big screen using the amazing 70mm cameras. And, if they brought it back to the theaters, I might be tempted to see it that way--even though the film does have many shortcomings.I've got to be honest here, I tried watching this film years ago and gave up on it. The only reason I am watching it through to the end now is that I would like to eventually see all the Best Picture winners--even the incredibly overblown ones. This brings me to a pet peeve I have. I HATE films that feature a bazillion cameos. I find that often the plethora of stars tend to get in the way of the story and often soak up a huge portion of the budget--leaving precious little for writing. Some of the stars in the film are very international in flavor and I never would have recognized them the first time I tried to see this movie 25 years ago. Now, after having seen and reviewed a ridiculous number of films, I was actually excited by some of these casting decisions. Catinflas, though completely unknown in America did some marvelous little comedies in Mexico--and he is the other reason I chose to try watching the movie again. I was to see Fernandel (who also made many wonderful films--in France and Italy). But, I was also maddened because his cameo as a hack driver was so short and unfunny--completely wasting his wonderful comedic talents. And this trend continued for several more of the cameo--wonderful actors who really have nothing to do and are pretty much wasted.At least 30 minutes could have and should have been cut from the film. I am NOT against long films...if they are well-paced. Too many times in this movie, however, scenes just unfold way too slowly--such as when the balloon is going over the Alps. A VERY LONG period of nice music and shots of the balloon are shown--when it really seemed interminably long. This reminded me of the major problem with Star Trek The Motion Picture--too many unnecessarily long shots which killed the film's momentum. The bullfighting scene is also one that goes on and on and on and could have been 1\/3 as long. Many other such examples followed.So is it a great film? No. I agree with another reviewer who felt the movie got an Oscar for Best Picture simply because it was such a spectacle--not because it was especially good. It's one of the weaker Best Picture films of the era, in my opinion. However, I must give the film its due. The movie is beautiful in every way--great costumes, amazing locations and sets, breathtaking cinematography and a scope that cannot really be matched. But, it is also very, very , very long with poor pacing, suffers from an overuse and wasting of cameos and just isn't that interesting. Catinflas was a very gifted and funny man--here you don't get a great sense of that at all. Likewise, David Niven was a very fine actor--but here he's more like set dressing and you don't get to see him at his best.Before I conclude, let's talk about the cameos. With all the many cameos, why did they pick Shirley MacLaine to play an Indian princess?! Talk about bizarre casting! And why have Frank Sinatra in a cameo that takes two seconds and he just turns and smiles at the camera?! I don't get it. And what was with John Carradine?! Even for him he over-acted horribly.

But, when Curtis decides to give it another try, he finds out that success isn't all it's cracked up to be. The performance by Curtis marked a career high, fresh off of The Defient Ones, and a couple years away from Some Like It Hot. Curtis gives a great performance here, his Sidney Falco is a smarmy, seedy press agent, who will do anything for publicity. Anything.Burt Lancaster plays J.J.

His Jedi Master, Obi wan Kinobi, stumbles across a unknown planet that was not supposed to exist. He also discovers that a bunch of cloners called the Kaminoains are establishing a mighty army at the request of a Jedi who has been dead for a long time. The army is said to be given to the Galatic republic to fight the growing separatist forces, which are having traitorous thoughts about the capital.The plot line is VERY deep in this movie. You may need to watch Star Wars The Phantom Menace to get most of the information portrayed in the film. The movie consists of multiple mysterious plot lines which all click together by the end.As always in the Star Wars films, the acting is great. There are many scenes of high expression especially from Obi-Wan and Anikin. The actors put a lot of passion into what they are saying and they really make the film believable.This time round, the movie is a little slow to start off. There are just talk of assassination and the discovery of a new planet. This part of the film plays out like a crime thriller with lots of Sci Fi element thrown in. When Obi Wan gets to the planet he has been searching for, Kamino, the movie really gets going. Obi Wan bumps into a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Jango is one of the main reasons why I like the film so much. From the first time you see him in his blue battle Armour, you instantly like the character. He exploits many tools and weapons from 2 personalised blaster pistols to a jet pack that fires rockets. In every scene you see him fighting he uses a new weapon to keep you interested. Fans of the original will recognise that the armour is identical to the armour of another bounty hunter Boba. You find out that this guy is actually Boba fett's Father. We also see a young Boba Fett which we had not seen before. This was intriguing in itself, but in a way, it sort of zaps out the ruthlessness of the original character, who's past had been shrouded in mystery until now. We finally find out that Boba Fett is actually a clone of his father and is basically the same type of clone as the millions being made for the republic. The character's background seemed unnecessary but it was quite entertaining to find out his origins.The middle half of the film is spent on the desert planet, Tatooinee, like they did with the first prequel.

They break free and a huge battle take place. IT'S HUGE! Monsters run about trying to kill the Jedi, Battle droids come out and start blasting the the monsters and the Jedi frantically dodge them. Massive amounts of battle droids come out, and start blowing stuff up. Just when you think you can't take much more, about 70-80 Jedi jump out of nowhere and join the fight. It gets really hectic when huge gunships swoop down and bombard all the droids. This is probably the biggest battle I have ever seen in a film!

His Jedi Master, Obi wan Kinobi, stumbles across a unknown planet that was not supposed to exist. He also discovers that a bunch of cloners called the Kaminoains are establishing a mighty army at the request of a Jedi who has been dead for a long time. The army is said to be given to the Galatic republic to fight the growing separatist forces, which are having traitorous thoughts about the capital.The plot line is VERY deep in this movie. You may need to watch Star Wars The Phantom Menace to get most of the information portrayed in the film. The movie consists of multiple mysterious plot lines which all click together by the end.As always in the Star Wars films, the acting is great. There are many scenes of high expression especially from Obi-Wan and Anikin. The actors put a lot of passion into what they are saying and they really make the film believable.This time round, the movie is a little slow to start off. There are just talk of assassination and the discovery of a new planet. This part of the film plays out like a crime thriller with lots of Sci Fi element thrown in. When Obi Wan gets to the planet he has been searching for, Kamino, the movie really gets going. Obi Wan bumps into a bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Jango is one of the main reasons why I like the film so much. From the first time you see him in his blue battle Armour, you instantly like the character. He exploits many tools and weapons from 2 personalised blaster pistols to a jet pack that fires rockets. In every scene you see him fighting he uses a new weapon to keep you interested. Fans of the original will recognise that the armour is identical to the armour of another bounty hunter Boba. You find out that this guy is actually Boba fett's Father. We also see a young Boba Fett which we had not seen before. This was intriguing in itself, but in a way, it sort of zaps out the ruthlessness of the original character, who's past had been shrouded in mystery until now. We finally find out that Boba Fett is actually a clone of his father and is basically the same type of clone as the millions being made for the republic.

The story of his film Detroit Rock City works because we like these characters even though they are odd and strange outcasts, and because the story's central point of focus, KISS concert tickets, seem to be so easy yet so difficult to obtain. It's a simplistic story made complex because of heavy factors; like age, overprotective moms, and disco Guidos.The four boys are do-it-all Hawk (Furlong), party-boy Lex (Andrews), loudmouth Trip (DeBello), and insecure Jam (Huntington) who love to rock out, work soft, play hard, and smoke marijuana. They have a garage band called Mystery that mirrors the band they idolize, KISS. After much trouble they look to have their eardrums blown off at an upcoming KISS concert, but because of Jam's overbearing mother, the tickets are gone and so are their hopes for the best concert ever.Though by sure luck, Trip calls into a radio show, answers the obligatory KISS question, and wins the four boys four tickets and backstage passes to the same concert. So now, they break Jam out of a boarding school his mother placed him in and are now resuming their plans for the best concert ever.Rifkin clearly knows how to have a fun time. He seems to know how it was to be a teenager who loved sex, drugs, rock and roll, and loud music. All the boys start as cookie cutter stereotypes, but it isn't until the final act of the film where they go off on their own that we see the true side of everyone of them.The fatal mistake Detroit Rock City made back when it was released in 1999; it cut off its main audience. Because of its R rating, used to fully utilize the language and drugs true to the youth, certain High Schoolers who I'm sure mirrored the behavior of the individuals portrayed in the film weren't allowed to see it without a parent. But how could you make a PG-13 Detroit Rock City? I just don't see it.This also occupies one of the best film soundtracks I've heard in quite sometime. Yes, lots of KISS songs are played to amuse the fanboys, but songs like The Boys Are Back in Town, Highway to Hell, Iron Man, Jailbreak, Rebel Rebel, and more are all snuck in. Detroit Rock City doesn't just stoop to the level of all KISS, all the time. I sneaks in other easily recognizable rock tunes to please both the fans of the band and rock fans in general. No assembly of knowledge on KISS is required to enjoy this film. It's a centrist kind of film.Now if only the ending could've been more.

The whole film is superbly shot and choreographed, with special kudo's going to the lighting directors and cinematographers for their excellent use of contrasting shadows to both hide and reveal things. The performances in the film are obviously among the best there have ever been and little needs to be said about them that has nor been said by critics in the past. Ellen Burstyn's performance as the socialite mother with a problem that can not be solved by throwing money at it rings true to what I would imagine any parent would do if faced with a similar situation.

As I said, Fright Night is a fun movie, which always raises a chuckle, but it also has some disgusting effects. I'm talking real practical stuff, with some of the most painful deaths and transformations you can imagine. This stuff is so much more creative with prosthetics and the like. Computers can easily make a body melt, or turn a wolf into a man, here some truly creative visuals make these things a reality. Sarandon is excellent as the charming vampire, and it's nice to see him go along with trying to prove he isn't a vampire. It shows him as a man that would rather keep his secret than enter a battle to the death. Ragsdale does the usual not-believed-kid routine, but he makes it work. McDowall stole the movie for me. He plays an out of date TV star given a chance to live out his pretend life. The threats are real, and the climax steadily grows. You do have to suspend some belief in terms of how the characters respond, but if you love the 80's, vampires, and movies that knew how to be fun no matter what their subject, you need to see Fright Night.

The story didn't bore me whatsoever, the color could have been much brighter and possibly more uplifting but it doesn't collide with the story. The story is a 'dull life' of a man and when he isn't upset and\/or fed up you can see change in brighter color.

It's the true story of Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert and their disastrous Apollo 13 mission where everything went wrong, yet through courage and determination the men made it back to Earth safely. It's emotional, it's daunting, and it's powerful. Apollo 13 is a truly thrilling film from start to finish as we watch the wonders as well as the risks of outer space come alive.Apollo 13 is a prime example of the Hollywood machine at work, but this time it produces fantastic results. Ron Howard directs this picture with the utmost care, as well as an obvious passion for the subject matter. Sure the events are probably glorified, but that's what this kind of melodramatic big budget Hollywood production is all about. Meanwhile, the film rounds up an all star cast with Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinse, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, and many more. This fine collection of actors come together in such a brilliant way as they all pull off fantastic performances that make Apollo 13 a melodramatic, yet still believable film. Then you throw in an almighty score from James Horner and you've got yourself a surefire win. Everyone involved with this film deserves credit because it really and truly comes together to be a wildly engaging film.You don't even have to necessarily have an interest in space or astronautics to enjoy this film. You can enjoy it as an engaging dramatic piece full of tension, suspense, and emotion. However, if you come into this film not caring at all about space you will likely leave with some sort of newfound interest in the wonders it beholds. There's something incredibly fun and fascinating about the way these characters speak. Their space jargon rolls off the tongue and allows the dialogue to flow so graciously and poignantly as mission control quickly streamlines commands to the men in the ship. The whole film has a great flow that keeps you engaged and thrilled, never losing focus on the film, always wanting to know what will happen next.It's actually incredibly ironic that a film like this can keep you so hooked and so boiled with emotion and suspense because we already know what happens. We know the story behind Apollo 13 and it's general knowledge that it was a disastrous mission to the moon yet the crew made it back safe and sound. Yet, amazingly enough, the suspense is so vigorous and the tension that builds is so captivating it's as if you had no idea what would happen. It takes true skill in acting and directing to pull this off, and it's the major challenge to overcome when making a film out of true events.

In this movie, The Cable Guy, played by Jim Carrey is a lonely character who has a lisp and is only looking for friendship. Except he doesn't know how to really keep a friend the right way. We learn this as we see Steven (Matthew Broderick) get sucked into a heap of trouble that takes an awful long time for him to clear his name. At first, The Cable Guy seems like a guy who's only trying to help. But he soon turns into a bad apple. Jim Carrey can be funny as a bad apple but it has to be done the right way. This is not one of them. By the end of the movie I still felt conflict because I couldn't decide whether The Cable Guy was likable or not. I still can't now.So besides Carrey being an annoying character, what else is wrong with this movie? Here's what - the film never took a side on what the viewer should really feel. There are so many times in the film where I was at a loss of what to feel for The Cable Guy. Some moments, I felt really bad for him and others times where I laughed at the things he did or said. Then there were other moments where I wanted to leave a couple knuckle imprints on his face. And it's not even how fast the movie changed tones but it was how frequent these feelings occurred.

That's one thing I could not agree with.Matthew Broderick along with several other actors, including Ben Stiller (director cameo), do a good job portraying their characters.

I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the objectively good, yet too slowly paced art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders.However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me. Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams.Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax? Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from.I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him, give this one a try.

I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the objectively good, yet too slowly paced art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders.However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me. Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams.Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax? Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from.I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him, give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though.I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9\/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams Wim Wenders to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

Seems like a long time ago since he enjoyed such a reputation but the problem I have with this movie is that it's trying too hard to be a neo-noir thriller when all it actually is is a depressing flick where bad people do bad things to worse people.Gibson plays Porter, a professional career criminal with a talent for inflicting pain and a certified mean streak. But when he's betrayed by his old partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) and his wife Lynn (Deborah Unger) for the relatively modest sum of $70'000 and left for dead, Porter begins the long road back to recovery and revenge. But once he starts asking questions, Porter quickly finds that getting his money back is a little harder than he first supposed. First of all, he has a couple of crooked cops on his tail (Bill Duke and Jack Conley) plus Val's twisted mistress Pearl (Lucy Liu) and her goons as well. But Porter's biggest problem is that Val is a small cog in a big machine and Porter doesn't have many friends...Essentially a retread of Point Blank (1967), Payback offers viewers a simple story attempting to be a classic film noir - faded palette, lots of cigarette smoke hanging in the air, a vast collection of low-lifes and scumbags and a narration from a world-weary protagonist. I can't call Porter a 'hero' because he's not - he's just as nasty and vicious as the criminals he's going after. Ultimately, I didn't care whether he got his money back or not and this is only part of the problem. The action took a bloody age to arrive and even then, only in fits and starts which left me feeling short-changed as did the film's short duration, despite the dumb-as-hammers plot. Performances are much better than the material deserved but Gibson is the only one to get any significant screen time.

It feels too grimy, gritty and seedy for its own good as if it will compensate for the lack of interest in proceedings. Like a pig rolling around in the proverbial, Payback is resolutely old-school without having any of the drama, appeal or excitement of proper crime thrillers like... hmmm, let me think Point Blank.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 December 2011","score":"","review":" I was not sure what I would think of Emir Kusturica's film about a society of Romani Gypsies but I have to say that this film touched me in its ability to present sympathetic characters and allow the audience to witness the customs, traditions, and spectacle of a minority culture on the outskirts of society. The story focuses upon Perhan, a Gypsy teenager with telekinetic powers who is vibrant and thoroughly optimistic about life and what the future holds for him. On a quest to marry his beloved, he sets out to make a name for himself and raise enough money to build a house for his future bride. The journey however leads Perhan into the sleazy underbelly of the Gypsy lifestyle where his youth is taken from him and the magic he saw in everyday life is extracted. Kusturica uses powerful visuals and an amazing score to build the Romani Gypsy's world and introduces a viewer to a microcosm so applicable to society in general, providing a lesson from the fringes of modern society, that is to never forget the magic in the world and to not take what you have for granted.

While many people credit Jurassic Park as the movie that revolutionized CGI and modern SFX I beg to differ T2 came out in 1991 2 full years before JP and the effects were just as good if not better I mean the scenes featuring the liquid metal T 1000 seem realistic even today.The action scenes are are Incredible the chase scene between the T 800 (Arnold) the T 1000 and John is one of the best and most exciting chase scenes period, my personal favorite is the Cyberdyne systems heist . The score is great and the Cinematography breath taking.What truly makes this movie this amazing is not its action or its visual brilliance, its the direction and writing and performances.Granted it had a huge budget but credit must be given where it is due one cant help but admire and revere James Cameron after viewing this,he is one of the true legends of Hollywood and this is his greatest cinematic achievement not Avatar or Titanic, from the beginning to end there isn't a single dull moment and the story that unfolds is astonishing . Linda Hamilton was amazing as usual its a shame that she was offered very few good roles after this as after witnessing her amazing transformation from Sarah Connor in T1 to Sarah Connor in T2 I must say that she had the potential to be one of the greats of Hollywood, Robert Patrick gave a power packed performance and Edward Furlong at such a young age gave a splendid performance but the best performance was given by Arnold Schwarzenegger some will argue that the role was tailor made for him but still he executes it with terrific brilliance even in the emotional scenes like the final scene where a tearful John orders him not to go an he defies his order and tells him that now he knows why humans cry (another example of great writing), spectacular . Its a movie for all ages and Races if u haven't watched it yet do watch it ASAP if you have then watch it again to refresh all of your great memories of this cinematic Masterpiece. 2 Thumbs up(if only I had more thumbs).
