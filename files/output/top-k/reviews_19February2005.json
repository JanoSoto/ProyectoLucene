[{"date":"19 February 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I rented Run Lola Run (or Lola rennt, if I want to be proper about it) expecting nothing more than shots of the lead actress running accompanied by throbbing techno music. That is a part of the film, but, as I discovered while recently watching it, not the only part. The film is mainly an exploration of choice, showing three different versions of the twenty-minute window Lola has to find 100,000 marks and deliver them to her boyfriend before he is killed by a crime boss. Are two of these versions simply imagined? Are they the same situation shown in parallel dimensions? In a wise decision, the director never explains how these three different versions are possible, or even which one, if any, is real. They all simply are, and exist side by side to clarify how extraordinarily one choice made in one second can affect your whole life. Further emphasizing this is a series of snapshots illustrating what happens to many of the people Lola runs into, showing how the slightest difference in the way they interact leads to a chain reaction that completely changes their futures. This brilliantly and concisely imparts the idea that even the strangers we merely glance at on the subway can impact our entire lives from thence forward.I think the thing that delighted me most about Lola rennt was that, as a crime thriller, it didn't have to include gratuitous violence, gallons of blood, and superfluous profanity. American filmmakers seem to think that these elements are required in generous quantities, but Tom Tykwer sprinkles them on sparingly, which results in maximum impact when and if they do appear. It's sort of the polar opposite of Reservoir Dogs, in which one becomes numb to the whole experience before the credits roll. The rest of Tykwer's directorial decisions aren't bad either. The film's visual aspect is vibrant and colorful (though maybe that's just the eye being naturally drawn to Lola's fire hydrant hair). The dialogue is thought-provoking, but sounds natural rather than just characters spouting textbook philosophy. The film finishes in eighty minutes, but is packed with more ideas than most blockbusters of twice that length, which is why arguments of the film being nothing more than a long music video really hold no validity. And, of course, the soundtrack complements the movie perfectly. I imagine I'll have to shell out more money for that in the future.Don't let the fact that this is shelved in the Foreign section intimidate you. The subtitles are well translated and not annoying to read, and it's normal enough to be within the comfort zone of most people. And I was certainly relieved that the film never took any cheap potshots at American culture.

It is a more serious films, less soap opera, than other fine films like 'Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios' and 'Tacone Lejanos'. It seems Almodóvar is growing up and it fits him. We still have the bright colors and there still is one (or two) transsexual character, but both are used in a more serious way.Here he tells the story of Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a woman who who loses her son while he is purchasing famous Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes) to get an autograph. He is hit by a car. Now Manuela wants to find her son's father, transvestite Lola (Toni Cantó), to tell him the bad news. She meets her old friend Agrado (Antonia San Juan), a nun named Rosa (Penélope Cruz) who also knows Lola, and due circumstances she becomes Huma's assistant. As with every Almodóvar film it is hard to explain the plot without revealing too much. His films always inhabit a lot of characters important for the story in one way or another.Although the story on itself is a very good one, there are little things I enjoyed very much. The way he shows us certain things and let them return later in the film. We get to see parts of 'All About Eve' for example, and later the main plot line of that film is mixed into this story. Another example shows Manuela as an actress in an instruction video where people have to decide whether they agree with a heart transplant of their dead relative, which ironically returns when she has to make that kind of choice for her own son.Of course there is the usual amount of comedy, especially when transsexual Agrado is in the picture. The cinematography is good, especially in combination with the colors we always see in an Almodóvar film. Very memorable is the important music. Alberto Iglesias has composed a beautiful score, even used in commercials these days, that fits the film perfectly. Although I like every film of Almodóvar since they are so different from other films, I do think this is one of his best. It is probably better accessible than most of his earlier films with a more familiar story. Fortunately the Almodóvar touch is felt all the way through the film.

But after giving it another chance on DVD years later, I was surprised by how good of a film it really is. I think that is because I was young when it was originally released, so I didn't get the satire, and was only looking for action.As it turns out, there is great action *and* satire in this film. In fact, after the second viewing I'd say the film's weakness is that it didn't include even more obscure references to Arnold's previous films, and make even more fun of the way Hollywood insults viewers' intelligence. But then again, Last Action Hero was released before Mystery Science Theater 3000 had trained me to expect riffs and puns flying faster than speeding bullets.Still, I wasn't quite prepared to laugh as hard as I did during this film, especially when blindsided by our hero's two questions for the villain. I won't ruin it by quoting here, because that just might be the funniest line Arnold has ever read on screen.The soundtrack still has the best and most appropriate songs of any film I've seen, although this is not as evident in the film as in the soundtrack CD. And it was great to finally see a teenage boy character in an action film who didn't annoy the hell out of me with constant screaming and whining. Austin O'Brien did a fabulous job as the hero's unlikely sidekick.The only thing that really bothered me occurred late in the film, which was supposed to take place in the real world. After spending so much time emphasizing that there is no deus ex machina in the real world, the hero-villain conflict is resolved in just such a manner. I would rather have seen a battle of wits, or at least brute strength, to carry our hero to victory.One last thing I watched the full-screen version DVD, and a lot more than usual seemed to be trimmed from the periphery.

Though the Matrix was hardly the first to use that type of effect, Asian cinema had been doing it for awhile, it was the first time I had seen anything like it. I remember being completely awed by the look and movement of the film. Though much of the style and effects quickly became vamped by many films, shows, and commercials, it remained perfect in its visual effects. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came out a few months later and pushed the Matrix visual envelope even farther. For my dollar, Ang Lee created a smarter, more beautiful use for the effects than the Wachowski brothers ever dreamed of creating.The story is a bit tricky. A master martial artists, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), decides to give up his heroism and settle down. Proving his seriousness in this new direction he gives up his famed sword, the Green Destiny, to a friend. The sword is quickly stolen throwing Li Mu Bai and another friend, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) into detective work to reclaim it. Added to the plot is a noble woman, Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), about to be married against her wishes and Li's old nemesis Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Chang). To add a little more to the plot (I told you it was tricky) Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien are lovers destined to never have their loved fulfilled.Ang Lee manages to sort out this complicated plot rather smoothly. The film is sumptuously shot on location in China. The renowned action sequences are poetic and beautiful. It feels more like watching ballet than a sword-fighting action movie. The more skilled fighters can climb up walls, jump great heights and seemingly fly through the sky. Though the film never explains how they are able to manage such incredible feats, they do it with such agility and grace, that you never think to question it. There is a scene fought out amongst tall whisp trees that is pure poetry. Yet they action sequences never stand in the way of the story. This is not a film designed to wow the audience with nothing but visual tricks, the action serves the story alone and is not there to give cheap thrills.As the film unfolds a theme develops. Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lin never express their love for each other out of honor and loyalty. They hold to strict codes that must be obeyed over all of their own desires. Jen Yu is also bound by codes of conduct, but she chooses to disobey them and strives to live her own life. This serves as the central conflict between the characters. I will not give too much of the plot away, but will say that film concludes this conflict in manner not seen often in cinema.It is difficult for me to judge the acting of a foreign film. I choose only to watch the original language, with subtitles. This allows me to hear the nuances of the actors voices, but since I must rely on the subtitles to tell me what they are saying it is difficult to really judge a performance. That being said all of the actors do a fine job. Chow Yun Fat does a remarkable job as a master fighter. Each action scene he is in he fill the screen with a knowing presence. He fights with great poise as if he knows he will be the victor, but does not want to show his true ability. Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are also stand outs.My only complaint has to do with one of the sub-plots. In the middle of the picture, we get a long back story on part of Jen Yu's life. After watching the film again I can see that the back story is essential to the overall theme of the film, but it is still too long in the telling. It also serves to slow the film down just as the plot was finally moving along. I believe the essentials of the back story could have been told at a quicker pace allowing us to understand what is needed without slowing the pace of the film down, or lengthening it too much.This is a small complaint with a truly wonderful film. I have been a fan of Ang Lee for many years, and this film stands as his finest achievement. He is known for his smaller, character driven family films.

Half metaphysical orgy of light and effects shots and half cheap, not very comic, sight gags.The whole development of the tapes was the kind of good literate, hard-core SF which is sadly missing in most Sci-Fi movies. real ideas were played with and explored. The lab and the equipment looked real. The sets were great.

Our protagonists John Blaine and Peter Martin (played by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin, respectively) choose Westworld. John is a Westworld veteran, having visited many times. Peter is his friend and first-timer at the resort; uttering childlike statements such as Do we get a real gun? Wow! In the various worlds, the guests interact with each other and with anatomically-correct, extremely realistic robots. They are able to *ahem* interact very closely with the female robots, and also shoot the mean robots for fun (the guns they are supplied with will not work on real people) as they wish. A real cowboys and indians scenario for the child in us all. Roman World is promoted as a big sex resort, and Medieval World is geared towards the romantic, it seems.The film starts out with quite a lot of intentional comedy and satire, and frankly starts out very much like it could have been a 1970's TV Movie of the Week, but once the robots start to go bad...what we have for the rest of the film is a truly creepy western\/sci-fi film. It's a gunfight! Albeit a Sci-Fi one. The last half-hour of the film is essentially a silent movie, as Crichton said he wanted, save for the great soundtrack, which sounds something like a bow being drawn against piano strings, or a cello; anyway it has the same unsettling effect as the out-of-tune piano in another classic, Wait Until Dark (1967).Movies with robots\/androids...there have been many I have seen and loved. But for this review I will cite examples of what I consider to be scary robots in film, besides Westworld The Stepford Wives (1974), Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), The Terminator (1984), Aliens, The Companion (1995). But Westworld was the first scary robot film I ever saw. And even after the others that followed, nothing quite equals Yul Brynner in his role as the gunslinger robot gone bad in Westworld. His performance is what really makes the movie. Brynner was a good actor, and even (aybe especially) playing a machine, his skill is used to great effect. His performance was anything but wooden (unlike the always wooden Ah-nold in The Terminator, for instance). When Brynner's robot gunslinger commands Draw, with the slightest twist at the corner of his mouth, he is completely creepy and scary. Even the way he walks when hunting down Richard Benjamin's character has an element to it that I have never seen again. What's also great about this film is the development of Benjamin's character of Peter Martin. He starts out as the inexperienced nerdy sidekick to Brolin's John Blaine, and ends up showing his true mettle as the going gets rough. The nerdy naive Martin quickly learns how to survive. This was Sci-Fi writer\/director Michael Crichton's first foray into big-screen film-making. Crichton has said he made the film in thirty days. I would expect that finding pre-made sets were easy at least; there was bound to be at least a western set sitting around the studio lots. And of course, back then there were fewer and less complicated special effects.If you find a DVD of this to rent, and you've never seen the film before, I recommend that you do not watch the trailer first!

A Dogma 95 film, this movie exemplifies the challenges put up by the group of film makers that created Dogma 95 in Copenhagen. DOGMA 95 counters the individual film by the principle of presenting an indisputable set of rules known as THE VOW OF CHASTITY. The rules (10 in all) include principles such as shooting must be done on location (scenes in Venezia) and on a sound stage used to rehearse Sound of Music--an auditorium where the Italian classes are held. Music should not be used unless it occurs where hte scene is being shot (how refreshing not to have Hollywood scores interrupting the natural sound). Hand-held camera-- this produces a feeling that you are doing the filming yourself. I felt that when Andreas was swimming in the hotel pool. Special lighting is not acceptable -- again the auditorium and the lights. Or the restaurant lighting. The characters in this movie are so real one feels you have met them before.

I found myself watching this movie for a second time, and not quite sure why I did see it again. It might have been for the actors in it, or the Hitchcock-like style of it, but most likely, it was just because I remembered that Juliette Lewis is in it... and she's every bit as talented as she was in later films. Truth be told, the movie just isn't really that impressive. The direction is sub-par for Scorsese, the acting is below common expectations for Nolte and De Niro and the pacing is dire. The directorial style shows inspiration from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Normally I would immediately say that this is a good thing, but Scorsese misuses the suspense-building elements that Hitchcock used to great effect in his films... and thereby ruins a lot of needed intensity. A good bit of the music(if not all of it) is also inspired of Hitchcock... this isn't all bad, but there are scenes where it seems completely out of place. The movie has some good scenes, but they are few and far between. I barely paid attention to the film on my second viewing... that says something about how meandering, overlong and slow it is. Just when you think it's about to end, it goes on. And on. And on. The narration is somewhat flat, despite Lewis' talent. The acting isn't particularly impressive, compared to what De Niro(who should be restrained, physically, if necessary, from ever attempting a Southern accent again) and Nolte has done in the past. The direction isn't anything special for Scorsese. All in all, this is OK for a thriller, but not something you'll want to watch more than once. I recommend this to fans of Scorsese, De Niro, Nolte and, to a lesser extent, Lewis. Big fans of Hitchcock should probably avoid this, though.

It's true that Pacino and Penn are two of the best American film actors ever, and their work in this film, as well as DePalma's effort as Director, does deserve praise. Latter day fans of the actors, or fans of Scarface, will see something of a reversal for Penn and Pacino - Pacino is simmering and reserved (complicated in a word, like many of Penn's pre- and post- Fast Times roles), and Penn is the bombastic psycho, a la Pacino's Tony Montana. And DePalma shows his technical and visual expertise, and deft handling of underlying violence, tension, and suspense, in many of the scenes mentioned in other reviews.But part of the reason the three principals here merit some applause, is that the script for this film is awful. It is paint-by-numbers without a shred of humor or irony. Pacino's Puerto Rican accent is unbelievably bad, as if he were mocking his own role, or if the text of the script were so bad he felt a need to mangle his own delivery. It's even worse than his Cuban accent in Scarface, without the cartoonish humor. Tony Montana couldn't even speak his few Spanish lines convincingly. Carlito sounds like a Cajun with bad gas, not a Puertorriqueño. Also, while I agree with other reviewers that Pacino's physical look in this film makes a big contribution (Penn's even more so), I have never met a Puerto Rican who looked as white as Pacino. Rick Aviles is Puerto Rican. John Leguizamo is half Puerto Rican. Pacino? Not remotely.This flaw is made worse by Pacino's voice over narration - one of my least favorite devices in cinema. The narration is so horribly written, it must have been added after the original cut. On occasion, narration is thus added to a completed film as an afterthought, where the original cut otherwise might seem confusing or incomplete, or to novel adaptations (like this one), to make up for the lack of illuminating backstory or detail. In Carlito's Way, it's simply unnecessary and annoying. The film would have been shorter and better without it. I also agree with other reviewers that the very True romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is a departure from other Pacino gangster films, where his character is too unflappable or monomaniacal to be involved in and motivated by any such relationship. And the premise of two lovers who have been tragically separated - and shed some of their narcissism in the process - is compelling. But the pair's actual performances as lovers are childish and irritating. I agree with an earlier review here that the mock rape scene is so ridiculous that it's a chore simply to sit through it.To sum up, the whole cast and the director are excellent, but the script is garbage. Such a combo worked a lot better in King of New York, a far less ambitious film, but one that is more watchable than this one because it sticks to its strengths.

Latter day fans of the actors, or fans of Scarface, will see something of a reversal for Penn and Pacino - Pacino is simmering and reserved (complicated in a word, like many of Penn's pre- and post- Fast Times roles), and Penn is the bombastic psycho, a la Pacino's Tony Montana. And DePalma shows his technical and visual expertise, and deft handling of underlying violence, tension, and suspense, in many of the scenes mentioned in other reviews.But part of the reason the three principals here merit some applause, is that the script for this film is awful. It is paint-by-numbers without a shred of humor or irony. Pacino's Puerto Rican accent is unbelievably bad, as if he were mocking his own role, or if the text of the script were so bad he felt a need to mangle his own delivery. It's even worse than his Cuban accent in Scarface, without the cartoonish humor. Tony Montana couldn't even speak his few Spanish lines convincingly. Carlito sounds like a Cajun with bad gas, not a Puertorriqueño. Also, while I agree with other reviewers that Pacino's physical look in this film makes a big contribution (Penn's even more so), I have never met a Puerto Rican who looked as white as Pacino. Rick Aviles is Puerto Rican. John Leguizamo is half Puerto Rican. Pacino? Not remotely.This flaw is made worse by Pacino's voice over narration - one of my least favorite devices in cinema. The narration is so horribly written, it must have been added after the original cut. On occasion, narration is thus added to a completed film as an afterthought, where the original cut otherwise might seem confusing or incomplete, or to novel adaptations (like this one), to make up for the lack of illuminating backstory or detail. In Carlito's Way, it's simply unnecessary and annoying. The film would have been shorter and better without it. I also agree with other reviewers that the very True romance between Pacino and Penelope Ann Miller is a departure from other Pacino gangster films, where his character is too unflappable or monomaniacal to be involved in and motivated by any such relationship. And the premise of two lovers who have been tragically separated - and shed some of their narcissism in the process - is compelling. But the pair's actual performances as lovers are childish and irritating. I agree with an earlier review here that the mock rape scene is so ridiculous that it's a chore simply to sit through it.To sum up, the whole cast and the director are excellent, but the script is garbage. Such a combo worked a lot better in King of New York, a far less ambitious film, but one that is more watchable than this one because it sticks to its strengths.

Also because I was interested in seeing Orson Welles towards the end, both as actor and director. In combination with Janet Leigh and Marlene Dietrich and Charlton Heston figured it would be interesting at least.I saw the DVD version in which they purportedly put together a version based on a 58 page memo written by Welles after seeing what the studio execs had done to his film. I did not review in detail what changes were made over the theatrical release, maybe someday I'll get a chance to see that version for comparison. Charlton Heston is pretty much a joke of a man in the first place, but it was hilarious seeing this guy trying to portray a Mexican. In the beginning of the film there's a really funny line from Heston about how the bombing would affect us, Janet Leigh questions us as if he meant them as a couple then he says us in terms of Mexicans. I died laughing and this set the tone for the rest of this horrible script. That both major Mexican characters are played by Heston and Tamiroff is a sad commentary on the racism of the times. Neither made for a believable character. I would hope Welles would not be a part of blatant racism but perhaps I simply don't know much about Welles in this respect. I expect it from a buffoon like Heston, but it surprised me with Welles. The other major disappointment with this film was the way they presented marijuana and heroin users; this was more along the lines of Reefer Madness than anything else. Again, I expected such from Heston but not Welles. Guess I'll have to do some Welles research here; I obviously thought better of the man than displayed here.The film was shot in an interesting fashion, and was visually stimulating. Just disappointing most every other way.

To start with Love stories with the backdrop of war are a Hollywood staple and somewhat of a cliché. A guy falling in love with his best friends girl when the friend 'dies' is also a movie cliché. The first movie they have 'remade' is From Here to Eternity, one of the best films of the war-romance genre and this love story is nowhere near as well made or acted as its more famous predecessor. The second film they tried to remake was Tora, Tora, Tora an excellent movie about the planning and execution of the attack. The third film is Thirty Seconds over Tokyo about the Doolittle raids, which features everything from two friends, to one of the friends dying in China and the other returning home to his pregnant wife. Not only is it a pitiful attempt at remake three excellent films but some of the scenes, especially the FDR scenes are totally pointless(Don't get me wrong I like Jon Voight but he was poorly used in this movie).Some of the special effects are neat but that is about it, why can't Hollywood do more original stuff.

There is an anonymous killer on campus who is knocking off students and basing the kills on modern urban legends, which are basically the stuff you hear about in horror movies or from someone who knows someone you know, you get the drift? Examplesthreatening phone calls coming from inside the house, an assailant hiding in the backseat of your car, a cry over the radio for help from a woman who is actually being killed... The premise is superb and very original and some of the cameos were great(Robert Englund Freddy, Brad Douriff Chucky, Robert Wagner's daughter... hehehehe). The radio station scene with a then-unknown Tara Reid is definitely one of the highlights of this film, and the unveiling of the killer at the end is kind of surprising...Most of the time I would enjoy this more than the Scream trilogy because when the day is long and I feel like chillin' out with some popcorn and a movie then 'Urban Legend' is worth the hour and a half because it is not very involving and I don't feel exhausted by the time the credits roll. However it does insult your intelligence sometimes like in the scene where Tara Reid's character narrowly escapes certain death and then runs into a nearby elevator when she could have just ran out of the front doors to safety. Also, there is a questionable scene in the beginning where a woman gets decapitated while driving a car and the killer miraculously survives and is even unharmed. But those are minor drawbacks which are present in almost every B-movie slasher. Still most of the viewing audience will probably discard this and consider it a trashy Scream rip-off, but for most of us die hard slasher-fans Urban Legend will eventually join the ranks with the best of them. It's definitely not better than the Scream trilogy, but it's worthy of a viewing. I rate it 6\/10. Avoid the sequel, unless your a fan of Eva Mendes.
