[{"date":"9 April 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Someone says that this movie attacks the entire punk ideology and lifestyle and tries to prove how worthless the political ideology of anarchy is. Someone says that this movie provides an inaccurate image of the punk ideology and lifestyle and thus, represents it wrongly. And critique it on that note.In my opinion those are completely flawed and unreasonable conclusions to make about this movie. This movie is about ONE simple thing. It's about an angry teenager who is trying to find his way in life between everything he THINKS matters, and what actually DOES matter.Stevo is a poser. Posers are the type of people who will judge people because of what they look and look down on them because of what clique they are in. Essentially, they are nothing better then the groups that they hate. But he doesn't realize this when he is an angry teenager who is upset with everything that is wrong with the world, everything that is mediocre, fascism and buttoned-down-normal.There isn't anything in this movie that complains about the entire punk ideology. In the end, Brandy makes the ultimate statement when she talks about how Rebellion happens in the mind, it's not about the clothes you wear and that's the whole point with the movie. Punk is about personality. It's about values, it's about your mentality. It doesn't have anything to do with how you dress or living like a bum. It's about individuality, freedom, open-mindedness and not doing things just because other people want you to.In the end, Stevo stops being a poser because he realizes what is important. It's what you think and do to change the world, not how you dress. You can do a lot more damage inside of the system then outside of it. He simply changes his perspective, he doesn't stop being anti-authority and he doesn't stop being a punk.This movie is about the STEREOTYPES and COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS in not only punk but alternative subcultures in general. That is what makes it the ultimate punk movie for me, because I have grown up with people (myself included) who dress in alternative fashion and judge other people for looking normal as much as normal people judge them back. And it's a very flawed and immature mentality to have, which you don't realize until you get to know people and see that appearance is just appearance. What's important is the mind.

Are we all to believe the Academy, which bestowed 7 academy award nominations for this film, have NO idea what they are talking about. Are we to believe the 8 star rating, out of 475 reviews, that 20% of the votes are the correct votes? Some of the reasons behind why this film is supposedly poor is HILARIOUS! Lets review a couple of the reasons..One guy writes.. Do you really think Helen Hunts boss would let her talk to customers for long periods of time? Answer Yes.. Why? Because Jack Nicholson's character may have saved her sons life. I am pretty sure the manager could let her spare a little time to say thank you, and frankly, she doesn't spend that much time with him anyway. Someone else writes.. Jack gets kicked out and asked to leave, then he is back minutes later.. Answer Well, it is NOT minutes later, and, again, I am quite certain Helen explained to her boss, hey, this guy helped save my son's life (He ain't that bad) and they give him another shot.. Do you people watch movies? It doesn't get better in the acting world. You are telling me you couldn't get that vibe that helen was loved in her restaurant? And, the best of all, people that wrote this movie is not funny? what?? I know from never even meeting these people, these are the people that only find movies like Monty Pyton and Ace Ventura movies hilarious. Any type of comedy that requires some thinking and they are long gone.Trust me folks, this is one of the best movies of the 90's, never mind 1997. Check it out for stunning acting...

But for its kind and the fact that it was directed by Wes Craven who does get the best out of them, it's as good as it will get.The film opens up with Drew Barrymore and her boyfriend being sliced and diced by some guy in a black cape and ghost mask. That's just to get the audience in the mood. It seems as though this slashing is connected to a case a year ago when Neve Campbell's mother was killed in the same grisly manner. This gives Neve a rooting interest to find out who is doing these killings.Two other people are interested in the story, TV reporter Courtney Cox and her then husband David Arquette playing a sheriff's deputy on the cases. But the killings go on and someone is after a lot of the town's teen population.Wes Craven borrowed a gambit from Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None for his story involving the real killer. If you know that film or the book Ten Little Indians from whence it comes, then you might just figure out who's doing all the slashing.Scream and its successors aren't exactly my cup of tea, but you might like this if that is your taste.
