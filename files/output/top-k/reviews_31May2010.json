Such a movie does not exist.- Psycho created its own genre Sure, there were monster, killer, and horror movies prior to 1960, but Psycho is the first actually good one. All pre-Psycho films are merely proto-horror movies. People still watch Psycho and, importantly, they still watch it as a horror movie. When people watch Frankenstein or Dracula, they are watching it for A) a laugh, or B) because it's famous. While Dracula and Frankenstein might sell in cheap monster movie box sets, Psycho still sells as a movie on its own, and to a wide and diverse audience that includes kids, adults, cinema lovers, and nacho lovers. No need to mention that every horror movie since Psycho is inspired by Psycho. This brings us to the next point...- Psycho is still a little bit scary At its release, this movie had people screaming and throwing up. This does not happen anymore, but VERY few movies can legitimately scare people for more than a few years after they're released. I'm not claiming that Psycho is still legitimately scary, but compare it to more recent horror movies such as Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those movies are also no longer scary, and Psycho is in fact (in my opinion) scarier to a modern audience. Thus, it has stood the test of time as well as one could hope.- The music you all know it, your grandma knows it, and your 4-year old knows it. How many movies have stolen this score almost note for note?One last thing. Critics everywhere regard Psycho as a masterpiece, but often include a little clause about the psychiatrist scene and how it's out of place.

No, I can 100% truthfully say that I think the scene adds to the movie, and I consider myself brutally honest when it comes to Hitchcock movies, even though I am a fan.

Re-launching the career of director Alfonso Cuaron, Y Tu Mama Tambien is an explicit film full of politics, subtle commentary, and sex. This movie is also a tough pill to swallow, as it showcases rough emotions, rough dialogue, tough moments of truth, and an overwhelming amount of sexual tension and material. If you can get past the intensity and frank content, then it's a good film to watch. But, this movie is not for the shy, not for the easily-embarrassed, and not for those that lack an open mind. View at your own risk. Don't let it scare you too much though, because this movie is full of heart, humor, and beautiful drama. Everyone has that one major moment in their life when they realize they must grow up, they must do something different in their life. Every person (that eventually matures) goes through that one period of time when ugly realizations open up, leading to them drastically changing. Before jumping to the mature stage, the edge or blockade to leap from must occur. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, we follow a road trip led by three people that deflowers into a plethora of emotions, ugly truths, and sudden realization of mortality. Two young horny teenagers (Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal) with nothing better to do in their lives attempt to convince a beautiful older woman (Maribel Verdu) to accompany them on a trip to the beach. What starts as a harmless attempt to have sex with this woman winds up opening up deep dark secrets that threaten the extremely strong friendship and bond between the two boys. Written by the director and his brother Carlos Curaon, this film not only feels very realistic and close to the heart, but also gets meshed in with the political turmoil happening at the time and taps into what was going on in Mexican youth culture. With Mexico having problems in its government for years, very few realize that those most affected are the next generation of leaders and movers, the young adults. The splitting class systems and constant political turmoil was leaving the Mexican youth in a Generation-X state of mind. This movie reveals all this in a matter of 105 minutes, and for that reason this is one of the better original scripts released in a decade.It is not just the writing that's very gritty; the acting is fantastic as well. I personally believe some of the toughest scenes you could possibly act in are sex scenes, and especially when there are no clothes and no camera tricks to hide the action. A lesser group of actors would have trouble delivering a decent performance when having to reveal it all and engage in graphic sexual scenes, but the three main actors were flawless in their performance. You can feel their tension, you can feel their rage, and sympathize with them when they are at their absolute lowest. The chemistry amongst the three is impressively strong, giving the movie a near documentary feel. Road trip movies always require that the audience can remain interested and invested in the characters involved at all times, and Y Tu Mama Tambien definitely delivers. After a stint of failures, Alfonso Curaon went back to the basics with this movie, ultimately delivering the best directing performance of his career. No shot is ever too long or too short, as he does a superb job visually showing the beauty of Mexico within its fragile status. His directing of the sex scenes were most impressive, as they hold nothing back in a physical scene, while at the same time still deliver the emotions. Sex scenes rarely deliver drama and reveal character traits (usually&#x85;its to make the men happy inside), but Y Tu Mama Tambien's assortment of explicit scenes happen for a reason&#x97;they are not used for show. While some of the dialogue could have been cut, making this a shorter film, Curaon did a fantastic job directing his script. Bottom Line An amazing look at turn-of-the-century Mexico, Y Tu Mama Tambien is an emotionally-driven road trip through a beautiful country marred by politics, reputation, and ugly stereotypes. There's so much more to Mexico then just Hispanics angry at their government and trying to head to the States; here is a country rich with culture, history, beauty, and unfortunate uncertainty. Few movies can represent their city well, and fewer movies can accurately portray entire countries well. But, Y Tu Mama Tambien accomplishes just that with a blend of fantastic writing, excellent acting, and great directing. One of the best road trip movies you'll ever see, I recommend this Mexican cinematic modern classic as long as your eyes can tolerate graphic sexual content and graphic nudity. Otherwise, you'll be missing out on a good film that's rough along the artistic edges.

In my mind it wasn't the photography so much as the production and set design that make the scenes, and if you read about how the movie was made and the extremes that were taken to get certain effects, it's fascinating.So the movie looks good, yes, and it often recreates the mood of these apparently simple times, uneducated people working hard in the fields, lots of folksy celebrating and huddling in the fields in their dignified poverty, appealing clichés, well imagined.Yes, Days of Heaven is a Hallmark card come to life. The actors are pretty but thin, and the words they are made to say are forgettable. Even the narrator with her exaggerated child's wisdom, a weary cliché, doesn't have anything actually new to say. Yes, the movie is an exercise in familiarity, and it succeeds, if it succeeds at all, by its mise-en-scene, its ability to envision those times out in the Texas Panhandle. The skies are airbrushed gold and crimson, and the prairie fires are fierce and devouring.That might not be enough for many of you. And I saw it on a fairly big screen, so if you have a television, and are depending for a convincing and moving plot with good acting, beware.

First of all, unlike mentioned in some reviews I don't think Robert Redford was miscast because according to some reviewers that he was too handsome for the role so any woman would sleep with him anyway even for free. The interesting thing for me  Yes Robert Redford is devastatingly handsome even aged in his fifties in this film but Diana and David are very much in love but totally broke and they need the money desperately.Why it is interesting ? because I think that Robert Redford as John Gage should be able to have all the women he wants without paying anything - The main point is that John GAGE wants Diana and no one else  something clicked inside him when he first saw her in the shop.It was not only a sexual attraction but also a strong feeling for her. The fact that he is handsome is interesting because you feel at the beginning of the film that David could be jealous of John Gage not only because of his money but also because of Gage's looks and great presence. David is aware of that and I believe is worried that Diana could be attracted to him as well from a romantic point of view. And he's right because Diana is attracted to John GAGE maybe not consciously at the beginning but she is later in the film when she realizes that he is a real gentle man looking for love. Actually she would like to hate him but she can't. That's why it is hard for Diana to talk about her fateful night with . John Gage when David asked her. If John Gage was portrayed as a bad-looking,rough guy, it might have been much easier for Diana to do it for money no risk then to feel attracted to the guy or to fall in love with him because it would be just sex and - that's all -no feelings involved. No risks at all so no interests, no suspense in the film.The film wouldn't be as interesting as it is. As for John GAGE,we know that he wanted to prove to David and Diana that everything could be bought, even people but he also realizes that feelings cannot be bought as he wanted Diana to love him like she loves David.

G. Peck, as the title character, is his usual solid self with his signature stage presence, but O. Sharif steals the show with his lusty and vibrant portrayal as the film's main desperado antagonist. His scene with McKenna where he tells him about what he'll do with his share of the supposed loot (a gentleman in Paris!) is short but emphatic, as it shows the scoundrel in a much different light, adding to the film's flavor. The old guard of actors, such as R. Massey. L.J. Cobb, B. Meredith, etc. have limited roles, but make optimal use of their brief time allotments. The exception here, however, is E.G Robinson's 5-10 minute gripping soliloquy of his experience at the canon del oro, where the whole cast (and probably the whole audience!) is engaged in rapt attention to what he says.But the cinematic magic really takes form as the movie draws to its conclusion as the remaining gold-seekers arrive at the canyon and prepare for their mission's conclusion. The audio and visual impact of the ride to and through the canyon and what might happen at any given point in time makes for a breath-taking segment.

No one can bring out the emotion and heart out of, what in any other writer director's hands, would have been just another romantic comedy. Crowe's script is funny, warm and thoughtful, and he brings out the best in his cast.

Not only was it surrounded by the unpleasant controversy of equally unpleasant Archie Comics completely screwing over their most famous artist of over 40 years -- who was reasonably outraged of their unauthorised usage of a character based off his wife -- but it was also very clearly a desperate attempt to cash in on characters that had not featured prominently in any popular media for years.Entertainment does move in cycles, and it shouldn't be surprising to anyone that, in the squeaky-clean teenybop year of 2001, that one of the original squeaky-clean teenybop groups would attempt to stage a comeback. Archie Comics as a company are well-known for attempting to exploit any and every possible trend or fad, and they can't really be blamed for that. However, the real-world events behind the film completely ruin its attempted message.Essentially, the message of the film attempts to convey exploitative corporate (and governmental) evils. It's impossible to take it on its own, however, despite the directors' clear attempt to make the characters and circumstances their own it's a film attempting to take the moral high ground on the topic of corporate evil, made possible by a company that at the time was committing one of its most grievous corporate evils. Because of that alone, the film is undermined before it even begins.There are some amusing moments and some satire that works in the film. The acting isn't too terrible for the most part, although there are some truly shameful performances in it, and by that I mean career lows. I can't imagine most of the cast would happily recall Josie and the Pussycats as a film they were too proud of making. Between the mediocre-to-bad songs, the self-aware attempts at humour that almost always try too hard, and terrible miscasting in places, it's difficult to feel much affection for the film.Even for fans of the comic (Josie hadn't had a regular series of her own in nearly 20 years when this film was released), the film couldn't help but be a disappointment the actors barely resemble the characters they're intended to be, such as the skinny Alan M. who is a mousy, terribly untalented folk singer. While his looks don't thrill, he also doesn't have a personality to make up for it. What happened to Alan M. the muscular blond roadie? What about the Cabots, longtime best enemies of Josie and her gang? They didn't even pop in Pepper for a cameo.The worst thing about the film is that it really didn't know what it wanted to be or who it wanted to appeal to as an audience. People who already knew Josie and the Pussycats would be insulted by the 'interpretation' of the characters, which were far off-base and barely included any of the memorable cast from DeCarlo's comics. People unfamiliar with them would either not be interested in a superficially teenybopper film or put off by the heavy-handed attempt at satire which simply falls flat more times than not. Was it a romance, a satire, a parody, a comedy, a chick flick, a friendship movie, a romance...what? It's all over the map, and not in a way that respectably combines themes to form a stronger whole. In this film, Josie and the Pussycats could have been replaced by anyone, and nobody would have noticed the difference.Of course, it also didn't help that by 2001, even the most popular girl group in years, the Spice Girls, had largely faded off the map and gone their separate ways. By 2001, people of all ages were growing tired of the sentiment embraced by the film Pussycats; they wanted a break.While the intentions of the film might have been honourable in questioning corporate endorsements and government roles in popular media and entertainment, the film itself was not realised as well as it could have -- and should have -- been. Surrounded by the controversy of the nastiness of its own corporate master, Josie and the Pussycats is an exercise in irony more than anything else, and on so many levels. For a film that makes such fun of pre-fabricated pop music and artificial groomed 'instant celebrities', it certainly tries to dole out those very things, which is regrettably hypocritical. So it fails even as a commentary, even if taken on its own merits, apart from Archie Comics and their machinations. It's not very funny, it's not that interesting, it's nothing that hasn't been done before, it's not subtle, the music isn't very good, the acting isn't that great, the casting is terrible, and well...it isn't Josie and the Pussycats at all.

Delia considers herself an artist and, with the help of her friend Otho, proceeds to re-model the house. The Maitland's are now really distressed, what with coming to terms with being dead as well, it's all proving a bit much. Lydia can see the ghosts and, after talking for a while, the Maitland's take a liking to her. Help is at hand in the guise of the crazy spirit known as Beetlejuice. But the Maitland's, at first try to scare the Deetz family away themselves. This all goes wrong when they are enthralled by their efforts and want more! Can Beetlejuice save the day? Guess you'll have to watch it to find out.Although it looks quite dated by today's standards, this is unmistakably a Tim Burton film. A lot of stop-motion animation is used for the special effects which reminded me of the much later Corpse Bride from 2005.

As I have recently seen Avatar in 3D, I am confident that it wasn't the special effects that impressed me. I also felt the main plot was simply average as it built off common themes including, time travel, contacting aliens, and saving the world. None of these elements are particularly unique, thus I must conclude that the characters and their personal journeys are what made this movie a success. Captain Jean-Luc Picard in particular was a very dynamic character. Initially he had a strong sense of revenge and wounded pride from his past involvement with the Borg, as this became mixed with his desires to save his crew, his ship, and his loyal friend Lt. Commander Data his actions became increasing intriguing. Lt. Commander Data's development was also quite interesting. For those of you who are unaware, Lt. Commander Data is an android who desires nothing more than to be human. After Lt. Commander Data is captured by the Borg, he is partially given this very thing as a way to exploit a weakness. Throughout his experience after being captured he is engaged in an intriguing internal battle that really can't be given justice with words. A third character I found interesting was the Borg Queen. She wasn't very dynamic throughout the film, however she was very unique and clever. In these three characters, and many others, I feel the actions are very believable and that this was a key component in making the whole movie a success.I also enjoyed the clear-cut good guy vs. bad guy portrayal in the film. It was very clear that the Borg were bad and all the humans from past and future were good. It was clear that the Borg needed to be stopped to dramatically save humanity and of course they were. And after all the Borg's biological parts disintegrated in the plasma and the good aliens were drinking whiskey with crazy ole' Dr. Zefram Cochrane I couldn't but feel good about life in general. Between the classic clear-cut good vs. evil and this classic happy ending, I felt that this entire movie was crafted to draw in a side of moviegoers that is often neglected. It was a pleasant respite that I can only hope will be matched in other Star Trek movies that I will be watching in the near future.

Initially he had a strong sense of revenge and wounded pride from his past involvement with the Borg, as this became mixed with his desires to save his crew, his ship, and his loyal friend Lt. Commander Data his actions became increasing intriguing. Lt. Commander Data's development was also quite interesting. For those of you who are unaware, Lt. Commander Data is an android who desires nothing more than to be human. After Lt. Commander Data is captured by the Borg, he is partially given this very thing as a way to exploit a weakness. Throughout his experience after being captured he is engaged in an intriguing internal battle that really can't be given justice with words. A third character I found interesting was the Borg Queen. She wasn't very dynamic throughout the film, however she was very unique and clever. In these three characters, and many others, I feel the actions are very believable and that this was a key component in making the whole movie a success.I also enjoyed the clear-cut good guy vs. bad guy portrayal in the film. It was very clear that the Borg were bad and all the humans from past and future were good. It was clear that the Borg needed to be stopped to dramatically save humanity and of course they were. And after all the Borg's biological parts disintegrated in the plasma and the good aliens were drinking whiskey with crazy ole' Dr. Zefram Cochrane I couldn't but feel good about life in general. Between the classic clear-cut good vs. evil and this classic happy ending, I felt that this entire movie was crafted to draw in a side of moviegoers that is often neglected. It was a pleasant respite that I can only hope will be matched in other Star Trek movies that I will be watching in the near future.

As I have recently seen Avatar in 3D, I am confident that it wasn't the special effects that impressed me. I also felt the main plot was simply average as it built off common themes including, time travel, contacting aliens, and saving the world.

I'll go along with the accolades for cinematography but storyline I'm not so sure about. 'Triad' is seen through the eyes of Shuisheng, a boy from the country, who is brought to Shanghai by his Uncle Liu, both distantly related to #1 crime boss, Tang. Uncle Liu has arranged for the boy to act as a servant to Xiao Jingbao (Gong Li), a cabaret singer who happens to be Tang's mistress.All the action occurs within a week's time. It seems Shuisheng has bad luck as shortly after he's picked up by Uncle Liu, he witnesses a gang rub out by Tang's second in command, Song. It seems that Song felt that an associate of rival crime boss, Fat Yu, did not show enough respect. Tang tries to smooth things over with Fat Yu by making a courtesy call to his rival and they eventually end up playing a friendly game of mah jong.Meanwhile Shuisheng must endure catering to Xiao who arrogantly treats him like dirt, calling him a country bumpkin. Xiao is a popular singer at Tang's club but must be continually reminded not to sing a particular song that the boss despises. In fact, Xiao hates being Tang's mistress and trashes her own apartment, cursing the boss when he's out of earshot.Things move along slowly until Fat Yu's henchmen attack Tang at his home and seriously wound him. During the attempted assassination, Uncle Liu is murdered. The attack forces Tang to regroup and he and his posse, along with Xiao and Shuisheng relocate to an isolated island off the coast of Shanghai. There, Xiao softens up and befriends a peasant woman and her young daughter. She also gives Shuisheng some coins and hopes that one day he can go off on his own and open up his own business.Finally, things come to a head when Shuisheng overhears a muted conversation by thugs hired by Song who plans to murder his boss. Shisheng bursts into a cabin and informs Tang of the plot but it seems that the boss already knows Song has planned to murder him. Song is soon dispatched along with Xiao who is blamed for having an affair with Song. Xiao pleads with Tang to spare the peasant woman's life but he tells her that she knows too much and must be disposed of. The peasant woman's daughter will be taken into captivity and raised to be Tang's new mistress. Meanwhile, Shuisheng tries to attack Tong, enraged that Xiao has been put to death. Tang teaches Shuisheng a lesson by hanging him upside down on the boat and the coins that Xiao gave him fall into the water. Shuisheng will not be opening up any businesses of his own anytime in the foreseeable future!As you can see, there isn't a whole lot of plot to sink your teeth into here. Triad is slow-moving and simply doesn't have a lot of surprises. On the plus side, there's no Hollywood happy-ending as all the protagonists meet an untimely end, either dead or in captivity. The unsentimental ending is meant to illustrate the nature of pre-Communist, urban Chinese society in the 30s, replete with amoral, brutal gangsters such as Tang and self-centered materialists like Xiao, who tragically fails to wake up until it's too late.Shanghai Triad is worth watching mainly for the cinematography and overall style and atmosphere. If you're looking for an in-depth character study, you will not find it here. 'Triad' emulates American gangster pictures but unlike some of the better American efforts, its characters don't have enough idiosyncrasies to draw you in (that includes the mostly mute Shuisheng, who says very little during a good part of the film). 'Triad' is definitely worth watching at least once, but I'd have to think hard about watching it twice.

Of course these interpretations are what makes a movie stand out. I could'nt say what strikes me the most about this film, I only watched it for the violence and nude scenes. I just saw it also as a satire on the teen genre and road movies. They cuss like sailors and have very little empathy for just about everything (with a little exception for the dog they ran over.)The movie has three charactersAmy blue Jordan white Xavier redTheir last names obviously references the American flag so I guess they represent todays American youth.I've read about metaphors about Xavier being a devil and Jordan as an angel fighting over Amy blue who is in interpretation of the human race. I'll admit I didn't look at it that way when I first viewed the film. I just saw it as a straight forward indie film. With exaggerations of American pop culture and a 90's soundtrack.
