While this film is nowhere near as good as its predecessor, it is also nowhere near as bad as it is made out to be. It rollicks along at a great pace and is enormous fun from start to finish. The film is well directed by H.G. Wells' great-grandson Simon Wells and Gore Verbinski, who replaced him for the last 18 days of the shoot as he was suffering from exhaustion. I don't know who directed what scenes so I can't really get specific in my critique but I will say that the direction seemed perfectly consistent. When it comes to the writing, there are a few plot holes but none of them impacted on my enjoyment of the film.Guy Pearce is a very good lead as the time traveller Alexander Hartdegen, even if the character's journey from an eccentric professor to an action hero over the course of a few days - relatively speaking - is a little hard to believe. Samantha Mumba is very natural as his Eloi love interest Mara. One thing that she does very well is deliver the Eloi dialogue as if it were an actual language. The same is true of her real life younger brother Omero as Kalen. He is quite good in the role but, perhaps unsurprisingly, he is at his best in his scenes with his sister. Their chemistry comes through very clearly, particularly in the scene when she comforts him after his nightmare. Jeremy Irons is suitably creepy in his cameo as the Über-Morlock and the film has three strong supporting actors in Mark Addy, Orlando Jones and Phyllida Law. Sienna Guillory is the weakest link but she has only a small role so that's okay. I loved Alan Young's blink and you'll miss it appearance as the florist! I have actually met both Irons and Samantha Mumba and they're both very nice.When it comes to the Eloi and the Morlocks, the film largely lacks the novel and the 1960 film's social commentary but the fact that none of the Eloi are white may have been intended as a commentary on the way that ethnic minorities are and were mistreated, as in the Planet of the Apes films. The first of those is referenced to the Morlocks' hunting of the Eloi. Speaking of which, I loved the design of the Spy Morlocks but I wasn't too gone on that of the Hunter Morlocks. The Über-Morlock's was very good except for his brain stretching down his back, which I thought was a bit silly. The time machine itself is a beautiful design but you can't beat the 1960 version. The CGI was very impressive for its time and the time travel effects are one of the highlights of the film. There are some lovely references to the original film, my favourite being the Über-Morlock aging rapidly and eventually crumbling to dust when outside the machine's temporal bubble. Not sure what the point of relocating the action to New York was though, especially since Jones is the only major American cast member. Incidentally, Alexander's first future pit-stop is May 24, 2030, which will be my 43rd birthday! Overall, the film is a very enjoyable film which is very good as remakes go. I wish that Planet of the Apes (2001), a remake of my sixth favourite film of all time, or Star Trek Nemesis, another 2002 film written by John Logan, were as much fun as this.

Those directors, wonderful as they are, took the normalcies left behind by their filmmaking ancestors and spiced them up, making the familiar suddenly indelible. Tarantino, on the other hand, has never made something familiar to the viewer. His films, though often paying homage to the greatest of the grind house and the sturdiest of the studio system, twist anything even resembling an expectation &#x97; maybe the plots of Tarantino's films have been portrayed in some way or another before, but don't bet that the dialogue, the actors, the dynamics that fill each scene will match anything you've come to know.Pulp Fiction is his most widely adored film, the one where his notable violent tendencies are kept to a comic minimum, the one where his dialogue never rings offensive and his exchanges glow with the smooth wittiness of yesterday's fools. Situations don't play out with the professional easiness of a square that went to film school everything feels as though it were washed and dried by a cinematic nut more fond of staying home Friday nights watching Pam Grier kick ass than going out on the town with slightly drunken friends. Even watching a bad movie was better than experiencing the mundanities of life, because bad movies, bad as they were, took them away from the troublesome thing called reality.And so Pulp Fiction is a stew of cinematic wonders, some sexy, some funny, some tragic, some bloody &#x97; like the sordid comic books of the same name, there's unrelenting sleazy appeal to be found among the campy ruins. But the film is more than camp it's radical noir, thunderously romanticized, delirious in its aesthetical violence. Tarantino doesn't just film his actors, his scenes he falls in love with them, clinging on to their every move, making even the smallest of a detail, of a character, seem enormous in their connection to the overall buoyant picture. Tiny intricacies, such as the way John Travolta casually corrects Uma Thurman when she refers to all the waitresses at Jack Rabbit Slim's as Marilyn (one is Monroe, yes, but the others are actually schlockily dressed like Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield), says much about Tarantino's filmmaking personality. As much as he loves the icons and movies the general public refers to as masterpieces, he can't help himself from putting the underdogs on a pedestal and letting them shine, even if it's for a blink &#x97; because Pulp Fiction is directed by a cinephile who appreciates everything about cinema, not just the conventional Oscar nymphos. There's something about the film that still seems as dangerous as it did in 1994 &#x97; there has always been daring auteurs in the slippery slopes of Hollywood, but exciting is the way that Tarantino pushed, and continues to push, boundaries, making madness seem mainstream, luminous.Stories intertwine in a fashion reminiscent of 1956's The Killing, time hopping yet staggering in its ability to complete each other's sentences. Pulp Fiction follows an assortment of characters, all connected assassins Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), powerful gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), his wife, the chic, cocaine addicted Mia (Uma Thurman), washed up boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis), and bank robbers Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth). How they are associated I cannot say (it would ruin the genius of Tarantino's screenplay). But each character, so well drawn and so flawlessly portrayed (the actors are excellent, their characterizations already iconic in some shape or form), is unforgettable.Look at the way Vincent covers up his lack of smarts with his ability to go from agreeable to brutal in a matter of seconds; how Jules can enjoy the taste of a hamburger while ready to commit a hit because he's too damn used to killing; how Mia can make the mere smoking of a cigarette bolster the same sexy power of Ava Gardner or Louise Brooks; how Butch is willing to risk he and his girlfriend's (Maria de Medeiros) life for a watch passed (with disturbing fervor, I might add) on through generations; how Honey Bunny and Pumpkin don't think about the risks of robbing a restaurant because life is short and sin is fun.Even the most despicable of characters participate in conversation so complex and blackly hilarious we can hardly help but side with them. Tarantino doesn't just write characters; he lives vicariously through them, as if he kept them locked inside his mind until it became time to write the screenplay. Among the finest scripts ever written, startling is how confident every line is, how well the performers deliver each sentence. Pulp Fiction is a near perfect film, and though I prefer Kill Bill, one can hardly deny the genius of Tarantino. How many directors create worlds as simultaneously grimy, cool, dangerous, humorous, appealing, as he does? If you can name five others, I'll have to take your word for it and revoke mine.

The movie starts off very confusing but interesting which drags you into the main character, John Murdoch, who has lost his memory but we never know how. The movie then leads you to an unexpected journey which reveals to you small clues and patterns that would eventually leads to a complete enigma.I am glad that they chose to set the background around the 1950s to 60s. It makes the perfect atmosphere which makes me associate with Zodiac, which is another great mystery\/suspense movie. The vision is stylish and unique even though the whole movie is always dark (as the title). As to the special effects, I love how the director handle his imagination then reflects it into the movie, such as the twisting and moving buildings and the stunning visionary. However, I was quite pulled out a bit once it changes its settings, from suspense to sci-fi, which I somehow find it unrealistic. However, as a whole, the special effects are wonderful for the sake of being the movies produced in the late twentieth century.Another reason I love Dark City so much is its originality. You can actually see many miniatures of suspense masterpieces that were later on produced. I definitely see the Matrix, which was released a year after Dark City, and Inception which was released more than a decade! However, Dark City does have similarities to another movie which was another movie released in 1998 and I'm not gonna spoil it to you. As a whole, Dark City is very confusing but mind-bending, which I guess some people who hated it would say that it's a mess. However, I love how the direction of the movie goes. Because the director sets for the audience to explore the movies by themselves, there are always plot twists for the audience to experience throughout the movie and that's what made it so attracting. It has been so long that I saw a movie as great as Dark City; this movie really gives me chills. It's suspenseful; it's mind-blowing, and absolutely visually stunning (for a movie produced in 1998). I strongly recommend everyone to see this movie; this is one of the best suspense\/mystery\/ sci-fi movie I've seen. If I'm going to set Dark City on the scale in comparison with other mind-blowing movies, this is nearly as good as the Matrix and Inception (though they have better CGI and stuff), and is even better than The Butterfly Effect, Predestination, Interstellar, Triangle, Cube ,and so on.

The movie then leads you to an unexpected journey which reveals to you small clues and patterns that would eventually leads to a complete enigma.I am glad that they chose to set the background around the 1950s to 60s. It makes the perfect atmosphere which makes me associate with Zodiac, which is another great mystery\/suspense movie. The vision is stylish and unique even though the whole movie is always dark (as the title). As to the special effects, I love how the director handle his imagination then reflects it into the movie, such as the twisting and moving buildings and the stunning visionary. However, I was quite pulled out a bit once it changes its settings, from suspense to sci-fi, which I somehow find it unrealistic. However, as a whole, the special effects are wonderful for the sake of being the movies produced in the late twentieth century.Another reason I love Dark City so much is its originality. You can actually see many miniatures of suspense masterpieces that were later on produced. I definitely see the Matrix, which was released a year after Dark City, and Inception which was released more than a decade! However, Dark City does have similarities to another movie which was another movie released in 1998 and I'm not gonna spoil it to you. As a whole, Dark City is very confusing but mind-bending, which I guess some people who hated it would say that it's a mess. However, I love how the direction of the movie goes. Because the director sets for the audience to explore the movies by themselves, there are always plot twists for the audience to experience throughout the movie and that's what made it so attracting. It has been so long that I saw a movie as great as Dark City; this movie really gives me chills. It's suspenseful; it's mind-blowing, and absolutely visually stunning (for a movie produced in 1998). I strongly recommend everyone to see this movie; this is one of the best suspense\/mystery\/ sci-fi movie I've seen. If I'm going to set Dark City on the scale in comparison with other mind-blowing movies, this is nearly as good as the Matrix and Inception (though they have better CGI and stuff), and is even better than The Butterfly Effect, Predestination, Interstellar, Triangle, Cube ,and so on. Please! Everyone go watch this movie even though it looks old and out-of-date just like how I thought before I watched it. I was actually so bored that I was digging from my old files and I glad I did! Dark City definitely worth a try!

This movie didn't turn me around but let's say that it made me stop and change my mind for 128 minutes. I saw it on TV in Spain a couple years go (Valor del Ley is the Spanish title) and I was struck by the majestic beauty of the locations. I also went back and reread the fantastic book upon which the film is based and from which comes every great word of dialogue.The book is narrated in the no-nonsense, straightforward fashion you would expect from a good journalist, as Portis was before he gave it up to write fiction full-time. He has a great ear for dialogue and he obviously researched the speech of the era as there are many phrases and words that are now out of use or just impossible to invent. Folks just plain spoke different back then, something Portis was keen on having us hear. Take this little exchangeI don't believe you have fifty dollars, baby sister, but if you are hungry I will give you supper and we will talk it over and make medicine. How does that suit you?I said it suited me right down to the ground.I just don't think you could make up a line like right down to the ground. That Portis was a newspaper reporter shows in his attention to details like this small one (but all details, big and small, are important, of course). I suppose that I take more notice to Portis' ventures in language because I am up to my own eyebrows learning Spanish and I subconsciously am translating everything I hear and read into castellano, as it is called here, mostly. And evidently Portis was a bigger fan of the Duke than I because he wrote the character of Rooster Cogburn with him in mind. The author also had a fair ear for humor of which the novel and both movies abound.I found myself one pretty spring day in Las Vegas, New Mexico, in need of a road stake and I robbed one of them little high-interest banks there. Thought I was doing a good service. You can't rob a thief, can you? I never robbed no citizens. I never taken a man's watch. It is all stealing, said I.That was the position they taken in New Mexico.At least both sets of film makers have enough wisdom to recognize the wisdom in the book.The original movie certainly isn't perfect, not by a long shot. But any criticism of it would be like criticizing the way people talked back in the 1880's. Films are different today, mostly better in my opinion. There are some problems in the 1969 version with some of the side characters and bad acting. The musical score is sometimes bombastic and annoying. The first five minutes which recount the murder of Mattie's father are tiresome and have been wisely excluded in the Coen brothers' remake. More than anything the 1969 movie is absolutely gorgeous from start to finish. The old movie has a better and more satisfying ending than the new one which follows the book more closely. The old movie is pure Hollywood, not always a pejorative, especially in this case.You're too old and too fat to be jumping horses. Well come and see a fat old man sometime.

But before proper testing can be done Caine impatiently pushes forward with experimenting on a human and volunteers himself as the guinea pig. The experiment appears to work and Caine becomes an invisible man, savoring his newfound ability and using it in inappropriate ways. But when the procedure to make him visible again fails, Caine's mind starts to experience side effects that make him violent and dangerous.Essentially an updated version of the Invisible Man story. Not surprisingly, since this is directed by Paul Verhoeven, there is a lot of focus on the sexual aspect of a man becoming invisible. Particularly that he uses his new situation to become a super pervert and rapist. Pretty much every woman in the cast is molested or worse. While the movie doesn't condone these actions, it is obvious that this is the part of the story that fascinates Verhoeven the most. It's kind of icky and exploitative. Kevin Bacon gives a particularly sleazy performance as Caine. Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens are all fine but none of the characters in this are written as relatable or likable. Rhona Mitra has a bit part as Caine's neighbor and victim. I don't believe she had any lines and appeared to have been cast just for how nice her breasts are.Despite the disturbing elements, it's a watchable movie of its type. The special effects are decent given the time in which this was made when CGI was still often spotty. Honestly the most impressive effects aren't that different from the impressive effects of older Invisible Man movies. The second half is probably better than the first. It's essentially 'slasher 101' with Caine going after his colleagues. Yes, it's predictable, but it's well-done and somewhat exciting. Could've done without Jerry Goldsmith's obtrusive generic score, though.

But before proper testing can be done Caine impatiently pushes forward with experimenting on a human and volunteers himself as the guinea pig. The experiment appears to work and Caine becomes an invisible man, savoring his newfound ability and using it in inappropriate ways. But when the procedure to make him visible again fails, Caine's mind starts to experience side effects that make him violent and dangerous.Essentially an updated version of the Invisible Man story. Not surprisingly, since this is directed by Paul Verhoeven, there is a lot of focus on the sexual aspect of a man becoming invisible. Particularly that he uses his new situation to become a super pervert and rapist. Pretty much every woman in the cast is molested or worse. While the movie doesn't condone these actions, it is obvious that this is the part of the story that fascinates Verhoeven the most. It's kind of icky and exploitative. Kevin Bacon gives a particularly sleazy performance as Caine. Elisabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, and Kim Dickens are all fine but none of the characters in this are written as relatable or likable. Rhona Mitra has a bit part as Caine's neighbor and victim.

This is the kind of film that really tugs on the heart but in a way that isn't really sad, Edward is just so sweet(even though he looks kind of dangerous), but the whole point here is that we shouldn't judge based on what someone looks like, a nice message and one I feel Burton gets across well.The story actually doesn't move that fast, and although things happen, the location is pretty much just one street all the way through. I found Edward to be the person who makes this funny, his new surroundings gives him such a playground of fun, it makes for great scenes. I think really when it comes to the plot it's hard to talk about it in length as mentioned, this really doesn't move much, although definitely fun though.Johnny Depp is Edward and he portrays him well, at times he can seem shaky but that is the thing, Edward is meant to seem awkward and very scared looking, so Depp get's him off to a tee. With the others in this movie none shine more than Depp which works well as he is the star, the acting isn't all top notch but the cast such as Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, and Alan Arkin give it a good go and all work together well with Depp and the awkward personality he gives off.Tim Burton is truly the man behind this and near all the credit for this needs to go to him, he writes it well but directs it even better, he seems to know exactly what he needs to do and his eye on this is perfect. I think the trademark style of Gothic design coupled with the just overly dark\/light juxtapositions make for an interesting watch, it's the kind of movie that is fairly interesting to look at, it should make most enjoy it, but if not, at least engaged.The emotion that flows through this is very high, I mean Edward isn't exactly the sweetest character ever but it is hard not to like him and he is an extremely intriguing creation too. Again Burton seems to mix that sweet centre with a beautifully dark humour\/story, it of course is a film that the family can all watch, but it still contains those more dark themes in the comedy even, but never to the extreme. Yet again another thing that makes this just awesome is the score, the ever on form Danny Elfman creates a fantastic piece of music and really shows his credentials off well. The way in which the story moves also works well with Elfman's creation, the parts where very little happens but there is a lot of comedy, the score only goes to make this not only more fun, but also create a more emotional experience. All in all this has to rank as one of Burton's best if not right at the top, this is done oh so well and created in a fashion where you just know, this is top quality. It's not in my opinion hard to dislike though, I think many will feel the style is not to there liking and the story for some may be a slight bit dull but in my opinion, they are neither and this finishes with a unique storyline to boot.

And yet somehow just like the first one it is watchable and fun and has this bizarre likable quality to the stars who try so hard and act so serious in such a cheesy movie.

As if we needed more reason to be a cheese-fest, an evil villain is building an army of super-ninjas (who really aren't that super at all and Joe Armstrong still manages to beat up bunches of them.) Its dumb, brainless, takes itself way too seriously and is fun and simple and you'll laugh and cheer despite yourself at the sheer 80's silliness.

The guy has terrible chemistry on screen and is trying to be a superstar in the worst possible way.

After 8 years, he decides going to a hotel where he discovers about her past as a theater actress, but unfortunately she had died after giving him the watch, at that date 8 years in the past.

It's a good and quietly intense way to open up.Theme Song The instrumental theme is very memorable and has a colourful quality to it. Matt Munro croons his way through the end credits version and does a fantastic job.Plot Bond is sent to Istanbul to acquire a decoding device from Russian Tatiana Romanova and help her to defect. However it is SPECTRE behind the scheme as they plan on taking revenge on Bond for killing their operative Dr. No. This is one of the most grounded and possibly best of all the series plots. Bond feels most like a spy in the film as he tries to help Romanova and avoid those who are on his trail. There is a real sense of vulnerability to Bond throughout the mission and the story remains gripping throughout as we await SPECTRE's next move.James Bond Sean Connery grows more into the role in this film and this might be his most accomplished performance. He once again portrays Bond's many different sides without having to compromise and delivers many witty lines with ease, we really believe that he is fearful for his life and he isn't afraid to rough up anyone who might be against him.Bond Girls Former Miss Universe contestant Daniela Bianchi plays Tatiana and does a brilliant job. She comes across as sweet-natured as well as intelligent and is pretty much at the centre of the story. She is no pushover either and her conflicted loyalty is played-up smartly. There is also a real chemistry between her and Bond which makes you get behind the story even more.Villains Lotte Lenya is pitch perfect as SPECTRE number 3 Klebb. She plays Klebb as someone who is uncompromising and vicious when it comes to getting things done. The lesbian undertones and unique climactic fight only add to her character. Robert Shaw is superb as the calm and imposing Red Grant, being possibly the best heavy to appear in the series. He doesn't say much throughout, but Shaw has a great presence and he plays Grant as someone who is always planning his next move. He is also a physical match for Bond which is something that we rarely see. Support Pedro Armendariz really shines as Bond's Turkish counterpart Karim Bey. He has a real likability that makes you warm to the character quickly. He brings plenty of charm to proceedings and throughout the film it is made clear that he has a large amount of respect for Bond. Bernard Lee is enjoyable once again as M. Action There's plenty of exciting action scenes here. The truly brutal train fight between Bond and Grant remains one of the series best. Every blow looks like it hurts and the sloppy aggressiveness makes you think that's what a fight to the death would be like, while the dark lighting only adds to the atmosphere wonderfully. The shootout at the gypsy camp is a good set-piece, while the climax has both a North By Northwest inspired helicopter attack and a battle on a lake that are both very entertaining.Score John Barry delivers another excellent score. He varies his sound a little more and creates some really memorable melodies. He is a composer that knows what is needed for certain scenes, he is always spot on at building tension or being the backdrop to some thrilling action parts.Production Values As said one of the films strongest aspects is its tone. This feels like a pure spy film and crafts the perfect atmosphere for that, only The Living Daylights would come close to having the same feel. Young's direction is again quite simple and it works to the films advantage, drawing the audience into this adventure. Istanbul looks beautiful on screen and the scenes on board the Orient Express have a real elegance to them, very little blue screen work is done and even when it is it looks pretty realistic. The editing and pacing is very impressive too, despite a lot of dialogue heavy scenes the film never gets boring or feels like its rushing important areas. We also get the first involvement of Blofeld too.Conclusion From Russia with Love is easily one of the best films in the whole series. I think it is the grounded tone that makes it such a pleasing piece and gives it something of a unique edge, this is Bond in pure spy mode. Every key area of the film is done to near perfection as Connery is terrific, Romanova is interesting, the villains are memorable and the action is simply outstanding. Even the quite straight-forward story is really engaging and keeps things moving along an enjoyable pace. This is Bond at its most real and most daring, keeping things gritty whilst giving the audience the all-out action that it craves.

Bond feels most like a spy in the film as he tries to help Romanova and avoid those who are on his trail. There is a real sense of vulnerability to Bond throughout the mission and the story remains gripping throughout as we await SPECTRE's next move.James Bond Sean Connery grows more into the role in this film and this might be his most accomplished performance. He once again portrays Bond's many different sides without having to compromise and delivers many witty lines with ease, we really believe that he is fearful for his life and he isn't afraid to rough up anyone who might be against him.Bond Girls Former Miss Universe contestant Daniela Bianchi plays Tatiana and does a brilliant job. She comes across as sweet-natured as well as intelligent and is pretty much at the centre of the story. She is no pushover either and her conflicted loyalty is played-up smartly. There is also a real chemistry between her and Bond which makes you get behind the story even more.Villains Lotte Lenya is pitch perfect as SPECTRE number 3 Klebb. She plays Klebb as someone who is uncompromising and vicious when it comes to getting things done. The lesbian undertones and unique climactic fight only add to her character. Robert Shaw is superb as the calm and imposing Red Grant, being possibly the best heavy to appear in the series. He doesn't say much throughout, but Shaw has a great presence and he plays Grant as someone who is always planning his next move. He is also a physical match for Bond which is something that we rarely see. Support Pedro Armendariz really shines as Bond's Turkish counterpart Karim Bey. He has a real likability that makes you warm to the character quickly. He brings plenty of charm to proceedings and throughout the film it is made clear that he has a large amount of respect for Bond. Bernard Lee is enjoyable once again as M. Action There's plenty of exciting action scenes here. The truly brutal train fight between Bond and Grant remains one of the series best. Every blow looks like it hurts and the sloppy aggressiveness makes you think that's what a fight to the death would be like, while the dark lighting only adds to the atmosphere wonderfully. The shootout at the gypsy camp is a good set-piece, while the climax has both a North By Northwest inspired helicopter attack and a battle on a lake that are both very entertaining.Score John Barry delivers another excellent score. He varies his sound a little more and creates some really memorable melodies. He is a composer that knows what is needed for certain scenes, he is always spot on at building tension or being the backdrop to some thrilling action parts.Production Values As said one of the films strongest aspects is its tone. This feels like a pure spy film and crafts the perfect atmosphere for that, only The Living Daylights would come close to having the same feel. Young's direction is again quite simple and it works to the films advantage, drawing the audience into this adventure. Istanbul looks beautiful on screen and the scenes on board the Orient Express have a real elegance to them, very little blue screen work is done and even when it is it looks pretty realistic. The editing and pacing is very impressive too, despite a lot of dialogue heavy scenes the film never gets boring or feels like its rushing important areas. We also get the first involvement of Blofeld too.Conclusion From Russia with Love is easily one of the best films in the whole series. I think it is the grounded tone that makes it such a pleasing piece and gives it something of a unique edge, this is Bond in pure spy mode. Every key area of the film is done to near perfection as Connery is terrific, Romanova is interesting, the villains are memorable and the action is simply outstanding. Even the quite straight-forward story is really engaging and keeps things moving along an enjoyable pace. This is Bond at its most real and most daring, keeping things gritty whilst giving the audience the all-out action that it craves.
