I thought The Holy Grail was overrated and I didn't really understand what was so funny. I have to say this second instalment is a lot funnier, well in my eyes anyway.Brian (Chapman) is born on Christmas Day, the same day Jesus Christ was actually born, not just on Christmas Day. He is nearly mistaken for the Messiah by the Three Wise Men who visit him on the day of his birth, soon realising their mistake they leave and take their gifts with them and deliver them to the actual Messiah, Jesus Christ, who has been born next door.Thirty years later and Brian has grown up to be just a normal man whilst Jesus is everyone's saviour. During this time hatred for the Roman Empire is building and Brian is recruited to help take them down. When he is caught and then escapes custody, he is mistaken for the Messiah once again and must prove he is not the man they believe he is.I had trouble explaining the concept as it certainly isn't overly clear throughout the film but that is not really what the Python films are about. This one does have a better story then Holy Grail but that is not what drives this film on, or any of the Pythons for that matter. It is the pure stupidity and humour that goes on throughout. The humour in the film quite often requires a laugh out loud moment, compared to some comedy films that just get a forced grin. Look out for a hilarious scene involving the name Biggus Dickus. So stupid, silly and immature I know but it had me laughing my head off and that's what I mean by these films, they are so stupid and unbelievable you have to just take them with a pinch of salt and for the stupid parody that they are.The performances in the film are great. Each actor taking on several roles, with forty roles spread between six actors, each delivering the individual role with perfection and the right amount of humour. Cleese and Gilliam are definite stand outs. The script is excellent, especially the dialogue as let's be honest the film carries no story and no real emotional attachment. It is purely just here to be laughed at and trust me there are several scenes where you will be doing just that. The film is utterly daft and really won't be everyone's cup of tea. The first film certainly wasn't mine but I do believe this one was much better. Many people believe the Pythons are some of the best comedy films ever made, I on the other hand do not. The comedy is funny, not constant but when it comes it comes thick and fast, but I like to engage into a half decent story as well as being made to laugh. I have never understood why these films are rated so highly as they do not have a patch on other parody films bought out. All parodies are stupid but these sometimes take the bit too far. Not far enough however to be banned for blaspheming, which is an absolute joke. The film does not make fun of the story of Christ but of a man born at the very same time and attempting to live during this period and undergoing the same nasty routines that Jesus went through to tell people his beliefs. It is not an outright parody of the man himself.I don't want to get too involved into why people banned this film as I am one who is not a huge fan of the film but one who can watch it once to see what the fuss is all about and then perhaps shelve it to not bother with it again. It is a funny film and did have me laughing and there for I do rate it as an average film but to me it is not the classic comedic masterpiece people worship and praise.

Soon the working woman has other obligations, which doesn't sit too well in the business world so she's forced out into the country. It's easy to see why this comedy became such a hit and continues to gather new fans each and every year. After all, you have some funny moments, a great performance by Keaton and you've got a cute child making cute faces. The word cute is the best thing to call this film because the screenplay is rather predictable and always goes for the obvious joke but this can be overlooked simply because of how great Keaton is. I think this film is the perfect example of something not being able to work had it not been for the actor in charge. If you take Keaton out of this movie then you've got absolutely nothing because the actress is just so convincing in the part that you can't help but love her. Keaton perfectly nails the working woman she plays early on as that toughness is something you'd never question. The actress has made a career of playing strong women so it shouldn't come as any shock that she handles the part here. She's also extremely funny with her comic timing and especially the stuff early on with getting used to the baby but also later in the film as she begins to crack in the country. The supporting players are also strong with Sam Shepard playing a kind-hearted country vet, Harold Ramis as a jerk who doesn't like kids and we even get vet Pat Hingle in a nice role. A young James Spader also appears playing what he plays best and that's a snake in the grass. Charles Shyer's direction handles the material quite well and he certainly keeps the movie going at a nice pace. I think the biggest problem is the actual screenplay, which hits every single note that you'd expect it too and the ending is just something you'll see coming from a mile away. BABY BOOM is certainly flawed but Keaton's performance is so great that she makes the film worth viewing.

Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) finds herself disgraced after a drug raid goes horribly wrong and she's left out to dry. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), the fourth victim of Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins), is offering a reward for the escaped maniac so that he can deliver some vengeance. To call this one of the most disappointing sequels in the history of cinema really wouldn't be going too far but you really can't blame anyone involved with the production of the film. I think 100% of the blame must go to the Thomas Harris novel because even David Mamet couldn't bring this thing to the screen. I think Jodie Foster made the right choice in refusing to take part in this film for a number of reasons. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that the story is just so stupid that it's really hard to take it very serious. The entire stuff dealing with Lector being in Italy doesn't make for any drama as there's no suspense, you don't care about any of the supporting characters and in reality everything is just so blandly done story wise that you don't really get drawn into any of the events. Even the stuff with Starling is pretty boring as we see she's fallen on hard times yet we never really get to feel anything for her character outside of what we know about her from the first movie. This sequel really doesn't try to expand on the character outside of us being told and shown what events have happened to her over the past few weeks. The original film really dove into her character and we got a full idea of what shaped her life. You'd expect this film to take that and go somewhere new with it but we're given nothing. After the brilliance of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS it's just shocking to see how far this film falls. What's worse is that 1991 masterpiece really delivered two of the most memorable characters in film history but this sequel makes them rather dull and lifeless. Whereas the first film went for suspense this one here seems more happy to just try and shock the viewer with outrageous gore scenes. I love horror movies and gore but whenever there's so much of it it's usually covering for the lack of something else. The gore scenes are all extremely graphic but they're well-made and you can't help but think that director Ridley Scott was trying to pay homage to the Italian gore films of the 80s. Performances are all rather mixed but Oldman comes off the best as the messed up loony searching for Lector. Hopkins is pretty good too but I think it's safe to say that the character was much more chilling when locked up. I found Moore to be rather boring in the part as she isn't able to bring any life to it but I'm willing to say that a majority of the blame can go towards the screenplay. Even Ray Liotta is wasted in his part. The ending has become a firestorm for controversy and you can add me to the list that feel it's just stupid. HANNIBAL might look good but sadly it's a complete miss on everything that made the original so great.

I think Jodie Foster made the right choice in refusing to take part in this film for a number of reasons. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that the story is just so stupid that it's really hard to take it very serious. The entire stuff dealing with Lector being in Italy doesn't make for any drama as there's no suspense, you don't care about any of the supporting characters and in reality everything is just so blandly done story wise that you don't really get drawn into any of the events. Even the stuff with Starling is pretty boring as we see she's fallen on hard times yet we never really get to feel anything for her character outside of what we know about her from the first movie. This sequel really doesn't try to expand on the character outside of us being told and shown what events have happened to her over the past few weeks. The original film really dove into her character and we got a full idea of what shaped her life. You'd expect this film to take that and go somewhere new with it but we're given nothing. After the brilliance of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS it's just shocking to see how far this film falls. What's worse is that 1991 masterpiece really delivered two of the most memorable characters in film history but this sequel makes them rather dull and lifeless. Whereas the first film went for suspense this one here seems more happy to just try and shock the viewer with outrageous gore scenes. I love horror movies and gore but whenever there's so much of it it's usually covering for the lack of something else. The gore scenes are all extremely graphic but they're well-made and you can't help but think that director Ridley Scott was trying to pay homage to the Italian gore films of the 80s. Performances are all rather mixed but Oldman comes off the best as the messed up loony searching for Lector. Hopkins is pretty good too but I think it's safe to say that the character was much more chilling when locked up. I found Moore to be rather boring in the part as she isn't able to bring any life to it but I'm willing to say that a majority of the blame can go towards the screenplay. Even Ray Liotta is wasted in his part. The ending has become a firestorm for controversy and you can add me to the list that feel it's just stupid.

That's good in my opinion.It viewed some where between documentary and romantic fairy tale. Maybe to many, the latter choice would be more appropriate. I'd place Sicilian, Salvatore Giuliano or Lambert's portrayal smack in the middle. That's because even after doing much research I'm still not sure who the real character was. Probably, no one really knows for sure.The plot moves along fine except for the opening flashback from Turturro's cell. Cimino should have axed the scene first cut. The inclusion of the American governess did not help the story line either. In fact, she, the actress gave an unconvincing and unflattering portrayal of Americans (the rich ones) living abroad. At times she swore like a trooper. Most of the film she sounded and looked like a hooker in communist garb, designer that is. I was so glad when she fell off the reel.The rest of supporting cast was complementary. Giuliano's accomplices were good enough and just bad enough to add intrigue. Even the crotchety old professor was a good fit as interlocutor between Giuliano, his loyal band of unhappy bandits, the fickle mob and the stripe changing church.The film's one weakness is the behind the scene's love affair between the Mafia Don and Giuliano.

What is it about bargain basement special effects like UFOs flying around on strings or actors lumbering around as they pretend to be aliens\/monsters with bad makeup jobs in rubber suits that is so incredibly entertaining? While Battlefield Earth is nowhere near THIS cheap-looking, it might as well be.Yes, Travolta is a devout Scientologist. Yes, Scientology mastermind L.

Yes, the movie studio backing this atrocity went belly up. Even if the backstory behind this movie weren't so laughable, this film would still be every bit the unintentional comedy that it is.We start off with an overuse of tilted camera angles and screen wipes. If that weren't bad enough, the camera tilts shift back and forth. It's enough to make a person seasick and give those who have a strong stomach a case of whiplash. Almost all the Psychlo scenes seem to have been shot through a blue filter. The lasers fired from the Psychlos' guns would look cheap in a Super Nintendo game and one character meets his death by being tossed into a green screen... I mean, off a cliff, sorry.The special effects and camera work are bad, sure, but the real failure of this movie is the plot. The plot is so bad it almost deserves a review of its own. The prologue sets up a crushing defeat by the human race at the hands of the aforementioned Psychlos. That's not where the badness begins. It's what happens AFTER.We start off with a human race that has apparently forgotten all of their history almost reverting back to a caveman state. Our bland hero, Johnny, is informed that his dad died offscreen and he gives a big NO. Whoop-dee-doo. He decides to go off hunting with some other friends where they attack... obstacles from a miniature golf course. Just when you think you can't take anymore, the Pyschlos capture them and take them off to indentured servitude. Are we really supposed to believe humanity completely forgot its entire past just because their planet was taken over? Sometime later we are introduced to our main antagonist John Travolta. He deserves special mention because he is easily the best and the worst thing about this movie. His hammy acting elevates this movie from boring obscurity into campy romp. The movie constantly reminds you he is this ruthless, cunning, and highly intelligent security officer yet he acts and speaks like he's doing bad Shakespeare. His scenery-chewing performance will have you in stitches. He even bumps his head on the ceiling in one scene like some sitcom dad. The other Psychlos seem to laugh at and torment him too so how are WE supposed to take him seriously? While his performance and costume are enough to undermine the threat his character poses, the script does him one better by making him the biggest imbecile in the galaxy. He teaches the most rebellious slave how to speak their language, operate their equipment and read and write. He takes the guy to an old library to educate him on the downfall of the civilization that his people had long forgotten. He seems painfully unaware of Fort Knox as a source for gold and doesn't catch on that the humans are bringing in gold from somewhere else when they hand it to him in perfectly shaped bars. Why does he want gold anyway? The only use for it seems to be jewelery. I guess a man dressed as gaudy as he needs some bling. Yet we're supposed to buy that his people conquered us in, I repeat, nine minutes.As the film builds to the inevitable rebellion climax, it becomes a contest of how ridiculous the plot can get. A man detonates a bomb on the Psychlo dome on Earth to asphyxiate the ammonia-breathing aliens (I think they breathe that, who cares...) but neglects to consider that hundreds of pounds of falling metal and broken glass will probably crush to death the humans still inside. All the while, five humans are flying in 1000-year old harrier jets which they mastered in days and are in exceptionally pristine condition... and they win! Another man teleports to planet Psychlo and manages to blow up the ENTIRE planet with a bomb barely larger than a suitcase.I will admit that for all the heat Travolta took over this movie, he's practically the only thing that makes it watchable though Forrest Whitaker has a few moments. Maybe not in the way he intended, but he's so much fun that you'll be fast forwarding through the boring human rebellion scenes just to get back to him. His performance is both funny and sad. You can tell it's clear that he had high hopes for this movie. They even end it on a sequel hook.Maybe in the year 3000, Travolta.

I guess I can recommend it as a date flick because it's not only romantic, but also romantic... in the larger sense. If you like a good story and intelligent dialog you'll dig Mumford.It cleverly interweaves trenchant and even poignant characterizations and scenes with carefully directed, measured comic punch.This is one of the best film shills for psychoanalysis I've ever seen. I know Mumford makes light of the professionalism of Western shrinks, but I think there's an important message here for people who are seeking professional help.

However these movies increasingly became small-scale personal dramas, emphasising the human stories within the struggle. And this did not have to be at the expense of their message. In the 1983 picture Silkwood, scripted by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen, we have a story of very real and intimate figures, fighting for issues at the most basic and human level.At this time, casting Meryl Streep for this kind of role was almost a given. Frankly she's never impressed me much &#x96; I often find her performances too calculated, too deliberate in her mannerisms and projection. There are still touches of that here, especially in the scene where here house is stripped, but for the most part Silkwood finds her at her most relaxed and natural. Co-star Kurt Russell on the other hand spent most of the 80s as big dumb action star, but here he is surprisingly believable and even sensitive. Cher, a long-established personality but still a relative newcomer to acting, has the most effortless performance, full of easygoing personality, eventually revealing an emotional fragility. Her scene on the swing bench with Streep shows an incredibly moving rapport between the two women.This was something of a comeback picture for director Mike Nichols, who after massive acclaim in the 60s had since suffered a string of flops. He still has the lateral thinker's approach that won him awards in his youth, but now it is more refined, less obtrusive. In Silkwood long takes are the norm, the camera either completely still or panning to follow an actor around the set. And, at a time when close-ups were becoming increasingly common, Silkwood is almost entirely in long- or mid-shot, sometimes with a barrier between us and the action, such as the scenes at the plant from within the equipment. It is almost as if we are looking in on the events, people-watching in effect. It gives the movie a strange sense of realism, and an impression that we are powerless to help as things unfold before our eyes. When we do finally get a close-up, as in Streep's goodbye to Russell, it is all the more effective for its rarity.In reality, there is no conclusive evidence to say whether or not Karen Silkwood's death was murder. And this telling of her life makes no definitive statement either. But what it does is show us Karen Silkwood as a real woman who lived, loved and struggled, and who should be remembered for who she was and what she did.
