The movie is 77 minutes, consisting of a story which is repeated twice, with different events which modify the ending decidedly in each repeat. The story is stupid, quite simply, and totally confusing. Manni, Lola's boyfriend, is a criminal in need of 100,000 DM (ca. $50,000) because he accidentally left this money (which he was supposed to hand over to his boss) in a subway. Now he's desperate because he know he'll die if he can't get the money within about 20 minutes. Too bad if you're a criminal!The movie is stupid because there is no explanation to the three parts. You're simply left to yourself to figure out what sense this all makes. In the end, you have seen three movies, so to speak, and then you can choose for yourself which part, which ending, you like best. The movie is totally hectic, jumbled, chaotic, wild, with lots of weird background music, and when you've finished watching, you'll ask yourself, So what's the point to all of this? I wish I hadn't listened to those many good reviews when I decided to buy this tape!Oh well. The best part about the movie is that it's over after 77 minutes. A total waste of money and time. Buy something else.

I have to admit that I am stumped over the love many people have for this trilogy of books.  I plowed my way through The Hobbit, and have been trying to read Fellowship for about a year.  Never made it past the Council of Elrond.  Maybe I would have more of an appreciation if I read these books as a kid.  The main problem I have with this story is that there is no suspense.  You always know that someone or something is going to show up and save the day.  But I decided to see the movie anyway, because everyone I knew raved about it.  Plus, I did want to find out what happened at the end, since I could never make it through the book.So, today I wasted three hours watching this horrendously boring movie.  I first looked at my watch about 45 minutes in, and looked at it every fifteen minutes for the rest of the movie.  I would've left, but I paid $9 and I kept thinking that it had to get better.  What's the problem?  Where do I begin...1.  No character development, as in the books.  Who cares what happens to these guys?  Not me.  I was rather thrilled each time Frodo was stabbed, because I kept hoping maybe he'd die and throw a twist in the story.  Nope. 2.  The plot is based on the following  travel, battle, Frodo thinks he can't do it, someone tells him how important it is for him to do it, travel, battle, Frodo thinks he can't do it, someone tells him how important it is for him to do it, etc., etc., etc.  Can you say boring?  Furthermore, they never seemed to have any trouble during the battle scenes.  I don't know, but those bad guys looked pretty tough.  Doubtful that this goofy group could beat them.  3.  Cheese factor is very high.  Example  Arwen  Do you remember the first time we met?  Aragon  I thought I had strayed into a dream.  Gag me.  The rest of the dialogue is equally as corny.  The women's voices (Arwen and Cate Blanchett) have a weird echo around them.  Also lots of slow motion\/close up scenes, that are supposed to tell us how the character is feeling, but instead are laughable.  4.  The music was specifically placed to inform the audience when a dramatic moment was occurring.  Without the music, it's doubtful we would have known, since the story simply kept repeating itself.  With the repeat, it was difficult to know when a big thing was happening vs. a little thing.5.  8 people have the power to kill an army of bad guys.  This doesn't bother me in Star Wars, but it bothered me here, especially since the Hobbits have no fighting skills.6.  Stereotypical characters who mess things up and get the group into more trouble.7.  Too long.  Way too long.  Scenes were dragged out for much too long, for emotional impact.  This movie simply never felt like it got moving.  When the first credit came onto the screen, I ran out of that theatre.  Couldn't wait for this movie to end.      I will never watch this movie again, nor will I return to see the rest of the installments.  Once was enough for me.  Huge disappointment.
