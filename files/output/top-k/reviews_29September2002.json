Bertolucci spends tons of money and showcases opulence on a epic scale to tell the story of a man who descended into anonymity, who journeyed from greatness into cypher-dom, who make terrible decisions and was guided by selfish desires.  The greatness of The Last Emperor is in that question; Bertolucci taunts and challenges his audience to digest the once-lived visuals, the pomposity of the circumstance and realize life's absurdity and folly.  The Last Emperor is a religious allegory, but instead of raising religion on a pedastal, Bertolucci mocks God and religion, ultimately praising humanism, as portrayed in the final shots, as an older, educated Pu Yi shares the only lasting joy and wonderful memory of his childhood, the grasshopper.Vittorio Storaro brings as much to the design of this film as Ferdinando Scarfiotti, masterfully working bold strokes of color to emphasis the film's emotion.  The contrast of Italian imagery with Eastern subject is a fantastic dissonance few filmmakers can successfully achieve.  The modern air these characters breathe lends credibility to Peploe's screenplay human characters caught in the turmoil of intrigue and impending death always react in an amoral way, justifying their brutality as survival. Many of the supporting characters, while never gaining audience empathy, defend the argument of their actions of drug-abuse, treachery, and psychological cannibalism.Sexual frankness is always a element to Bertolucci's films and his restraint here is both sensual and offensive.  Brando sodomizes with butter, but the three-way here is performed under opaque silk, lending it a more sensual air, but shields us from forbidden, exotic sex.  Is the Orient still taboo? Must we only be privy to the hairy, primal animalistic behavior of European sexuality, and not voyeurs into the smooth, delicate moves of another region's sexual play?  It is a surprising move from such an erotically provocative director, and while one may actually blame Puttnam's regime (the releasing studio was Columbia Pictures) for the censorship, Bertolucci's artistic power should have won the argument.As a stand-alone work of art, discounting the crass nine Oscars and its piddling box office stature, this film is harmed by its use of flashback, a contrived device to show off symbolism and color, more than an indictment of the infant regime educating war criminals.  It doesn't know where to take this guilty verdict, as the film ends during the cultural revolution, depicting the never-ending flip-flopping of political ideologies.  Would it have been more powerful to unravel the linear story line from epic to personal?  It will forever remain unanswered.Joan Chen is an exciting presence, and with this film, proves herself one of the most beautiful woman in the world.  John Lone is adequate in the title role, but is intimdated by Bertolucci's direction.  While passionate as a child, the character's battles become more internal and do not register. As a device, it supports the thesis of the character, but as a performance it loses the audience's interest.  We become more fascinated with the cruelty of the household than the political intrigues that forced Pu Yi's hand to the Russians. A more defiant Lone may have struggled with Bertolucci, but the result would have been a more fascinating portrayal.Despite criticism, this remains a film that must be viewed in letterbox and in surround sound (if possible).  Its title sequence alone is worth the price of admission and is a hell of a precursor to the experience one has watching this film.  The score (credited to three composers), is melodramatic and luscious, working our emotions and exhilirating the piece. It is gorgeous and enhances our experience.

But The Tailor of Panama is an unpleasant novel, riven by the widening divergence between the author's superb skills at observation and characterization, and his post-Cold War loss of moral bearings and common sense. Listen up, David just because some American officials are louts, does not make America and Americans the bad guys of the planet.Conventional wisdom calls Le Carré a 'spy' novelist, but this is not the whole picture. He is really a 'con man' novelist, fascinated by smart self-destructive psychopaths whether they be spies or not. Yet his most interesting and sympathetic characters, notably George Smiley, are the professional spies who are con men only on the job; when they go off duty they at least try to care about some person or thing. The Tailor of Panama has no such sympathetic character for us to identify with. Maybe the author cared about the self-invented tailor, Harry Pendel, whose whole life is a lie, but I never could. In the film, Geoffrey Rush does a fine job of bringing Harry to life, but this is not enough to carry the movie.* possible spoilers follow *Director John Boorman's biggest mistake was choosing to film this depressing and sordid tale in the first place. He seems to have acknowledged this by discarding the entire climax and ending of the book, substituting a sweet dab of Hollywood-style vanilla icing for Le Carré's apocalyptic conflagration. Yes, it would have been a hateful and horrifying movie with the book's ending, but it is a grimly depressing  novel, whose principal redeeming feature is that the con-man tailor ultimately takes responsibility for the horrendous damage he has done (or does he choose death merely to avoid taking responsibility one last time?). In the movie's endings (including the alternatives on the DVD), both the damage and the redemption are watered down to inconsequence, so the whole film winds up as nothing more than a pointless caper. Pierce Brosnan tries hard to be Osnard, but only succeeds about half the time. He is not wantonly cruel enough in detail to make his larger cruelties plausible. Osnard is an intelligence operative for whom getting to hurt and humiliate people is a fringe benefit of being an agent runner, and inflicting pain and degradation is the main interest he has in sex, as well. Perhaps there was insufficient money in the budget to keep re-shooting scenes until Brosnan got the nuances right in all of them, but in those scenes which he does get right, he is genuinely scary.Hmm...
