It's a very powerful film in its own right and conveys the feelings of pretty much every college graduate. Being almost a college graduate myself, I was really able to connect with this film. There are not many characters presented in this film, but that only adds to Benjamin Braddock's feelings of loneliness.One of the first scenes in the movie focuses on Benjamin sitting in front of an aquarium. My eye first went to the scuba diver at the bottom of the tank and how alone it looked even though it was surrounded by fish. Later in the movie Benjamin appears in a very similar scuba outfit as his parents are coercing him to get into the pool. He too seems very much alone in this scuba outfit, for he cannot hear what they are saying to him. Benjamin is literally caught between to worlds. One scene that particularly struck me was when he was holding the door open at the Taft Hotel. We see swarms of old people passing him. They are already done with their lives as Benjamin holds the door open for them to pass. This image was interesting to see in reference to the film. It seems as though Benjamin will never reach this phase of his life, but he is at a point where he needs to make a decision.This film was revolutionary in its time, but to the modern viewer seems very tame. We never actually see Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson having sex, but we see them before and after. The quick flashes they use to express the fact that Mrs. Robinson is naked seem very odd but I'm sure that it was quite revealing for the time. Another technique that seemed unique to this film was how they moved from one scene to the next. Benjamin was often seen in darkness as he moved from his house to the Taft Hotel with Mrs. Robinson. The contrast was quite effective and showed what his summer consisted of. The music that accompanies certain scenes was very effective as well. Simon and Garfunkel seemed like the perfect accompaniment to Benjamin's escapades. At the end, as in the beginning, the song Hello Darkness My Old Friend is playing as Elaine and he ride off on the bus together. This does not seem very indicative of a happy ending, but we can't be sure. We are left to linger on the actual words in the song and wonder what will become of Benjamin Braddock. He still seems to have no idea of what he wants to do or where he wants to end up, but he smiles for what seems like the first time in the film. Another moment where music was used as part of the plot was when Benjamin is driving to stop Elaine's wedding. Here's to your Mrs. Robinson is playing as he drives and then slowly begins to slow down and fade, to an eventual stop. This effect coincides with Benjamin's car as it begins to slow down and eventually die on the side of the road.Christian imagery also has a presence in this film. The most obvious and effective image is when Benjamin reaches the church, but is looking down on the ceremony already in progress. Looking up at him in his white coat illuminated by light with his hands up and to the side, resembles the image of Christ on the cross very clearly. Everything around him is white and what he sees has the effect of a crucifixion. The different techniques this film uses can be seen in many present day films so they don't really stand out as new or different, but realizing that this movie is where they probably came from makes it that much more impressive to watch. Not only is the film well acted, but it is also well filmed and directed.

My boyfriend described it as Blue Velvet filmed by the Farrelly brothers and I think that is an excellent description. My problem with this film is that it sets up its premise so exquisitely in the beginning - Renee Zellweger trapped in a waitressing job that she can actually do in her sleep, who watches her favorite soap so zealously that she can pour coffee while staring at the screen. As we follow her around in a day we begin to realize how desperately she is trying to keep going by losing herself in a false positivity sustained by soap opera platitudes, but that these are becoming increasingly more difficult to apply to her sad life and bad marriage. As she soldiers on through the day, more and more things unravel around her, so that by the time she witnesses the brutal murder of her husband, she is completely consumed by her imaginary world. Up to this point, Zellweger balances the tension of her delusional positivity with a buried sadness that is so delicate, when it comes out every once in a while, it is heartbreaking to see. Then LaBute just abandons ship with her and launches into a road trip movie that loses all dramatic tension by creating extremely cartoonish interactions and characterizations that do not come into balance again until Bette meets up with her soap opera star at a charity event. The scene where Bette introduces herself to the writer and some of the cast of the soap opera A Reason to Love is one of the best balancing acts of conflicting views of reality I have ever seen on screen. But once again LaBute abandons Bette to one-dimensionality so he can rush over to the Grand Canyon for yet another badly written scene where Morgan Freeman is trying to have a conscience and Chris Rock is just trying to get the job done. The point at which I got anything out of their interaction with each other was the point at which Chris Rock decided to stop acting and just start doing his foul-mouthed comedy routine. Finally there seemed to be some spark and life to their relationship, and the road trip aspect started to pick up for me. I feel like Mr. LaBute is very good at theatrical manipulation of audience expectation, but not so adept at filmic flow and continuity. I am glad he exists, and the film was very interesting and very watchable, but I think he still has a lot to learn about how to create and sustain a convincing oddball reality throughout the duration of a feature length film.You can't have intermissions in a modern movie theatre, but I felt as if there were intermissions in this film, that plot lines would ebb and flow like tides until each character was plucked out of the group and given meaning. Perhaps this would have been best done as a play first, and then the ensemble cast rounded up to do the film.

Point being,you have to do for yourself in this world because,not everyone will help you all the time. It almost makes you wish today's school problems were this easy to handle. Along with Fast Times At Ridgemont High And The Breakfast Club,I wish all movies about teens in the 1980's had been this good,instead of the more mindless teen-sex films that I found very insulting to my intelligence!

I ran up to my room and covered myself with my b l a n k y until my sister came up to me and said that the big bad ugly wolf was gone. Also today, aged 17, I refuse to look at Gmork.

It won 11 Academy Awards, tying it with Ben-Hur for the most one by any single movie. It was nominated for 14 Oscars. It had another 76 wins and 47 nominations.The acting was great; not wonderful; but still very good in every sense of the word. Not only by Kate and Leonardo, but many people on the cast that were overshadowed by the stars. Gloria Stuart gives a heart-breaking performance in her return to the screen. Victor Garber portrayed Thomas Andrews, and did a magnificent job, his best scene being the meeting between Ismay, EJ Smith, and himself; Andrews declaring Titanic will founder. The main story in itself is one that has been told a million times over. A poor boy and a rich girl meet by chance and soon fall in love, but her parents will not allow it because of social order. Titanic has one thing going for it as it tells this story, the backdrop of history and tragedy tied into one as the lovers meet on the ill-fated ship Titanic. We are introduced to Rose De-Witt Bukater, a young woman of society who is engaged to Caledon Hockley, the son of a rich steel tycoon. We find ourselves on Rose's side as she rebels against her mother and Cal, ultimately resulting in a suicide attempt. Fate steps in there, bringing her a savior by the name of Jack Dawson, an artist who wins third class tickets aboard Titanic in a poker match. He persuades Rose not to jump off the back of the ship; telling her that if she jumps, he'll have to go after her.The story is being narrated by Rose Calvert, a woman of 100, who upon seeing a drawing on television decides to contact Brock Lovett, a salvager who is exploring the Titanic. He is the one who found the drawing, and kept it only because he noticed that the woman in the picture is wearing a diamond necklace. Rose and her granddaughter Lizzy are brought upon Brock's ship, where she tells the crew she is the woman in the picture. Brock then tells them the diamond is said to have gone down with the ship, and would be worth more than the Hope Diamond if discovered. Rose says nothing, but starts into her account of what happened during her experience with Titanic.Jack and Rose continue to grow to love after he saves her from death. Rose tries to deny her feelings for him, but can't help herself, despite threats made by both her fiancée and mother. She longs to be like Jack, free and independent; something she has never done before. She tries her hardest to do this, by having Jack draw her nude, wearing only the blue diamond necklace her fiancée Cal bought for her. This is the drawing Brock finds 84 years later. But fate has a twisted hand of cards, making Cal frame Jack into stealing the diamond, and having him being locked away. Rose chooses to believe Cal, but not for long. She soon comes back for him, saving him from being drowned.They continue their race for survival, staying on the ship until the bitter end, despite a gun chase by Cal and his manservant Lovejoy, and Rose choosing to jump off the lifeboat and back onto Titanic for she can't leave Jack behind. It is at this point Rose realizes that she does love Jack, greeting him with the words, You jump, I jump, right? Subsequently they continue trying to stay alive as the glorious ship is destroyed. The band is shown playing their final song, Nearer My God To Thee, making for a emotional montage.Finally, as the ship goes under, Jack ushers Rose to a broken door. It can only hold one of them, and he offers it to her. They listen to the screams until it gets quiet, and Jack realizes that he will die soon. His final words tell Rose to keep on living, not to let herself die. He makes her promise never to give up, and not to let go of that promise. She agrees, saying that she'll never let go. A light appears out of the darkness, and Rose, barely clinging to life, tries to awaken Jack to tell him there's a boat coming back, but there's no use. As she is shocked by his death, she remembers her promise to keep on living, so leaves him there in the ocean, saying once more she'll never let go. Old Rose then speaks of how the 700 saved people floating in lifeboats were waiting, to die, to live, and for an absolution that would never come. It then shows her walking on the deck of Brock's research ship, standing on the railing, to show that she had the diamond Brock had spent three years searching for. Another flashback is here, showing young Rose feeling the pocket of the jacket Cal put on her, feeling in the pocket and pulling out the diamond. Old Rose then looks at the deep blue diamond one more time, then tosses it into the ocean.There are many ways to interpret the ending of the movie. In my opinion, she passes away. Old Rose is seen going to sleep, then cutting to a dream sequence where Young Rose and Jack are reunited on Titanic and then a cut to a bright light. On the DVD, the name of that scene is called A Promise Kept.

Nope, it just gets more political and extremely graphic in detail. Sex anymore isn't hopping into the back seat of a 58' Plymouth and going to work, it's a lot more complicating in modern times. It's a lot more in detail and there's supposed to be closure to it, there's supposed to be an end, but the trick of the whole thing, or I guess the illusion in a lot of peoples minds as there is supposed to be an end, there isn't an end, because it keeps going on more and more and more.This film spoke volumes to me and if you think that Closer or We Don't Live Here Anymore is the signature of extramarital affair movies then your so dead wrong, this is it, this is the movie that puts those movies to shame(or to me it's more of an inspiration, follow the leader, jump on the bandwagon sort of thing).There's one leader in this film, every film has one and his name is Jason Patric. He is cruel, he is repugnant and he is as derogatory as Divine in Pink Flamingos, but only in a sexual represented way. I loved the Book Store scene where he gets rejected by Catherine Keener's character and suddenly flies into his short little tirades and gets emotionally conflicted and then stabs her deep of what she wants to hear, but what she tries to hide which later I think leads to the breakup of Stiller and Keener even though she is using his adultery as an accuse. But that scene alone is enough to watch the movie and watch him walk away with this harsh, malice look on hi face, it's disturbing, but it's funny as he walks out and checks out a woman before he goes. To think that Patric did not even get a Oscar nomination for his performance made me ill, an nomination for a near flawless performance, and all performances has at least one scene in the movie where they give a long speech or they have a timed reaction(Michael Douglas in Wall Street and Helen Hunt in As Good As It Gets are good examples), Patric brought that in the middle of the film with his best sexual experience(which happened to be in high school with another male, even though he is a womanizer, but go figure, I've seen more complicated stuff).I never quite understood Ben Stillers acting, I still say that he plays the same character in every movie, but that's me, I think I sort of ignored him throughout this entire film or pretended that someone else was playing his part, I have to do that time to time or otherwise I'm going to really despise the movie and turn it off.The other leads , Amy Brenneman, Aaron Eckhart and the lovely and astounding Nastassja Kinski(which for the life of me could never understand why she is never nominated or starring in movies) are very convincing in their own trials and tribulations in the movie. I never understood really why Brennemans character is so hard to pleasure in the bedroom or if she carries this guilt for cheating on her husband when, he himself who thinks giving himself pleasure, finds out he is his own best lover, I just really don't identify her character or understand the grievance, but towards the end of the film it all kind of dawns on me and the nature of her game.This movie is slow paced and it's talky, but when I'm in the philosophical moods, these are my favorites and it allures my attention and helps me rationalize my own sexual demons, politics and tastes that I acquire and I think it's safe to say that the days of showing a girl a good time by going to the movies and then out to eat are over.

(pun not intended) This was what struck me about 'In the Line of Fire'. The concept sounded excellent - a grizzled secret service agent (Clint Eastwood), still haunted by memories of his inability to prevent the assassination of President Kennedy is now confronted by another madman (John Malkovich) who also claims he intends to dispatch the current president by force. But of course Clint isn't willing to let Malkovich off the president so easily this time, and becomes even more determined to track down the madman and stop him.But unfortunately, the interesting story didn't turn out nearly as well as an actual film. The film is frequently far too obvious when it should have been much more subtle, when explaining things such as how Eastwood's character reflects on whether he would have been willing to die for Kennedy and Malkovich's character's backstory as to why he wants the president dead so much. These would have worked much better if the filmmakers hadn't tried to beat the audience over the head with these plot points, making them much less interesting. Also, whoever decided to put 63 year old Clint Eastwood in a love scene with 39 year old Renne Russo can only be described as sick and twisted, not to mention the two of them falling in love seems ridiculous due to their age gap. (Clint's best seduction technique seems to be winking every 5 seconds, which gets extremely annoying after a brief while) But apart from the terrible script and oversimplified characters, I was also astonished at for a suspense film how little suspense 'In the Line of Fire' actually contained. Again, the concept of the killer constantly phoning the hero, taunting him with clues and hints as to what he's going to do next must have seemed more original when the film was released in 1993, but for today's audiences, who have seen the concept executed much better in films such as 'Speed' and later 'Phone Booth', it really isn't as interesting as the filmmakers seem to think. And the fight scene at the end between Malkovich and Eastwood was one of the film's greatest letdowns, and seems to mainly consist of rude pushing back and forth. Of course, the absurdly predictable plot leads up to the required happy ending, another eye-roller. Eastwood is completely wasted in the role of aged secret service agent Frank Horrigan, playing off his patented tough guy persona and nothing else. He isn't a complete letdown, but it isn't at all difficult to imagine a more enthusiastic lead for the film. Renee Russo is also given almost nothing to do as the far too young love interest for Eastwood's character, complete with cheesy dialogue (I can't believe I'm doing this!) and all. Dylan McDermott also has almost nothing to do other than yell a lot and look frightened as the necessary young naive partner to Eastwood's grizzled old mentor figure. It's Malkovich as the psychotic assassin who easily steals the film, coming across as genuinely creepy and chilling - his silky voice over the telephone was surprisingly off-putting. Overall, 'In the Line of Fire' comes across as a far too clichéd and predictable weak Hollywood action film and nothing more. There is almost no suspense created in the suspenseful sequences, and all the plot twists are far too predictable to ever be enjoyable. There is the occasional good element present (Malkovich's villain is a plus) but overall, there's no real reason to see In the Line of Fire - there are several other very very similar action movies that turned out much better.-5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2006","score":"6 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" In the Line of FireIt never fails to astound me how a decent premise for a film can be ruined upon execution of it.

And the others, refusing to abandon their comrade, gather up some guns and go right up to him, where....This movie is very famous for its incredible amount of Western violence. And I agree, it's got to be the most gory and violent motion picture of the 60s. And even more than some of the movies today. There is an enormous amount of blood that we see when characters get shot and the way it's portrayed gives out a very destructive atmosphere.

From one scene to the next it was awesome to follow what each character would do next. For example, would Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) really have an affair with a woman twice his age? Is he actually falling for a girl whose mother brought him into maturity? I was asking myself questions like these throughout the film.The opening scene begins with a close up and pulling back shot of the protagonist, Benjamin Braddock. This type of centralizing cinematography seems very useful in elucidating Ben's feelings of being cramped and held in a place he can't get out of. There is an incorporation of pop music as Ben is being moved along a set path by a standing escalator. At this time he is having orders being commanded at him from a loudspeaker and it is truly a metaphor for his life. He is a college graduate who doesn't know what he is doing with his future because it seems he has always been told what to do, and how to do it. This is the film's recurring theme, one of youthful alienation and the feeling of entrapment by society. Benjamin had been living a life of preparation, but hasn't seemed to decide on what he is preparing for. This movie depicts his struggles with breaking free from the life he has been made to think is his, and the challenges of finding his own path to follow.In the beginning, Ben is magnificently melancholy, and the environment of his household only increases his feeling of despair. His parents are overbearingly proud of him, and are waiting on pins and needles to see what he is going to do with his life, but Ben doesn't even feel like he has a life. Then Ben is re-introduced to a family friend, Mrs. Robinson. As an ex-alcoholic seductress, she opens a whole new world to Benjamin, and the way she does it is oh so thrilling to view. She is unbelievably sure of herself, and the means in which she uses her age and figure to solidify her affair with Ben are purely ingenious, and the power she has over him are at times nothing but comedic.Their affair continues throughout the summer, until Ben is faced with a decision that he has sworn to Mrs. Robinson he has already made, to go on a date with her daughter Elaine. Although he tries his best to give her the cold shoulder, love prevails, and he ends up succumbing to his heart. Everything of course falls apart, because who can really have an affair with someone's mother and not think that everything will come to the surface at some point, especially when one of the parties in the affair develops such animosity towards the other. It is at this point where the theme of water really comes to light. Again and again Benjamin finds his escape in water. Whether he is gazing into his fish tank or submerging himself in his pool this theme of escapism is really apparent to the viewer. Ben is incredibly passive aggressive, and water becomes his safe house. Under the water he can hear no one, and he can be truly alone. He escapes all the pressures that are coming down on him, even if it is only for a brief moment.At this juncture in the movie Ben really comes into his own. He makes some rash, yet full hearted decisions, and it is revealed to the viewer that he is finally capable of breaking away and doing what he wants. He breaks through his passiveness and makes the journey to claim his love, Elaine. The final scene is extraordinarily energizing. Benjamin crosses a line of no return, striving for the one he loves to the point of breaking up her marriage ceremony. In one of Dustin Hoffman's most memorable scenes, he takes the dive of putting his entire self on the line, and wins!

Benjamin Braddock is trapped into his life as a college graduate and most of the movie deals with ways in which he escapes this entrapment. Whether it's a torrid affair with his father's law firm partner's wife, or it's the subsequent engagement with said wife and partner's daughter, Ben slowly breaks free from his square family's strict rules of conduct and sets off on his own life's trail. Director Mike Nichols and editor Sam O'Steen (who also edited films like Cool Hand Luke and Chinatown) really tell more of Ben Braddock's story than even Dustin Hoffman does. Let's look at the party scene at the beginning of the film to see some of these images of entrapment created solely by the camera-work. The party begins with Ben alone in his room, and the sounds of the party downstairs can be heard. His room is dark and plainly decorated, and a dartboard hangs quietly on the wall. Ben's father, played by William Daniels, bangs on the door and eventually enters Ben's room to confront his son. He's wondering why a party in honor of the new graduate does not have the graduate in attendance. Ben responds simply that he needs to be alone for a while. The only thing Mr. Braddock can say to convince Ben to come downstairs is that these people at the party have know Ben for most of his life, like Ben owes it to all of them to make an appearance and thank them for always being there, when in reality these people are here more because of their relationships with Ben's parents than they are to support the graduate. Ben's being physically forced by his father to go down to the party, to continue the charade of a life that his parents want him to. All Ben wants, though, is to be alone.The most memorable scene of entrapment though, is Ben's scuba gear incident at his 21st birthday party. His father has forced Ben to put on this ridiculous diving suit and to stand at the bottom of their pool to show his father's guests how the suit works. Ben is trapped into the suit on his birthday, completely against his wishes, and eventually decides to humor his parents by stepping into the pool. Ben then jumps in and looks back at his father. The frame of the camera is now showing the view from the mask of Ben's father, who proceeds to take his hand, cover the mask, and push Ben down under water. It's as if William Daniels is pushing the camera underwater. Brilliant.Later in the movie, after Ben is entrenched in the affair with Mrs. Robinson, Ben's spending his days lounging in the pool when his father confronts him, and we see the following exchange, Mr. Braddock Ben, what are you doing? Benjamin Well, I would say that I'm just drifting. Here in the pool. Mr. Braddock Why? Benjamin Well, it's very comfortable just to drift here. Mr. Braddock Have you thought about graduate school? Benjamin No. Mr. Braddock Would you mind telling me then what those four years of college were for? What was the point of all that hard work? Benjamin You got me.Ben's beginning to break away from his parent's traps. He's meeting Mrs. Robinson at the Taft Hotel every night and not explaining to his parents where it is that he leaves to each night. He's literally doing nothing except having his affair and lounging by the pool, and it's been going on for weeks. Where Ben was trapped in the darkness during the beginning of the film he is now soaking in the sunshine, but still he's trapped. Now it's in a torrid affair with a family friend and in his backyard. He's still within his parent's world, and that conflict of trying to be free in that world, free to sleep with the partner's wife and eventually to court the partner's daughter, his freedom is in a world where he's still just a kid. This will be troublesome as the film progresses. I've not said enough of the editing of Sam O'Steen. Briefly I'll say the montage of Ben moving from his bed to lounging in the pool to laying on top of Mrs. Robinson and back and forth and so on, all set to Simon and Garfunkel's bittersweet symphonies is one of the most well done sequences I've ever seen. The editing tells the story, and that in itself is exciting.The last scene of the film shows Dustin Hoffman ripping a giant gold cross from a church wall, jamming it into the door to stop Elaine and Carl's wedding party from chasing Ben and Elaine on their escape from their parent's world, and then getting onto a community bus, setting off on a lifetime together.

In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom. Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband. Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together. Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond.

However, what made Shakespeare in Love stand out from the rest of them? When I saw Shakespeare in Love, I nearly busted a nut it was a breath of fresh air from the usual love stories that we usually see. It stood apart from the others; a pity, alas, because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry. Today, it all seems to have become show & tell, there-you-have-it, reality-TV presentation.Well, to the footage at hand The legendary Mr. Shakespeare is depicted very well with some human flaws (farting). It is interesting how this early in his career, some events from his later plays found their way into the movie. (Skull from 'Hamlet,' 5.1) (His sorrowful presence at the altar on his knees bears a similarity to Claudius' remorse in 'Hamlet' 3.3) That said, the story flows nicely. King Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth is depicted rather awesomely. (Especially the way her life enables her to feel an understanding for the object of Shakespeare's adoration.) Christopher Marlowe is shown as the already established writer who offers some assistance to Shakespeare's play still in the writing stage. (SIDE NOTE Marlowe's Two Gentlemen of Rapallo, King Lear II, and Massacre At Paris are some wonderful plays to peruse.) John Webster was probably not the monster he is portrayed as, but at least his nature kind of hints at the nature of the plays he would write. (His Duchess of Malfi and The Holy Trout are bloody, but funny.) Ben Affleck is ribald as the Laurence Olvier of the 21st Century.WARNING if you are very serious and boring about your comedies and especially if you like parrot humour, fuzzy kittens, and if you like the movie Mr.Roger's Teatime jokes then DON'T watch this movie. This amount of ribaldry is just too damn much for you...these jokes will just hurt your little head. This movie would have you believe that the Queen would actually sit with the common folk at the Globe Theater!The screenplay for this movie is without a doubt, excellent. To nicely intersperse the story of Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night into this movie, was delightful to behold. My favorite kinds of movies are ones that are based on histrionics, legends, and nostalgia. I am a big fan of comedies that have stupid humor and political humor, like Monty Python and Mel Brooks. This movie had plenty of that. There's just something about hearing jokes in the kind of accent they used that makes them so funny.

If you're in the first group you'll bust your nuts like I did! Coming to the cast, Gwyneth Paltrow did a wonderful job in her role. She definitely deserved the Oscar for the expressions of abawdery she portrayed when enacting on stage as Thomas Kent, while looking wonderful and acting gracefully as Viola. Joseph Fiennes acted great too as Will Shakespeare, and the chemistry between him and Viola was charming. (Hard to believe Fiennes was reportedly soused for much of the filming. He seems rock-steady!) The rest of the cast equally, such as John Cleese, Judi Dench and Colin Firth did a fine job on their roles. Ben Affleck was OK -- the funny thing is that this guy probably took it in the can at fraternity initiations, but still hates all things homosexual.I have an affliction for period piece spoofs but am of the opinion that they could have shown the amazing Nathan Lane more. Hell. I even think Monty Python should adopt Nathan Lane as an official member!FACTIOD Shakespeare in Love is a non-stop laugh-a-thon!. So if you want your spirits lifted, you should watch this masterpiece, as, all in all, there is a zany representation of Elizabethan times, some interesting speculation of historical figures, and some fictional personages as well. So, don't listen to the opinions of some uneducated guy, listen to somebody that KNOWS. Go and BUY this movie, have a little patience at the beginning, 'cause after that, you'll be sure to want to see Yellowbeard, Parrot Sketch Not Included Twenty Years of Monty Python, Monty Python's Secret Policeman's Ball, and Nathan Lane's (Cliff Marlowe)Austin Powers in Goldmember and Monty Python & the Holy Grail in Lego.There is only one thing I have seen that John Cleese was in that I liked more, Starballz.

It is interesting how this early in his career, some events from his later plays found their way into the movie. (Skull from 'Hamlet,' 5.1) (His sorrowful presence at the altar on his knees bears a similarity to Claudius' remorse in 'Hamlet' 3.3) That said, the story flows nicely. King Henry VIII's daughter Elizabeth is depicted rather awesomely. (Especially the way her life enables her to feel an understanding for the object of Shakespeare's adoration.) Christopher Marlowe is shown as the already established writer who offers some assistance to Shakespeare's play still in the writing stage. (SIDE NOTE Marlowe's Two Gentlemen of Rapallo, King Lear II, and Massacre At Paris are some wonderful plays to peruse.) John Webster was probably not the monster he is portrayed as, but at least his nature kind of hints at the nature of the plays he would write.

Ben Affleck is ribald as the Laurence Olvier of the 21st Century.WARNING if you are very serious and boring about your comedies and especially if you like parrot humour, fuzzy kittens, and if you like the movie Mr.Roger's Teatime jokes then DON'T watch this movie.

This movie would have you believe that the Queen would actually sit with the common folk at the Globe Theater!The screenplay for this movie is without a doubt, excellent. To nicely intersperse the story of Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night into this movie, was delightful to behold. My favorite kinds of movies are ones that are based on histrionics, legends, and nostalgia. I am a big fan of comedies that have stupid humor and political humor, like Monty Python and Mel Brooks.

One of the scenes that is most amusing has Governor Stanton (Travolta) and his staff sitting around an over-sized table at a familiar Southern barbecue joint, slopping down chicken and ribs and bottles of beer. The governor, the black barbecue owner, and the campaign strategist (Thornton), are trading stories about their Mammas. My Mamma had diabetes. My Mamma never had a nickel. It's a subtle contest in which the conversants one-up one another while exchanging sympathies that are at least half genuine. Thornton wins. He gets uncertainly to his feet, slams his chair down, and cries, My mamma raised SEVEN of us kids and worked her fingers to the bone doin' it. Now they're cuttin' her up, piece by piece! He begins weeping. The others gather round him and give him a group hug and they sing, You Are My Sunshine (written by a Southern governor, claims Travolta), and Stanton's wife (Thomson) feeds him tissues to sob into. It's late at night and the newly awakened hound dogs howl along with the singing.The whole first half of the movie is more or less that way, an outrageous ripoff of Clinton and his amateurs and friends during the 1992 primary race with lots of jokes and lovable characters.Your Mamma still with you? the teary barbecue owner asks one of the governor's staff during the sob fest? The new man, who hasn't been listening, looks up and answers distractedly, No, she lives in Beverley Hills with her second husband. The middle third of the movie turns more serious, with some major challenges to Travolta's continuing momentum. Did he really impregnate the barbecue owner's pretty young daughter? We don't find out but the suggestion is that COULD have. Is Travolta going to have to go negative in his ads, as his opponents have done? We can be forgiven, I think, if we find these issues a little naive these days.The final third of the movie, in my view, fails. The director, Mike Nichols, is extremely efficient and very sensitive to details of scene and character, but he has a tendency to take a funny movie and make it serious by giving it a downbeat or even tragic ending. It's as if the Chicago gangsters had finally caught Jack Lemon and Tony Curtis at the end of Some Like it Hot and gunned them down in an alley. Instead of a skillful mixture of comedy and drama we wind up with a movie that's been cut up -- piece by piece -- into two big pieces.Aside from the structure itself, this particular tragedy doesn't work. A manic lesbian (Kathy Bates) is called in to do her usual job of digging up dirt on the opposition. She's energetic, earthy, and likable. And when she feels betrayed by Governor Stanton she kills herself. A person who is a professional cynic finds she can't live after her illusions about her boss are shattered. Then there is a kind of anti-climax involving a retired governor who becomes a public figure by -- well, never mind. I got a little lost somewhere along in here. A gay man dying of AIDS in a hospice.Well, the laughs disappear, but not to be replaced by thought, only by emotions easily elicited by the pushing of certain buttons. You may tear up, but you don't think, What a tragedy. You think, Gee, that's too bad. Meanwhile the movie, overburdened by its own weight, wobbles on to its end. It's cleverly written by Elaine May and done well by everyone involved, but, gee, that's too bad. What is wrong with a straight comedy? What is it, some kind of disease?

I was jazzed when I saw the previews. When the movie finally came out, I left the theater shaking my head. The director and screenwriter should be punished for squandering such a potentially hot property.With the exception of William Hurt, I liked the casting. The great choices are Mimi Rogers as Maureen, Matt Leblanc as Don, and Gary Oldman as Dr. Smith. To a lesser extent, other decent players are Heather Graham as Judy, Lacey Chabert as Penny, and Jack Johnson as Will. But the script deals them all a fatal blow. Why does Judy have to be a doctor all of a sudden? Can't Penny be nice and less whiny? Would they really put little Will in charge of robotics? Please. The original series gave the kids some good qualities, but let them act their age and didn't push it too far.Gary Oldman plays the right mix of personality flaws to make a great Dr. Smith. His storyline is not too bad until the unfortunate turn of events at the end.William Hurt was the big mistake here. The crew has no reason to follow his character's attempt to give orders. He should have been left home in a lab somewhere. Even Maureen emasculates him fairly easily. Guy Williams as John Robinson more than held his own as a husband, father and sparring partner for Don in the original - a true leader.

Too bad.Now for the robot... he was clearly established as a main character in the series. But in the movie, besides saying Danger Will Robinson about 659 times, he\/it looks more like a tank than a mechanical man. How enduring can that be?

Dysfunctional family takes some wrong turns and has to deal with the future. Action scenes that play more like video games.

The original series gave the kids some good qualities, but let them act their age and didn't push it too far.Gary Oldman plays the right mix of personality flaws to make a great Dr. Smith. His storyline is not too bad until the unfortunate turn of events at the end.William Hurt was the big mistake here. The crew has no reason to follow his character's attempt to give orders. He should have been left home in a lab somewhere. Even Maureen emasculates him fairly easily. Guy Williams as John Robinson more than held his own as a husband, father and sparring partner for Don in the original - a true leader. Hurt is a great actor, no doubt, but his Robinson is annoying and has no command presence. It's not pretty when the kids don't listen to him but Don is forced to submit to his (?) authority.Speaking of Don, Leblanc could have played him in a major way if this movie script had not reduced him to an immature boor. Too bad.Now for the robot... he was clearly established as a main character in the series. But in the movie, besides saying Danger Will Robinson about 659 times, he\/it looks more like a tank than a mechanical man. How enduring can that be? At least the classic old model could look friendly or scary, shake your hand, zap a few bad guys, and then make you believe he had feelings. This new model gets destroyed before anyone has any bonding time, and then the kid rebuilds him to look like one of the tortured mutant toys from Toy Story.As for Jar Jar Binks the space-chimp-teletubby... let's not waste any more thought. Things are bad enough already. CG characters in live-action movies should be banned by the Screen Actors' Guild.The story is the biggest offense in this movie. Dysfunctional family takes some wrong turns and has to deal with the future. Action scenes that play more like video games. Once again, I can only lament... why didn't they ask me (or anyone else for that matter) how to make a decent TV show-based movie???

Gosh I wished I wouldn't have waited all this time to finally watch it, although maybe it's a good thing cause I would have probably been a little bit more traumatized at 14... This movie is exceptional!!! Makes u think, makes you frustrated, makes you wanna scream and even makes you cry! Edward Norton is just phenomenal playing the role of a freak skin head and even more so playing this skin head who finally realizes how stupid he was and tries to protect his younger brother. Edward Furlong also does an amazing job!!! This film is moving in so many ways...I can't even describe how real and heartfelt it felt. I definitely think Edward Norton should have won the Oscar for his performance, cause he was absolutely terrific! I can't get why they didn't gave it to him... This movie will surely stay on my mind for a while now... just thinking that some place in the world things like that still happen...it crushes my heart. This is a wonderful movie that every single person should see at least once in his life... Watch American History X, it totally worth it!
