[{"date":"20 June 2007","score":"","review":" Reading all the comments after picking this DVD up at the rental store, I was looking forward to a high quality movie representation of the drug scene in America. Overall, however, i was left with a feeling of Is that all? It all comes down to the final scene where Michael Douglas' character is giving his speech to the support group, and, just like another person has suggested here, it was just too much, too cheesy, and too cliché.Having said that Michael Douglas fills his role well and Benicio Del Toro was nice to watch.Worth seeing once perhaps but this one was definitely over-rated 6\/10.

Fight club lives up to more than just its name, The acting was brilliant (Brad Pitt & Edward Norton) and the story line is one not to forget what did it for me in the film was certainly the twist, putting this film in close competition with some of the great films of our time, the storyline was great and the whole film is definitely one you have too see, unless your not one for the few violent scenes that the film has to offer. This film does have a few weak points but there's not enough to really bring up on. The Story is based on a average man, who really wants to become someone better. and he finds that someone who he really wants to become, and then the story begins. - thats all i can say without giving anything away )Thank you for reading ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2007","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is personally one of my all time favourites.

Edward Nortan (Dereck) And Edward Furlong (Danny) Performed what i would call some of the most phenomenal performances i've seen in a long time, but that was certainly not the only great thing this film had to offer. The storyline was written to perfection i couldn't say a bad word about this film i think David McKenna did a great job. Onto the story, The story is mainly based on Danny and his brothers (Dereck) Influence on him and how after Dereck completes jail time he see's that Danny is turning into the man he was before he went to jail, and tries to turn his and Danny's life back on track. I have nothing but praise for this film and i'd highly recommend this film to anyone.
