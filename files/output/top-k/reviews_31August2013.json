Speaking as a fan of Macdonald, I've always just loved his delivery. The man could say practically anything, and I'd still chuckle. Here he works with other comedy pros and established actors to create a gleefully un-P.C., ridiculous movie that's just fun from beginning to end.Co-written by Macdonald, Dirty Work stars him as Mitch, kind of a loser in life who finally realizes what he's best at getting revenge when somebody does him wrong. Together with his best friend Sam (Artie Lange), he decides that this will be his line of work. However, they do need to come up with $50,000 rather quickly to pay a gambling addict doctor (Chevy Chase) to pull some strings to get Sams' dad 'Pops' (Jack Warden) a new heart. Trouble brews when rich bastard Travis Cole (Christopher McDonald) plays Mitch and Sam for fools and some innocent people get booted out of their homes. So the two buddies save the best revenge of all for the nefarious Cole.Examples of the kinds of lunacy in this movie include dead prostitutes in car trunks, frat boys tricked into picking a fight with cops, the raunchy spin on Men in Black that Mitch and Sam play at a theatre, Mitchs' frequent notes to self dictations into a pocket tape recorder, and a highly unlikely choice of music for a fight scene in a bar. Macdonald does alright in his first lead, and isn't bad when he's required to actually act. Lange makes for a good sidekick. It's nice to see veteran Warden be so feisty (and randy). Traylor Howard is cute as the requisite love interest. McDonald is perfect in the kind of jerk role that he was clearly born to play. Don Rickles has fun doing his traditional insult humour as a crabby movie theatre owner. David Koechner has a small role as the proprietor of a car dealership. And there are assorted lively cameos by a couple of familiar faces. The verbal and visual jokes keep coming and everything is wrapped up within a very reasonable 82 minutes. Best of all, there's a few outtakes to enjoy during the end credits.This is one of those riotous movies that can hold up to repeat viewings, especially if one is an admirer of any of the comedic talent here. It's highly recommended.Eight out of 10.

That story is Alice in Wonderland,...unfortunately, it may create some mixed results for various viewers. For the most part, this is based on the original story to begin with. If you don't like the original, you probably won't enjoy this either. I was on the fence for this even though I do support it more than I didn't enjoy it. But it still lacked a lot of what many people would consider a Disney classic.The story begins in the real world where Alice, a little girl is being a taught a history lesson from an adult. But Alice has other plans, she's too much into fooling around like a kid and not having to care about education and other important skills. She becomes bored and follows a rabbit yelling that he's late and thus begins her vertigo adventure into the world of wonderland. I think the term really should be called crazy-land or nonsense land because that's really what is the description of this place. There's nothing to gaze on in wonder about. The pace at which these inhabitants live is remarkably fast. Almost like they're all on a sugar rush. A lot of them are also very rude which is a bit strange for Disney.It doesn't last forever but the pace is very quick for about half the film and it can get extremely annoying to watch. It won't help that the main character, Alice, becomes fed up with everything around her as well. It's good character development but for me, if the main lead is frustrated, then so am I. If the lead is tired of its surroundings I will be too. This is mostly because the first half of the movie was all random occurrences. There didn't feel like much of a plot to begin with and by the end, my opinion had not changed. The point at which where viewers might change from annoyed to appreciating the cleverness of Disney's adaptation, is when Alice runs into the garden bed full of flowers. It'll be cool to see how Disney and Co. smartly marry the names of flowers and adjectives together. From there, viewers will finally be able to enjoy the zaniness that is the more popular characters like the Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat. Thankfully for them, they are given more charm than most of the other characters. But again, they're all a little too goofy to be liked all the time because even they become nuisances at some point.However, if there's something to give credit for, it's the animation and music - score wise. The soundtrack that has the musical numbers,... they were alright but there were only a few that were catchy like Painting the roses red or The un-birthday song. The animation though is as great as all the others are. The imaginative drawings and character design are extremely unique. Oliver Wallace, a composer for many other Disney films like Peter Pan (1953) and Lady and the Tramp (1955) did a good job at the score as well. Besides this, if there's one useful lesson learned from this movie, it's that being crazy can be funny but too much nonsense can dilute the experience.This is probably the most divergent of all Disney oldies. The animation and musical score are appreciated but the plot is seriously lacking along with very few likable characters with the rest being fairly rude.

It's often listed as one of the greatest movies of all-time and the famous funny guy scene has been parodied countless times. It struck a huge impact on the genre and influenced countless gangster films that came after it. But why is that? Let's find out! Firstly, the story and how it's told. While the story in Goodfellas about the rise and fall of a gangster is nothing new, it's the way that Scorsese tells the story that makes it so compelling. The movie opens immediately with Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy driving late at night in the highway and then stopping their car to check their trunk and then... it turns out that there's a guy who's all bloodied up there and then Tommy stabs the guy a few times and Jimmy finishes him off by shooting him at point blank and then boom! The movie starts and it never slows down. What's so effective about this opening is that it immediately grabs your attention. We don't start out with any boring exposition dialogue, we get thrown right in the middle of the murder and it makes the audience want to find out why they killed this guy. It's a brilliant opening scene and it's one of the greatest in all of cinema in my opinion.The rest of the film goes through the life of Henry Hill from his teenage years working at a mafia-owned cabstand to dealing drugs behind their back at a brisk, fast pace. This movie has a lot of plot and it could've been really long and boring if it was made by a weaker director but Scorsese keeps the plot going at a fast pace and uses a lot of interesting shooting and editing choices to keep the film interesting. The first half of the film shows the positive side of being a mobster as we get to see Henry take Karen to the Copacabana, steal trucks, rob an airport, and beat the snot out of a man for touching his girl. A lot of people say that this film glamorizes the lifestyle of a gangster from watching this half but I think it's necessary because it makes it believable why Henry would want to join the mob in the first place and it makes the audience enjoy the lifestyle while watching it. The thing that makes this part of the film so enjoyable is how fast-paced it is. We go through all this plot and information in a fast-paced manner so we never get bored in such a long film. Also, the shooting and editing in this film is excellent. Scorsese shot and edited this film with a sense of intensity and it works because it keeps the audience interested rather than if they just used flat, static shots the entire time like the Star Wars prequel.The second half is when the sh!t starts hitting the fan. This is the part in the film where things start going really bad for the characters. Tommy gets whacked for killing Billy Batts, Henry gets arrested for dealing drugs, and Jimmy becomes a paranoid wreck over an airport robbery and starts killing members of his crew out of fear of them leading him to his demise. What's so great about this part of the film is that you really feel the fear and anxiety the characters are feeling. When Henry gets released from prison and gets really paranoid about getting whacked for dealing drugs, you feel the same way because you care about his character. It's quite an accomplishment to make you feel for a mobster\/drug dealer.I haven't talked about the performances yet so I might as well here. Ray Liotta is really underrated in this film. He plays Henry as a douchebag and not a nice guy but we do see his humanity when he sees Tommy murdering people. He makes us both pity him when he's caught dealing drugs and find him despicable when he's cheating on Karen and it's sad that when people talk about this movie, they never bring up his performance because he's actually really great in this film. Robert De Niro is the middle ground character of the trio. He's not as violent as Tommy but he doesn't have as much of a conscience as Henry and he plays it well, showing both the ruthless gangster side as well as the respectable side. The actor who gets the most attention for this film is Joe Pesci. He plays Tommy as an explosive, violent psychopath who would kill you just for looking at him the wrong way and yet, he's still really funny because of the way he talks. He's a joy to watch in this film!Lastly, I want to bring up Scorsese's choice of music in this film. The music he chooses in this movie consists mainly of 70's rock & roll and pop music and they fit with every scene in this movie. When Henry's dating Karen, Bobby Vinton's Roses are Red and it helps in creating a romantic scene. When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack.Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Goodfellas is one of the most iconic films of all-time.

When Henry's snorting coke, a rock and roll song abruptly comes on and it fits in with the intensity the character's feeling. All in all, the music choices in this movie were great and I suggest you to go buy the soundtrack.Overall, the amazing direction, shooting, editing, acting, pacing, and music choices all add up to making one of the greatest films of all- time. I'm gonna give it a 10\/10.

Away from the jokes; the wisecracks and the sheer arrogance of the man, we sense his Axel Foley is someone tough enough to dish out a beating but equally hard enough to take one. The film isn't particularly good on its own, but had it been so unbelievable that Foley was in it for the gags before having to go through a fight because the screenplay demanded it, it would have fallen at the first hurdle. As for the rest of it, there isn't necessarily anything interesting here; it cracks along, tries too hard to impress with its second unit material and maintains an uneasy line between comedy and black drama. There can be little doubt that the film is made up of bits from others you've already seen the revenge story that sees a tough individual traverse a distance to investigate; the eventual plot that has much to do with narcotics and the uneasy combination of black and white, of carefree and regimented in the central character pairing. The trouble is, each of these things were better when you first saw them.At the core of the picture is how a ragtag, unorthodox cop from somewhere as rough and ready as Detroit can bring a little carefree energy to the stiff procedure driven folks in Beverley Hills. A point is made early on as to how the Californian police officers cannot break their stiff routine when the chance of getting themselves out of trouble is offered for sake of a lie to a superior officer. They pass it up, preferring to take the heat for their actions if it means remaining truthful &#x96; when the time comes to establish what everybody's learnt from the exercise that is Beverley Hills Cop, it is to tell us that the stiff cops have come to embrace bluffing to the suits in charge if it means cracking the case and getting away with avoiding ramifications. How Martin Brest tells this tale is essentially in the mould of what you might get if you merged Get Carter with The Cannonball Run, a revenge story about a man far from home told under a colourful umbrella of different parties out for a similar thing &#x96; each getting in each other's way and tripping over one another in the process.Beginning in Detroit, the aforementioned Foley has shown the brash initiative we will later learn is synonymous with his character in that he's decided to infiltrate a smuggling ring without authorisation. When things go wrong, he bears the brunt of his police chief but we sense Foley is suffocated by narrow-mindedness out of the fact the chief cannot see all the good work Foley was responsible for. Plus it was ultimately the untimely appearance of a squad car which blew the operation. From here, we get a brief taste of what life in Detroit is like for those occupying it; the film in no hurry and refusing to play its hand. People live rough, they swear; they occupy sleazy pool halls and make stupid bets on one's ability to pull off trick shots &#x96; one person is even gunned down in cold blood. In spite of this, Brest doesn't want to gross the audience out too much; there remains, throughout, a distinctly fruity atmosphere of fun and frolics. This is not a film directed particularly well, but often its dialogue and willingness to crack on with things it knows are not particularly smart in that B-movie way.About that instance of someone being gunned down in cold blood it ends up being the film's catalyst out of the fact it was a friend of Foley's who had come over from Beverley Hills to visit him. Unfortunately, he had brought too much of something else with him and incurred the wrath of a hit-man. Distraught, Foley takes time off work but is warned by his chief of treading too close to his usual ways of playing the lone-wolf and hunting for the perpetrators of the killing. Thus, the titular Beverley Hills Cop is born when he heads over there in his raggedy car to investigate a name his former friend mentioned. What unfolds is not so much a detective story per se, but a series of scenes based upon the fact Foley already knows who's guilty &#x96; he just needs to work backwards from the right answer and land something on the antagonist guilty of some seriously amoral stuff in a world where affluence can buy you into rarefied circles free of accusation. Steven Berkoff fills this void and does so with a slimy relish, amply supported by a doughy eyed second-in-command thug assassin.Away from the case, the film must flesh itself out with a series of scenes depicting the police force of the area questioning Foley, while the scenes that play out wherein Foley just doesn't seem to belong in Beverly Hills are done so with a sort of confident relish that just feels heavy. The fact of the matter is, Foley is not a fish out of water beyond the racial and class distinctions; he is a police officer mixing with other police officers striking us as someone following up on leads the locals cannot bring themselves to fathom for the fact the suspect is who it is. The stubbornness of the locals in this regard is so hard to break down, that the film must resort to the villain engaging in a straight-up case of kidnapping so as to prolong a police presence for the final shootout. Where by no means a disaster, the film didn't do an awful lot for me beyond individual bits and pieces that were often as good as they were out of Murphy's delivery. In the long run, this is fairly poor a middling-to-bad effort.

Someone pointed out that being sick also got you a lot of sympathy and attention. Freud -- no sociologist -- dismissed all that as secondary gains. This movie, for all its epic sweep, doesn't really deal with freedom from King George's sometimes whimsical rules for the colonies. It's the story of the rebels' revenge on the British redcoats who are snobs and sadists. Independence, freedom, representation -- all that nonsense is a secondary gain compared to the motive to kill certain individuals who have harmed the militia. It might as well be a Western, with the redcoats as Indians, except that here it's the colonials who use sneaky tactics and the Brits who march around in loud jackets in the open, inviting attack. I don't know why it's called The Patriot because patriotism has little to do with it. The writers and producers always have to handle the Revolutionary War very carefully. After all, Americans and Brits have been allies in any number of wars, large and small, and have generally supported one another since 1812, when those damned sons of Albion burned down the White House in Washington. Maybe that's why there are so few movies about the Revolutionary War. Classics like James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans, John Ford's Drums Along the Mohawk, and John Wayne's Allegheny Uprising, are all about the French and Indian wars, known in Europe as the Seven Years War.The Americans at that time weren't Americans yet, just overseas British citizens. We avoid Revolutionary War stories because the mental gears begin to grind and a lot of cognitive dissonance is stirred up. The result is discomfiting. It's good that we don't have to extend this cinematic tenderness doesn't apply to the Germans or Japanese. If Hollywood had to do that, it would mean an end to war movies.The film itself is rather routine, though colorful and filled with action and sentiment. Splendid scenery. Many slow-motion deaths, a hoary cliché long before this came out. There are good people and there are evil people. All the colonists are good. The Brits as a whole aren't really bad, just one or two rotten red astrachans in that crimson barrel. Tom Wilkinson as General Cornwallis (Kids he was a British soldier) is perfect in the role. He plays it in the way of classic English actors, projecting thoughts and emotions without carrying on about them. He's been splendid elsewhere too, a fine actor.Poor Jason Isaacs is the sadistic officer, tolerated but not approved of by Cornwallis. He has the coldest blue eyes known to man or beast, except for those of my ex spouse. I believe make up has clipped off his eyelashes to make his icy irises stand out more ominous, as in a comic book. He may be a good actor too but there's no way to tell because the script has him trapped in a swampy stereotype. Everything he does is pure e-vil. Why, man, he burns down churches full of innocent civilians! Burning a church is one thing, but with the whole congregation locked inside? He gets his comeuppance in the movie, which his real life counterpart never did. The real guy went on to serve in parliament and died in 1833.Mel Gibson is okay as the Homeric hero, wielding his tomahawk, teaching the farmers how to shoot and run away, to set traps for the enemy -- but no useless slaughter. He was never a very expressive actor but he's reliable enough and easy to identify with if you're as handsome and well built as he and I are.The locations are splashy and evocative, nicely photographed. The sentimentality is less than I'd expected. I got rather a kick out of it, even though it was thoroughly predictable, right down to the smallest incident.

Its main flaw, which can be forgiven, was noted by the director, Mary Harron. It is that she left the unintentional impression that the murders shown in the film were fantasies, when they are not. However, there is a breaking point late in the film at which Bale sees writing on an ATM machine that is unreal. From that point on, we cannot be certain of what is real and what is not.The film mercilessly skewers nouveau riche Wall Street yuppies of the 80s. There are priceless sequences involving their restaurants, business cards, wine, clothing, personal appearance, musical tastes and sex lives. The sameness of each is emphasized to the point where they often mistake one person for another.One-upmanship and petty jealousy are rampant. In Bale this erupts into anger. The outlet for the emptiness of his life is murder. He has gone mad and the madness soon takes over his life altogether.Anyway, there is some brilliant writing and satire here. The movie apparently had a good solid novel to work with as a foundation.I wondered how deep a critique of American society was intended. If you look at television commercials of today with a critical eye, you will find that they resemble a good part of the consumerism in this movie. Both seem insane. Both seem unreal in a sense of being unmoored from values that are important and matter.What is shown is a disconnection being activities and the values and gratifications that they actually bring. There is then an escalation, as in the use of drugs, as the person attempts to obtain the gratifications. The psycho shown here goes through this rising wave.How far does the critique extend? Are these unsatisfied hungers uniquely American? No, they've appeared in past places and times again and again. But they are expressed most vividly at this epoch by America and its history. Think land hunger. Think Manifest Destiny. At the government level, think about the many futile attempts to create social perfection, eliminate evils, or spread democracy. Or think about such grandiose hungers as eliminating terrorism anywhere and everywhere.Rationality and psychosis can and do co-exist in the Bateman character. The message is that the same goes for everyone. It is a question of control, is it not? Of the psychosis crowding out everything else.The message is that a breakdown in one's values and ways of attaining value is a serious illness of the being, here treated as a psychosis (a severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality.But what is external reality? It shows itself by a kind of order or law, such as gravity. These are easier to grasp than when reality shows itself as a kind of law of human or animal behavior. You cannot shake hands with a wild bear. You cannot expect some stranger willingly to give you $10,000.The questions of contemporary life revolve around why disconnects between actions and their real consequences occur.
