[{"date":"7 August 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Growing up, this was one of those movies that people said I had to see if I loved movies. I waited a long to watch this because it was rated R and I was only 7 when this was released. So after waiting long enough and convincing my parents to let me, I finally watched it. This is one of those cases where the movie is so hyped up that when you watch it, it's good but nothing special. I was impressed by the movie, and they seemed to be throwing all these new ideas at you about the world and how it works. I've always wondered after watching this, if there are people that actually believe what the movie is telling them. The scene people constantly refer to when talking about this movie is the bullet time scene. It's over in a matter of seconds, and my response was what, that's it? I did like this movie, I just didn't think it was a profound masterpiece or anything. It seems to me that people only recommend watching this movie because of that one scene that is now cemented into movie history. The Wachowski brothers wrote a very intriguing piece of work, and I admire their exploration outside the norm of reality. The cast is good and Lawrence Fishbourne is great as ever. The guy who stole the show for me was Smith who is played by Hugo Weaving. This is an action packed science fiction movie that I think most can enjoy, though some may not want to invest their time into.
