But Surviving the Game is out-and-out garbage. The premise was already stale, the writing is god-awful, and the characters aren't even on the level of a comic book. The depiction of homeless life in a big city is, at best, charmingly inaccurate. The climactic showdown is one of the most mind-numbingly stupid scenes I've ever encountered (and I've seen everything that Edward D. Wood Jr and Steven Seagal have done).The only possible reason to see this is to watch a good cast waste its time. Ice-T, taken out of his usual big-pimping-gangster routine, is surprisingly good; he's believable in the action scenes (although I can't figure out how a malnourished homeless man could have so much energy), and he creates a good deal of sympathy too. Unfortunately, the screenplay gives him the lion's share of clunky dialogue. In particular, his conversation in the cave with John McGinley is so poorly-written that no actor could possibly survive it. Hey, wouldn't that make a nifty DVD extra, to have, say, Ralph Fiennes, Samuel L. Jackson, Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, and Denzel Washington each give their reading of Ice-T's monologue about how his family died in the fire?Rutger Hauer is entertaining and intelligent as always, and Charles Dutton is his usual rock-solid self. They really do come off as a couple of guys who have known each other for a long time, and the numerous unexplained inside jokes between them are a nice touch. But both actors have been much more impressive in better movies than this.F. Murray Abraham is horribly miscast, and his character is a mess of contradictions. Abraham has been magnificent before (see Amadeus and Mighty Aphrodite). But here, he's saddled with the burden of playing the dumbest character in the movie, and, much like James Woods, Abraham is incapable of playing stupid. You can sense Abraham's discomfort with the character throughout, especially in his scenes with William McNamara, who plays his son and seems equally confused about what he's doing here.John C. McGinley, who foundered for years in crap like this, On Deadly Ground, and Highlander II, gives yet another signature performance that's way too good for a movie of this caliber. Fortunately, he finally found a role on Scrubs that's worthy of his best efforts. Hopefully his days of playing minor bad guys in lame action movies are over once and for all.Which brings us to the only real reason to see this movie, the great Gary Busey. Busey by this point had made a second career playing over-the-top villains (see Lethal Weapon through Under Siege). Here he outdoes himself. As he was probably the highest-paid actor appearing in this movie, he doesn't last very long. But he makes an impression that overshadows everything else. His long monologue (about the dog he had when he was a kid) is up there with any weirdo soliloquy that Christopher Walken's done in the last ten years, and he chews on it like he's enjoying every bite (no pun intended). Shortly after that, he has a well-choreographed fight with Ice-T. But again, could a malnourished homeless guy really hold his own against a CIA-trained total psycho who's much bigger than he is? Well, whatever. Bravo, Mr. Busey, I tip my hat to you.In short, you can stop watching it after Busey gets his.

And I'm not really a huge jazz guy though I have always liked the Miles Davis - John Coltrane type stuff. This is my favorite non - Angelo Badalamente (sp?)film score. Seriously, see this flick just for the music alone. And, see it for Miranda Richardson who is AWESOME in this movie. I think she really steals the show in this one. J. Jason Leigh is solid and plays the part of a not too bright, not very successful midwest girl decently. Also, Harry Belafonte is great as Seldom Seen and he just looks and sounds the part so well. Steve Buscemi, Dermot Mulroney and the woman who plays J. Jason Leigh's sister are all quite good in supporting roles, and Michael Murphy is perfect for the part of the slightly confused, yet somewhat powerful husband to the kidnapped Richardson character.The clothes, cars, and look of the film is nicely done (cmon it IS an Altman picture!!!) and really does make you feel as if you are in Missouri circa 1935-1940.

I now know the error of my ways and it has become quite clear what I have been missing out on. A Fistful of Dollars is the tale of a mysterious man who wanders into a small town governed between two rival families of bandits. He sets out to rid the town of the families by pitting them against one another. The film is the first in Leone's Man With No Name Trilogy and a remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic Yojimbo. I loved Yojimbo and was greatly entertained by A Fistful of Dollars. Sergio Leone managed to take the masterpiece that was Yojimbo and create a spectacular classic that is in the same league as it's Japanese counterpart. The film can both stand apart from Yojimbo and at the same time stand along side it as an equally amazing cinematic experience.Clint Eastwood seems to have some fun with his role as the man with no name, simply referred to as Joe. He stays calm in the face of danger and carries an intense coolness throughout the film that makes him all the more entertaining to watch. While I found myself a bit annoyed at the score for the film, I found the pacing to be just right. The amount of action in it was enough to not get in the way of telling the story of a man bringing piece back to a deserving town. Joe is compassionate for the townspeople and alludes to his mysterious past while not giving too much away about himself. Sergio Leone's direction is everything I had hoped for after hearing so much about this legend. A Fistful of Dollars was a great movie-watching experience. It never let up and was just an overall cool movie. However, I would have to say that I prefer Yojimbo by a very slight margin. While Clint Eastwood was amazing in his role he cannot compare to Toshiro Mifune's performance in Yojimbo. This film deserves a rating of **** out of 5 and I am now eager to see more of Sergio Leone's work and as soon as I possibly can.

I now know the error of my ways and it has become quite clear what I have been missing out on. A Fistful of Dollars is the tale of a mysterious man who wanders into a small town governed between two rival families of bandits. He sets out to rid the town of the families by pitting them against one another. The film is the first in Leone's Man With No Name Trilogy and a remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic Yojimbo. I loved Yojimbo and was greatly entertained by A Fistful of Dollars. Sergio Leone managed to take the masterpiece that was Yojimbo and create a spectacular classic that is in the same league as it's Japanese counterpart. The film can both stand apart from Yojimbo and at the same time stand along side it as an equally amazing cinematic experience.Clint Eastwood seems to have some fun with his role as the man with no name, simply referred to as Joe. He stays calm in the face of danger and carries an intense coolness throughout the film that makes him all the more entertaining to watch. While I found myself a bit annoyed at the score for the film, I found the pacing to be just right. The amount of action in it was enough to not get in the way of telling the story of a man bringing piece back to a deserving town. Joe is compassionate for the townspeople and alludes to his mysterious past while not giving too much away about himself. Sergio Leone's direction is everything I had hoped for after hearing so much about this legend. A Fistful of Dollars was a great movie-watching experience. It never let up and was just an overall cool movie. However, I would have to say that I prefer Yojimbo by a very slight margin. While Clint Eastwood was amazing in his role he cannot compare to Toshiro Mifune's performance in Yojimbo. This film deserves a rating of **** out of 5 and I am now eager to see more of Sergio Leone's work and as soon as I possibly can.

I think it is one of the greatest, too&#133;A beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so anti&#150;Hollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.Amazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had &#150; the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose &#150; instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place &#150; cheerful but melancholy in the same time&#133; Criterion DVD is wonderful &#150; the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available &#150; British and American, and a lot of extras.

That isn't to say that he isn't my favorite (or one of my favorite) directors in the world because he is. What I love most about his work is that he never condescends to explain everything, or even anything. 'Mulholland Drive' is one of his strangest creations, along with the classic 'Eraserhead' and 'Wild at Heart'. I love all those films and this latest one is equally arresting and fascinating, albeit incomprehensible. I'm not sure if it is this way because it was patched together from a pilot script with an ending tacked on or what. Whatever the answer I think the film is representative of a very profound mind at work on the mysteries of life. I have my ideas as to what it all means but won't belabor them here because they are probably wrong. The usual suspects (Lynchian clues) are present in this film; the sinister cripple, the strange object with seeming cosmic powers (the blue box), the horror-film version of aging parents, the all- knowing bum in the alley, etc. Very much akin to Twin Peaks although not nearly as creepy or violent.And what would Lynch do without Angelo Badalamenti's music? Like Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, they enhance each other's work to make a much greater sum total.Having lived in Hollywood and spent many hours gazing over LA from Mulholland Drive I was driven to chain smoke about 30 minutes into this film. So many details reminded me of the sad, banal evil that flows like lava under Sunset Boulevard and environs. It gave me the creeps, in other words. The deadly beauty of the place, filled with the voices of the dead flitting amongst the sea of lights below the Santa Monica mountains.Diane Selwyn's witch-hut cottage gave me goose-bumps, reminding me of all the ghosts that wander around that town. The faded kitchen cabinetry and hideous old paint all brought it back vividly to mind. I don't bandy the word genius about much, almost never, but I have long considered David Lynch to be about as close to one as they get in the film-director business. He is our Hitchcock of the day, would that the moneyed producers in Hollywood recognize the fact and give the guy a little more support to make his visions into reality, though he seems to have done quite well without them. Hitchcock lost his edge when he went technicolor, perhaps Lynch would as well if he went totally Studio.As for the acting I can't find fault other than the occasional thought that perhaps he's gone out into the streets and hired amateurs for certain parts, like The Cowboy. But then at the beginning of the film Naomi Watts speaks her lines a bit amateurishly, which is a far cry from her true abilities that surface gradually and blossom into an awesome performance after she has been transformed in Diane Selwyn in the second half of the film. A great actress! Laura Harring is mesmerizing and really is the spittin' image of Rita Hayworth at the opening. And I didn't recognize Lee Grant as the all-seeing witch, another Lynchian stalwart character. And of course it was wonderful to see Ann Miller one last time, still vivacious and a bit odd, as she has always been since her hoofing days in 'Stage Door' a part she played when she was 15 years old!What really threw me was the film suddenly turning into a lesbian love-death story. As time passes I'm starting to see the logic behind this but fitting it all together is akin to putting a Chinese puzzle back together after you'd thought you had it finished, excepting for one nob which still sticks out of line and is irreconcilable to the whole. So back to square one trying to work it all out. But that is what I like about Lynch, he makes us think! It may be all bosh and he may be playing a huge joke on all of us smarty-pants out here, but I don't care, I liked this movie a lot. It's certainly far more entertaining and thought-provoking than anything anyone else is doing inHollywoodland these days, with the exception of Tim Burton.Silencio!

If you are seeking a simple good guy beats bad guy film, then don't watch this or any other realistic spy film. If, however, you want a story that manages to combine cynicism & romance, I recommend this one. ","genre":"Drama, Romance, Thriller"}]
