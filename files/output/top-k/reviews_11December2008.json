","genre":"Action, Crime, Romance"},{"date":"11 December 2008","score":"","review":" These comments are based on the restored version, now available on DVD.It's Sam Fuller's story of a small group of infantrymen from the First Division, Mark Hamill, Robert Carradine, Bobby De Cicco, and Kelly Ward, led by their sergeant, Lee Marvin. The battles, and the rests between battles, takes us from North Africa, through Sicily, France, and Czechoslovakia. We see the entire war through the eyes of this small group because Fuller was operating on a budget of something like four million dollars. It's as close to an epic as Fuller was to come, but the budget shows. This is no Saving Private Ryan. I'm taking a couple of things into account -- not just the budget but the effort and care that Fuller put into it. It's by far his most personal film. Carradine plays Zap, a reporter who is a stand in for Fuller, and Fuller himself appears as a war correspondent.It's an episodic movie, as many war movies are, but if there's one feature of this film that's consistent, it's its inconsistency. When somebody dies, there are no tears, no eulogy, no remembrance of him later. Instead, there's a quick cut to a party. Death comes out of nowhere, both for the Americans and the Germans. Pause to take a leak and you get your throat cut. (That's how Fuller would have put it.) There are a couple of memorable moments, small ones that don't involve a lot of action. Halfway through the film, the reporter and writer, Zap, notices a replacement reading a novel that Zap has just had published. Inching his face close to the replacement's, Zap says, That's my book. YOUR book? I just bought it at the repo depo. Yeah, but I wrote it, Zap tells him, then gives him a swig from a bottle of booze and claps him on the cheek. Marvin has been lounging nearby, his helmet over his face, and when he overhears this exchange he surreptitiously tilts his helmet back to stare wonderingly at Zap for a moment before allowing the helmet to drop again. He didn't know Zap was a writer, and no power on earth could ever get Marvin to compliment him on having a novel published. There isn't space enough to describe more, but most of them revolve around the utter absence of sentiment. Well -- one more. It lasts about a minute. It's just a scene in which a matronly hotel manager sits at an old piano and plays a bit of Chopin, while Marvin sits on the end of the bench, looking away from her, dreamily, and neither speaks a word. For those few seconds we're able to get far enough into Marvin's head to get past his identity as a soldier. But there are other recurring elements that Fuller makes good use of. The kids, for instance. The children. First we meet Arab kids who are conniving scamps. Then we meet Italian kids, the boys tough (one of them shows no emotion when he's arguing with the men that the decomposing body of his mother must be buried in a proper place), the girls sweet (one of them weaves flowers into the netting of Marvin's helmet). The German kids who are still saluting Hitler and sniping at the advancing GIs.We also get to meet Lee Marvin's German counterpart, a sergeant played by Siegried Rauch, who was the intelligence officer assigned to research the personal characteristics of General Patton in Patton. Well, ALL the Germans we anything but lovable. But Rauch is an uncomplicated Nazi. He's brave, resolute, and brutal. If someone bad mouths Hitler or the cause, Rauch simply machine-guns them to death. It doesn't matter if the victim is just a poor disgruntled grunt or a contessa. Rat-a-tat-tat. And when Rauch finally surrenders, it's just so that he can live long enough to carry on the fight later.That's kind of a simple-minded view of an enemy, never mind another human being. And the film, its strengths notwithstanding, suffers from this simplicity in its dialog and characterization. On a French battlefield, the men stumble across a monument to the First Infantry Division, with a long list of names. One of them says, Look at that! We just got here and already they put up a monument to the Big Red One. Marvin explains that the monument was put up in 1918 after the First World War. But the names are the same, remarks the kid. They always are, replies Marvin.Well, Fuller fought with the Big Red One through Europe. He's been there. And yet incidents like this sound fraudulent. The event itself is improbable, and the dialog could have come from a 1950s comic book.There's another problem with the film. Lee Marvin and a couple of foreign professionals aside, nobody in it can act. Some are positively embarrassing. The four young privates that Marvin manages to shepherd through the war may, from time to time, utter a believable line of dialog or come up with an endearing and appropriate expression, but none looks or sounds right for the role.I don't like tearing this film apart because I liked Sam Fuller's character, but he's made a much better war movie than this -- Merrill's Marauders. The Big Red One doesn't linger on anything for long and what character development there is, is predictable from almost the beginning. (Griff learns to shoot a man. Lee's sergeant lays the ghost of a murder from the previous war.) If you want to see a movie that stands almost in direct opposition to this one, take another look at Terence Malick's The Thin Red Line. It's slow. It's languorous. It's poetic -- too poetic at times. The battle scenes can make a viewer shiver with fear. The enemy, although strictly an obstacle to be overcome, isn't stereotyped.

I recorded a copy again recently (when it was broadcast at something like 3.00a.m. and introduced ominously in the voice-over as 'a 1960s horror movie'), and regret to say that my impressions of it have not improved at all despite the intervening years and my continued reverence for the products of Powell's career as a whole.It is clear that Powell thought he was trying to mix making a 'serious' film, investigating the nature of fear, sexual psychology and the role of cinema\/film-making in awakening and developing these qualities in film audiences, with a 'popular' 'hunt the madman'-type detective story. In my view, though, he fails in BOTH endeavours. Both of the lead characters, played by Carl Boehm and Anna Massey, are wholly unconvincing and come across as caricatures and totally 'artificial'. The plot is entirely predictable and would have left a mass audience yawning within half an hour, whilst, overall, I regret to have to say that I CAN see fully why such words as 'sordid', 'tacky' and 'seedy' were used by critics when the film was first screened. From the very opening scene, (virtually a replay of numerous portrayals of a 'woman of the streets' meeting her murderer - as in countless 'Jack the Ripper' films), through the scenes of Boehm taking the 'glamour shots' of half-clad girls, (covered in garish lip-stick), in the upstairs room of the seedy tobacconist's shop through to the interminable murder scene with Moira Shearer, (obviously just appearing 'for old time's sake' with the director of 'The Red Shoes'), the direction is flat and does indeed have a voyeuristic, stilted quality which is alienating and discomforting. Of course it may well be argued that this is precisely what Powell is intending and that the audience SHOULD feel squeamish and 'guilty' at being what the title of the film is telling us we really are. The problem is that the feeling one is left with is NOT, contrary to what Powell may have claimed or thought, that this is being done in an investigatory or explanatory manner which shows any respect for the audience at all, but rather that, (just as in the revealing scene where Powell plays a sadistic father making his son afraid in various ways and filming the reactions), Powell is not aiming to understand his audience but to shock them in a way which shows contempt and loathing for them, (and totally unlike Hitchcock, of course, who invariably, (if not always), remained acutely conscious of how his audience would view and respond to any scene he directed). Powell (and Pressburger), had always had more than a touch of 'looking down' on their audiences but by this stage of his career, I think Powell had lost any empathy with his audiences at all, (especially the broad mass of cinema goers), and was beginning to regard them as 'box office fodder'. Audiences, and critics, felt this very quickly and reciprocated the feelings, (by staying away from the movie in droves), virtually killing Powell's career stone-dead, (as with other highly talented directors who 'turned their backs' on the mere film-goer, such as Von Stroheim and Welles).Wind forward twenty years and the young Hollywwod 'Brat Pack' are aiming to rediscover mass popular film entertainment, (in the shape of Star Wars, Close Encounters, Jaws etc.), and 'discover' half of the team behind A Matter of Life and Death, The Red Shoes, (above all), The Thief of Baghdad etc. etc. In the atmosphere of growing adulation, someone 'discovers' Peeping Tom and it, too, is proclaimed 'a masterpiece' as well. I beg to differ. To me it remains a cheap, garish 'shocker' which may have pretensions but whose failure was entirely predictable and justified and which does very little indeed for the overall estimation of one of the foremost talents which British cinema has ever produced.

That's how it's gonna feel at the end of the world. Coincidentally, you can feel that exact same pain and suffering by watching Michael Bay's Armageddon. Armageddon is a painful exercise in squeezing every cliché possible into 150 minutes of swooping camera moves, slomo shots of blond American farm kids, nauseous flag-waving and the movie's heroes walking abreast towards the camera, with smoke billowing in the background in slow motion. At least twenty times.Armageddon is also about an asteroid (the size of Texas) on a collision course with Earth, which only Bruce Willis' team of oil-drillers can destroy, able to perform the requisite deep-core planting of a nuclear device on the asteroid to blow it up. You can't train actual astronauts to do technical stuff like that, no way.While a slightly perverted subplot revolves around Ben Affleck pursuing Willis' daughter, Liv Tyler, a cavalcade of B-stars makes A-holes of themselves in the middle background Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner, Will Patton, Owen Wilson, and trusty Chris Ellis (Deke Slayton in APOLLO 13, and forever cast as Some Guy In Mission Control in all these space films).A movie with less science than STAR WARS (if that's even possible), less physics than MOONRAKER (which had none), less credible operating procedures than CAPRICORN ONE (which faked them), and less street cred than DEEP IMPACT (which preceded this film by two months). And - of course - ripping off Arthur C.

Not director Steven Spielberg! Instead, the incredibly versatile helmer of Jaws, Schindler's List, The Color Purple, and Jurassic Park skewers a patriotic chapter of American history on a bayonet with his graphically realistic but otherwise sappy Saving Private Ryan. Saving Private Ryan ranks as a second-rate World War II movie with a first-class cast and top-notch production values that pass inspection with some of the most savage combat carnage ever lensed. As demeaning as this criticism sounds, Saving Private Ryan is one of the top 25 World War II movies. Since Saving Private Ryan swamped moviegoers with cutting edge combat action, Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down and Sylvester Stallone's Rambo have eclipsed it with even greater cutting edge violence. If the story had been as memorable as the kinetic, blood-splattered battle scenes, Saving Private Ryan might have been a classic. Essentially, Saving Private Ryan is a ten-star movie until the U.S. Army gets off the beach and into France where it devolves into just another standard-issue G.I. Joe war epic. Anybody who knows anything about combat movies will cringe the first time that they see the hero parading about in a helmet with the captain's bars painted on the front like a bull's eye. This is an egregious error! During World War II, officers didn't advertise their presence in this manner for fear that an enemy sniper would single them out for a bullet in the head. Okay, I'd dismiss this lapse of realism as a dramatic liberty except that the film itself raises the same point. A seasoned dogface (Vin Diesel) warns a rank amateur to stop saluting the captain for fear that a sniper will shoot the captain down.Dispersed throughout the movie is the usual quota of Hallmark speeches about valor, loyalty, and redemption. These platitudes add little dimension beyond the obvious to the purely physical rat-a-tat-tat. Spielberg could have trimmed much of this sappy dialogue and upgraded his movie. Running nearly three hours in length, this rowdy, often profane World War II melodrama creates a deeper impression with is grotesque special effects than with its drab, sometimes improbable tale. Told from the perspective of the infantry, Saving Private Ryan is a movie in the grand tradition of Louis Milestone's classic All Quiet on the Western Front, Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One, Lewis Milestone's A Walk in the Sun, and William Wellman's Background. Granted, none of them boasts the extreme combat that Saving Private Ryan commands, but they are solidly-made, engaging war movies with deeply personal stories. The muddled but high-minded screenplay by Fly Away House scenarist Robert Rodat follows a unit of U.S. Rangers on a public relations mission to rescue an American paratrooper. Captain Miller assembles a collection of stock characters to help him locate Private James Ryan of Iowa. Ryan (Matt Damon of Good Will Hunting) has gotten lost behind enemy lines in the pre-dawn parachute drops that preceded the June 6th D-Day Normandy Invasion. When the War Department discovers that Ryan's two brothers bite the sand at Normandy and that the Japanese have killed a third sibling a week earlier, General George C. Marshall (Harve Presnell of Fargo) decides to pull the last Ryan out of action. Along the way, Miller's G.I.s bitch about the irony of risking eight lives to save one guy. Before Saving Private Ryan grinds to its sanguinary conclusion, the Biblical theme of singling out an individual from a multitude for redemption grows tedious. Spielberg and Rodat, along with uncredited scribes Scott Frank and Frank The Shawshank Redemption Darabont, seem confused. Are they making a fiercely repellent anti-war movie? Or have the drummed up a gung-ho Hong Kong style, kick-butt actioneer? They pile on enough violence for a platoon of war movies. Bullets zip and zing by the hundreds giving death an impersonal omnipotence. Presumably, the filmmakers hoped their grisly depiction of combat would eviscerate the memories of those flag-waving John Wayne propaganda sagas. The sadistic horrors that occur in Saving Private Ryan seems more commercially than philosophically oriented. We don't think so much about how terrible war is as how miraculous it is to survive.The first 24 minutes of Saving Private Ryan dwells on the famous D-Day landing at Omaha Beach. Spielberg shows the baptism by fire that befell the seasick G.I.s as they waded ashore into a murderous Third Reich shooting gallery. This is the best part of this movie and guarantees it an immortal place in the ranks of all great combat epics. After the scary, visceral D-Day prologue, the film settles down long enough for Miller to receive new orders. Eventually, Miller locates Ryan with a bunch of paratroopers guarding a bridge behind Nazi lines. Ryan refuses to leave his buddies in the lurch. Reluctantly, Miller and his squad prepare for the worst. This part of Saving Private Ryan has a lot of action, but it cannot compete with the 1960s ABC-TV show Combat. Tom Sizemore makes a credible sergeant, but the usually dependable Edward Burns plays a soldier that would have been shot by his own men for disobeying orders. Tom Hanks' former teacher turned combat leader is a little too sentimental to be believable as is his inevitable demise. Many soldiers have commented&#151;among them retired Joints Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell&#151;that Miller and his men should have blown the bridge and retreated. Of course, had our heroes shown this much common sense there would have been no climactic battle.Spielberg relies on elaborate visual gimmicks to strengthen his screen activities. The astonishing combat sequences have the compressed look of a video surveillance camera. The only thing that saves Spielberg is the politically incorrect way that the G.I.s shoot the surrendering Nazi troops.

His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure unadulterated violence. Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty. So of course, the film about him deals with none of that, instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Al Stump. Now this isn't such a horrible idea in theory, as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on these events, which I figure were simply too interesting, the film is a pseudo fictionalized road film with a clichéd plot that will cause any knowledgeable Cobb fan to cry vinegar tears. Tommy Lee Jones does quite well as a crotchety Cobb, but somehow manages to overplay his cartoon supervillainy. Most stories about Cobb are barely believable, but to make him even crazier seems both impossible and unnecessary. Robert Wuhl, portraying the writer Al Stump, is a dark vortex of non-talent. He sucks the life out of every scene, trying to make this film his own Nagasaki. There is a reason we never see him as a leading man anymore (Arli$$ does not count. It's barely a show). Even the played out, inevitable role reversal of Cobb and Stump by the end is made even worse by his pure inability to utter lines that don't sound akin to a bottom shelf book on tape narration voice. For all the awful writing and bland film-making on display, there is one sequence which stands out as so far superior to the rest of this failure that accepting it's from the same film is near impossible. A hyper stylized flashback sequence displaying Cobb's overpowering psychology and brutal athleticism while actually playing the game of baseball is pure brilliance. The camera moves in bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream due to the unique playing style of the monster Cobb. Every slide, hit, and tackle are rendered even more forceful due to enhanced sound, and Tommy Lee Jones OWNS the intensity of the master player. It makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of a true biopic of Cobb in his prime with the same actor. It's worth watching the film for this incredible few minutes alone, just to see what could have been. I may be slightly unfair to this film due to my own knowledge of Ty Cobb and wanting it to be something it isn't, but to make such boring, neutered movie about this maniac is nonsensical. I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has slid ever since.
