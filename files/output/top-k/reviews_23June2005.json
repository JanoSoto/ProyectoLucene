In this case it has become the second option.Until today, Bobby Bowfinger hasn't had a very successful career as an actor \/ producer \/ director in Hollywood. But that will all change. He's reading the script which a friend has written and he is so convinced of its quality, that he decides to take a last shot at fame and fortune. However, there is one small problem no-one wants to buy the script ... except for one famous producer who promises him to do it, when he agrees with one extra line in the contract Kit Ramsey, Hollywood's number one star, has to be in it. Bobby Bowfinger pays a visit to Kit, but the man says no. But no problem! Bowfinger has an 'excellent' solution for that problem. He'll hire the cheapest film crew available and adds an unknown beauty from Ohio, a mentally retarded man, someone who has an unimportant job at a studio... and together they start shooting the SF-film starring Kit Ramsey who doesn't even know he's in it. As they keep following the man through the city, they make him go completely paranoid because of all the strange things that happen around him, but in the end they are able to finish the movie.What probably surprised me the most was how well Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy perform together. I don't think it is very easy for these actors, who are used to be the only ones that offer the comical note in a movie, to share that role. But it works perfectly and together they have made an hilarious movie. Especially Eddie Murphy did an extraordinary job. Not because he was so much funnier than Martin, but because he did not play one, but two roles and still was able to convince me. Of course they have been helped a lot by Frank Oz. This director hasn't got a big career in directing, but what I've seen from him so far certainly wasn't bad (except for the remake of The Stepford Wives which really didn't do it for me).All in all this is a very good comedy about Hollywood and film-making. It's perhaps not the most intelligent movie ever, but it offered me some great laughter and that's still the most important thing for me when watching a comedy. I give this movie a 7.5\/10, perhaps even an 8\/10.

Only a couple of years ago there was a game show over here where some people weren't allowed because they weren't 'fit for the screen', a nice euphemism for saying that they were just too ugly. So that I saw this in this movie didn't surprise me. But giving the questions and answers to the contestants, that was really something new. But apparently it really happened, because this movie was based on actual events.In the late 1950's, an idealistic young lawyer who works for a Congressional subcommittee discovers that game shows aren't always played honestly. He focuses on two contestants on the show 21 and finds evidence for the fact that NBC and the sponsor have been screwing with the system. He interrogates Herbert Stempel, an ordinary working-class Jew from Queens and Charles Van Doren, a member of one of America's leading literary families, although he doesn't want to blame them for what has happened. He wants to nail the TV-station, but when the official hearings are held, the big guns escape and the true victims are the two contestants...If you only want one reason why you shouldn't miss this movie than I would definitely say that you should watch it for the acting. John Turturro is excellent as the Jewish, seemingly media crazy Stempel. But Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, Rob Morrow as the lawyer,... all did a fine job as well. In fact, I find it very hard to say which actor did the best job, because I liked them all. Of course they would never have been able to give away such a performance if there hadn't been a well-written and very interesting script thanks to Paul Attanasio.Normally I don't say too much about the writer but this time I will make an exception to my own rule. The reason for that is because Paul Attanasio isn't just an ordinary screenwriter. He is also a movie critic and many of the critics always say that they know so much better what a script should look like, but this man actually proves it by writing a very good one himself. But a good script isn't of course all the work. Without the good direction of Robert Redford this wouldn't have worked either.All in all this is a very good movie that deserves to be seen for many different reasons. Some very good acting, a nice script, good direction... this movie has it all. The only problem that I had with it was that it was a bit of a slow starter.

This Walter Hill film is really nothing too exceptional, though. How in the world could any movie in which Bruce Willis fires so many rounds of ammunition lose 49 million dollars? The film uses the ancient story of a mysterious drifter waltzing into town and pitting himself between two rival gangs. This plot has been used in westerns, samurai films, you name it. This film takes place in a dusty west Texas town which seems to exist only for the purpose of being a midway point for bootlegging during Prohibition. Two gangs have an uneasy truce going when Willis drives into town and starts wreaking havoc. One gang is led by David Patrick Kelly, who is an old Walter Hill stand-by actor. The other is led by Ned Eisenberg. You may remember him as being the guy from Moving Violations who is really into horror films. Both gangs are incompetent, but at least Kelly has the services of Christopher Walken's savage character on his side. Willis predictably routes these gangs, or sets up scenarios where they can kill off each other.The biggest problem with this film is its tone. Everyone is mean, depressed, or indifferent. Nobody is having any fun at all. Walter Hill is such a talented man. Hadn't he seen Willis in The Last Boy Scout? That film was also loaded with excessive violence, but it was at least FUN! Hill has given us 48 Hours and the Warriors. Those films also worked mainly because they didn't take themselves too seriously. Last Man Standing is all style and no grace.The action of this film is also very easy to see coming. Does it take a genius to figure out that when the Mexican woman gives her necklace to Willis that it will be found on him later by Kelly's gang? Notice how they beat him senseless, then turn their backs long enough for him to crawl away! You have got to be kidding me! There is not one surprise along the way.The location is dirty and desolate, but I found it somewhat beautiful. The music from Ry Cooder (whom Hill often uses) is very good and atmospheric.

But that isn't always the truth. It has been proved that there are more and more women who are developing a drinking problem. With this movie, Hollywood finally proves that it isn't as conservative as we often like to think.This time it is Meg Ryan's character Alice Green who has overdeveloped her taste for alcohol. When her addiction threatens her life and their daughter's safety, there is no way back for the airline pilot Michael Green and his wife, but to face the consequences of her drinking problem. She goes into therapy and overcomes her problems, but now it is the man who has to try to live with a woman who's no longer the same one he once married. He was used to have complete control over the family, but now that Alice has been cured, she can no longer accept this...The main problem that I had with this movie was that I didn't really believe Meg Ryan. Of course she wasn't really drunk while on stage, but it also never felt real to me. It all looked too acted. Take for instance the scene where she starts throwing with eggs to that car. I just didn't buy that one. Andy Garcia was better. In my opinion he was convincing enough as the concerned house father \/ airline pilot and I don't really think there are many other actors who would have done a better job with this role...Even though I find it more than OK that the studio's make a movie about the subject of alcoholism, I would like to see a more realistic version of it. With this movie I had the feeling that it all went a bit too easy to get rid of the addiction (not that I have any experience with it).

When her addiction threatens her life and their daughter's safety, there is no way back for the airline pilot Michael Green and his wife, but to face the consequences of her drinking problem. She goes into therapy and overcomes her problems, but now it is the man who has to try to live with a woman who's no longer the same one he once married. He was used to have complete control over the family, but now that Alice has been cured, she can no longer accept this...The main problem that I had with this movie was that I didn't really believe Meg Ryan. Of course she wasn't really drunk while on stage, but it also never felt real to me. It all looked too acted. Take for instance the scene where she starts throwing with eggs to that car. I just didn't buy that one. Andy Garcia was better. In my opinion he was convincing enough as the concerned house father \/ airline pilot and I don't really think there are many other actors who would have done a better job with this role...Even though I find it more than OK that the studio's make a movie about the subject of alcoholism, I would like to see a more realistic version of it. With this movie I had the feeling that it all went a bit too easy to get rid of the addiction (not that I have any experience with it). What I did like on the other hand was that they also showed the repercussions on the family once she is declared sober. Overall I would say that this is a good attempt, but far from a perfect one. I know there are many people who find this movie perfect, but I really can't follow them in their opinion. The best I can do for this movie is a 6\/10.

Indeed, fact is more strange than fiction, as is portrayed in Walt Disney Pictures' The Straight Story. A true tale of a 73 year old man named Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth ) who, in 1994, rode his lawn tractor on a journey from Iowa to Wisconsin to make amends with his ailing brother.Of necessity, this film rolls along at a crawl, but this isn't because we're watching some geriatric putt along US-18 on a John Deere at 3 mph. Well, maybe that's part of the reason, but more importantly, this slow passage of time gives Al Straight time to think; time to think about where he's been and where he's going. It gives us time to think, too. We ponder because we want to understand this person's feat and the immeasurable motives that must be moving him. Along the way, we get to see what Alvin sees, vast corn fields and repeated shots of an open sky and a very, very lonely open road.Richard Farnsworth is right on point with his blended performance of stubborn, wise and weary. Sissy Spacek plays Rose Straight, Al's daughter who has some special physical challenges which hinder others' judgment of her capabilities in a tragic way. Spacek's attempts of the disability begin well enough, but become over-done and increasingly unconvincing as the movie progresses. Because this film was shot in sequence, perhaps her gradual comfort with the character costs her the grasp on the uncomfortable inhibition.Throughout the trek we cringe, fearing that some inevitable doom will befall our traveler. Instead, we learn that his worst pain comes from his wrestle with his demons; haunting reminders of his accident untold and his words unremembered. We find out that during the war, our lawn mower man was quite the grass kicker when it came to sniping, much to his chagrin.The people in his path are surprisingly kind. Alvin even sojourns with some, at least for a small season. A run-away who seems initially unimpressed with Mr. Straight, later learns from the wisdom of years. Amid his teachings, the who of an old, wise owl can be heard off camera, a subtle Snow Whitish reminder that this is, after all, still a Disney production. A symbolic bundle of twigs intended to warm our fuzzy only made me worry for Alvin's tongue and dentures as it hearkened back to the little presents left for the campers in The Blair Witch Project. Dueling twin brothers, who obviously got their clothes from Uncle Jesse Duke, are taught by Al's particularly poignant and present experience. All of Straight's encounters are potentially thought-provoking and seem to have a little lesson for him, or us, or someone along the way.I appreciated Angelo Badalamenti's score, which is used sparingly and laced with overcoming pensiveness. Musically silent scenes use the sudden implementation of the soundtrack themes to make the mood piercingly lonely and sad.Richard Farnsworth was a Hollywood stunt man for 40 years before he ever began acting. The Straight Story was his final role. A year after this film, he was diagnosed with terminal Cancer and shot himself. It is supposed that he did not want to lose his dignity through death by disease. In an interview that I once read, Farnsworth stated how he could relate in a lot of ways with Alvin Straight. Richard was notorious for not using four-letter words in his movies. Seemingly a man of stubborn principle, like Alvin Straight, he did things his own way. Playing pieces of himself, an actor is often most convincing when he doesn't have to act.

I think this film is so because it is honest, somewhat autobiographical and derived from a splendid and mature short story of enduring fame.  The plot line of the film is simple.  In a fever because of an accident, Harry lies perhaps dying, tended by his third wife in a camp in Africa.  His delirium causes him, through a long night spent waiting for help to arrive, to relive in his mind the triumphs, disappointments, sorrows, loves and moments of his somewhat unsatisfactory life as an author.

JAWS THE REVENGE is one of the most lambasted and skewered sequels ever made, and while I can't defend most of its problems, I think time has been a tad kinder to it. Unlike JAWS 3, this film at least took a stab at some kind of storyline and characterizations.Lorraine Gary returns as Ellen, the wife of Chief Brody, now looking very haggard with all she's had to deal with. Her husband has died from a heart attack brought on by his fear of the shark, and her two sons are now fully grown and involved in nerve-wracking careers that further wear their mother down. Eldest son Mike (Lance Guest) is a marine biologist, and his younger brother Sean is a Deputy. During the Christmas season, Sean is torn to pieces by another shark just off Amity Island. Mom then goes completely nuts and starts to convince herself that the shark has some sort of personal vendetta against her whole family and is deliberately seeking them out.Looking for some kind of solace, Ellen vacations in the Bahamas with what's left of her kin, including surviving son Mike, his wife Carla, and their little daughter Thea. While there Ellen falls for a friendly pilot named Hoagie (Michael Caine) and starts to relax and laugh a little with him. Meanwhile, Mike and his humorous partner Jake (Mario Van Peebles) come across another Great White (the same one who killed Sean? Who knows for sure?) and try to study it behind Ellen's back. Just as things are starting to look up for Mrs. Brody again, her granddaughter is nearly attacked by the intruding shark and Ellen decides to confront her demon out on the ocean by herself, once and for all.The ending is so dumb and abrupt that it has to be seen to be believed. The Great White even roars with what sounds a lot like a looped growl of Spot from The Munsters! The Jaws premise is very limited to say the least, and the sequels themselves got (arguably) worse with every new chapter. So how did this despised installment fare for me this time around? Strangely, kind of watchable. While JAWS 2 is a much better movie, at least there's something of a plot attempt with #4. One of the biggest criticisms toward JAWS THE REVENGE is the unlikely notion of the same shark following Mrs. Brody all the way to the Bahamas; but in my view, despite the film's title and tag line (this time it's personal), this whole revenge nonsense really exists only in Ellen's troubled mind, and nowhere else. There is nothing in the movie itself to indicate that this isn't a second shark, even. After all she's been through, no wonder Ellen imagines her family's been jinxed!Mario Van Peebles is likable as Mike Brody's sidekick (though his immaculate fate on the currently available release of this is absurdly far-fetched). As Hoagie, Michael Caine hasn't really got a clue, but at least he's on hand to offer a little charm, if not much else. And Lorraine Gary is surprisingly good in this film, better even than she had been in JAWS and JAWS 2. Visually, director Joseph Sargent (COLOSSUS THE FORBIN PROJECT, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE) can't do as much with this tired old material as Jeannot Szwarc managed in Part 2, although the look of the ocean is quite picturesque. ** out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" (Possible Spoilers)Try catching this fourth (and final?) chapter of the deteriorating JAWS saga right after being exposed to the super-lousy JAWS 3-D and then try to tell yourself it's not at least a 'little' better than that one was.

It also has to be one of Alfred Hithcock's signature noir achievements; it is both popular an estimable for many reasons, I suggest. The set is one of the most memorable and imaginative eve--group of New York apartments across a courtyard, visible from his window to wheel-chair bound photographer Jimmy Stewart as he recovers from an accident suffered while photographing at an auto race track. Bored, he begins observing his neighbors, in a detached, using optical instruments where necessary and taking a few photographs. His would-be-fiancée, pretty Grace Kelly, begins by distrusting his entertaining himself in this manner; but his loquacious maid Thelma Ritter approves of his hobby. When Stewart believes he has discovered a murder perpetrated by Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald, a true figure of menace, he enlists the help of his police detective war buddy played magnificently by Wendell Corey. This is noir because the authorities charged with helping in such a case--his best friend--refuse to believe him. What follows is a double climax that is most exciting. Thorwald catches Kelly searching in the murder apartment, so Stewart has to call police to get her away; and then Thorwald penetrates his anonymity and comes after him, to try to kill him. Kelly does well as Stewart's snooty but courageous girl, and Ritter is in top form as an enthusiastic co-conspirator. No one else is given much to do in the film except to be background characters; but this talented group includes Jesslyn Fax, Frank Cady, songwriter Ross Bagdasarian, Judith Evelyn and Georgine Darcy. This script has been adapted from a fascinating story idea by veteran Cornell Woolrich; John Michael Hayes and director Hitchcock also contributed. This is an expensive-looking production wherein Waxman's subtle score, intricate settings, costumes, art direction, lighting, cinematography and sound are all far-above-average. Stewart has one of his best roles ever here, and Burr despite a lack of lines made a strong impression as the white-haired killer so much older than his own years. The film is perhaps overrated in importance; but it would nearly be impossible to overvalue the skill exerted by Hitchock in camera use or the cleverness of his management of space and time in achieving what we see here. The result is a polished gem of directing, from the daring opening 360 degree establishing pan shot that introduces us to Stewart's presently-limited world of action (with his broken leg) to the exciting climactic battle with Thorwald involving flashbulbs as a defense and police racing to save him before it's too late. Kelly throughout wants him to become a society photographer and marry her; Stewart wants to continue being a free-lance observer of the world in dangerous places. So the underlying theme of this low-key narrative is how people need to find out what makes them happy; the film is Stewart's evidence as Scotty that he needs to be who he is--a man who slakes his curiosity in the world by observing and remaining just a little detached.

They live together in present day New York preying on random people who they seduce, kill by slashing their throats with a hidden knife & drink their blood. However their existence is threatened because for some unexplained reason John starts to rapidly age, he seeks the help of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon) who is conducting research into premature ageing in a New York clinic. Sarah doesn't believe John at first & ignores him, after psychically witnessing his deterioration she is eager to help but John isn't interested anymore after being treated with contempt. John heads back home to Miriam who has seen this before, the attic in their house is full of the coffins of Miriam's past lover's who continually age but never die. John, who now looks like he's about 150 years old, kills a young girl named Alice Cavender (Beth Ehlers) but her blood doesn't make any difference. Miriam sticks John into a coffin & puts him with the rest as her thoughts turn to finding yet another lover. Sarah feels guilty about not believing John & decides to visit, as John is somewhat unavailable being shut in a coffin in the attic, Sarah speaks with Miriam but not for too long as they decide to jump into bed with each other. As they do what two adults usually do together in bed Miriam bites Sarah on the arm turning her into Miriam's next lover. As the days pass Sarah starts to get the 'hunger' that can only be satisfied by one thing, human blood!Directed by Tony Scott I thought that The Hunger was a unique, stylish & daring horror film. The script by James Costigan, Ian Davis & Micheal Thomas based on the novel by Whitley Strieber fore-goes most traditional Vampire folklore, there are no fangs, crucifixes, Vampire hunters, stakes through the heart or bats. The only aspect that defines The Hunger as a film with Vampires is that Miriam & John both drink blood occasionally. The Hunger is as much a romance as horror with the tragic relationship between Miriam & John & Miriam's eventual need for someone else to share the centuries with taking centre stage for most of The Hunger's running time. It's a great story which I found very engrossing, interesting & ultimately it worked for me on an emotional level which many horror films don't even try & attempt. Scott packs The Hunger with clever visual symbolism & directs with great style that encompasses wonderful use of light & colour, fantastic cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt in which not a single part of the frame is wasted & is used to near perfection & please whatever you do make sure you track this down in widescreen as it's the only way to both watch it & do it justice, great selection & use of music which ranges from classical to rock, unusual editing where not a single shot is pointless & which inter-cuts different scenes together to terrific effect & simply gorgeous production design by Brian Morris especially the attic scenes with the flowing white curtains blowing in the wind & white doves flying everywhere. There is a fair amount of nudity in The Hunger & it amazed me that Scott even made the lesbian sex scene between Deneuve & Sarandon seen like art! The special make-up effects credited to Carl Fullerton & Dick Smith are exceptional with David Bowie's transformation into an old man frighteningly realistic, there are also some nasty slashed throats & plenty of spurting blood along with a house full of rotting zombies at the end. The Hunger is technically brilliant throughout, is a pleasure to watch & I don't think you'll be able to find many better looking horror films. The acting is very good & Deneuve is pretty sexy. I think The Hunger is a film that I could probably talk about all day long as there are so many scenes which stand out & the themes it brings up are also worthy of longer discussion but I think it's a film that needs to be seen to be appreciated properly. It is a little slow at times & I definitely don't think it's for everyone, especially those who have a short attention span or those who don't like films that try to be 'different' shall we say.

","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Hunger tells the tale of a centuries old Egyptian Vampire named Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) & her lover John (David Bowie) who both seem to enjoy immortality as long as they satisfy their 'hunger' for blood. They live together in present day New York preying on random people who they seduce, kill by slashing their throats with a hidden knife & drink their blood. However their existence is threatened because for some unexplained reason John starts to rapidly age, he seeks the help of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon) who is conducting research into premature ageing in a New York clinic. Sarah doesn't believe John at first & ignores him, after psychically witnessing his deterioration she is eager to help but John isn't interested anymore after being treated with contempt. John heads back home to Miriam who has seen this before, the attic in their house is full of the coffins of Miriam's past lover's who continually age but never die. John, who now looks like he's about 150 years old, kills a young girl named Alice Cavender (Beth Ehlers) but her blood doesn't make any difference. Miriam sticks John into a coffin & puts him with the rest as her thoughts turn to finding yet another lover. Sarah feels guilty about not believing John & decides to visit, as John is somewhat unavailable being shut in a coffin in the attic, Sarah speaks with Miriam but not for too long as they decide to jump into bed with each other. As they do what two adults usually do together in bed Miriam bites Sarah on the arm turning her into Miriam's next lover. As the days pass Sarah starts to get the 'hunger' that can only be satisfied by one thing, human blood!Directed by Tony Scott I thought that The Hunger was a unique, stylish & daring horror film. The script by James Costigan, Ian Davis & Micheal Thomas based on the novel by Whitley Strieber fore-goes most traditional Vampire folklore, there are no fangs, crucifixes, Vampire hunters, stakes through the heart or bats.

I think it's supposed to be a deep character study, but the enigmatic main character, Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson), really doesn't express much emotion except some anger and some depression, and so seems rather stilted. And the supporting actors seem fairly shallow.The tag line for the movie is He rode the fast lane... on the road to nowhere and I would certainly agree with that last part, as the movie seems to lack direction. Dupea runs from job to job, woman to woman, town to town.I thought that the movie may have redeemed itself when Dupea visits his sick father, but unfortunately the father couldn't speak, which made for a somewhat one-sided reconciliation.A high point of the film is the classic chicken salad scene, about getting what you want.I've enjoyed other movies like Easy Rider and Withnail and I which were also set in the late sixties\/early seventies, but both of these movies had a strong rock soundtrack to help them along. In Five Easy Pieces we mainly have classical and country music.It has been said that Dupea is an archetypal non-conformist character which Nicholson used as a steppingstone to later roles. Perhaps, but there is a world of difference between, say, Dupea and the well-developed Randall McMurphy character in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Having said all this the movie did receive several Oscar nominations but, perhaps not surprisingly, no wins. I'm sorry but I can only give this movie 5\/10.

These are the shouts of anger and frustration that seep out of Vargas' mouth as he frantically beats information out of thugs responsible for kidnapping his wife. This being only a miniature plot point in unraveling the mess Vargas has gotten himself into in proving the corruption and guilt of a famous American cop and a Mexican drug boss respectively. Orson Welles' film noir tutorial on how to make a cinematic masterpiece is an experience you will never forget. Shot beautifully in black and white, it vividly portrays how humans abuse their power once in possession of it and is a masterful character study. Welles' ahead-of-its-time approach to film making with his famous and stylish camera angles that paint symbolic pictures on their subjects is a wonder to look at, giving his films such realism and credibility even by today's standards, as compared to the films of the day (1958), this was one of the most realistic of all. In addition to this, Orson Welles is one of the great story tellers and this is arguably the most brilliant detective film of all time.In what is one of the longest single cut intros ever captured on celluloid, the film begins with an assassination of an American business tycoon on the American side of the Mexican\/American border. A Mexican narcotics officer named Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his American wife Susan (Janet Leigh) witness the bombing on the Mexican side and Vargas heads over to help with crime scene investigations. It is only a matter of time before the famous intuition based Chief of Police on the American side Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) arrives at the scene to give his 'honest' opinion.The bomb was planted on the Mexican side, so Vargas decides to remain on the investigation. Following agreements and disagreements on jurisdiction, the cops on both sides of the border unite to investigate this horrible crime. However, on top of THIS investigation, Vargas has another problem. His involvement in the GRANDI narcotics cartel breakdown has him as an important witness in putting away the cartel's boss and therefore puts his wife in danger, as the boss's mafia, including his brother Joe Grandi attempt to threaten Vargis and scare him off the case, which could determine the boss' life or death verdict.Following little investigation on the bombing the previous night, with Vargas' wife safely brought to a remote motel in the desert to protect her from the Grandis, Vargas captures the hard edged corruption of Hank Quinlan in a red handed framing of a bombing suspect, who Quinlan claims is the guilty one according to his never failing intuition that was famous for bringing down previous criminals. Vargas' nosy, good-cop attitude to his work threatens Quinlan and it isn't long before he teams up with Joe Grandi in a conspiracy to frame Vargis - to prevent Vargis from putting both men away. What follows is deception, murder, abuse of power and greed and a complex character study that make this poignant film 'TOUCH OF EVIL' an unforgettable classic in its genre.Orson Welles created one of the darkest, most powerful film noirs ever assembled with 'Touch Of Evil'. Watching it, you feel like you are there the whole time with its rich Mexican atmosphere. Welles himself brings his fat hard-boiled corrupt, drunkard Police Chief Quinlan to life with such conviction that you hate him to death only 5 minutes into the film. It was the best, most effective corrupt cop portrayal I've ever seen. Charlton Heston's portrayal of a man in a dilemma in between doing his job as a good cop and being a husband was the most powerful aspect of the film. He plays a Mexican very well, and you easily forget it is Charlton Heston in the unusual role. Janet Leigh was perfect. Her beautiful and stand-strong exterior made her one hell of an actress and her performance was commanding and elegant. My favorite character however was Marlene Dietrich in her minor role as a tough mentally unbreakable prostitute 'Tanya'. Her attitude towards Quinlan, an old friend, is amusing and touching at the same time - her presence always accompanied by the film's only musical piece, rarely played throughout, that gives such a 'that's life' attitude to the film which is unforgettable. The tune will be playing in your head long after the film's conclusion. The cinematography is rough and crisp assisting the film's atmosphere impeccably. The rich black and white choice for filming is a feast for the eyes and Welles' film making techniques are modern and ahead of their time with powerful camera angles and smooth camera movements to move a complex story along.'Touch Of Evil' is the most patient, dark and captivating film noir of them all. The powerful imagery, the superb cast, the twisted plot and the haunting musical tune rarely played come together to formulate an almost dream-like experience. Film has rarely so vividly and masterfully painted corruption quiet like it. They don't make movies like this anymore.

They get a message for their girlfriends, the twins, and they talked about how their house is all trashed up thanks to them from the night before. Jesse says it'll be all right because they bought their girlfriends gifts. When they go outside to get the gifts in the car and go to the twins house they ask themselves a big question, Dude, Where's My Car? Together they must retrace their steps from the night before to find their car and patch up their relationships with only two clues, a fridge full of pudding and a match book from a local strip joint. They soon encounter hot alien chicks, a manly female stripper wanting a suitcase full of money, an annoying fast food lady, nerd alien hunters, wild ostriches, and hunky alien dudes to find their beloved car.When watching this movie I kept telling myself, this is a stoner flick. It's supposed to be stupid...well this film was beyond stupid. You have two idiots who retrace their steps from nothing because they were too wasted from the night before. This is the kind of movie where it had a good story but they made it too stupid even though it could of been a lot better. Sure you get a few laughs, a stoner dog, a crazed man in a cage, two dudes fighting over what the tattoos on their friends back says, and so on, and on, and repeats. This film is a perfect concoction of bad acting, bad scripting, and over all, bad movie! Not recommended unless your going to be wasted at a party and you won't remember it the next day.

Everyone knows how Romeo and Juliet, a well-written but Medievally gloomy Shakespearean tragedy, was adapted for West Side Story. The locale was moved from Northern Italy to New York City; the Montagues' and Capulets' servants and relatives were transformed into Euro-Ethnic Versus Puerto Rican youth gangs; and Romeo and Juliet became Tony and Maria. The basic premise probably seems interesting; the original play stressed the baselessness of the quarrel, the hot-blooded youth of the participants and the swiftness with which attachments were formed. In the play, also, a strong injunction was put onto the two sides in the war by authorities--and this is missing here. This I suggest is the dramatic key to why Romeo and Juliet is more violent than West Side Story--because to do what they do, the youth in Verona have to defy a strong edict. Lacking this, the rival gangs here only slowly escalate their quarrel to an artificial climax. The other odd element here is dance; the idea of stylizing human action as dance in a musical is one that has very seldom been tried. The fluid choreography by Jerome Robbins works well here for the most part; the use of real New York streets etc. permits a reality to play against--much as shadows may be thrown onto a prepared wall perfect for seeing them as outward shapes hinting at something more inward. The credit for the film's pace and power go to Ernest Lehman, Jerome Robbins and Arthur Laurents for the adaptation of the original play; to Robert Wise and Robbins for the direction; to Irene Sharaff for her costumes and Daniel L. Fapp for luminous cinematography. Among the huge, largely spear-carriers or dancers participating cast, acting honors go to Rita Moreno, Simon Oakland, William Bramley, Ned Glass Natalie Wood, and Susan Oaks as Anybodys; Russ Tamblyn and George Chakiris do well; no one else is particularly good except Tony Mordente. But they do not have to be; they are playing young people, meaning they need intelligence, energy and purpose, and these are supplied by all concerned in abundant measure. Songs such as Tonight, Somewhere, The Jets' Ballet, Maria, America, I Feel Pretty, Your Love is Your Loveand others have become famous; and the film won many nominations. It is innovative in many ways, engrossing, captivating, and occasionally not-too-well-acted. But the essence of the film is motion, I assert, and seldom has movement been used so effectively in any film in my judgment. A+ for effort is the least one can give any aspect of this unusual movie. The music by Leonard Bernstein carries the day, always interesting and never dull; and the lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are terrifically on target. This is a musical whose emotional appeal is perhaps very hard to resist.

The original - a psychological thriller with mostly excellent acting. Mitchum understated and therefore so menacing. Shot in black and white. A lovely and unnerving score by Bernard Herrmann - the music itself worth the price of admission.The remake - loud and brutal, with the underlying psychology taking the back seat and the director relying on de Niros (over)acting and special effects.Don't misunderstand. I enjoyed them both! Scorsese is a very gifted director and de Niro one of the best actors of his generation. But the original is, to me, so clearly superior in important aspects (acting, photography, musical score...). You may say the difference is aesthetical. I think there is more to it than that. Many of those writing of their disappointment with the original here are probably younger people who saw the remake first, and were expecting something other than psychological subtlety and b\/w photography. If generations can understand what they see differently, perhaps something is gained. Especially if the young can see what makes the original great, I think.I am 47, and yes, I thought The Shining was the greatest horror movie I had seen until there was a rubber doll in the bathtub.

As they try and piece together how it happened, they also embark on an emotional journey that aches for a resolution&#133;Building on his previous success with Happy Together and Chungking Express, Wong Kar Wai gives us this rather old fashioned and marvellous story of reawakened passions, yearning and unrequited love. Possibly, In the Mood for Love is not to everyone's taste. It wanders in rather lazily at 98mins not particularly long for a film, but it appears longer because not a lot really happens. But this lazy feel conceals a quite tightly constructed film. Most of the story is cunningly woven around a series of set piece role plays, where the characters act out presumed scenarios between their respective spouses, trying to work out how the affair started. I say cunning because, of course, this makes it difficult for the audience (and the characters) to tell what is in-role and what is genuine. If all this sounds rather arty and self-conscience, that's because it is. Unashamedly so. And it is played to perfection by two of Hong Kong's finest, Maggie Cheung and Leung Chui Wai, with some excellent support from Ping Lam Siu and Rebecca Pan.It is also a virtuoso performance by Wong Kar Wai, who treats the audience to a sensory, and sensual, overload. Bringing together Christopher Doyle (who later deployed his lush, over-ripe style on Hero) and Pin Bing Lee (whose beautifully understated style can be seen on Springtime in a Small Town) was cinematographic genius. It has all the bold beauty of Doyle, without, frankly, the Athena-poster cheesiness of his work on Hero. The music, as always with Wong, is prominent. From Nat King Cole singing in Spanish, to the haunting strings of the main theme, it perfectly matches the eclectic beauty of the images. All in all a top film, whether judged on plot, acting, cinematography or soundtrack. Similar to, but more accessible than, Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire, this is a beautiful, old fashioned story about love lost and regained. And watch out for Tony Leung's hotel room 2046, which presaged Wong's recent film of the same name.
