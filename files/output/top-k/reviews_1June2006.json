It's not as mindless as The Bachelor Party or The Money Pit, though. There is quite a bit of rattiness in there. As the title says this movie is about suburban life and it gives a good roasting to the bored, nosy inhabitants of the 'burbs.Tom Hanks plays Ray Peterson, who is somehow the hero of the story and the leader of the neighborhood. He always acts as if he was the reasonable guy when he's really no different from his acquaintances. He's a henpecked husband and he spies on the Klopeks, the strange new people who moved in next door, just like everybody else does. Ray and his friends suspect weird ongoings in their new neighbors' house and begin to investigate the disappearance of Walter, an old man from the block.Besides its satirical look at small-minded small town-folk, The 'burbs is first and foremost a light comedy with countless classic one liners and hilarious characters, all embodied perfectly by the respective actors (I always thought that Dan Aykroyd would have made a great Art, but Rick Ducommun also did a fantastic job).Director Joe Dante, the man who had also made Gremlins, Innerspace and Explorers, is a master when it comes to making dark adventure movies, so The 'burbs has more than just a touch of that, too. As Peter and his pals begin their investigation with all their supposed cleverness and their military spying toys one feels like watching The Goonies, except with grown men in a grown up world. (Speaking of The Goonies, Corey Feldman is in this movie, too, in one of his last great roles as the neighborhood's meatball MTV kid.) We, the audience, get sucked into the adventure ourselves. We also want to know whether the Klopeks are just cranky people or if they're really hiding something. We become just as nosy and shameless as Ray's little troupe.The 'burbs is a bonafide classic and deserves a much higher ranking on IMDb. FACT!

Recently, this movie has been overshadowed by his 1962 follow-up epic, the comparatively more elaborate Lawrence of Arabia, but this richly textured WWII-set adventure is special enough on its own terms. While it has its share of action and suspense presented in exacting detail, the film is even more resonant as a psychological drama about the test of wills between mission-driven officers amid the perils of wartime survival.The plot takes place in 1943 when after surrendering in Singapore, Col. Nicholson marches his ragged British company into a Japanese prisoner work camp in the Burmese jungle (this is where the famous whistling of Colonel Bogey March is first heard). The erudite Col. Saito runs the camp and demands that the new prisoners build a massive railway bridge, a critical juncture between Rangoon and Malaysia. In a classic stand-off, Nicholson finally forces Saito to respect Geneva Convention and not allow his officers to do manual labor on the construction. Upon his ironic Pyrrhic victory, Nicholson slowly descends into the madness of seeing the completed bridge as a potential morale booster for his battle-weary men. Meanwhile, shortly after Nicholson's arrival, U.S. Navy Cmdr. Shears escapes from the camp only to be later blackmailed into joining a British commando mission led by do-or-die Maj. Warden and hesitant Lt. Joyce with the sole goal of blowing up the bridge. Through Peter Taylor's thoughtful film editing, the movie breathlessly alternates between the parallel story lines of the bridge construction and the jungle commando mission until the exciting climax.Lean's accomplishments are many with this memorable film - the authenticity of the Burmese jungle locations (filmed in Sri Lanka), the seamless integration of the two story lines, the masterful handing of the final scenes, and in particular, the gradual metamorphosis of Nicholson from a by-the-book British officer to Saito's willing collaborator. A frequent participant in Lean's films, Alec Guinness gives his career-best performance as Nicholson providing all sorts of unexpected shades to his complex characterization. As Shears, William Holden does what he did best in the 1950's, concurrently exude natural bravado and a conflicted soul and then added a layer of cynicism that dares to challenge the viewer to support him. The 68-year old Sessue Hayakawa came out of retirement to play Saito and delivers a subtle performance of unbending discipline and pained humiliation. Jack Hawkins and Geoffrey Horne lend sturdy support as Warden and Joyce respectively. With the same expert eye he lent to Summertime, Jack Hildyard provides the superbly expressive and composed cinematography. Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, both blacklisted at the time, wrote the brilliantly developed screenplay. This is essential viewing.The two-disc 2000 Limited Edition DVD set has a pristine print transfer with great sound making the entire experience feel surprisingly fresh upon viewing. There is a nearly hour-long documentary on Disc Two, The Making of The Bridge on the River Kwai, produced for the DVD and full of intriguing insight into the production logistics. There are a couple of shorter featurettes produced around the time of the film's original release, the first is a black-and-white teaser for the film itself and the second a rather pedestrian lesson in Film 101 produced by USC grad students and introduced by Holden. Director John Milius provides a respectful tribute to the film in another short.
