Like his other movies -- maybe even more so -- this one is a diamond, and Kubrick wore the jeweler's glass. Every facet, every detail seems to have been considered and carefully calculated.  The colors and the sets -- both of which are incredible -- stand out in this regard.  Each one means something and expresses it.  The score is the same way -- to me, it surpasses even the Psycho score in its contribution to the more frightening moments of the movie.  Towards the end of the film -- at the climax, in fact, when I should have been used to it -- I jumped at those piano shrieks.  Twice.  When this movie decided to be scary, it was the most scary and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The sex in this movie -- though I think it is a study of sex -- is of secondary note.  This is not a porno, and the sex in it is not steamy or sexual.  Most of it is downright eerie. If this movie does not win at least two Oscars -- Best Picture and Best Director (neither of which a Kubrick film has ever won, much to my astonishment) -- I will never pay attention to the academy again, because this will be final proof that it has no taste.  Also, I have learned two things about the censoring of this picture (1) Kubrick realized that he would have to add the digital characters to get an R rating, and planned to do so.  Though they were added after he died, it was according to his wishes, and (2) I didn't even notice the digitally added characters. They affected the movie or the scene in no way at all.  Though the MPAA are Puritannical Retards, and I am disappointed that I live in the only country in the world that made him add these things, even the MPAA could not damage Kubrick's work.  Besides, I am sure that an NC-17 version will at least come out on video, and that will settle that. This final film -- most aptly described by Janet Maslin as haunting -- gets an 11 from me.  Kubrick was entirely in a class by himself.  The film is forever diminished by his loss, but at least he left us with a collection of movies to watch in awe forever.  Eyes Wide Shut is definitely a worthy addition to this collection.  Thank you, Stanley. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 1999","score":"","review":"  This movie may well be Stanley Kubrick's best.

With Walt gone, all this material means to the company is Happy Meals and video sales. Gadget is an outrage of giant magnitude. The latest in a string of Disney live action family films with no class and no respect to the viewer.If anything is inspired about Inspector, it might be the casting of Matthew Broderick as our multi-gadgeted hero. Broderick still has the right amount of fresh faced charm and honest personality for the role. I doubt anybody else could have been a better choice to play the character, but then again I can't see anyone else taking the part after reading the script. The plot is basic, evil Claw(Rupert Everett in an embarrassing performance) vs. good Gadget. They also take the time to show us the origins of the characters, something the show never did. I would like to know why, in each of these cartoon or comic based movies, do we need to show the character foundations. Gadget would have been a lot more satisfying if they just dropped us in on the action and skipped the needless back story.Distressing, almost hilariously so, is the use of Gadget's thought balloons for three key moments. It's no secret that this film tested very poorly and was continuously edited down to the current bare bones running time of 80 minutes. What was deleted was basically every inch of narrative(check out the Evil Joely Fisher, in purple latex, that comes out of nowhere and then leaves even quicker) and character, leaving only the action and more action aspects of the movie intact. I submit that this might be the first film that could legally be diagnosed with ADD. But back to the thought balloons...

It's weird to describe it, it's even weirder to see it.Since this is Disney flick, the filmmakers also include heaps of product placement. To those who found the gratuitous Austin Powers 2 beer plug distasteful should stay away from the Gadget McDonalds, Skittles, Coke products, Tommy clothes(see below), and most blatantly, the Yahoo Internet corporation plugs. I've come to expect this behavior, but the discretion in which the placements are being presented is getting faint.With the use of a huge budget the film does have the unique virtue of fully fleshing out the Inspector's gadgets. I'm trying hard not to be a sour puss, so I will heartily admit that the special effects are great. They colorfully display Gadget's trinkets more realistically than I could have imagined. The filmmakers deserve credit for the creation, but they ruin it with Gadget constantly in the midst of mayhem. There should've been more opportunities for Gadget to breathe, for the audience to get used to madness. No such luck. Gadget runs at full steam from opening credits to closing credits.Almost sacrilegiously, the filmmakers have also decided to tamper with the essence of Gadget. Niece Penny (sharply played by Michelle Tractenberg, in full Tommy Hillfiger gear) and canine Brain were, in the cartoon, the real reason Gadget got out of trouble. The real inspectors behind the Gadget. In this film, the two are quickly introduced and then quickly forgotten. The film relies on Gadget alone to solve the crime. He bumbles has way across town while Brain and Penny sit and watch. By taking out the essential charm, why did they even bother to make the film?

Almost every scene involving sex in some way felt like Kubrick was tempting the audience slowly and deliberately with a hint of danger and then yanking it away. Watching Cruise go through this ritual of sticking his hand close to the fire and pulling it away was done to perfection. Kidman's role was less than I expected but she did a grand job of pushing Cruise to seek pleasure because of jealousy, but at what cost?

Seriously, Rose McGowan tried, but couldn't carry the movie. Her voice is so bitchy and bratty it got annoying. One good thing about her is she is built like a real woman with hips instead of the usual anorexic standard for actresses these days. Kind of like the feminine ideal from the 50's, except all the raunchy tattoos kind of ruin that effect. The cameo by her boyfriend, Mr. Manson, was kind of amusing. But the movie seemed like they were making it up as they went along, and very predictable. Terrible script, and your believability is stretched way too far. After Courtney (McGowan) and her clique kidnap one of their pals, things go awry and she (the pal) ends up dead. They drive around, freaking out, all except for Courtney, who has the brilliant plan to call the high school, pretend to be the dead pal's mom, and call in sick for her. OK, what is one of the first things the police would ask the kid's mom after she turned up dead? Sheeeesh. Rebecca Gayheart's acting is slowly improving. I give this movie two stars, one for Pam Grier, one for the sheer mean-spiritedness and bad taste of it. But that's not enough to save this dog of a movie, and the jailbait band The Donnas weren't enough to save it either. Oh, and I liked the Donnas better the first time I heard them, when they were called The Ramonas and The Runaways. I wouldn't bother, unless you are a big Rose McGowan fan.

OK, what is one of the first things the police would ask the kid's mom after she turned up dead? Sheeeesh. Rebecca Gayheart's acting is slowly improving. I give this movie two stars, one for Pam Grier, one for the sheer mean-spiritedness and bad taste of it. But that's not enough to save this dog of a movie, and the jailbait band The Donnas weren't enough to save it either. Oh, and I liked the Donnas better the first time I heard them, when they were called The Ramonas and The Runaways. I wouldn't bother, unless you are a big Rose McGowan fan.

Seriously, Rose McGowan tried, but couldn't carry the movie. Her voice is so bitchy and bratty it got annoying. One good thing about her is she is built like a real woman with hips instead of the usual anorexic standard for actresses these days. Kind of like the feminine ideal from the 50's, except all the raunchy tattoos kind of ruin that effect. The cameo by her boyfriend, Mr. Manson, was kind of amusing. But the movie seemed like they were making it up as they went along, and very predictable. Terrible script, and your believability is stretched way too far.

First of all, it is an extremely unrealistic portrayal of life in a college.  I couldn't help but roll my eyes at some of the ridiculous scenes (the ladder-window scene, smoking reefer with professors).  Second of all, it is most certainly not Belushi's best film--see the Blues Brothers for that.  Thirdly, it is not the funniest comedy of its era--hands down, that would be Airplane.  And lastly, it is not the funniest college movie; no, I'm not thinking of PCU, I'm referring to Higher Learning, a movie with so much unintentional laughter, I nearly wet my pants.  Anyway, if you must see it because of the hype, go ahead, but you'll get an unmistakable feeling of disappointment if you do.

The acting isn't anything to look at, the characters are two dimensional, and the FX aren't all that great either.

My four friends and I laughed through most of the movie (we are all women, by the way) as did most of the people in the theater with us.  Never saw so many breasts in my life, it's all you could look at, forget the dialogue, no one was paying attention to the words.  The musical score was jarring and annoying, I may have not been so annoyed with the movie if it had not been for the score.I think men were short-changed in this movie, they were portrayed as idiots who thought a woman's fantasies were an act of betrayal and so to get even they should go out a have sex with anyone who was willing.  And what kind of idiot would tell her husband stuff like that anyway, get real!After a while the f.. word and the nudity were ineffective because they were everywhere!  This movie reminded me of a bad porno movie, lots of sex, or in Tom Cruise's case, lots of opportunity,  and little plot.  What a waste of 305 minutes - I guess I just kept thinking it just had to get better if I just stuck with it.. unfortunately it didn't.  Waste of time and money.
