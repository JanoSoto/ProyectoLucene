Based on the true story, first-time crooks Sonny Wortzik (BAFTA winning, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino) and Sal (The Godfather's Golden Globe nominated John Cazale) entered the Chase Manhattan First Savings Bank in Flatbush, Brooklyn hoping to carry out a quick robbery. They took their guns out and got the held up staff to take out the money, but they didn't realise that the bank had been emptied out earlier, so there isn't much money to take. Soon the phone rings, it is Police Captain Det. Sgt. Eugene Moretti (The Muppet Movie's Golden Globe nominated Charles Durning) wanting to speak to Sonny, the building is surrounded with the city's whole police force, and a crowd wanting to see something. Sonny goes outside to see for himself, and shouting his defensive words he gets the crowd on his side, but he and Sal have little options to get out of this. Sonny starts making some demands to get out of their situation, he wants a car ready to take him, Sal and the remaining hostages to the airport with a ready plane to fly abroad. While the hostages relax a little more, Sonny also demands that they bring his wife to talk to, who is revealed to be his gay lover Leon Shermer (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Chris Sarandon), the money stolen would have been for his sex change operation. Eventually, after little progress, and the FBI led by Agent Sheldon (James Broderick) showing up, a car is ready for Sonny and Sal, and a plane is also ready at the airport. With the co-operation of the police and FBI, Sonny and Sal get the remaining hostages into the car, letting go only one, and they are joined by driver Murphy (Lance Henriksen). They reach the airport with little problems, and see the approaching plane, but Sal is the more dangerous of the two men, so Murphy shoots him between the eyes, while Sonny is arrested and ready for prison, the hostages are safe and sound. Also starring Sully Boyar as Mulvaney, Penelope Allen as Sylvia, Carol Kane as Jenny, Beulah Garrick as Margaret, Sandra Kazan as Deborah, Marcia Jean Kurtz as Miriam, Amy Levitt as Maria, John Marriott as Howard, Estelle Omens as Edna and Gary Springer as Stevie. Pacino gives a really good performance with a mixture of emotions, the supporting cast also do well in their parts, and it has some good moments to put you in the scenes, it may be a little weird but its all apparently true, so a very watchable crime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Al Pacino was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 86 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (Attica!

It is depressing. It's whole reason for being seams to cater to people who are so frustrated with the pressure of the Holidays that they want to blow off steam by flipping around and mock the whole holiday scene. For that is what it does. It mocks every holiday tradition in sight. The characters are despicable and insensitive. The only things I could relate to is the washing out the mouth with soap as punishment for saying a swear word and the decoder ring because that happened to me. Otherwise the story is blatantly unbelievable. A nine year old kid who still believes in Santa Claus? A grandmother who still knits a full body bunny suit pajamas for a nine year old child but not for his younger brother? Those type of pajamas are for toddlers and infants. No sane person would make them for a kids even at the age of six. But yet we are led to believe that the grandmother is so senile that she still thinks Ralphie is still 6 years old when he is nine in the movie. How about the parents stepping in to tell the grandmother to stop making those pajamas because the kid is too old for them and she is embarrassing him. That would be the realistic thing to do. But do they in this film? No. They seam to enjoy embarrassing their own son by forcing him to wear them. Or how believable is it to have a nine year child still going to a department store Santa, sitting on his lap and ask for a BB. Gun? Not very. Worst yet, no department or mall would ever allow their Santa to put his foot in the face of a child to push him down a slide. They would have faced a ton of law suits. Another absolutely unbelievable part of the film was Darren McGavin as the father The Old Man - Mr. Parker. He was way too old to be married to Melinda Dillon Mrs. Parker and still be called a young couple in the film. He looks like should be having Grandchildren or Great-grandchildren instead of his first round of offspring. Yes, I understand this story is presented through the distorted lens of a child viewing his parents as old. I just think that if you can spot the dye in McGavin's hair, the director carried the exaggeration to far and broke the willing suspension of disbelief. I never bought for a moment McGavin as being the father in that family. The mother is not that much better. A woman who has a husband who has swear words pouring out of his mouth freely as water flowing over the edge of Niagara falls but yet is shocked when one of her sons eventually starts using the same language he had picked up from his father. Come on! Even Though nonsense words are substituted for the real swear words, it is clear what was really meant that the father was saying and what Ralphie was saying. The F word and it is not Fudge. The father doesn't think his foul mouth isn't partly the blame? Also the bit of the mother separating the two boys fighting but not stopping to see if one boy is alright when she sees that one boy has a bloody nose was a bit far-fetched. How many mothers you know act like that? Not many. Ralphie was just plainly stupid. He should have known better at his age not to swear in front of his parents. Here is another piece of stupidity by Ralphie. After being told how dangerous BB rifles were and was told not to place the target in front of a metal surface because BBs ricochet off of metal, what does he do? He places the target on a lattice in front of a metal fence where the BB goes through the target, through the lattice and hits the metal fence and ricochets back and hits Ralphie in the glasses on the first shot. As for the story and the jokes, the story was predictable and the many of the jokes were ether not funny, or just plain flat. Every plot point was televised a mile ahead of time. I mean I knew from the from almost the start that Ralphie was going to get his BB. rifle and shoot his eye out in the end. I knew the tongue was going to stick to the flagpole. I knew that the mother was somehow going destroy the leg lamp. As far as the leg lamp gag went, that was not that funny in the first place and got old faster than a particle traveling at the speed of light. The story is so bereft of content that a group of animators made a 30 second parody of it that covers every important point in the story.

","genre":"Comedy, Family"},{"date":"25 August 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Naturally, in a film like this, the what that happens is not as important as the how it happens. And this makes all the difference, as nothing I could describe to the viewer could resonate as deeply as what is seen. There are numerous camera shots that establish mood (most notably the famed 'magic hour' landscapes, and scenes wherein words are not spoken, but glances tell the tale). There are great scenes- such as when locusts swarm the fields, and when a fire breaks out at night as Bill and the Farmer fight. The audio commentary by editor Billy Weber, art director Jack Fisk, costume designer Patricia Norris, and casting director Dianne Crittenden, lends great insight into how these scenes were achieved without special effects, and with some danger. The locusts were really peanuts shells tossed from a helicopter, as the actors walked backward, to give the effect that the shells\/locusts were rising upward and the fire scenes were not as well-controlled as thought. Also, there is quite a revelation as to the extent that Malick changed the film in two years of postproduction, cutting much filmed dialogue, and replacing it with the Manz narration. Another bit of trivia ia that John Travolta was the initial choice for the role of Bill, but the ABC television network would not let him out of his contract for the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter.But, there are a few other nice features on The Criterion Collection DVD. There are interviews with cinematographer Haskell Wexler and cameraman John Bailey, and an interview with Richard Gere, plus a booklet that has an essay on the film by film critic Adrian Martin, which is rather rote observations that many others have made before, and a piece from the autobiography of cinematographer Nestor Almendros that deals with the film. The 95 minute film is shown in a 1.781 aspect ratio, and is superb. There is one puzzling oddity in the Criterion release vis-à-vis an earlier 1999 Paramount Pictures DVD version of the film, and that is the lack of the original theatrical trailer that the Paramount release included.Of course, given the high and truly transcendent quality of the film, it is little wonder that few critics praised it upon its release, and even those who appreciated the film still did not fundamentally get it. As an example of the former claim, I give you the stolid Pauline Kael, of The New Yorker, who wrote that, 'the film is an empty Christmas tree you can hang all your dumb metaphors on it.' Of the latter claim I give you the Chicago Sun-Times' Roger Ebert, who in re-reviewing the film decades later, wrote, 'We do not feel the full passion of the adults because it is not her (Linda's) passion It is seen at a distance, as a phenomenon, like the weather, or the plague of grasshoppers that signals the beginning of the end.' This is an excellent observation that explains why much of the film's 'passion' seems to be missing, considering the center of the story seems to be a love triangle, that oldest of motivs. This is because the whole film is Linda's tale, and she was not directly involved. But, just as one feels that Ebert may have gotten a grasp of the film, he shows his readers that his insight was just another case of a hundred darts being tossed blindfoldedly, with one lucky sucker hitting the bull's-eye, for he later writes 'This is a movie made by a man who knew how something felt, and found a way to evoke it in us. That feeling is how a child feels when it lives precariously, and then is delivered into security and joy, and then has it all taken away again- and blinks away the tears and says it doesn't hurt.' Well, no. Period. The reason the film is constructed the way it is is not because it is emotion-based, as Ebert and a plethora of lesser critics claim (despite writing of the claim in a convincing way- the man did win a Pulitzer for his wordsmithing, after all), but because it has a fantastic screenplay, constructed in postproduction, which chooses a very unique narrative form- one based upon inferences and implications (they are different beasts) and told through emotional snippets. It is not because emotion has replaced narrative, but emotion has been tamed to a narrative tool, along with a purely visual anecdoture cribbed from the silent era.In this way, like 2001, Days Of Heaven does not prove that a great film can succeed without any story, but shows the essential need for a great story to make great cinema. Malick simply went beyond the scope of most critics' rudimentary understanding of what a narrative looks like and how it should be conveyed, in emotive threads or in silent fenestration of images. Add to that the revolutionary use of voice-over to act as both tangential relief and ironic commentary, and, even were the acting mediocre (it is not, for it is truly acting when dialogue is superfluous) or the camera-work pedestrian (it is not), the film would be great, anyway. But given the quality of all the other elements, Malick's daring makes this film one for the ages; one which be studied long after the species has left behind the planet earth, and only such images of it remain. Perhaps our descendants will feel for it (and the film that conveys it to them) the way Linda feels for an anomic friend she reacquaints with at film's end, when she opines, in a Huckleberry Finnian way, 'This girl, she didn't know where she was going' or what she was going' to do.

This is where I think the point of what this story is meant to portray is being lost by the viewer.

In a way, Norman Maine gave his life for his wife to be born, he felt he was hampering her career and her life, so he wished to free her. Janet Gaynor was a star long before this movie came out, so it is really unfair to state that one can't believe she didn't appear to be someone that could have made such an impact in Hollywood. She'd been playing the naive type for quite some time, she played it well here, but she, also, portrayed her progressive maturity quite well and quite believably. As for me, this version shines far above the remake, because of the main character portrayals and for the outstanding supporting cast. This movie focused on the Gaynor character's experiences influenced by those around her, mostly with March's character. The remake seemed, to me, to focus mostly on the Garland character a little too much, not really getting the feel of those around her other than James Mason's character, but even it wasn't as deeply explored and conveyed as the Norman Maine character of the 1937 version.

When you have a great cast like this, with a script this well written and a great director like William Wellman (whom had some very, very great pre-codes under his belt), it's a win-win situation.

They just tried to jam pack too much stuff in there. After it hits the 1 hour mark, it's back in top form and draws you quickly in again, making you become invested in the story at hand.

It's not bad (its actually kind of fun), just makes the project weaker in that time. A lot happens and it's very talkie, and the film doesn't give the audience a second to breathe and comprehend what's going on.The dialogue makes it a little confusing. It also seems like there is crime after crime after crime, I thought to myself Why should I care? Though, I must say it's the only flaw.

It's actually the first film I saw by myself at the movie theaters. I liked it when I was 14, but I always make sure when I write a review that I see a movie more recently. Movies as I remember them are not always what they are.Fourteen years later, even though Michael Jordan has retired and CGI animation reigns supreme, Space Jam still stands up. Critics may label it a kid's movie, but its dialogue is funny and far from intelligence insulting. Plus, I thought the overall story was creative and inventive, although a little weird and out there sometimes. But hey, aren't all Looney Tunes a little weird and out there? Aren't those characteristics what has made them relevant throughout many generations?I loved the fact that this movie could have been a vanity piece for Michael Jordan, but it wasn't. The temptation must have been there to make a movie similar to Muhammad Ali's mediocre The Greatest (1977). After all, Jordan was at the height of his popularity at the time this movie was released, and the Chicago Bulls had just won the NBA Finals that year (with two more championship wins to come).With the Looney Tunes added into the mix, you get a far more creative premise. I really liked how the movie took place circa 1993-1995, from when Jordan retired from the NBA to his notorious stint playing minor league baseball for the Birmingham Barons (a farm team for the Chicago White Sox) to his triumphant return to the Bulls. I would really like to know how the premise came about to have the Looney Tunes characters persuade Jordan to take up basketball again. It doesn't matter who came up with it or how. It was just weaved into the real life story very creatively.As random a plot as it is, the Looney Tunes live in a cartoon community underneath the Earth, and puny aliens from a failing intergalactic amusement park called Moron Mountain come to abduct the cartoon characters for their next attraction. These aliens are not very smart, prompting the clever Bugs Bunny to convince them to challenge the Looney Tunes to a basketball game instead of immediately kidnapping them. The aliens agree, except they also apparently have the ability to steal basketball playing ability (or talent) from real NBA players. Each of the five aliens gets into the brains of Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Larry Johnson, Muggsy Bogues, and Shawn Bradley, and steal their talent. Apparently, this also gives the aliens the ability to shape shift and become large monsters, or MonSTARS, as they are known here.If you really try to insert logic into this plot, you're going to hate this movie. Looney Tunes cartoons were never logical, so why should this plot be? They were always funny and entertaining, and so is this movie.Once Michael Jordan enters their cartoon world, it's amazing how well he interacts with the characters. Perhaps the best scene is when Bugs Bunny kisses Jordan, and the reaction from him that follows. Jordan's not a great actor, obviously, but you really forget while you're watching this movie that he is actually in front of a green screen not talking to anyone. This is by far the best live action and animation combination since Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).There's really little to fault this movie on. It's funny both in animation and real life. Wayne Knight as pushy publicist Stan Podolak was very funny, and Bill Murray (as himself) was especially hilarious, particularly when he joins the Tune Squad. I still love how Daffy Duck asked him how he got to the cartoon world, and he says (in typical Bill Murray style), Oh, the producer's a friend of mine. I had one of the teamster's drop me off. It gets me every time.I highly recommend Space Jam. It is one of the best kids movies ever made, its story is random, but solid, and its a highly enjoyable film, not to mention a fitting tribute to the Looney Tunes and the NBA glory days of the 1990's.

The film takes place in modern day California.The movie starts out with a man and a woman having a conversation in a public park with a large crowd. This conversation is of much importance as to the rest of the film because it is being recorded by a man named Harry Caul (Hackman) and the crew he works with. Caul is a professional in the surveillance business and is considered to be the best on the west coast. When Caul finishes touching up the tapes he recorded he goes to give it to the director for $15,000 but only the director's assistant (Harrison Ford) is there. Caul decides not to give them to the assistant because he wants to give them directly to the director. Then Caul heads to a surveillance convention where he meets a man, Bernie Moran (Garfield). Moran is very competitive and thinks he is the best at the job in the country and pushes a few too many of Caul's buttons. The main plot of the film is that the tapes that Caul has he believes are evidence that will be used so the director can kill these two people and he does not feel morally correct giving the director the man and woman's death warrant.The screenplay was very smart, especially for a thriller. The film is not the average thriller in any way, it has no guns or chase scenes. It is mostly psychological. At points though during the film is was slow and somewhat boring, but it made up for it in the end. There was a lot of characterization in this film which I liked a lot. I completely understood Caul's feelings and I also knew that he was getting annoyed with Moran since the very beginning. In almost every aspect except for the parts where it was slow.Francis Ford Coppola reaffirms the fact that he is a fantastic director with this film. He keeps the suspense going the whole way through and has many beautiful shots. Many of the shots are like surveillance cameras which is just brilliant. He definitely knows how to get great performances out of his actors especially Hackman. He proved that he was the greatest director for the decade of the 1970s but sadly after that decade he did nothing really noteworthy. Hopefully he will come back into mainstream films and end his career on a high note.The acting in this film was magnificent. Gene Hackman was wonderful as the lead being a very introverted type of person. His character was so real he was easily the best part of the film. The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his performance is one of the greatest Oscar snubs in history. If someone had told me that he won the Oscar I would have believed them immediately and said that he deserved it. The rest of the cast acted fine as well. John Cazale had a small part but played it perfectly as did Harrison Ford. Allen Garfield gave a really strong performance as the competitive Moran, who was quite annoying. Overall a very strong ensemble performance.The score for this film was also great and it never missed a beat. It was suspenseful at times and calm at other times and it connected the whole film together. Francis Ford Coppola's films all seem to have great scores in the 70s.Overall I give this film a strong 8\/10, it is a great addition to Coppola's filmography and has an ending that will keep you thinking. I recommend this film to those who enjoy thought provoking suspense films.

Sure, it had some interesting elements, but it's not enough to make me think that this was a movie which really needed to be made.A central character in this movie is super-rich...all the perks of the landed gentry...which is what makes this movie seem like something Jane Austen might have flirted with...or Lifestyles of the rich and famous. For a Bond movie, it has little wit to it.Exotic locations Paris, San Francisco.Plot A microchip which is immune to the magnetic pulse of a nuclear blast has been developed for Britain, giving it a tactical edge against the Soviet Union. However, when the company manufacturing the chip is taken over by a private company, the Soviets may secretly get their hands on the technology. Super spy James Bond must investigate the owner of the private company to see if he is working for the Russians.Franchise clichés Pre-title sequence - Has the first disclaimer in a Bond movie! For some reason the producers want to assure us that the owner and his private company depicted in this movie is not real. Phew! But wait...does that mean the owner of the private company in Moonraker IS real? Now I'm scared! You then get the bog standard gun barrel sequence where Moore has a relaxed but efficient gait (cf some of Connery's wobbly kneed efforts!). You have another common Bond sequence of a ski chase...Russians are chasing him and you hear California girls on the soundtrack. Hmm.Theme song - By Duran Duran. Not a favourite of mine. Has drumming redolent of The Power Station...that band featured some members of Duran Duran. In fact, The Power Station had their first hit before this movie was released...maybe some cross over influence here? The visuals for this song seems to contain beautiful women dancing with glow in the dark dildos...but don't quote me on that! Silly female character names - May Day. OK, that's not over the top. Jenny Flex...get it?Sexism\/misogyny - Bond is patronising at times...or maybe he's being avuncular? Wine fetish - Bond orders Bollinger '75. This brand is mentioned in the end credits.

Hmm...seem to remember reading somewhere that actual wine buffs think that the movie Bond has less than connoisseur taste! Q -He's back. The usual guy...Connery's last turn as Bond a few years previously (in Never say never again) had a new character with that moniker. And the relationship between Bond and Q isn't as unpleasantly poisonous as it was in Moore's previous movie, Octopussy.End teaser - Yes, but no specific title, just James Bond will return.Watch out for * Christopher Walken's boyishly nerdy psychopath. One of the good elements to this movie.* Bond recovering a chip from 003 in Siberia...seeing other 00s is rare in this franchise.* a lesson in ee-nun-cee-ay-shun by Bond...pretending to be St.John Smith...it's actually pronounced sin-gin-smythe.

Not sure if this is the last time that Gogol appears in this franchise.* James Bond's cover identity...James Stock, London Financial Times. See what he did there? Notes to self - Surete means? - Pola Ivanova...has she appeared in previous Bond movies? - hmm...not sure about the plausibility of the evil scheme at the heart of this movie. Not sure if the notion of double earthquakes seals the issue or not!Conclusion Christopher Walken plays a different kind of Bond villain...more willing to do the dirty work himself, up close. He's interesting. Grace Jones as May Day ends up having an interesting story arc. But these pluses aren't enough to lift this movie above mediocre.

It's more likely that I had this movie in mind. Managed to stay awake all the way through this time, as an Australian free to air TV station is now showing all the Bond movies in sequence. Sure, it had some interesting elements, but it's not enough to make me think that this was a movie which really needed to be made.A central character in this movie is super-rich...all the perks of the landed gentry...which is what makes this movie seem like something Jane Austen might have flirted with...or Lifestyles of the rich and famous. For a Bond movie, it has little wit to it.Exotic locations Paris, San Francisco.Plot A microchip which is immune to the magnetic pulse of a nuclear blast has been developed for Britain, giving it a tactical edge against the Soviet Union. However, when the company manufacturing the chip is taken over by a private company, the Soviets may secretly get their hands on the technology. Super spy James Bond must investigate the owner of the private company to see if he is working for the Russians.Franchise clichés Pre-title sequence - Has the first disclaimer in a Bond movie! For some reason the producers want to assure us that the owner and his private company depicted in this movie is not real. Phew! But wait...does that mean the owner of the private company in Moonraker IS real? Now I'm scared! You then get the bog standard gun barrel sequence where Moore has a relaxed but efficient gait (cf some of Connery's wobbly kneed efforts!). You have another common Bond sequence of a ski chase...Russians are chasing him and you hear California girls on the soundtrack. Hmm.Theme song - By Duran Duran. Not a favourite of mine. Has drumming redolent of The Power Station...that band featured some members of Duran Duran. In fact, The Power Station had their first hit before this movie was released...maybe some cross over influence here? The visuals for this song seems to contain beautiful women dancing with glow in the dark dildos...but don't quote me on that! Silly female character names - May Day. OK, that's not over the top. Jenny Flex...get it?Sexism\/misogyny - Bond is patronising at times...or maybe he's being avuncular? Wine fetish - Bond orders Bollinger '75. This brand is mentioned in the end credits. In case you are wondering if this displays good or bad taste, he is complimented as a connoisseur for this order. Hmm...seem to remember reading somewhere that actual wine buffs think that the movie Bond has less than connoisseur taste! Q -He's back. The usual guy...Connery's last turn as Bond a few years previously (in Never say never again) had a new character with that moniker. And the relationship between Bond and Q isn't as unpleasantly poisonous as it was in Moore's previous movie, Octopussy.End teaser - Yes, but no specific title, just James Bond will return.Watch out for * Christopher Walken's boyishly nerdy psychopath. One of the good elements to this movie.* Bond recovering a chip from 003 in Siberia...seeing other 00s is rare in this franchise.* a lesson in ee-nun-cee-ay-shun by Bond...pretending to be St.John Smith...it's actually pronounced sin-gin-smythe. Ah, those Hyphenated-Names! * the facial equivalent of incontinence by Moore...he seems to have lost all control of his expressions in this movie! He smirks creepily at times in this movie...like when told of the price of a horse for sale...doesn't really come across as very upper class here!* May Day making Bond look frail in the castle. May Day actually has an interesting arc as a character in this movie...which is another good thing about this movie.

As expected, Daniel is not crazy about starting a new life across the country, having to say goodbye to all of his friends and everything. Once they reach their destination, Daniel meets up with some people his age and they go to the beach. It does not take long for Daniel to find trouble. He has an encounter with Johnny Lawrence after the latter gets into an argument with his ex-girlfriend, Ali. The problem is that Johnny knows karate, and proceeds to triumph over Daniel.After the beach incident, Johnny and his pals continue to harass Daniel. While all of this is going on, he begins to develop a relationship with Ali. Not only that, he strikes a friendship with Mr. Miyagi, the handyman at Daniel's apartment building.Miyagi comes to Daniel's aid one night when Johnny and his group surround Daniel and beat him up. Miyagi, who is experienced in karate, defeats all of the boys in no time. This leads to Daniel asking Miyagi for assistance in dealing with his enemies.The duo go to the karate school where Johnny and company train, the Cobra Kai dojo. Once they enter the building, they see why the students are like they are Their sensei, John Kreese. Kreese is a hardcore type, who believes that anyone you encounter in karate is an enemy. The two sides discuss the matter, and it is agreed that Daniel will enter the local karate tournament, where several Cobra Kai students will be competing as well.

Like Rocky, Avildsen knows how get the audience to sympathize with Daniel. Robert Mark Kamen wrote the screenplay, and from watching this movie, you will have a liking or disliking for each character. The casting is also very good. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita give good performances here (and Morita has his share of funny moments), and Elisabeth Shue is fine as Ali.

I tend to like Hong Kong actioners from the 80's so Police Assassins didn't cause me too much irritation for all its flaws, but its sad that the film is the way it is given its potential. Potential that amounts to this Michelle Yeoh teamed up with Cynthia Rothrock. Two great ass-kicking ladies, Rothrcok with her genuine martial arts talents and Yeoh a graceful mover with some great training behind her (though she wasn't originally a martial artist), they make for a fine team and the film zings whenever they are together. Regrettably their time together is much less than it should have been, as the film inexplicably chooses to focus on a trio of dimwitted petty criminals who get in over their heads in a bit of dirty corporate dealing. John Sham and Hoi Mang are little more than irritating as the oddly named Strepsil and Asprin, while Tsui Hark (best known as a veteran director) does a bit better as the wheeler dealer forgery expert Panadol, perhaps the only one of the three who actually fits into the film. He puts across his sly and shifty, mischievous role pretty nicely and gets a few decent scenes, and isn't cloying in his comedy or emotions like the other two, who overact, mug and generally detract from affairs. Most of the comedy in this film is off, the mixture of light and seriousness is even less well handled here than it is in other films of the same stripe. The films other problem is that the plot is pretty inconsequential, the device on which events hinge is never well explained, thus the film lacks suspense, and the arch baddies is never quite villainous enough to be an effective force, though his two head hench-people (Dick Wei and Fat Chung) are appropriately menacing and fine fighters. Also, the film is largely inconsequential in events until the halfway mark, there are fights and the pace is fair, but it all feels contrived and hastily put together. For all this the film isn't too bad in the end, mostly due to some great action and the fine style on display from director Cory Yuen. He knows just when to slow up or slow down a fight, plenty of smart angles and fast paced editing that remains coherent whilst keeping the pace rapid, also fitting in a couple of nifty jump cuts. His choreography ranges from solid in earlier stages to excellent in the rip-snorting finale and even with the aforementioned plot contrivances, when the film gets moving it gets pretty exciting. To sum up the good points, they just about balance out the bad and leave the film ultimately moderately satisfying. It surely isn't great (it took me a few viewings to really warm to it), but if 80's style Hong Kong action is your cup of tea, this film is certainly better than a poke in the eye with a wet stick.

If you're not familiar with his work it is all worth checking out. His other films include Boogie Nights, Magnolia (an all time favorite of mine) Punch Drunk Love, and the Best Picture nominated There Will Be Blood. Hard Eight is Anderson's first film and while you can tell that Anderson's directing style is rough around the edges and still developing into the masterful artistry it is today, the film itself is still a work of art.

The man behind it is Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He is responsible for an unsurpassed body of work that has and still continues to inspire filmmakers young and old worldwide.Few would disagree that Seven Samurai represents the definitive film of the legendary Japanese director's luminous career. In a decade which is proud to establish some of the medium's most gifted practitioners including Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Satyajit Ray, and Andrzej Wajda, Kurosawa is arguably the most influential.Seven Samurai exists in many cuts. The most rewarding is the original uncut version that runs more than 200 minutes. Do not let the lengthy runtime put you off, because there is probably no other film as incredibly well-paced as Seven Samurai. It gains tremendous momentum, and is so thoroughly enjoyable from start to end that the intermission sequence halfway through feels like the film's only liability.Repeated viewings get only better, allowing us to further appreciate Kurosawa's technical prowess and artistic vision. The film's storyline is simple A group of poor, helpless farmers hire samurai to protect their village from ruthless, marauding bandits who steal their rice.Seven Samurai is split into three major acts First, the seven samurai are introduced. Each is given time to develop a personality. Ironically, the longest time is given to Toshiro Mifune's character, Kikuchiyo, who needs little development for his presence immediately lights up every scene he is in. He gives the film's most entertaining performance as an impulsive, wild, and occasional clownish peasant masquerading as a samurai.In contrast, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the leader of the group, is honorable and caring, and is in my opinion the film's best-acted role. A young inexperienced samurai, a skillful samurai who is always practicing his craft, and three other samurai whose personalities are interchangeable make up the other quintet.The second act shows the integration of the samurai into the village of farmers who give them the cold shoulder by hiding in their shabby homes when they first arrive. After all, samurai are still fundamentally killers and their instinctive reactions are triggered by fear more than anything else. Kikuchiyo makes himself useful by breaking the ice between the two social classes in perhaps the film's most hilarious set-piece.Speaking of which, Kurosawa sprinkles the film with many scenes of humor (especially those involving the bumbling Kikuchiyo) that lightens the mood of the film, creating essential camaraderie amongst the characters. And in a subplot, Kurosawa explores tradition and social stigmatism when one of the samurai forbiddingly falls in love with a daughter of a farmer.The third act showcases Kurosawa at his skillful best the climatic battle sequences. Filmed in adverse conditions that include heavy rain, mud and strong winds, these scenes are brilliantly edited through the rapid inter-cutting of chaotic ground shots of hooves of horses and limbs of humans (farmers, samurai, and bandits) as they scurry about to kill or avoid being killed, together with distinct eye-level shots of the events that are happening. In one magnificent scene, a swarm of bandits on horses rush down from a hilltop to the village below in an uninterrupted sequence that has long been accepted as Kurosawian.Never for a moment when watching Seven Samurai do we seem puzzled. Everything is laid out clearly by Kurosawa. Before the samurai meet the farmers, we already know most of their personalities. Before the battle cry is sounded, the samurai have already taken us on a tour of the village's key defence points and their tactical strategies while training the farmers to defend themselves.With characterization and plot developments established so excellently, the joy of watching it all unfold is pure cinematic ecstasy. The art direction and costume design are exemplary. Together with the incredible cinematography and haunting music, Kurosawa effectively transports us several centuries back.In my opinion, Kurosawa's most accomplished picture is Ran (1985), a fabulously told tale of literally Shakespearean proportions. However, Seven Samurai is arguably his most entertaining, a glorious triumph that is still the standard-bearer for bravura epic filmmaking. It represents not only a cultural turning point for Japanese cinema (its Western influences are obvious) but also an important milestone in the art of filmmaking.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 August 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I've seen this film probably four or five times, and I love it more each time. I sought out Blow Dry because I love Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman and the late, great Natasha Richardson ... but it took me ages to find the DVD because it had these two random American kids on the cover.I was puzzled because Richardson, Rickman and Nighy had obviously been relegated to sub-plot which seemed incredible, but I watched it anyway. In the event, the marketing became only more baffling. I can only assume that the publicists played on Josh Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook for the American market, but in doing so they must have put off an awful lot of people like me - and surely Richardson at least carried plenty of weight in the US? And Nighy and Rickman are hardly unknowns!Anyway, now that I've found it in spite of the marketing people totally missing the point, I can review it. Blow Dry is whimsical, gentle and funny - and I mean that in the best possible way. It's a British comedy in the best tradition, understated, warm and centred solidly in the very ordinary lives of very ordinary people.Bill Nighy is predictably surreal and steals every scene he's in, but handles his role as the devious, dastardly but ultimately vulnerable and really quite likable villain of the piece very well. Alan Rickman struggles a little to portray his character's bitterness and hostility at first, but as the character warms up he comes into his own. Given his character's back story it must have been something of a task both for Rickman and for the writers to avoid making him utterly pitiable, but they managed it and Phil comes out the hero, still hurting but beginning to move forward with life in totally non-pathetic fashion.The screen belongs, though, to Natasha Richardson. The relationship between Shelley, played by Richardson, and Sandra is brilliant; totally convincing but not in any way more of an issue than it should be. There's a brief moment of surprise when you realise they're a couple, but it's written and played so well that you very quickly accept it and it becomes simply part of the story. Richardson's balancing act between pathos and comedy is finely-tuned and very admirable; the fact that she's dying is never forgotten, but neither is it allowed to overshadow the plot or stifle the comedy. For one of the best examples I have ever seen of good, simple writing skilfully delivered, watch Richardson's scene with the doctor in which her character learns she is terminal; it should not be possible to be that sad and yet funny at the same time!My one complaint with this film is the casting of Josh Hartnett as Phil and Shelley's son, Brian. Rachael Leigh Cook is non-descript and suffers from being on the same screen as Bill Nighy, but at least they just let her be American even if she was a strange choice in the first place. Josh Hartnett, meanwhile, should never have been allowed anywhere near this film, and all the line-cutting in the world (and you get the impression they cut as much as they could get away with) can't prevent him from ruining what should have been some of the finest scenes in the film. The scene about halfway through in which Richardson's character reveals to Phil and Brian that she has cancer and is dying should have been a deeply moving showcase for the talents of Richardson and Rickman, but the viewer is thrown completely out of the moment by Hartnett's utterly appalling trampling of the Yorkshire accent - which, in spite of its awfulness, still seems to have been absorbing enough to prevent him from actually acting at the same time.Aside from this utterly bewildering casting choice, Blow Dry is a fantastic film - I could rave about it even longer, but your time would be better spent just watching it.

I sought out Blow Dry because I love Bill Nighy, Alan Rickman and the late, great Natasha Richardson ... but it took me ages to find the DVD because it had these two random American kids on the cover.I was puzzled because Richardson, Rickman and Nighy had obviously been relegated to sub-plot which seemed incredible, but I watched it anyway. In the event, the marketing became only more baffling. I can only assume that the publicists played on Josh Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook for the American market, but in doing so they must have put off an awful lot of people like me - and surely Richardson at least carried plenty of weight in the US? And Nighy and Rickman are hardly unknowns!Anyway, now that I've found it in spite of the marketing people totally missing the point, I can review it. Blow Dry is whimsical, gentle and funny - and I mean that in the best possible way. It's a British comedy in the best tradition, understated, warm and centred solidly in the very ordinary lives of very ordinary people.Bill Nighy is predictably surreal and steals every scene he's in, but handles his role as the devious, dastardly but ultimately vulnerable and really quite likable villain of the piece very well. Alan Rickman struggles a little to portray his character's bitterness and hostility at first, but as the character warms up he comes into his own. Given his character's back story it must have been something of a task both for Rickman and for the writers to avoid making him utterly pitiable, but they managed it and Phil comes out the hero, still hurting but beginning to move forward with life in totally non-pathetic fashion.The screen belongs, though, to Natasha Richardson. The relationship between Shelley, played by Richardson, and Sandra is brilliant; totally convincing but not in any way more of an issue than it should be. There's a brief moment of surprise when you realise they're a couple, but it's written and played so well that you very quickly accept it and it becomes simply part of the story. Richardson's balancing act between pathos and comedy is finely-tuned and very admirable; the fact that she's dying is never forgotten, but neither is it allowed to overshadow the plot or stifle the comedy. For one of the best examples I have ever seen of good, simple writing skilfully delivered, watch Richardson's scene with the doctor in which her character learns she is terminal; it should not be possible to be that sad and yet funny at the same time!My one complaint with this film is the casting of Josh Hartnett as Phil and Shelley's son, Brian.

After hearing that there is a strong chance that the men who raped Tonya will get off because they are white, Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to take the law into his own hands and kill the two men who raped his daughter. Killing them in the courthouse, Carl Lee does not try and hide his murder, and immediately goes to jail. Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) is set to defend Carl Lee, but with the return of the K.K.K. it will be a much harder, and more dangerous case then Jake had originally anticipated. Jake will have to risk everything he owns, including his family, to free Carl Lee, and beat the District Attorney (Kevin Spacey) in what will be the hardest case he has ever had.Along with The Rainmaker A Time To Kill is without a doubt my favorite film based off of a Grisham novel. The script was not just fantastic, but I really, really liked the story in this film, and I even thought some parts of it were quite touching. The courtroom action was very interesting, much better than most movies I have seen, and it really kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen.The cast was fantastic, not all of the acting was perfect, but it certainly was good. Several of the actors in the film have been at least nominated for an Oscar. However, there some flaws in the performances, they definitely were not perfect. Matthew MaConaughey as the lead was much better then I had expected, it was not Oscar worthy or anything, but still good. I can easily tell you that He is much better playing a lawyer in a courtroom drama, then some loser in a terrible comedy. Now, Ashley Judd playing his wife was not very good. I am not really sure why, because in a lot of her movies she is a pretty good actress, but in this one she is not really at all. Sandra Bullock and Oliver Platt are good along side MaConaughey, but my favorite performance was by far Kevin Spacey. He was brilliant playing the District Attorney.Overall, A Time To Kill, is a flawed but very good film with great performances, and to some will be a touching, and maybe even at times moving story. Along with a lot of interesting court scenes, and a nice ending, it was a good film.
