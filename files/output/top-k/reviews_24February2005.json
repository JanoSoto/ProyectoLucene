What I found was a dark, violent, and ultimately inaccurate portrayal of one of my favorite periods of history.The movie covers Elizabeth's treatment under her half-sister, Mary's reign, her subsequent ascension to the throne upon Mary's death, and the early years of her reign. Information about these people and events is readily available from a number of sources, so one wonders how Michael Hirst managed to put together such an inaccurate portrait of this period. Mary Tudor was not the doddering old fool she is portrayed as here, even though most of her actions as queen were misguided. Neither was Elizabeth as uneducated in the ways of court as she is presented to be. And while Dudley was certainly a favorite of Elizabeth's she never slept with him (there is a reason she was called the Virgin Queen after all). Also, she knew him well when they were in the tower together during Mary's reign. She knew he was married. It was what saved his life. Her discovery of this fact wouldn't have been a shocking betrayal because there was nothing to discover. Likewise, he would never have plotted against her. He knew where his bread was buttered. Walsingham was a trusted adviser, but not the only one Elizabeth could turn to, nor was he the murderer he is made out to be in this film. And Cecil left her service for his own reasons, not because she tired of him and banished him.Visually, the film is quite dark. Many scenes take place at night, or in secluded places shut away from the light. Even those in the daylight have a furtiveness about them that gives the whole film an element of paranoia which is quite distracting. While the violence is true to the times, it is excessive, and we could live without seeing the beheading.The cast does a good job with the material they are given. Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth is a bit naive, but still charming. Joseph Fiennes' Dudley is charismatic. Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham is a cipher, as though Rush were unsure whether to portray Walsingham as trustworthy or menacing, and ended up doing neither very well. Christopher Eccleston's Norfolk bristles with evil and menace. Lewis Jones' murderous priest is so over the top that you can't wait for him to get his. Also over the top, although far more entertaining, is Vincent Cassel's Duc d'Anjou. Fanny Ardant strikes the right balance with her portrayal of Mary of Guise. Richard Attenborough's Cecil is quite noble.Clearly Hirst sacrificed accuracy for entertainment's sake. He did have some success in this, as it is an entertaining film. But if you really want to learn about this period, get the first two episodes of the BBC series Elizabeth R, and watch those. They present a far more accurate picture of the beginning of the Elizabethan period.

The film tries to answer all the questions that were left unanswered in HALLOWEEN 5 THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS, by revealing what the Thorn cult symbolizes & just who the Man In Black was & what his connection was to Michael. GEORGE P. WILBUR (HALLOWEEN 4) plays the role of Michael well (one of two actors to don the role more than once) & the special effects by John Carl Buechller (also of HALLOWEEN 4) is also really good. Interestingly the film tends to try & bridge the gap that exists between the Michael Myers films & the seemingly unconnected third film, with the introduction of the druid cult & the pagan rituals of Halloween not to mention the re- introduction of the Samhain methos mentioned in II, played up to in III & was oddly jettisoned in 4 & 5. The film also introduces Mr. Blankenship an elderly lady who as it turns out is a member of the cult (interestingly enough HALLOWEEN III SEASON OF THE WITCH also makes mention of a character named Mrs. Blankenship & that film also dealt with a druidic cult). HALLOWEEN 6 also brings back the heavy breathing Michael of Part I & II & pays tribute to the original film in a scene where Danny (the kid hero of the film) trips & falls, smashing his pumpkin in front of Tommy Doyle, who also dropped a pumpkin smashing it in the first film. There's a tribute to John Carpenters THE FOG, wherein a kid asks for a stomach pounder, the character of Dr. Wynn returns from the original, played quiet well by MITCHELL RYAN, (interestingly enough, this character was originally written for Christopher Lee, who turned down the Dr. Loomis role in the first & later regretted it, before the studio jettisoned the idea). Debra & John Strode are named after HALLOWEEN 1-3 film-makers Debra Hill & John Carpenter. There's even a tribute to WHEN A STRANGER CALLS (1979) interestingly enough, director Fred Walton was originally set to take the helm, but had to beg off at the last minute.The film score by ALAN HOWARTH is more in line with John Carpenter score & thus fits the film better than the rock soundtrack the theatrical cut presented. That said the film exists in two forms THE THEATRICAL CUT, while pretty good in it's own right, attempts to substitute flashy editing & over the top gore scenes, often times instead of suspense, character & story structure & revels in weird imagery such as an creepy mental patient who has aborted her own baby before dying! plus the film seems to say that it's the cult that has Michael under it's control, when at the climax he just winds up killing them! Which makes you wonder what the point of this plot was? While the PRODUCERS CUT is more in line with the series, since it's plot is better orchestrated, the characters are better fleshed out & more suspense & tension added, a better score & more linear editing, with the kills not being over the top or super gory. It easily ranks up in the top five best of the Halloween franchise & is much more intelligent than Part 5 & discards any supernatural elements of the Theatrical Cut, in favour of revealing the cult as a group of doctors who try to genetically isolate Michael's evil. Another difference is the fact that Jamie Lloyd (played here by J.C. BRANDY) who is killed very gorily by Michael in a barn in the Theatrical Cut, is killed off by The Man In Black in the Producers Cut (who uses a silencer on his gun to dispatch her) almost a full hour into the film, in a hospital & helps move the Man In Black plot forward. While I missed the character of Jamie, I will admit this helps enrich the mystery surrounding the villainous character of HALLOWEEN 6's co-villain. The Producers Cut also reveals that the baby the cult & Michael are pursuing is indeed Michaels child! Kara, her son Danny & Tommy play a bigger role in the climax than they do in the theatrical cut & the climax is more in tone with the build up that the film was leading up to than what the theatrical cut was, with Tommy using the power of the runes he was talking about earlier in the film & that was connected with the Druids, to immobilize Michael & sets up the interesting notion that the curse of Thorn will pass from Michael, to Kara's son Danny, which will open the door to a new era of terror & blood shed & setting up Dr. Loomis as Michael's new caretaker instead of Dr. Wynn, with Michael breaking Dr. Wynn's control over him & switching clothes with him. Mrs. Blankenship telling Danny about the dark, pagan roots of the season of Halloween is super creepy & the fact that she mentions she was babysitting Michael the night he butchered his sister was interesting, in the sense that the opening shot in HALLOWEEN shows Michael walking from across the street (Mrs. Blankenships home) & over to his own home. The film also explores more of the Thorn symbol, what it means & the cult surrounding it. The only complaint I have is that the film never does feature a confrontation between Michael or Dr. Loomis which is a shame... In the end, HALLOWEEN THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS while far from perfect, is still well worth a look for fans of the series. If you want to see the better version however, try & get a hold of the Producers Cut which is a far superior version in almost every way. Highly recommended to series fans.

Recently I viewed the film again & although HALLOWEEN 5 is still a far cry from one of the best sequels in the series, overall it's not bad for a film that was quickly rushed into theatres & direct to video barely a year after PART 4. First I will dwell on the negatives The direction leaves a lot to be desired, as the film also wallows in tons of gore & overly violent kills, that seemed more appropriate for a Friday The 13th film than for a HALLOWEEN movie. At this point in the series, the scares & creepiness of serial killer Michael Myers was absent, as Michael has now enveloped into more of an run of the mill slasher, rather than the creepy killer he was in the original. Michael's mask also looks horrible & the creepy small house he grew up in has now turned out to be a huge Victorian style mansion! & looks nothing like it did in the first two films. The box art also proclaims two things, first that, Michael Lives, & this time, they're ready! who is ready? the characters here? if so that's a lie, since Michael has no problem disposing of any of them, none of which, minus Loomis, puts up a fight & Michael Myers is finally unmasked! first off, whomever put that on the box art obviously didn't see the first film, Michael was unmasked at the end of Part 1!. The unmasking at the end here is a ripoff as Michael's face is hidden in the black shadows, so you can't even see his face & for a guy that was badly burned in a fire at the end of HALLOWEEN II, Michael looks to be in pretty good shape, minus his hands, as since you can see in the DVD version when he awakens from his year long sleep, but that's another thing that kind of irked me, Michael is kept at an old shack for a whole year lived in by an old man & his parrot, which begs the question, why would the old man keep Michael for a whole year? why didn't he go to the authorities after he found Michael? I could have done without the two idiot cop characters (who even have their own goofy theme music), they were pretty annoying as was lead heroine Tina, whom the writers stupidly thought could replace Rachel the heroine of the previous film as the new heroine who tries to protect little Jamie, she's so over the top that one can't wait for her to bite the big one. HALLOWEEN 5 also introduces a series of obnoxious\/annoying teen characters to grace not only the HALLOWEEN series, but horror movie history period! One can't wait for them to be offed & the man in black who roams around town, with a thorn symbol on his wrist similar to Michael, is never explained, who he is? What does the thorn symbol mean? What is his connection to Michael? Why has he all the sudden shown up in Haddonfield? Where has he been all this time? Is he a long lost brother? What does he want Michael for? Or is this Michael? Does he have a split personality? (All was explained by different writers in Part 6) The only real good actor out of the teen victims this time is, believe it or not, Tina's boyfriend Mike, a wannabe FONZE from HAPPY DAYS, he's not only talented, but funny & his death is pretty cool, if only we could have seen more of him in the film...ELLIE CORNELL briefly reprises her role as Jamie's stepsister before biting the big one. What a shame, she was so talented & should have had a bigger role in the film. DON SHANKS takes the role of MICHAEL MYERS this time out & does fairly well for himself, easily one of the best actors to don the infamous mask, the only problem.........He's too big to play Michael! DONALD PLESEANCE reprises his role as Dr. Loomis, Michael's former psychiatrist turned arch nemesis, but his character comes off even more loonier than Michael & it's clear that at this point he was merely sticking around for the fans & to collect a good fat pay check for his acting services.I will say this in the film's defence, HALLOWEEN 5 at the very least has many moments to help it rise above most genre sequels, there's many moments of tension & suspense to help rival many of the franchise's top moments. In particular the cat & mouse chase between Michael & Jamie in the Myers house at the climax. The gore is good & plenty, the kills are brutal & inventive, the body count is high, the film has more plot than usual, the score by ALAN HOWARTH still rocks! The acting is surprisingly good here & the direction is well handled by french director DOMINIQUE OTHENIN GIRARD who manages to capture all the carnage at all the right angles & delivers a series of well established shots. The film also introduces a psychic angle in which Michael seems to have a telepathic link to young Jamie, but disappointingly this plot twist is dropped noticeably about midway. Director Girard also pays tribute to John Carpenters original 1978 original in a scene where young Jamie is sitting in the same room that belonged to Michael's sister, brushing her hair in front of the window, which is what Michael's sister was doing when she was stabbed by him many years prior. A good movie, but strictly for series fans.

The film also introduces a psychic angle in which Michael seems to have a telepathic link to young Jamie, but disappointingly this plot twist is dropped noticeably about midway. Director Girard also pays tribute to John Carpenters original 1978 original in a scene where young Jamie is sitting in the same room that belonged to Michael's sister, brushing her hair in front of the window, which is what Michael's sister was doing when she was stabbed by him many years prior.

Recently I viewed the film again & although HALLOWEEN 5 is still a far cry from one of the best sequels in the series, overall it's not bad for a film that was quickly rushed into theatres & direct to video barely a year after PART 4. First I will dwell on the negatives The direction leaves a lot to be desired, as the film also wallows in tons of gore & overly violent kills, that seemed more appropriate for a Friday The 13th film than for a HALLOWEEN movie. At this point in the series, the scares & creepiness of serial killer Michael Myers was absent, as Michael has now enveloped into more of an run of the mill slasher, rather than the creepy killer he was in the original. Michael's mask also looks horrible & the creepy small house he grew up in has now turned out to be a huge Victorian style mansion! & looks nothing like it did in the first two films. The box art also proclaims two things, first that, Michael Lives, & this time, they're ready! who is ready? the characters here? if so that's a lie, since Michael has no problem disposing of any of them, none of which, minus Loomis, puts up a fight & Michael Myers is finally unmasked! first off, whomever put that on the box art obviously didn't see the first film, Michael was unmasked at the end of Part 1!. The unmasking at the end here is a ripoff as Michael's face is hidden in the black shadows, so you can't even see his face & for a guy that was badly burned in a fire at the end of HALLOWEEN II, Michael looks to be in pretty good shape, minus his hands, as since you can see in the DVD version when he awakens from his year long sleep, but that's another thing that kind of irked me, Michael is kept at an old shack for a whole year lived in by an old man & his parrot, which begs the question, why would the old man keep Michael for a whole year? why didn't he go to the authorities after he found Michael? I could have done without the two idiot cop characters (who even have their own goofy theme music), they were pretty annoying as was lead heroine Tina, whom the writers stupidly thought could replace Rachel the heroine of the previous film as the new heroine who tries to protect little Jamie, she's so over the top that one can't wait for her to bite the big one. HALLOWEEN 5 also introduces a series of obnoxious\/annoying teen characters to grace not only the HALLOWEEN series, but horror movie history period! One can't wait for them to be offed & the man in black who roams around town, with a thorn symbol on his wrist similar to Michael, is never explained, who he is? What does the thorn symbol mean? What is his connection to Michael? Why has he all the sudden shown up in Haddonfield? Where has he been all this time? Is he a long lost brother? What does he want Michael for? Or is this Michael? Does he have a split personality? (All was explained by different writers in Part 6) The only real good actor out of the teen victims this time is, believe it or not, Tina's boyfriend Mike, a wannabe FONZE from HAPPY DAYS, he's not only talented, but funny & his death is pretty cool, if only we could have seen more of him in the film...ELLIE CORNELL briefly reprises her role as Jamie's stepsister before biting the big one. What a shame, she was so talented & should have had a bigger role in the film.

After seeing L.I.E. for the first time, I had to see it again because I was amazed. Brian Cox, Paul Franklin Dano and Billy Kay produce incredible performances. I was simply amazed by the plot and themes in the film. The conclusion of the film was incredible and not predictable.This film is not a sappy teenage drama which I am tired of seeing. The themes of this film are original and thought provoking. The characters are real! Gary and Howie are not the best-looking boys out there, nor they have the material possessions that many Long Islanders have, nor a happy home. That's why they are realistic.Howie (Dano) does not have the best of situations. However, the most unfortunate events involves with what happened to his mother, his father, his best friend (and crush), and most importantly, himself. They seem to pile on top of each other and linger with him like a black cloud. However, this is not a woe is me film. Dano seems to rise against the obstacles and help himself with the assistance of Big John (Cox). Howie does not cry and shrivel up in the spotlight. This is one of the rites of passage that he undergoes.If you don't want to know the plot or the themes of the film already, DO NOT CONTINUE TO READ!!!!!I do admire the speculation of Howie's sexuality. This is about a 15 yo boy, so sexual tension and questioning definitely have to be a part of the film to be realistic. Most films stay away from this topic, but the screenplay is not afraid of the questions Howie raises, especially in the bedroom. The film is not afraid of Howie's true desires, especially after he observes in Big John's house.The subplot of Howie admiring Gary sexually is original in the sense that he likes Gary for physical reasons but because he is attracted to him because he is another male. Cuesta handles the situation perfectly especially after Gary leaves.The last quarter of the film raises a lot of questions, however within the context of the film, it does not leave the viewer confused. The scene where Howie and Big John are shaving, a rite of passage for Howie because this is a sign that he is changing from a boy to a young man.Because this rite of passage occurs, another one is speculated. Even though the film does not explicitly state it, the film implies that Big John does not molest Howie. The rite of passage here is that Big John does not take advantage of a young boy for the first time in his life. He is not the pedophile that the film sometimes speculates.The film can open speculation with what happens between the two because it is not direct and viewers want to say that Big John did molest Howie just for the sake of it. But, if the viewer reads the feelings the two have after the scene that some speculate did it, the viewer can see that sexual contact did not occur.Another theme is I-495. The highway is a metaphor of Howie's life. 1) It has two separate directions east and west, like the two possibilities of consequences that Howie can make. 2) The speed of the traffic is the speed that Howie grows up in the film into a young man. 3) The balancing act Howie performs on the overpass of I-495 is the delicate balance of life, one little thing can cause one to tumble. What happens to Big John during the finale is the tumble.Even though this film is not mainstream and does not have a $200 million mega-budget or all-star cast, it is much better than 90% of the films made in the last 4 years. Well done for all, especially Dano. Wish there were more films like this than the trash Hollywood gives its audience.

The pace is slick & the direction was crisp & the film felt more like a real sequel to the original than what most of the sequels did. The film, much like Carpenters original, focuses on the chills, thrills & suspense of the piece & features an ominous title sequence featuring hanging paper skeletons, scarecrows, pumpkins, ghosts & abandon houses, all the trademarks that one associates with the season. Unlike most sequels in the series which concentrated mainly on gore & a high body count, HALLOWEEN 4 tends to be the thinking man's slasher flick Michael kills a hydro man by thrusting him into the live fuses which causes a major black out, an explosion knocks out the power lines so no one can call out, the new sheriff believes Doctor Loomis when he tells them that Michael is walking around & killing instead of calling Loomis crazy & locking him up, the cast was attractive & some of the kills all though violent, are pretty painful looking & inventive & the film features a nerve wracking sequence set on the roof of a large house, where the terrified lead characters are forced to to try & prevent themselves from falling from the roof, while at the same time try & find a way off the roof as Michael pursues them. ALAN B. McELROY'S script is fast paced, smart & manages to rise itself up to become one of the best sequels in the franchise. McElroy is clearly a fan of the original & that is very evident in the films plot & execution which actually pays tribute to many plot points & elements seen in the 1978 original Both Tommy Doyle & Lindsay the two little kids Laurie babysat in the first film have cameo's here (Lindsay as Rachel the lead heroines best friend & Tommy in a cameo at a drug store as Rachel's boyfriends best friend) the lead heroine Rachel is also a babysitter who is tasked with taking her foster sister trick or treating, her friend Kelly is the daughter of the town sheriff much like Laurie's friend Annie was in the original, Dr. Loomis coming across Michael's hand work en route to Haddonfield, Jamie's costume is eerily identical that Michael wore when he stabbed his sister & much like Carpenters original, the film has a nice twist, where the first film's twist happened at the beginning by revealing that the killer (whom is seen through a lengthy POV sequence) who stabs Judith Myers while she is sitting by her bedroom combing her hair, is in fact her younger brother Michael, an eight year old boy carrying a kitchen knife & a childhood clown costume & not an adult, HALLOWEEN 4 takes this twist & places it at the end by revealing that the person (seen through a brief POV shot) who stabs the girls mother, is not Michael himself who has come back to life, but rather Michael's young niece, Jamie! wearing the very same costume Michael did when he committed his first murder! The ending helps to shock the viewer, creeping them out & ending the film in an unforgettable attention grabber that no horror fan will forget & is one of the scariest, most disturbing & unnerving climaxes in horror history & returning composer ALAN HOWARTH delivers one of the scariest scores the series has to offer!Apart from that, I had very few if any complaints about the film, the only thing I will mention is the fact that in the climax of HALLOWEEN II, Michael had his eyes shot out by Laurie, yet oddly enough he has both his eyes here, this plot point was either forgotten or ignored, with the latter probably being more probable since who on earth would give an eyeless homicidal maniac a pair of eyes to see with? much less one in a coma? All in all, HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS is an absolute must see for any horror fan, it's everything a really good sequel should be, smart, terrifying, suspenseful, filled to the brim with tension, excellently written, produced, directed & acted & boasts a real terrifying score, has a nice story structure & creative kills. Sadly despite the terrifying climax, the producers rather than exploring this avenue, by having Jamie grow up to replace her uncle, as the new bogeyman, to stalk Haddonfield, was abandon in the pretty good, but not as much fun, fifth instalment, HALLOWEEN 5 THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS PROLOX TRIVIAJAMIE LEE CURTIS turned down the chance to reprise her role as Laurie.MELISSA SHAFFER & MELISSA JOAN HART auditioned for roles in the film.**** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"24 February 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" After sitting out of the slasher biz for ten years, serial killer MICHAEL MYERS awakens from his coma following a transfer from Smith's Grove Sanitarium to another mental hospital wherein he slaughters his way to freedom & returns to his old stomping grounds of Haddonfield to try & kill his young niece Jamie & anyone who gets in his way.

McElroy is clearly a fan of the original & that is very evident in the films plot & execution which actually pays tribute to many plot points & elements seen in the 1978 original Both Tommy Doyle & Lindsay the two little kids Laurie babysat in the first film have cameo's here (Lindsay as Rachel the lead heroines best friend & Tommy in a cameo at a drug store as Rachel's boyfriends best friend) the lead heroine Rachel is also a babysitter who is tasked with taking her foster sister trick or treating, her friend Kelly is the daughter of the town sheriff much like Laurie's friend Annie was in the original, Dr. Loomis coming across Michael's hand work en route to Haddonfield, Jamie's costume is eerily identical that Michael wore when he stabbed his sister & much like Carpenters original, the film has a nice twist, where the first film's twist happened at the beginning by revealing that the killer (whom is seen through a lengthy POV sequence) who stabs Judith Myers while she is sitting by her bedroom combing her hair, is in fact her younger brother Michael, an eight year old boy carrying a kitchen knife & a childhood clown costume & not an adult, HALLOWEEN 4 takes this twist & places it at the end by revealing that the person (seen through a brief POV shot) who stabs the girls mother, is not Michael himself who has come back to life, but rather Michael's young niece, Jamie! wearing the very same costume Michael did when he committed his first murder! The ending helps to shock the viewer, creeping them out & ending the film in an unforgettable attention grabber that no horror fan will forget & is one of the scariest, most disturbing & unnerving climaxes in horror history & returning composer ALAN HOWARTH delivers one of the scariest scores the series has to offer!Apart from that, I had very few if any complaints about the film, the only thing I will mention is the fact that in the climax of HALLOWEEN II, Michael had his eyes shot out by Laurie, yet oddly enough he has both his eyes here, this plot point was either forgotten or ignored, with the latter probably being more probable since who on earth would give an eyeless homicidal maniac a pair of eyes to see with? much less one in a coma? All in all, HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS is an absolute must see for any horror fan, it's everything a really good sequel should be, smart, terrifying, suspenseful, filled to the brim with tension, excellently written, produced, directed & acted & boasts a real terrifying score, has a nice story structure & creative kills. Sadly despite the terrifying climax, the producers rather than exploring this avenue, by having Jamie grow up to replace her uncle, as the new bogeyman, to stalk Haddonfield, was abandon in the pretty good, but not as much fun, fifth instalment, HALLOWEEN 5 THE REVENGE OF MICHAEL MYERS PROLOX TRIVIAJAMIE LEE CURTIS turned down the chance to reprise her role as Laurie.MELISSA SHAFFER & MELISSA JOAN HART auditioned for roles in the film.**** stars ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"24 February 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" After sitting out of the slasher biz for ten years, serial killer MICHAEL MYERS awakens from his coma following a transfer from Smith's Grove Sanitarium to another mental hospital wherein he slaughters his way to freedom & returns to his old stomping grounds of Haddonfield to try & kill his young niece Jamie & anyone who gets in his way. When Haddonfield's police force is taken out, the towns Sheriff & Dr. Loomis (the returning DONALD PLESEANCE) rounds up a posse of rednecks in order to try & stop Michael, but discover planning something like that is easy, but pulling it off will be anything but, as Michael leaves behind a trail of mangled corpses in his wake.HALLOWEEN 4 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS (Or HALLOWEEN H10 THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS as some fans over the years have lovingly called it) is easily the best sequel to ever have been churned out in the long running slasher series! The pace is slick & the direction was crisp & the film felt more like a real sequel to the original than what most of the sequels did. The film, much like Carpenters original, focuses on the chills, thrills & suspense of the piece & features an ominous title sequence featuring hanging paper skeletons, scarecrows, pumpkins, ghosts & abandon houses, all the trademarks that one associates with the season.

Not necessarily because you went before your time, or even in somewhat rotten circumstances. No, it is because unlike the purveyors of so-called family entertainment these days, your work was actually entertaining to the whole family. When I was a lad, I used to think these films were childish and patronising. By comparison to what is being aimed at the children of my cousins, it is MENSA material, and I realise now that it was far more brilliant than I had previously given it credit for. Indeed, compared to the you're not good if you don't have good feelings rubbish that the likes of B'Harni fill the heads of children with, Henson productions deserve a medal.At its heart, Labyrinth is a simple fable about how much we miss something once it is gone. A young girl wishes that her annoying stepbrother would disappear, only to find when he is gone that she misses him. Enter the Goblin King, played with a great malice by David Bowie. The challenge the Goblin King sets almost sounds like a video game. Indeed, one popular Commodore 64 game of the time set the challenge of collecting the pieces to solve a key puzzle to save the world in a certain time period. Labyrinth was even adapted into a game for the Commodore 64. In Labyrinth the film, this young woman named Sarah, played with a certain kind of brilliance by a young Jennifer Connelly, is challenged to navigate a massive labyrinth in less than thirteen hours, lest her brother become one of the Goblins.It sounds like a very simple idea, and it is. What makes Labyrinth the under-appreciated classic that it is is in the details. As previously indicated, the leads are absolutely brilliant. While David Bowie chews scenery like there is no tomorrow, Jennifer Connelly gets so into her character that she makes it seem perfectly natural when she is interacting with some of Jim Henson's most ludicrous creations. The scene in which she rescues a giant yeti-like thing called Ludo is one of the most superbly-made things in the history of children's film. It is also worth noting that in contrast to the aforementioned normalism of B'Harni and his ilk, Henson's creations taught the valuable lesson that appearances are not the sum total of a living creature's character. Ludo looks like he could tear apart our protagonist, but his manner and speech show him as one of the most gentle and lovable characters ever depicted in film.As you might guess from this film featuring David Bowie as the top-billed star, there are also a few song and dance numbers. Some of them, such as the magic dance number, are immortally embarrassing. Or at least, they would be, if not for two things. First, the suspension of disbelief that Henson so admirably achieves with his puppets is a real pleasure. Second, Bowie's golden voice could charm the paint off walls. When he sings I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry, it stands out like a stark reminder of why this man used to be able to sign record deals worth tens of millions of dollars. It may even bring tears to your eyes.If Labyrinth does have a weakness, it is in the closing reels. The final song from Bowie stretches the scene beyond its welcome, but it recovers nicely once Sarah returns to the real world. The compositing work in the Firey sequence is rather lousy, and the story seems to grind to a halt when they do their song and dance number. On the other hand, their song and dance number is still incredibly amusing to behold.In all, I gave Labyrinth an eight out of ten. It is not perfect. In fact, I wonder if whomever designed Bowie's costume was not playing an elaborate joke upon him. But for all of its problems, Labyrinth is an underrated classic. One of the few films that is advertised as being for all ages, and can entertain audiences of that description. A great light went out in our world when Jim Henson passed away.

George Clooney's Seth Gecko has to be one of the coolest movie characters in history, next to Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield, and Harvey Keitel's Mr.White. Clooney deserved the popularity and fame he received after making this movie. The supporting cast is great too, Harvey Keitel, always excellent in any role he plays, Juliette Lewis, gorgeous and also great, Cheech Marin, playing three characters, great as well, Salma Hayek, although a short role as one of the villains, pretty good too. The snake dance, along with her role in Desperado is what really launched her into Hollywood stardom. performance-wise she only said a few lines all to George Clooney right before he kills her which I think happened too fast and me and i'm sure most men wished Tarantino could've stretched Salma's character's life a bit more. The other complaint I have is that the body count was too high and I wished at least Sex Machine and Scott could've made it, maybe he could've saved Scott from getting bitten by his own father and all those vampires towards the end. I loved how Rodriguez brought the retractable penis gun back from Desperado but this time we actually see how it works. Rodriguez does a great job directing his movie, his camera work, especially in the first part of the movie is excellent. The make up, props and stunts, pretty good for a low-budget flick from 1996. It's not Oscar material, but it's still a classic in it's own right.

This scene is probably the most famous scene from this film and for good reason. It is a display of two of the greatest performances ever committed to film. It is powerful and full of emotion and raw energy. The way it is shot by Kazan and by the exchange between two of the greatest method actors of their time. This scene is also the pivotal point in the picture, we find out so much about these two characters, their past and their future. Here Brando explains his frustration with his brother and his brother's line of work. It has cost him his future, and he is forced to realize the painful truth; he is a bum. Steiger is equally good in this scene, here he makes a desperate plea to his brother, a plea that if not headed could mean the end of both of their lives, near the end of the scene you can see Steiger has made peace with the fact that he has failed in persuading his brother and that he is now a dead man.Apart from that scene, this film is filled with memorable scenes and performances in one of the greatest crime dramas of all time. It is gritty, realistic, moody and vibrant. The movie moves at a good pace, never getting too far ahead of itself and allowing the viewer to enjoy the story and the development of the action and the characters. In short this film is about the redemption of one man, Terry Malloy (Brando). He has made some poor choices in his life. Most of them stem from his association with his brother, who is a member of the mafia that controls the longshoreman union. He cannot fault his brother though as he has been everything to him, and done everything for him. But soon he realizes that he could have been more, much more, I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. But his brother has held him back, and now he is faced with the decision to side with his brother or do the right thing and ultimately sacrifice his life and his brother's life. Complicating his choice, is the feelings he has for a beautiful girl, Edie (Eva Marie Saint). She makes him second guess his misplaced and self imposed isolation. Not isolated from people, but from himself and the truth. It is a fascinating journey we are taken on, through the trials and tribulations of Terry Malloy. He is on a journey whether or not he knows it, a journey to become a respectable human being, and we have front row seats.Overall 10 out of 10, excellent film.

In this case, the real estate is a cozy country cottage in Vermont, a warm and cheerfully decorated little place far from the city. The shades are always closed, but warm, golden, late summer sunlight filters through, suggesting that it would be a wonderful place to either visit or, better still, to grow old in. It looks so real and richly detailed that it is hard to believe that it is a set, built for the movie in some New York film studio. The creepy thing about Woody Allen's September is that this totally make-believe house is more realistic than the characters who gather inside.September is another of Woody's beautifully detailed, sensitively written, lovingly acted and utterly annoying serious films. There is a smattering of not-particularly-funny bits of humor, designed to suggest that the characters are clever people, but once again the main traits shared by all are indecisiveness, depression and a gift for long-winded bouts of self pity. The six main characters who spend the weekend in this country home spend a lot of time talking about their feelings, though one has a hard time believing that any of them actually have real feelings. Instead everyone seems to be doing psychotherapy exercises designed to help them self-consciously get in touch with themselves. The end result of this achingly insincere sincerity is an intense desire by the viewer to want to give each and every cast member a sincere slap across the face.During their years together, Allen gave to his partner Mia Farrow some of the best roles of her career -- as well as some of her worst. This may be the worst; certainly it allows her to indulge in her unfortunate tendency to whine and blubber in despair. The most intriguing aspect of September is that it is inspired by a bit of Hollywood legend, the death of Lana Turner's gangster boyfriend at the hands of her teenage daughter. Allen takes that infamous scandal and uses it as the seed for this film's drama. Farrow plays Lane, who is still living down the notoriety of having killed her celebrity mother's abusive boyfriend and who is now recuperating from her most recent suicide attempt. The feelings of guilt, shame, animosity, bitterness and envy shared between Lane and her mother, Diane (played by Elaine Stritch), would seem to be sufficient to sustain an interesting drama. But Allen uses the dirty little secret behind the old scandal as a minor plot twist, and instead focuses most of the film on a trite four-sided love triangle, in which passion is secondary to unrelenting discussions about each characters' unrequited passions.Howard (Denholm Elliott) loves Lane, who loves Peter (Sam Waterston), who has a thing for Stephanie (Diane Wiest), who is married but returns Peter's feelings even though she knows that she is betraying Lane, blah, blah, blah. It all seems so high school, especially since they all talk about this, but are paralyzed to act on those feelings. Meanwhile Diane loves only Diane, even though she is partnered with Lloyd (Jack Warden), a melancholy physicist who is depressed over how utterly meaningless existence is.The problem isn't so much the trite plotting as it is the overall and overwhelming tone of the drama. Woody walked this path before (six characters in a country house) in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, but did so with a sense of whimsy and an unexpected show of hopeful romance. In September, the characters all talk with that hushed, sterile, halting formality that Allen apes from pretentious European art films. Everyone seems dubbed, disconnected from both their feelings and their dialogue. They might as well be discussing their income tax returns, though that would probably inspire much more enthusiasm. Such pregnant disconnection from emotion all but guarantees audience indifference and certainly is wrong for a story delving into the life of an emotionally disturbed woman.As for the house itself, the set design, the lighting and the cinematography conspire to make this make-believe slice of rural eden so invitingly charming that it all but betrays the notion that the little house is meant to represent a prison -- or an asylum, if you prefer. It comes to represent the past Lane wants to shed and the past Diane wants to recapture. It is a battlefield to reclaim the honesty of their shared past. To the audience, no matter how flimsy the walls, it is the single thing in the entire film that offers warmth, comfort and promise. And it is an illusion.

This movie has changed my perspective on a lot of things in my life; all the materialism is just not important, nor does it matter. And it's screwed up, how our society runs.

I am in tenth grade, and my Humanities teacher showed this movie in class (the whole thing, unedited, sex scenes and all) (I had already seen it before). Why would a teacher show this brutal and harsh movie in class? At the time, we were working on Romanticism. Here is a definition of Romanticism a movement of the 19th century that sought to replace the great emphasis on reason with a new focus on feelings, emotions, and nature. Nature often came to replace God, and reason was seen as a restraint on true feeling. (This definition is extremely vague and I will elaborate a bit more later on.) Now, how in the world could Fight Club possibly tie in with Romanticism? A big thing with Romanticism was self-discovery and liberation from material needs. It was about humans going back to their primitive state, living in and appreciating nature. Romantic literature and artwork often portrayed a sense of hopelessness or loss. All of these things are present in Fight Club. Edward Norton's character is consumed by his material possessions, and Brad Pitt's character shows him a way out of it. They start a Fight Club, which gives men a primitive outlet for their frustration and everything they have pent up (fighting is an extremely primitive way to solve problems). In the scene after Edward Norton is injured in the car crash, Brad Pitt begins to talk about his world, in which people climb on vines wrapping around the Sears Tower, people wear leather clothes that will last the rest of their lives, and people pound corn and lay strips of venison on an abandoned highway. All of these things are obviously Romantic in nature.I'm presenting you these ideas so that, perhaps, we can learn even more from this movie that already teaches so much.

It's mainly about a young girl named Sarah(who's acted really well by Connelly) who has to reach the goblin castle through a tricky labyrinth by a certain time in order to save her baby brother Toby, who she wished away, from being turned into a goblin. She meets colorful and unique characters on the way also. It's really entertaining and it's a movie that you could watch over and over. If you like Muppet\/human movies like this, i'd recommend a Muppet Christmas carol also by Henson productions.

After all, part 3 didn't measure up to part 2, and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.The girl's part was pretty good. She's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she just met. Of course, he was a friend of her brother.I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music, that would have been another matter.Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid, nations trying to destroy each other is stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure, there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three, and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again, but it is worth seeing once.

Where else will you see a group of odd balls who use packs on their backs with beams to catch ghosts all over New York. Where else will you see a green ghost that slimes people. The only place where you can find any of those things is Ghost Busters.This movie isn't a horror movie for any of you who watch it for that purpose, but it does have plenty of hilarious humor, action, and it is a very cool movie.This has a great cast of comedians that includes Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd. Sigourney Weaver is in this during her earlier years.Anybody can enjoy this movie. I saw this when I was about 6 years old and I have loved it ever since. The kids will like it for the action and the ghosts, everyone else who watches it will probably appreciate the humor in it. This isn't real scary, but I knew a 4 year old who watched this and he was pretty scared by it.Unfortunately, it is a bit dated. Many of the ghost effects that were amazing in 1984 are considered fake for today's standards. This was made before CGI first came around, so it is pretty good considering that.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it any time. It is a great movie and I'm sure you'll like it too.

This is a superbly made adventure drama, and a highly critical piece of commentary on society, and more specifically capitalistic societies. Within the three main characters Huston and writer B. Traven show how wealth and the desire for wealth corrupt men's souls and ultimately corrupt entire societies. In their blind lust and greed for wealth (or gold in the case of the movie) the plights of others are ignored, courtesy is exchanged for shrewdness and politeness is exchanged for malice. Even foreigners who happen along and want to share in the excess of wealth are ostracized and driven off, to the point of murder if they insist on sticking around. It is obvious that the writers had an agenda, if not to just create an amazingly entertaining film then to point out the ills of a society that is preoccupied with it's pursuit of wealth and it's misguided ideas of privilege. The fact that they are in Mexico seems to be an indictment of the way wealthy nations seem to exploit smaller nations in order to become wealthy. How poor nations are poor because others make use of the resources that they have. The fact that the main characters end up the way they do in the end is a direct result of who they are and the choices they made, but it may seem that the country they stole from finally got it's revenge on one of them, and the others get away with a lesser punishment, mainly they have their 'goods' taken back by the land they took it from.Aside from the political and social commentary by the writer of the book, B. Traven and the screenplay writer, John Huston, this is a wildly entertaining film and adventure. Back in a time when adventure films rarely left the realm of War dramas, this is a refreshing film experience. Huston creates a tense atmosphere of danger throughout the film. We feel the suspense from within the group of main characters to the outside elements that would cause harm to them. As anyone who comes along is a potential threat, to their quest for gold to their very struggle to survive. Huston makes this danger feel very real. Bogart's character is the most vibrant, and probably his best acting role ever! That is saying a lot. Bogart seems to take the viewer on a journey into madness, and when it happens it is shocking. In the beginning Bogart plays a sensible enough guy, just a little down on his luck, but otherwise a normal guy. That makes the transformation he makes all the more spectacular to watch. Tim Holt's character unfortunately falls victim to the madness swelling inside the gold hungry Bogart. Holt plays the average nice fellow, nothing spectacular about his character, except how average and nice he is, even when double crossed by Bogart's character. Walter Huston plays old man Howard, and his performance is marvelous as the crusty yet lovable world weary old man. His portrayal of the experienced gold digger is entirely believable, and very authentic. I cannot imagine anyone else playing that role and succeeding the way Huston does. I can just imagine the directer John Huston reading the book and thinking to himself, dad would be great in this part! And he certainly is.This film is like gold, it is worth what it is, cause there are so few films on par with it. It is so difficult to find a truly outstanding film these days, so when I see films I enjoy as much as this one, it is a real treasure!
