However, it's very entertaining and quite good, starring Marlene Dietrich, Jane Wyman, Michael Wilding, Richard Todd, Alistair Sim and Sybil Thorndike. Set in the atmosphere of London theater, Dietrich plays Charlotte, a stage star whose husband is murdered in their house. She begs her boyfriend Jonathan (Todd) to help her, as she is certain she will be accused. Worse, she has blood on her dress. Jonathan takes the dress and goes to Charlotte's home to get her another one. However, on the way out, the maid sees him. He panics, Charlotte panics, and Jonathan takes off with the aide of a young actress (Wyman) who's in love with him. She takes him to her father's (Sims) boat so he can hide out. She returns to London and finds out that indeed, Jonathan is the prime suspect. She meets a detective on the case named Smith (Wilding), and the two start falling for one another. He doesn't know that Eve is now living a double life as herself and that of Charlotte's dresser Doris in order to get information.Stage Fright moves quickly, and the characters are wonderful. Dietrich is beautiful in her Dior outfits and as Charlotte, she is completely self-involved, calling Doris Elsie and every other name except Doris. She wants her widow's weeds cut lower in the front and plans on attending a garden party right after her husband's funeral. Wyman is very good, though she doesn't use an English accent. As Doris, though, she has a very serviceable Cockney. Michael Wilding is handsome and charming as Detective Smith, and Richard Todd as Jonathan is obsessed as well as frightened. Alistair Sim is hilarious as Eve's father, an excellent portrayal of an eccentric man, and Sybil Thorndike is very funny as Eve's airhead of a mother.Dietrich sings several numbers in her inimitable style, and a very young Pat Hitchcock plays a young actress friend of Eve's. All in all, a good movie. Not Hitchcock's best maybe, but certainly better (as far as I'm concerned) than I Confess.

Hitch has often been quoted as treating actor like cattle and that is borne out to some extent here when he allows Pierre Fresnay - later to star in Le Corbeau, a finer movie than Hitch could even aspire to - to be killed off after one reel. I don't mid a film being implausible if it can compensate in other ways - like wit, class, style - but alas, all that happens here is we wonder why an ordinary, if affluent man, Bob Lawrence (Leslie Banks) should be able to casually produce a gun when setting out to search for some bad guys, or how the bad guys themselves not only had a plentiful supply of guns of all shapes and sizes but also - and most risible of all - at least one large steel box of ammunition so heavy it could only be dragged rather than carried.

This is the first great horror film I ever saw.My original viewing took place back in 1994, where, as a young lad on the path to a world full of glorious gore and brilliant giallo, I stumbled upon the world of a director named Dario Argento. I snagged an issue of FANGORIA from a local bookstore and I was fascinated by the images shown in pictorial form in that magazine. I got pumped up. I searched for this movie, the most famous of Dario's films, and I was able to find an old copy on VHS. This was before it was released in any good form on DVD.I remember the first time I watched it being completely shocked by the first murder scene, where the girl is hung. Then, the camera pans down to the floor where another one was struck by falling glass through the mouth...I was hooked.The colors and the splendor with which Argento paints the picture that is the setting of Suspiria should be on every painter's palette. The way he uses lights is amazing, especially for the time of Suspiria's release.To call him the 'Italian Hitchcock' is a little misleading; Argento brings something totally different to the table than Alfred ever did he updated the shock factor. And, unlike so many disgusting films that come out nowadays, he managed to keep it beautiful at the same time. Suspiria is the perfect introduction to this legendary horror director.
