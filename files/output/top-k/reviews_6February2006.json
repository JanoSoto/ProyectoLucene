It's absolutely amazing that for his directorial debut, Robert Redford created such a masterpiece. Now it was not all due to him, as the story was so well-written and the acting is dead on for all the characters. Part of the reason I love it so much might be because I was a psychotherapist before becoming a school teacher (mid-life crisis, you know). And, having worked with dysfunctional families, this movie gets it right time and time again. Therapy is not a miracle cure that takes effect almost immediately (like in GOOD WILL HUNTING) and the parents BOTH have a strong role in keeping the family sickness alive. Donald Sutherland is the enabler who denies there is a problem--even after one son dies by accident and the other attempts suicide. He also cannot face that the family's dysfunction is mostly controlled and maintained by his very disturbed wife, played wonderfully by Mary Tyler Moore. She is not mentally ill but has a very sick personality, as she is cold as ice emotionally and deals with problems through massive amounts of denial as well as stuffing her anger WAY down deep. Timothy Hutton is, despite his being the patient, the healthiest one in the family, as his suicide attempt is a strong cry for help. Finally, Judd Hirsch plays the therapist--and one of the most realistically portrayed therapists on film. He has no miracle cure but tries his best to get Hutton, and later Sutherland, to work hard at uncovering their dysfunction. Again and again and again, the viewer is rewarded by a brutally honest script that is about people who would be real--not Hollywood's idea of people. The film is neither manipulative nor condescending--this is the way more films SHOULD be.In addition, as I have watched the film several times, I keep noticing just how perfect the direction was. How wonderfully framed the shots were, how wonderfully the music fit in and how unflinching the movie dealt with pain. In particular, I love the scene with Sutherland at the psychiatrist's office as he talks about his marriage....and his eyes keep looking away and avoiding the doctor as he says how much he loves her. And the great Christmas photo scene--it just screams out this is real!!. For this to be Robert Redford's directorial debut is absolutely amazing and he surely earned that Best Director Oscar.FYI--although this movie is rated R, it is only for language. There are a few REALLY CHOICE WORDS used here and there, but otherwise this is a great movie for teens. If filmed today, this would no doubt be a PG-13 film. I am a very conservative parent, and yet I found this to be totally acceptable for my 15 year-old. It's a great film to watch WITH your kids and discuss what you see.I cannot recommend a film more highly.

So despite the fact that his belt has expanded since his best days in high school, he generally still has that going for him even if he has generally underachieved in everything else. Basing his rules around the approach of Steve (Steve being the embodiment of American male cool) Dex has managed to get into more beds than his looks really should have allowed him to and generally he is happy despite being a slacker in his late twenties. When he meets Syd though he finds himself feeling a bit more than normal (which is nothing) and genuinely liking her as a friend. Will she make him look again at his approach to life?The title should at least give you some idea of the type of film this is going to be because it manages to sound cool and interesting and a bit hip without really doing a lot &#150; which pretty much sums up the appeal of this as a film. The story is essentially quite a nice romance but it is set in a post-modern word of slackers who have relaxed jobs, relaxed morals, relaxed approaches to life, relaxed houses and generally just shoot the breeze about nothing. I suppose it will depend a bit on your age but, as some in his late twenties (at least, at the time of writing I am) I suppose I am target audience and I must admit it quite won me over. The story doesn't really go to any depth and, at the end of the day it does just what you expect it to do in terms of how it ends but it manages to get passed all this by having the same relaxed attitude of the characters.I'm sure it was not as easy to put together as it appeared but the film moves nicely along with a lot of pop culture references, slacker humour and a touch of genuine humanity in the romance. It wasn't the most convincing story or scenario but I was so happy to just buy into the cool nature of the world within the film that I forgave it perhaps a bit too easily for this. The direction helps because it all looks sunny and chilled, while the use of music is cool without being too obvious. The cast also help and, in particular, sterling work from Logue who manages to take a fat, sexist womaniser and make him into a character who has those characteristics but still managed to make me like him and care where his story went. Goodman gave a good performance and, like Logue, she came over very natural (probably helped by being the writer). Although these two carry the majority of the film the support cast are still pretty good and enjoyably fill in the film and match the mood.Overall a chilled and enjoyable little comedy that drew me in despite being slight and not having that much to it. Probably best watched by older members of the slacker generation or those that have grown up but still look back affectionately, this is quite fun and quite charming even if these qualities are covering up a multitude of sins in the background.

With the blessing of his employer, Gandhi resolves to create a stir and get the bad treatment of Indians in South Africa changed to be equal in the law to the English people. Burning passes is the first step towards a life spent in peaceful protest, massive social change and ultimate assassination.Taking on the unenviable task of doing justice to the life of Gandhi in a matter of three hours, Richard Attenborough has produced a professional film that presents the story in an engaging, easy to follow way that sees the hours slip effortlessly by. It is easy to suggest that the worthiness of the story tells itself but in reality this must have been a nightmare to script and then to edit into a film that has an impact, flows but yet still does the subject justice &#150; that it does all these is to its credit. The story picks the highlights of his life and moves it forward well; one criticism is perhaps the fact that it doesn't totally convey the sacrifice of a lifetime given over to the struggle but in fairness it gets as close as it was ever going to get. Starting at the end the film shows us the growth of Gandhi and it does it very slickly. Attenborough's direction is strong and the use of locations is impressive &#150; the film never really loses the sense of place, time or people that it creates from the very start.The cast greatly helps this sense of place and they are led by a fantastic performance from Ben Kingsley, who marked this film as the one he will always be best known for no matter what else he does. It helps that he resembles Gandhi and that he can do the accent but his performance is still suitable for the man and manages to come across as a person without losing the saintly air he has around him. He is well supported by a host of Indian actors (Om Puri, Jaffrey etc) and extras as well as Western stars including Fox, Gielgud, Mills, Sheen, Hawthorne, Griffiths and a young Day-Lewis; however there is never any doubt that he is he star of this film and he never disappoints.Overall this film has a high reputation and nothing I can say can add to it. It is highly regarded and a simple viewing will tell you why &#150; it looks great, does a great job with period, a great job with condensing the story and generally very strong performances with Kingsley deservedly winning many awards for it.

It deserved a better fate because of the funny screen play Mr. Blakeney created and the wonderful cast that was gathered for the picture. The problem seems to have been in the marketing. This is clearly not a Sandra Bullock vehicle at all!Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt are about the best thing going for the movie. Liam Neeson's Charlie is one of the funniest roles he has done in his career. Mr. Neeson tends to gravitate toward more dramatic fare, but as Charlie, he proves he is an accomplished comedian. The same goes for Oliver Platt who plays a bad guy interested in domestic activities such as cleaning a messy kitchen, or even thinking about a life in Italy growing tomatoes.The minor roles are equally good. Jose Zuniga and Micahel DeLorenzo are hilarious as a pair of gay drug dealers. Sandra Bullock doesn't get as many opportunities in the movie, but she is seen in the pivotal role of Judy. The group therapy sessions involving Charlie and other law enforcing people are fun to watch.Erik Blakeney shows he can do good work if only he could have the right studio people behind him.

And yet that's exactly what's happened. Gilliam's extraordinary vision keeps the film just surreal enough throughout that the audience is guessing to the end as to Cole's true state of mind, in a masterful manipulation of audience response, on a par with David Lynch.The most intriguing thing about Gilliam's characteristically idiosyncratic film noir venture is its eerie, almost apocalyptic depiction of modern America. Through the eyes of Willis' confused and emotionally vulnerable character, the world as we know it seems darker, more sinister and the society thereupon built seems to ominously and unknowlingly teeter on the verge of a inevitable tragedy. All I see are dead people, Cole despairingly confides in Dr. Railly, with a depressing conviction that for once has the audience actually hopeful that the main character is crazy.Working with this are some simply superb performances from the lead cast.

Madeline Stowe is competent as always, but it's no secret that the star is Brad Pitt, who should have won an Oscar for this disturbingly convincing portrayal of a complete and total nutter.And if all this weren't enough, the film's been given an erratic, discordant accordion score to boot; interspersed when thematically necessary with more harmonious string section, depending, of course, on whichever of the two Cole is feeling.

But Psycho is more than Perkins' extraordinary performance and Hitchcock's masterful direction. The movie offers a great plot of mystery and horror. It all starts as a dramatic situation but turns into a story of horror and beyond reason. Marion Crane escapes from his routine life and steals $40,000 from her work in order to start a new life with her boyfriend. Marion knows it's wrong but her moral won't stop her from doing her purpose. Everything seems to work on wheels until she stops in the Bates Motel where soon she will find her cruel fate. At this point of the movie you don't expect that it will be the main character's last scene!. This is where Psycho turns into a shocking movie, and at the same time the viewer is slapped in the face by Hitchcock's unique way of creating a suspenseful\/creepy atmosphere. But it's until the audience meets Norman Bates (played masterfully by Mr. Anthony Perkins) when things start to get a new point of view. The story gets rid of the angelic heroine that turned bad and now focuses on the mysterious Motel's owner. Norman seems to be a shy guy with a dark vibe that makes his presence uncomfortable. His major problem is his over-protective mother than won't allow him to do anything that she considers is against moral. As Norman talks about his mother and how he's affected by her madness, the viewer can determine that he is mentally disturbed but knows perfectly how to behave. Anthony Perkins acting is terrific because he knows how to create an uncomfortable atmosphere whenever he's on screen and mainly because he seems to be the kind of guy that is silent but dangerous at the same time. This is where the real suspense of the movie begins. And after Marion's murder things seem to get out of control for people who are used to scripts that don't get out of the standards. The main character is dead by half of the movie and from then, the situations become more interesting (in the point of view of a general audience) and you don't know what's gonna happen next, not even from a guess. This 180 degree twist has to be the most important in terms of contribution to any genre (being in this situation the Horror genre). What will happen to the people trying to find Marion? what about the $40,000? Who is behind Marion's murder? And most important of all, what's behind Norman Bates' behavior? Watch Psycho in order to witness one of the most important movies of all time. Even if you don't like the Horror\/Mystery genre, this movie will leave you satisfied because it offers everything a good movie needs  Good acting, masterful direction, excellent script, and a perfect score.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance that needs special mention. The man knows how to portray a psycho like no other can. Thank you Mr. Perkins for the performance that most people respect in the genre. Janet Leigh also delivers a believable performance. She showed that she is a great actress. The death scenes are beyond great this time. You don't see coming Mother ! whenever she raises the knife! Excellent scenes. Always copied, never matched. Also, the score deserves a honorable mention. This is probably the best score in any Horror film! Followed by Carpenter's in Halloweeen maybe. Please, do yourself a favor and watch this movie in order to witness why this is the most influential movie of all time.

An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as getting it which you would use explain the positive\/negative reactions to Dr. Strangelove, Nashville, or Clockwork Orange.The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching Times Square, Pump Up the Volume, New Waterford Girl, or Empire Records. An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality .....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts...... The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with Empire Records and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of Empire Records as the American Graffiti of the 90's, a similar one-day structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like The Big Chill, as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of Ghost World and Can't Hardly Wait will enjoy Empire Records but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid Empire Records.It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings. I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level. For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away. They are the two people who care the most about her. Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most.My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe and the store. So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet, the editor cuts between characters, coming back to Juliet Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?. The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.The ending is a mix of the Times Square's ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.Empire Records has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most.My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe and the store. So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' Romeo and Juliet, the editor cuts between characters, coming back to Juliet Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?. The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.The ending is a mix of the Times Square's ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.Empire Records has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Music"},{"date":"6 February 2006","score":"","review":" Trying to contribute something useful to prospective viewers means trying to explain the extremely polarized nature of the comments about Empire Records. An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as getting it which you would use explain the positive\/negative reactions to Dr. Strangelove, Nashville, or Clockwork Orange.The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching Times Square, Pump Up the Volume, New Waterford Girl, or Empire Records. An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality .....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts...... The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with Empire Records and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of Empire Records as the American Graffiti of the 90's, a similar one-day structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like The Big Chill, as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of Ghost World and Can't Hardly Wait will enjoy Empire Records but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid Empire Records.It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings. I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level. For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away. They are the two people who care the most about her.

This films portrayal of childhood is so timeless and real.Most of us who saw this film can probably relate completely to this story. We too spent all day long trekking around outside, getting dirty, and yes-occasionally cheating death. (I'm sure we all have our own crossing the train tracks story...) Not carrying a wallet. Not thinking twice at the prospect of having to spend all day walking in the heat to get somewhere. Being gone all day, unsupervised, with no mobile phone to rely on if you got caught in a jam. There are so many scenes and pieces of dialogue that resonate so strongly as you watch this film.However, childhood nostalgia is not the only emotion you feel watching this movie. Learning about the lives and hardships of these characters is heart-rending to watch (particularly Gordy's personal reaction to the body, and River Phoenix's famous milk money scene). I can't think of another film starring child actors that has made me feel even a 10th of the emotion I felt during this movie. This is due largely to the fact that they managed to cast some great actors here. But I think also, the fact that these characters weren't predictable and 2-dimensional, like so many other children portrayed in films. Yeah, these are regular kids, who spend much of their days eating sugar and laughing at vomit stories. But that's not all they're about. They all have real problems and real emotions, and care about more than collecting baseball cards.This movie is bittersweet. It makes you laugh, and brings back so many fond memories, but it also makes you ache for your lost childhood, and the friends who shared it with you (who are now, as so accurately put, just faces in the hallway). It also drives home the fragility of childhood innocence, and the harsh realities of life. Hearing the outcome of Chris's adulthood is one of the most boldly pessimistic things I've ever seen in a film.

I had never seen SHOCKER up until a couple of days ago, but always heard negative things about it, usually from big shot critics so I knew that it had to be good! however I was unable to find it, until a new video store opened up in town, I decided to pick it up since I didn't see anything more recent that looked to good to watch. So I popped this into my VCR & boy did I have fun! This flick is one of the many examples of fun horror flicks that does not get made anymore or at least does not seem to, SHOCKER tells the story of a young football player who has an awful nightmare that his foster family is being done in by a vicious serial killer who does in families. When he awakens he discovers that his dream was real & works with his policeman father to help nab the psycho who did it, it turns out that the son can dream about the murders before they happen & when he & his dad nab the killer thanks to his son's description taken from his dream, he is executed in the electric chair for his crimes, but it ain't over yet! Now the killer named HORACE PINKER (who was an occultist who practiced animal & human sacrifices while working in his own shop as a TV repairman) has the ability to jump from body to body & soon continues his vicious killing spree targeting people that the hero's knows, including killing his friends & his girlfriend. Now the only way to stop Pinker is with the help of his girlfriends ghost & it's going to be a long & dangerous ride! Although a tad long in running time, SHOCKER does not bore & features good directing & acting, HORACE PINKER was a well written character & it's such a shame that they never made a sequel to this, horror fans should have lots of fun with this, especially near the end when the hero & Pinker are jumping from old re-run shows, horror movies, an ALICE COOPER rock concert, game shows, boxing, documentaries & news broadcasts & even into other peoples living rooms as they fight one another. The scene where the hero uses a TV converter to make Horace pause, fast forward, rewind & bleeps the heck out off him is hilarious & works well. Essentially however, this is really nothing more than a remake of WES CRAVEN'S earlier horror film, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, since there is so much here that is reminiscent to that film, the scary dreams, the dark secrets held by the parents, the wicked one liners that pop out of the killers mouth, the neat plot twists, hallucinations, the killer being unable to kill the hero because of some power learned to defeat him, the vicious killings, the connection between the antagonist & protagonist of the story etc. I loved the SHOCKER theme song that played during the credits, they should have used it more in the film!

After directing his first movie in the U.S., The Dead Zone in 1983, Cronenberg was chosen to direct his first big budget project in the U.S. the remake of the classic movie The Fly.The plot of the original movie was kept at its core, a brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), creates a teleporting machine, but when he experiments teleporting himself, something goes wrong and he gets combined with a fly. That is the plot outline and all the movie has in common with the original, because Cronenberg took a whole different approach to the story.While in the original movie the doctor turned himself into a giant fly, in Cronenberg's movie Seth Brundle doesn't change instantly, his mutation is progressive, at first not apparent but later he becomes a new creature, something that has never existed before, as Brundle describes himself, he becomes the offspring of man and fly.The script is simply brilliant, not only it explores Seth Brundle's tragedy, the inclusion of Geena Davis as the reporter who falls in love with the scientist only to discover that his lover is slowly changing into something unnatural plays an important part in Brundle's tragedy. The story is full of metaphors and it is the ultimate romance\/horror tragedy.Now, all this would not be possible without the acting of both Goldblum and Davis, their chemistry together is remarkable and their performances carry the film with the power enough to give us insight in the tragedy that slowly gets in the middle of their love.David Cronenberg's direction is outstanding and this is one of his best works. The Fly truly shows his progression as an artist and it is an important step in his career. In The Fly he successfully mixes the character study of previous works like The Brood or The Dead Zone with the SFX-packed action of Scanners and Videodrome. this is without a doubt one of his most accomplished pictures.Overall, I could go on praising this film and yet it would not be enough.

After watching Stanton in action though, Henry is converted and joins him as campaign manager. Things are rough at first with little staff and a big gap in the polls however a major drop-out and some smart campaigning brings him into major contention for becoming the presidential candidate. Henry starts out arranging speeches, press conferences and sound bites but very quickly a sex scandal and personal revelations about Stanton start coming out of the woodwork and the campaign finds itself in a tougher battle.Although very clearly intended to satirise politics and, in particular, the Clintons, but the film just somehow doesn't manage to do it that well. The plot is interesting but it lacks teeth, making general points rather than going for the jugular on any issue. The general descent into corruption is reasonably well handled and the use of Henry is a nice device for making it clear that we are on a journey into something rather than, like the politicians, already being there. However the script isn't sharp enough and drifts forward with a lethargic style that may compliment Stanton's delivery but doesn't help the material at all. The comparisons with the Clintons do add some extra value to the film but it isn't enough to make the whole film (in the same way as a good Bush impression wasn't enough to sell Silver City); it may produce some snickering but again they lack a sharp edge and could have been a lot more.It doesn't help that Travolta does a pretty poor impression of Clinton. I could see what he was trying to but Clinton does sincerity much better than this and Travolta's version is a disservice. What is close to the mark is Thompson's take on a driven woman who will take anything as long as the prize is within reach. She is much more convincing and her tough character and struggles makes for interesting content. Lester is a talented actor and he doesn't allow himself to be dominated by any of the starry cast; he is impressive even when the weaker material leaves him out there on his own. Support from Bates, Thornton, Tierney, Hagman, Guilfoyle, Reiner, Ladd and others all add a touch of class but, like the leads, they cannot help the fact that the material is too weak to produce a solid satire.Overall this was an interesting and distracting film but it is certainly not as sharp, funny or insightful as it would like to think it is. By being far too general, meandering and uncommitted in one direction or the other the film loses a lot of its impact and doesn't have enough to it to be worth a look.

However the script isn't sharp enough and drifts forward with a lethargic style that may compliment Stanton's delivery but doesn't help the material at all. The comparisons with the Clintons do add some extra value to the film but it isn't enough to make the whole film (in the same way as a good Bush impression wasn't enough to sell Silver City); it may produce some snickering but again they lack a sharp edge and could have been a lot more.It doesn't help that Travolta does a pretty poor impression of Clinton. I could see what he was trying to but Clinton does sincerity much better than this and Travolta's version is a disservice. What is close to the mark is Thompson's take on a driven woman who will take anything as long as the prize is within reach. She is much more convincing and her tough character and struggles makes for interesting content. Lester is a talented actor and he doesn't allow himself to be dominated by any of the starry cast; he is impressive even when the weaker material leaves him out there on his own. Support from Bates, Thornton, Tierney, Hagman, Guilfoyle, Reiner, Ladd and others all add a touch of class but, like the leads, they cannot help the fact that the material is too weak to produce a solid satire.Overall this was an interesting and distracting film but it is certainly not as sharp, funny or insightful as it would like to think it is. By being far too general, meandering and uncommitted in one direction or the other the film loses a lot of its impact and doesn't have enough to it to be worth a look. I found it vaguely interesting but it felt watered down and needed to be a lot sharper if it was going to be remembered as anything more than that film where Travolta does a poor Clinton impression.

However the advice of Dr Rowan is ignored and the military decide that he is too valuable for science to lose. Of course it all goes wrong and it is only the sacrifice of Rowan that gets Jason frozen again. Jump forward a few hundred years and a student expedition uncovers the frozen bodies of the Jason and Rowan. They revive Rowan but start to cut up Jason as all scans show him to be dead; of course Rowan is brought back to life too late to warn the others and before you can say sexy teenagers in peril, Jason Voorhees is back to his old tricks on board the spaceship as it heads towards Earth II.Although I have yet to find any real value in the Friday 13th series, I decided that I'd give this a try since it had had many positive reviews. I quickly realised that this film was just going to push all the usual buttons but do it slightly differently by essentially crossing the series with the alien series (not really of course, but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was the closest it could have got). Looking back I can only assume the kind reviewers were a reflection that at least this film wasn't as bad as some of its predecessors rather than being reviewed by critics on its own merits. Despite being set in deep space, the film still manages to pull together a cast of nubile young actresses alongside some other genre clichés before setting out to pick them off one at a time in a series of rather nasty but yet unimaginative set pieces. In fairness it is distracting and fans of the series will probably enjoy it but personally I just felt like I was plodding wearily through overly familiar ground and the fact that it crossed over into a different genre didn't change that.The gore is reasonably good I suppose (I'm not really a horror fan) and those who like this sort of thing will probably not be bothered by the fact that the scares are obvious and don't really have a consistent or significant tension to them. The cast are all very pretty and buy into the material pretty well. Doig makes an unconvincing scientist but is sexy and gorgeous enough to fill the main requirements of the script. Hodder does his usual slow plodding stuff without having the opportunity or ability to add to it. The rest of the cast are a collection of soldier clichés, sexy young things, geeky guys and other genre staples. None of them do anything special or interesting but in fairness none of these films have ever been about the cast as performers &#150; just about them as eye candy and fodder.Overall this is better than the general standard of the Friday 13th films if only by crossing over into another genre to provide the same old same old with at least a fresh appearance. It is of course nothing of the sort and just repackages the same old stuff as usual. Better than the usual slasher fare but just don't expect it to be good.
