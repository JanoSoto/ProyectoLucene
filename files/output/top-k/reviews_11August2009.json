How do you top that? Seriously. Although Road to Perdition is an impassioned story (based on a graphic novel) of an Irish mobster and his son trying to stay alive, its screenplay is not the opus that American Beauty was. So, how do you approach your next directorial project when the bar is absurdly high? Whatever Sam Mendes did, it worked, because Perdition is just as beautiful and poetic.The posthumous Oscar for cinematographer Conrad L. Hall is much deserved. Perdition is a story that takes death rather lightly with a very high body count and as seen in American Beauty, Mendes will settle for nothing but the most visually memorable and poetic of tragic climaxes and deaths. These two make quite a team, inflating what's just a good but not great script into a rich and striking film. They milk everything they can out of the film's most poignant moments and convince you of that feeling that you're watching incredible, meaningful cinema when it's just a very good\/interesting story at best.Taking place in 1930s Illinois and Chicago, Perdition is about Michael Sullivan, a hit man (Hanks) with two young boys working for an Irish mob boss John Rooney (Newman) -- loosely based on real gangster John Looney -- who gave him everything he's ever had. When a curious Michael Jr. wants to know what his father does, he accidentally witnesses a hit gone wrong, which puts Sullivan in bad standing with his mob family. Rooney then has his son, Connor (Daniel Craig), off Sullivan's family. Sullivan and Michael Jr. manage to survive and flee to Chicago, where they are still wanted dead. Soon, father and son must be honest with each other in order to survive and Sullivan will do anything to get his revenge yet still keep his son away from it all.The cast is great, but an actor with Tom Hanks' versatile talent has no business playing a hit man of few words. Perhaps the notion of a audiences thinking it's just another mob film scared Mendes and other producers into getting a marquee name, but all you have to do is say Paul New-- and the old people start flocking. Newman gets a supporting Oscar nod for nothing but the respect he commands of the camera and on the screen. A mob boss is such an intriguing role for a then mostly retired famous actor and it definitely gives Perdition something give it that instant classic feel.Perdition avoids telling us all the mob stuff we already know from watching The Godfather and Goodfellas in terms of organized crime life being about loyalty, respect and family, etc. It jumps right into the fresh angle it's taking the relationship between a hit man and his son. It's a story of guarding innocence in the face of harsh, immoral reality.Most of the film is just a thriller with Sullivan finding ways to get his revenge while avoiding the man hired to whack him (Jude Law). There's a lot of killing and the general rule has always been the more killing, the less meaningful death becomes and the more silly and less serious a film is (theoretically why action movies don't get taken seriously). But Mendes and Hall take exception, making sure these deaths will give you enough chills to forget that you're tired of seeing people get shot. Lots of films have you guessing who will die -- Perdition has you guessing what order.The script is good, just a little deliberate. It's not shy about letting you know what it's about and what its themes are, which is always good for some viewers and souring for others. But in the end its the thoughtful and artistic eye of Mendes that wins out as the film closes with a thrilling, beautiful and near-perfect climax. Mob movies might have gotten old for some people already, but it would be inadvisable to skip out on such great film-making for that reason.

This is odd, because Always, until recently, had always been one of the few Spielberg titles that I was somewhat hesitant to defend. I had never doubted its decency as an entertainment, but I was often willing to acknowledge that it was one of his weakest films. I think the reason was usually the fact that it's one of his poorest reviewed works. The thing is, unlike 1941, with which you can ignore the bad reviews and simply enjoy the movie because it was all fun and games, Always is quite clearly a film that Spielberg wanted to be taken seriously. It's never good when the audience is laughing for all the wrong reasons.But then just recently, I revisited Always. I realized that I had forgotten much of what occurs in the film because I had seen it years earlier. I wondered if perhaps, now that I had gotten older, I would be able to better understand what the filmmakers were getting at. Suddenly, I was surprised to find out many things that John Williams's score is a treasure; that Michael Kahn's editing makes this two-hour feature move like a streak; that Jerry Belson's screenplay is actually intelligent and expertly written; and that Spielberg directs with the threads that only a master could weave. Sure enough, not only is Always a much stronger film than I remember it being, but it has even aged nicely.Always has only one glaring flaw the miscasting of Brad Johnson in the role of Ted Baker. Because this is a love story about two people who simply have got to move on, it doesn't help to know that Dorinda is now falling for a guy who doesn't have any of the charisma or charm of Pete. Ted is the equivalent of a male dumb blonde and is almost hilariously stupid; when he's in a bar chatting with a saucy redhead (Mary Helgenberger), he blurts out that he's still thinking about the girl I met last summer (as Pete puts it while in ghostly form, I don't think I'm familiar with this technique, Ted). Also, when Ted and Dorinda finally hook up, Ted immediatedly gets impatient when Dorinda starts rambling about Pete. How are we supposed to like Ted if he can't even think well of Pete's memory? And sure, the female audiences all thought Brad Johnson was a hunk, but COME ON! Does he even know how to ACT? Why did Spielberg cast him in this movie? What was Johnson thinking when he did those terrible John Wayne impersonations not just once, but FOUR times? Either the part should have been written better, and\/or a better, more experienced young actor should have been cast in the role.One thing about the film that is still pretty confusing is the title. Apparently, Spielberg had wanted to call the film Always because he had planned to use the Irving Berlin theme Always as Pete and Dorinda's dance song. Problem was, Berlin (who was near death at the time) refused to sell Spielberg the rights to the song. So, Spielberg had to use Smoke Gets In Your Eyes as Pete and Dorinda's dance song- but he couldn't use it for the film's title because it would sound offensive to slap that title onto a film that was, really, about people who sometimes got killed in forest fires. Ultimately, Spielberg ended up using Always as the film's title, even though this title had already been used for a 1985 independent film directed by filmmaker Henry Jaglom, who, ironically, did not have a good relationship with Spielberg (Jaglom had once criticized The Color Purple as a Disney version of The Grapes of Wrath).Always is a sentimental film. That is for certain. But that should not be a sole reason for criticizing it. This, after all, was how Spielberg really felt about the story. Without the sentimentality, perhaps Always could still be admired for its technical accomplishments, but nevertheless, it would still be hard to, well... enjoy the film. Part of what makes Always such a fantastic achievement is that we care about what happens to Pete and Dorinda. We wish they could have gone on to live a happy life together. We wish Pete could have told Dorinda, while he was still alive, that he loved her. But what would the movies be if characters only did what we wanted them to? What happens to Pete is sad, but ultimately, Hap was right neither Pete nor Dorinda will ever be free until they are able to let go. When they finally do, we, as an audience, are like Pete and Dorinda, and are finally willing to accept it. This, of course, was not the only film Spielberg made in 1989 that was about letting go. What does Henry Jones Sr. tell Indy at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Indiana... let it go.When Always ends, we are able to let go, but without regret. We are like Pete and Dorinda.

What was Johnson thinking when he did those terrible John Wayne impersonations not just once, but FOUR times? Either the part should have been written better, and\/or a better, more experienced young actor should have been cast in the role.One thing about the film that is still pretty confusing is the title. Apparently, Spielberg had wanted to call the film Always because he had planned to use the Irving Berlin theme Always as Pete and Dorinda's dance song. Problem was, Berlin (who was near death at the time) refused to sell Spielberg the rights to the song. So, Spielberg had to use Smoke Gets In Your Eyes as Pete and Dorinda's dance song- but he couldn't use it for the film's title because it would sound offensive to slap that title onto a film that was, really, about people who sometimes got killed in forest fires. Ultimately, Spielberg ended up using Always as the film's title, even though this title had already been used for a 1985 independent film directed by filmmaker Henry Jaglom, who, ironically, did not have a good relationship with Spielberg (Jaglom had once criticized The Color Purple as a Disney version of The Grapes of Wrath).Always is a sentimental film. That is for certain. But that should not be a sole reason for criticizing it. This, after all, was how Spielberg really felt about the story. Without the sentimentality, perhaps Always could still be admired for its technical accomplishments, but nevertheless, it would still be hard to, well... enjoy the film. Part of what makes Always such a fantastic achievement is that we care about what happens to Pete and Dorinda. We wish they could have gone on to live a happy life together. We wish Pete could have told Dorinda, while he was still alive, that he loved her. But what would the movies be if characters only did what we wanted them to? What happens to Pete is sad, but ultimately, Hap was right neither Pete nor Dorinda will ever be free until they are able to let go. When they finally do, we, as an audience, are like Pete and Dorinda, and are finally willing to accept it. This, of course, was not the only film Spielberg made in 1989 that was about letting go. What does Henry Jones Sr. tell Indy at the end of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Indiana... let it go.When Always ends, we are able to let go, but without regret. We are like Pete and Dorinda. We are free.

And sending assassins with lots and lots and lots of bullets to try to stop him.Shockley thought he was chosen to escort Mally because I get the job done. Ironically, the crooked commissioner chose him because he knew drunken slob Shockley would be an easy target. No one to call, no one to help, no one to trust, Shockley is on his own; set up by his own department, with bullets coming at him every which way, Shockley at last finds incentive to really get the job done.Sondra Locke looking her most delectable with those big doe eyes and 70's-wench bellbottoms, doing the best acting of her nepo-Clint-istic career. She never achieved this level of natural-ness in any of her other roles with Eastwood; just a guess, but maybe she became too complacent as his main squeeze. After leaving Eastwood, she left Cinema.Just another guess, but maybe her ousting was self-imposed after her directorial debut with RATBOY (1986), where Clint lent her his A-Team production crew (David Valdes, Joel Cox, Bruce Surtees, Lennie Niehaus, et al) only to have her pump out a landmark of filmic sewage.In THE GAUNTLET, the ludicrousness starts when police open fire on a house that Shockley and Mally are hiding in, and shoot it up so badly it collapses. Film immediately redeems itself by having Mally change into something more prostitutable - tight velour bellbottoms laced up the ass-crack and a shirt-top tied up to expose her midriff.Plot? What plot? Working with many familiar cast (Bill McKinney, Dan Vadis, Michael Cavanaugh, and Pat Hingle as a doughy superior officer - again), Clint stages one chase-and-shoot set-piece after another, each designed so that only an icon as audacious as Clint Eastwood could survive them.The funniest slice of non-pc violence has to be Shockley punching the biker chick off the train. The act of punching ladies seems to advocate violence against women, but Clint's avenger characters - of which Shockley is one, albeit more reluctantly than most - have always advocated only punching people who deserve to be punched. If they happen to be female, so be it.The feature piece of THE GAUNTLET is also its grandest stupidity Shockley and Mally driving an armored bus up the main street to the courthouse, while policemen line both sides of the street, unloading millions of rounds into the bus. Where do we start the one hundred questions?...Have any of these guys heard of crossfire? Why didn't Shockley drive faster than 10mph? Why didn't the cops shoot out the tires? Even if the commissioner falsely warned against armed and dangerous perps onboard the bus, is it really police procedure to open fire on a city bus without it opening fire first? Is their aim to stop the bus or the people, because as soon as the bus stops and Shockley and Mally exit, the cops stop firing. And if their aim was to stop the bus only, why not a spike strip across the road? Because nothing can stop Clint Eastwood.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).

One major flaw. No, not that Sarah Connor lives in the painful New Wave 1980s with her brainless, bighair girlfriend, not that the Terminator has no eyebrows, not even that lame Brad Fiedel soundtrack that sounds like Oingo without the Boingo - writer-director Cameron artfully dodges the time paradox flaw created simply by sending the Terminator back through time in the first place.You see, if the Terminator succeeds in killing Sarah, she will not birth the leader of the revolution, therefore the Terminator would have no reason to come back and kill her.

This is also the movie where Schwarzenegger coins, I'll be back! In this perfect role for someone with no command of the English language, of his seventeen lines of dialog, these three words would become Arnold's catch-cry forever.And he does come back - again and again, in mighty action sequences where he is gunned down, run over, exploded, yet relentlessly recovering and pursuing Sarah, unstoppable, Reese forever warding off the attacks. Reese tells Sarah ...it doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear (he's right - seen PUMPING IRON?) It absolutely will not stop until you are dead. While they hide out in a roach motel, Reese puts his future-moves on Sarah, calling her a Legend and strong and brave and anything else guaranteed to moisten her man-jeans.

And then Cameron makes an excellent character move - something which no one would dream of making in later Arnold movies after his star had risen to major box-office draw - he terminates Arnold! The flesh is seared off the Terminator in the last act and we see only the steel machine-man endoskeleton (created by legendary Stan Winston) pursue Sarah. This plot development, though robbing Arnold of screen time, drove home the Terminator's relentlessness; how it would literally stop at nothing, not even its flesh coming off, to complete its deadly mission. These are some of the most terrifying sequences of this modern technological horror tale, clinical, un-human; as Reese's warnings come to metal stop-motion fruition ...It can't be bargained with, can't be reasoned with...The dicey closeups of Arnold's prosthetic head nearly land this movie in the B-Movie crap heap, though - but we forgive Cameron and Winston; best anyone could do pre-CGI, without selling their soul to George Lucas.Though the Terminator failed in its mission - leaving the future of mankind in the hands of a semi-bighaired, man-faced eighties chick - with the box office grosses nearly hitting the movie's filming budget on its opening weekend, we can be sure of at least one thing He'll be back.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 August 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Seven years ago, when K-19 The Widowmaker was first released, it was seen as little more than another loud, frantic sea story jam-packed with bad luck trips and close calls aplenty. In the same summer, a boy was turning into a human spider, a young warrior was training to become a galaxy legend, and a falsely accused police officer was hiding blindfolded under ice water. Some of these summer blockbusters were worth seeing and some were not, but the last thing post-9\/11 audiences wanted to rush into with popcorn tucked under their arms was a gritty international thriller in which combat was lacking, but internal drama was seething underneath.K-19 The Widowmaker shifts from a hard-edged adventure film to an almost unbearably disturbing, terrifying thriller. Vostrikov and Polenin know that the only solution to saving the sub is to send men into the core to cool the reactor, but this is easier said than done. As the first couple of men make their way to the core, cloathed with little more than thinly-protected chemical suits, Bigelow, at first sight of the glowing-blue reactor, hauntingly elects to play an operatic theme from the Voices of Light version of The Passion of Joan of Arc on the soundtrack. The men go in and within ten minutes are coming out with burned faces, vomiting pea soup. The reactor itself becomes a monster- right up there with HAL 9000 or the diesel truck from Duel. Rather than walk, talk or eat, it simply waits for its prey, like a sea sponge. The scenes involving the reactor invoke an unexpected claustrophobia that, to put it frankly, doesn't feel good.I attended K-19 The Widowmaker during its initial release in July 2002. I was eleven years old at the time. As a schoolboy just beginning to look at various types of films, I was thrilled to be seeing a film starring two A-list actors who were both famous for working with my two favorite filmmakers at the time. Ford and Neeson were well-known to me they had both worked with Spielberg (Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Neeson in Schindler's List), and they had both followed Lucas into the Star Wars universe (Ford in A New Hope, Neeson in The Phantom Menace). When I finally did get the chance to see the film, the nearby theater showing it had just suffered a broken projector; my father and I had to travel to a more remote theater, finally, in order to see what this film was all about. I am proud to have had that experience considering that the film met with ghastly box office results; at least we gave Bigelow and the filmmakers our money. For a boy my age, it was worth it, too, to see Ford and Neeson sparring in the same film together. As Vostrikov, Ford gives a performance that echoes his portrayal of the obsessive, paranoid inventor Allie Foxx in Peter Weir's Paul Schrader-scripted utopia nightmare The Mosquito Coast (1986); and as Polenin, Neeson exhibits a fatherly charisma that reminds us both of Oskar Schindler and of his portrayal as the Irish revolutionary in Neil Jordan's Michael Collins (1996). Both actors deliver some of their finest work here.Kathryn Bigelow's newfound popularity may even spawn the appreciation for her career that she has always deserved but, curiously, has never received. I think K-19 The Widowmaker will be back. It is impossible to imagine a film such as this one- with its passionate screenplay and its powerhouse acting by Ford and Neeson- being left on the shelves to wither away and die. Whatever it takes to bring this film back to the public's attention, I'm all for it. For twenty-eight years, the story of the K-19 could not be told. Now the story has been disclosed, and yet it is still oblivious to a large portion of the public. What are we to make of this, comrades? ","genre":"Drama, History, Thriller"},{"date":"11 August 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Seven years ago, when K-19 The Widowmaker was first released, it was seen as little more than another loud, frantic sea story jam-packed with bad luck trips and close calls aplenty. In the same summer, a boy was turning into a human spider, a young warrior was training to become a galaxy legend, and a falsely accused police officer was hiding blindfolded under ice water. Some of these summer blockbusters were worth seeing and some were not, but the last thing post-9\/11 audiences wanted to rush into with popcorn tucked under their arms was a gritty international thriller in which combat was lacking, but internal drama was seething underneath.K-19 The Widowmaker shifts from a hard-edged adventure film to an almost unbearably disturbing, terrifying thriller. Vostrikov and Polenin know that the only solution to saving the sub is to send men into the core to cool the reactor, but this is easier said than done. As the first couple of men make their way to the core, cloathed with little more than thinly-protected chemical suits, Bigelow, at first sight of the glowing-blue reactor, hauntingly elects to play an operatic theme from the Voices of Light version of The Passion of Joan of Arc on the soundtrack. The men go in and within ten minutes are coming out with burned faces, vomiting pea soup. The reactor itself becomes a monster- right up there with HAL 9000 or the diesel truck from Duel. Rather than walk, talk or eat, it simply waits for its prey, like a sea sponge. The scenes involving the reactor invoke an unexpected claustrophobia that, to put it frankly, doesn't feel good.I attended K-19 The Widowmaker during its initial release in July 2002. I was eleven years old at the time. As a schoolboy just beginning to look at various types of films, I was thrilled to be seeing a film starring two A-list actors who were both famous for working with my two favorite filmmakers at the time. Ford and Neeson were well-known to me they had both worked with Spielberg (Ford in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Neeson in Schindler's List), and they had both followed Lucas into the Star Wars universe (Ford in A New Hope, Neeson in The Phantom Menace). When I finally did get the chance to see the film, the nearby theater showing it had just suffered a broken projector; my father and I had to travel to a more remote theater, finally, in order to see what this film was all about. I am proud to have had that experience considering that the film met with ghastly box office results; at least we gave Bigelow and the filmmakers our money. For a boy my age, it was worth it, too, to see Ford and Neeson sparring in the same film together. As Vostrikov, Ford gives a performance that echoes his portrayal of the obsessive, paranoid inventor Allie Foxx in Peter Weir's Paul Schrader-scripted utopia nightmare The Mosquito Coast (1986); and as Polenin, Neeson exhibits a fatherly charisma that reminds us both of Oskar Schindler and of his portrayal as the Irish revolutionary in Neil Jordan's Michael Collins (1996). Both actors deliver some of their finest work here.Kathryn Bigelow's newfound popularity may even spawn the appreciation for her career that she has always deserved but, curiously, has never received.
