This comic duo plays traveling businessmen who accidentally bump into each other during a crazy trip home for the holidays. Steve Martin plays Neal Page - a smug, successful businessman with a wife and three kids who he leaves alone most of the time in their big, suburban house in Chicago while he works too much on the road. John Candy plays Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman who plays the clown on the outside but we know that inside, he is in some kind of pain. He talks too much, is sloppy and carries this giant trunk everywhere he goes; but there is something warm and kind about him; even though he is obnoxious, we cannot help but like him. The two are an unlikely pair; but their paths cross over and over again when Neal Page is trying to get home to his family for Thanksgiving. And just like the characters in this movie, we are in for the ride of our lives!As you might guess, everything goes wrong for these two. From Del stealing a cab from Neal - and then Neal being bumped from first class on the plane only to be seated next to blabbermouth Del - to further flight delays, and unsuccessful car rentals - this Laurel and Hardy pair eventually end up on the road together and ultimately in the same hotel room...and the same bed. This hotel scene is absolutely sidesplitting. In another classic scene in which Neal (Martin) tries to get a rental car at the airport, he is so tired and angry, he totally abuses the woman at the car-rental counter. In this scene, the word f***ing is uttered more times than you can count and it is so hilarious - your ribs will hurt from laughing.This movie has some of the funniest scenes in comedy history and if you don't laugh until you cry, there is something seriously wonky with your sense of humor. You're going the wrong way! is a line that will forever be associated with this film and if you have not ever seen it, please, please put it on your list.In the midst of the flawlessly funny exchanges between Martin and Candy, there are some very touching moments in this film that remind us what the holidays are all about family and friendship; peace, love and goodwill toward others. This movie manages to get that message across loud and clear even though you are laughing your ass off through most of it.Boy, do I miss John Candy so much. Thank Goodness his movies live on so we can get a glimpse of this brilliantly funny man in action again and again.

Or were you actually interested in the upbringing story of this kid Anakin Skywalker? here is my thoughts as to why I think this movie was actually pretty good where others totally just crap on it saying it was bad. This might contain spoilers if you haven't seen the movie yet, or the Anakin trilogy. Sounds weird but it's true since these three parts actually are about Anakin and also the war.Now on to the first movie which is this one right here. This is actually a good start to a franchise that was already established and great since the 70's with Star wars A New Hope. This Prequel however opens a lot of doors as to what was really going down before the events of A New Hope and really answers a lot of questions, but also gives us more questions while it does so.People complaining that there is no Character Development on here. I suggest you watch it again and pay attention. these characters have such a great history behind them and are fleshed out as the series goes along. Also the special effects are decent here, but don't expect to much since this is a story piece movie and not a full blown action flick. I also don't agree that this was just for kids I think that since this movie was slapped with the PG rating it made it seem so, but it wasn't. This movie was made more for people who know about the Star wars Universe than the kids that are fresh and new to it. But it is a good place for the fresher eyes of the viewing audience to get an understanding as to what is going on.Spoiler If you haven't watched the movie I suggest you skip this part until you do watch it cause this is where it gets interesting and I try to break down the movie as best as I can. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escape Naboo and land on a desert planet Tatooine They meet a young boy by the name of Anakin. Qui-Gon later realizes that the boy has the power of the force within him. He then later finds out that Anakin has a large amount of midi-chlorian over 20k which no Jedi has. He then finds out from Anakins mother that she had a virgin birth if you think religiously somewhat like how Jesus was born. Also when they are deciding whether to train him or not they tell him that he is too old. and its dangerous to train him at this age (age 8). You also know that Anakin was created because of these cells, and in Episode 3 they throw in some epic information as to how Anakin was really created. But that is for a later review.As far as this movie goes everything is really decent the acting is good, the Characters are good, but have to understand these characters grow as the series does.the little you know about them in this movie is good. The dialogue wasn't bad at all and I thought the kid that played Anakin was actually good. To get more insight on these characters you have to watch the following movies. There is a great story being told, but they distract you with all this nonsense at times that can throw you off just like the old ones. Where as this one is the colorful jar-jar character and his race. And others along the way. I am not sure if these characters are thrown in just for the kids and the laughs, like 4,5, and 6 had. But my advice is to look past the crazy characters and focus on it's core. You will understand what they are trying to tell you, and leave you asking for more.

Pop culture was pushing the limits and changing the way many people on the drug scene were used too. The problems were being told through the news, the radio and the newspapers frequently. Then in 1996 an independent British film hit cinema, causing uproar, controversy, worldwide success, critical acclaim and even government mention, this film was called Trainspotting.Trainspotting is based on a novel by Irvine Welsh which charts the life of a bunch of non- existent losers who're living their lives to their supposed full on the Edinburgh drug scene. The film charts the issues of poverty, crime and anti-social behavior that are still alive in Britain today and shows the horrifying problems of drug abuse that the public-eye attempts to be unaware of. The film exposes the bunch of nasty, yet somewhat hilarious group of stoner's lives and how Renton (Ewan McGregor) attempts to find a true meaning to his chaotic and miserable life.Trainspotting is not a film that will appeal to everyone; it's graphic, nasty and harrowing. Yet, it retains from wanting the viewer to stop watching and manages to hold you throughout the entire running time. A film's content can, in some cases occupy the film's story and make you lose any pity, affection or remorse for the characters. Trainspotting manages to disgust, while still informing the viewers of the problems from drugs.For a film that is so startlingly daring and distressing at times you'd be surprised that it manages to make its point so clear and authoritative. A factor that caused controversy on release was that the film is not afraid to say drugs are good at first, but then the film goes on to saying but it's not worth it because the side effects will screw you up forever. It's an excellent message and one that alerts any viewer not to ever go near drugs, yet people have ignored the true meaning of the film which is held within some of the horrific imagery and experiences. If there is one that film that will make you never want to take drugs its Trainspotting. It really will make you think twice and also help you understand why people do such repulsive and then why drug abuse is wrong. Trainspotting is not a film that is preachy, it says you have one life which you should use with care and how you should realize the consequences of your actions. So at heart Trainspotting is an unforgettable and mesmerizing study of wasted life. It succeeds in making its viewers come out learning and understanding one of the world's many unpleasant problems.If you didn't see these characters going through such disturbing events the film would not have such a poignant message and one that shows so many devastating outcomes of the drug abuse. Trainspotting has many iconic and memorable characters that're acted out with the utmost sincerity, yet some remain oddly charming. The characters are hysterical at times and for a film full such shameful people you still manage to hold pity for their decaying lives as they spiral into a living hell. The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialog is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why.

The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialog is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why.

Not that it's in the same league as that film of course but as sequels go it's not bad. It sort of looks to me that it was some kind of response to the accusations that the original film attracted of being a fascistic police brutality manifesto. In this one we have some renegade policemen handing out vigilante justice to an assortment of low-life's that the justice system hasn't been adequately dealing with. It can surely be no coincidence on the film-makers part that in this instance Harry Callaghan is made to look relatively libertarian alongside these cops. Although this plot-line is in some ways a weakness, as in the original flick the villain was an irredeemable scumbag, where here we have cops who take out characters such as a pimp who brutally murders one of his prostitutes in the back of a cab. The problem is that I think most of us are cheering the comeuppance of lowlifes such as this, so the villains of this movie aren't entirely unsympathetic which dilutes the dynamics a bit.If it could be said that Harry is softened a bit here, pretty much everything else is ramped up. There's more violence, nudity, swearing and sleaze. But never has the truism less can be more been more appropriate than here, as the overall effect is much less effective. The direction is more sluggish and the movie is definitely too long. It could easily have been a good 20 minutes shorter, and the last third is a bit lacking overall. However, as I mentioned earlier it's really not too bad either. There is plenty of violent action to keep things interesting. And the idea of a succession of sleazy characters getting knocked off is not too bad an idea.So, some reservations for sure but overall pretty good fun.

And that's coming from a non western fan! You clearly don't have to be a western fan to have a love and appreciating for this movie. Every movie lover in general should be capable of appreciating the quality, art and talent that is all present in this movie.It's one of those rare movies in which everything comes together perfectly. The story, the directing, the acting, the settings, the music. Everything fits and works out perfectly. All elements strengthen each other as well. The music strengthens its images, the director its actors, etcetera. Would the movie had been just as good and unforgettable with a different cast? Or different music, or a different director? Probably not. It would be like replacing an instrument in a Mozart composition, or changing some of the colors in a Picasso painting. All of the elements need each other to become the great masterpiece that Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo. is.One of the reasons why I have always loved this movie is because it's buildup as a real adventurous movie, in which the hunt for a treasure plays a very central role. It takes the main characters to all kinds of different places, where they meet all kinds of different people and each time run into different problems as well. Really, this movie is basically an adventure movie, disguised as a western. It also really makes this movie unique in its genre and so extremely likable and easy to watch, time after time, despite its long running time.Also the interaction between the three main character is just great. They often trade roles and alliances with each other and constantly try to be one step ahead of the other. They never thrust each other and for good reasons. None of the characters are truly good or bad, even though the title of the movie might suggest otherwise.And needless to say that the three main parts are also perfectly cast ones. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all rarely have been better. And they also make it real difficult to pick a favorite character. Each of them has their own qualities and certain amount of charm and likability level to them.There is also no big surprise in it that the movie is really skilfully directed and put together by Sergio Leone, who obviously was a master of the genre. He perfectly combines both visual and story elements, with an equal amount of eye for detail for both. He pretty much perfected the spaghetti western genre at the time pretty much on his own and his influences can still be seen back in modern movies now days.One of his finest moments of course comes during its final shootout. But I actually think it are the movie its last 30 minutes in general that are just great, the moment Tuco first enters the cemetery. It's really something that's among the greatest moments out of movie history.The shootout, or Mexican standoff, itself is really nothing short of brilliant. Its compositions, the editing, its close-ups, the Ennio Morricone music. Could had things been more perfect? It has such a great buildup, in which the characters are slowly moving and looking around at first. The music helps to buildup the tension, then it swells up and when you expect things to go down it goes suddenly entirely quiet. However then the music suddenly starts again and the buildup gets even more intense, with fast cuts and even more extreme closeups.

Howard The Duck is not a good a movie. True, the first half of it isn't nearly as bad as its infamous reputation. That second half, though&#x85;ye gods. The first hour is like a lame 80s sitcom in tone and tenor. Imagine My Two Dads starring a little person in a duck costume and you've got an idea of what it's like. The second hour is one of those epic crapfests where the film got completely away from the filmmakers and they didn't know how to get it back. It's also evident that the people who made Howard The Duck did not understand the way Steve Gerber's embittered everyduck was bound up in the zeitgeist of the 1970s and doesn't really work outside that era. Throw in an at times mind blowingly inappropriate soundtrack and you've got a motion picture that does deserve most of the disdain directed at it over the years.In the comics, Howard was an anthropomorphized duck from another dimension transported to Earth and trapped in a world he never made to be the cynical, struggling centerpiece of writer Steve Gerber's surreal social satire. His adventures became one of those mini cultural sensations that flare up and disappear almost as quickly, like the Adam West Batman show but on a much smaller level. There's only one scene in this movie that reflects Howard's comic book sensibilities. The rest of the time, this story could have been about Daffy, Donald or any other duck.In this film, the three foot high waterfowl finds himself transported from Duckworld to Earth, where he quickly meets Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson), the lead singer in a girl band. She takes Howard in and leads him to over excited lab assistant Phil Blumburrt (Tim Robbins), who eventually connects Howard to Dr. Walter Jenning (Jeffrey Jones), the man whose experiment brought Howard to this planet. After trying to recreate that experiment, Dr. Jenning is possessed by an alien monster and Howard and company have to stop him from bringing the rest of his kind down and destroying the world.The list of good things about this movie isn't very long. Lea Thompson is cute as the dickins and admirably plays along with these filmmakers' poor sense of humor. Tim Robbins also eats the scenery with aplomb and Ed Gale and a set of other little people do an okay job of giving Howard a physical personality.As for the rest&#x85;oy.The musical score to Howard The Duck is one of the most unfortunate ones I've ever heard in any film. Imagine if Ghostbusters had had the soundtrack from Out of Africa. Now imagine if Ghostbusters also wasn't funny. That's what the music here is like. The writing is full of willful clichés, unearned sentimentality and lazy plotting. The direction is sterile, never giving the audience a defined point of view. We aren't shown the world through the eyes of Howard or any other character. The camera is always at an emotional and intellectual distance, which only highlights the dull-witted attempts at comedy.Even if the talent fairy had waved her magic wand and gotten the people behind this film to fix every other problem, it still would probably have been doomed by the terrible miscasting of Howard's voice. Chip Zien gives the curmudgeonly mallard all the depth of an infomercial host and all the edge of a Mormon candidate for President of the United States. Zien sounds like one of those bad standup comedians who get a TV show that airs for 6 episodes and then are never heard from again. Given the technical limitations of the day in regard to Howard's look and expression, getting the right voice for the character was absolutely essential and they blew it as bad as it could be blown.Some folks may try to tell you that Howard The Duck is a cult classic. They're wrong because the first half of the movie isn't nearly bad enough to qualify as cult. If you're in a forgiving mood, you might even like it. Not even Nelson Mandela has even forgiveness in him to tolerate the second half, but that has too much hackneyed, conventional Hollywood nonsense in it to merit cult status either.

Chip Zien gives the curmudgeonly mallard all the depth of an infomercial host and all the edge of a Mormon candidate for President of the United States. Zien sounds like one of those bad standup comedians who get a TV show that airs for 6 episodes and then are never heard from again. Given the technical limitations of the day in regard to Howard's look and expression, getting the right voice for the character was absolutely essential and they blew it as bad as it could be blown.Some folks may try to tell you that Howard The Duck is a cult classic. They're wrong because the first half of the movie isn't nearly bad enough to qualify as cult. If you're in a forgiving mood, you might even like it. Not even Nelson Mandela has even forgiveness in him to tolerate the second half, but that has too much hackneyed, conventional Hollywood nonsense in it to merit cult status either. This is just another failed comic book adaptation, notable only for being one of the more eccentric comics to ever be brought to the big screen.

For example, 2001 A Space Odyssey could have been good, but it just was too boring and had no explanation for the monolith and not enough focus on HAL 9000, the freaky antagonist supercomputer. Basically, most of the movie was shots of space with classical music. And everyone tells me that I didn't get it. No, I can't get it because there is no explanation, and it's too boring! BUT, I did love Hellraiser Inferno, and In the Mouth of Madness. So, what's the problem with New Nightmare??? Okay, first of all is the fact of Freddy. I actually love his new look, the jacket and hand, although the sweater and hat looked kind of funny and I didn't understand why they put the greenish-red rings around his eyes. They went to so much work designing this new, evil looking Freddy and he can't have more than 20 minutes of screen time. Yep, just a little bit more than Freddy's Revenge. And yes, I know that Pinhead had just about as much screen time in Hellraiser Inferno, but they didn't redesign Pinhead in that one. Okay, I do love psychological thrillers, but this was just BORING! It starts off with an all metal, robotic glove coming to life on the film set of a new Nightmare on Elm Street movie. The glove kills several special effects crew members and is about to kill Heather Langenkamp (Nancy)'s husband. And then she wakes up. Okay, that was awesome! Good, frightening, and all a dream. And the next forty five minutes or so have NOTHING going on for the movie! I will admit, the interview scene and the limousine scene were somewhat interesting, but the rest of it was just boring fluff. And also, we get a few decent shots of Robert Englund in this movie, but we don't see near enough! The entire movie revolves around two characters, that just can't carry the film. The kid is just annoying. He isn't creepy, he's just annoying. Some of the dream sequences are pretty freaky, but other than that, he's just a normal kid talking in a stupid voice. Also, the vomit scene was pretty much stolen from The Exorcist. So, by the end of the movie, all of the characters are referring to Heather as Nancy, but this is never explained. And then there is a showdown at the boiler room, which looks more like an ancient Greek temple than a power plant mechanical room. Okay, this scene was too tacky.

And some of the dream sequences are pretty creepy. But, I have two HUGE problems with this movie. First off, the fact that Heather has to wait until, like an hour and a half (around three days in the movie) after her kid tries to commit suicide, has seizures, nightmares, and tries to kill her before taking him to the hospital. Also, her kid is terrified of nightmares and she shuts the door so he is in the dark! ??? Worst mother ever! And it also isn't about Freddy on a film set, it's about him stalking Heather and her kid for two hours. This movie was so slow paced that it seemed like Titanic. Not to mention a hilariously low body count, with Freddy having a brand new glove, but breaking someone's neck! ??? Judge for yourself, but I thought it was boring. The kid was annoying, there wasn't enough Freddy, and Heather Langenkamp is just not an interesting character, unlike Nancy Thompson. Overall, this film is just TOO slow. I mean, Wes Craven had a really good idea here. Very original, just like the first Nightmare movie. But he didn't execute it very well. The kid was annoying, Heather Langenkamp looks bored and worried throughout the movie. And some of the dialogue is just ridiculous. Like how Wes all of a sudden knows what the new Freddy is is kind of ridiculous, because he couldn't possibly know that.

While I'll admit some of the action scenes are decent, but they are not impressive. This one however does give you some information that should not be overlooked. *Spoiler* If you haven't watched it please do not continue to read. In this movie it's been about 10 years after the first movie, and as they try to fill in some gaps, and do a pretty good job at it. First thing you know is that Dooku who was part of the jedi order has shifted to the Dark Side. Obi-Wan discovers that a planet in the Galaxy map has been erased from their Archives and he further investigates into it. He finds the planet and then realizes that this Alien species is creating a clone army for the republic. The clones were modeled after Jango Fett The Bounty Hunter. The Alien tells Obi-Wan that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas put in an order about 10 years ago, but this comes off as suspicious to Obi- Wan because this Jedi master was not with them he was gone longer than that. As he observes the factory you could say. He meets jango and he asks if he has ever met the jedi master, but says he's never heard of him and that his recruiter was Lord Tyranus. Now if you guys aren't aware Tyranus is actually Count Dooku. Count Dooku was the one who killed Sifo-Dyas and recruited Jango Fett from my guess under the orders of Darth Sidous. Also deleted the planet in their archive galaxy map. So in this case Count Dooku was actually behind these Clones. This also brings up that the Sith were indeed planning something from the start to take out the Jedi Council.Now if you guys watched the First movie Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson) notes that there has been no Sith activity for a long time. This somewhat answers the question that the Sith was indeed on the low for an attack. This information proves that they were indeed plotting something. Also Anakin in this movie is showing tension and believe that he is being held back. And with the death of his mother in this movie you can clearly see the darkness in his eyes that it's just a matter of time to take full control.The second movie like I said was weak, but did have some information on there that connected some dots. George Lucas has a way of throwing in some really good information to complete a puzzle, and also leaves to draw your own conclusion as to what you think is happening in the Star wars Universe.

The campaign is headed by Jonathan Pryce's snarling and deliciously amoral General, the The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson whose duty is to sit comfortably in his tent giving orders whilst his men continue to be slaughtered. On occasion, he will order the execution of the odd trooper that shows great courage in trying to win the battle out the fact it might cause the dozens of other soldiers to question their own ability and thus, feel demoralised. The film is not interested in the war nor in terms of who's fighting who; the Turk appear to be defending their land from a force hazy in their identity made up of brash Europeans forces whom the director, a certain Terry Gilliam, essentially represents as a broad metaphor for brutish Western imperialism.Amidst the strife; chaos and murder of the battle lies John Neville's eponymous Baron von Munchausen and the sheer outlandish escapism he is able to bring through a travelling show; a sentiment encapsulated by the lone poster that advertises his performance amidst the pained announcements of war. At least, we assume it to be him upon first observing he of the title and the extravagant travelling show he puts on &#x96; alas, it is indeed a man posing as the Baron and the gentleman is swiftly put in his place by the true incarnation whom later arrives. The film doesn't cover a particularly pleasant lead, but the film's desire to paint ugly and somewhat alienating characteristics in regards to the titular Baron serve only to make it more interesting when the nature of the skirmishes he will later find himself in come about. Von Munchausen has on him a bit of a mouth, and there are particular degrees of arrogance about him one might find unlikable in another lead in another film so inclined to romp through the sorts of content on show here. We are inclined to get behind The Baron, not because he is an especially likable character, but more-so because he is a lone beacon of identification around which some fairly off the cusp content unfolds.After an establishment that he is unafraid to stand up to Pryce's tyrant, there is a retelling of a very specific story about one time wherein he displayed great bravery in the face of adversity during which he made a dangerous bet with a rich Sultan. This episode involves four other very particular allies, allies of whom are quite the motley bunch of oddballs acting as an indelible mixture of characters specialising in speed; agility; sight and marksmanship. Along with the Baron, they once made up an indomitable five-some stumbling from locale to locale; a group whom, many years ago, spent their time getting into adventures and foiling what was often a beastly, unpleasant force. It it to this extent the idea is hit upon that this crew, of whom are now occupying their own respective sociological pits of despair and failure where they've tried to make it by themselves, may be able to aid in the defending of a small settlement on this front-line and could go a long way in helping to defeat the Turkish forces if they were each present.We observe von Muchausen take off in his faithful hot-air balloon along with an infant Sarah Polley, playing a girl named Sally, to recover said allies of days of old so they may help in the campaign; Gilliam's movie settling into a neat groove of surreal episodes complete with a number of wacky creatures and often eerie supporting acts peppering an overlying message of teamwork and defeating one's self-doubt being really good things. The director has a large body of work which always seems to be able to combine wanton ideas and a real sense of adventure with varying degrees of substance. In 1981, he successfully to some extent pulled off the periodic adventures of a young boy in Time Bandits; here, applying a similar approach to a film more creative and better unfolded whilst feeding off a premise that bares more than a striking resemblance to Sturges' The Magnificent Seven.The Advenutres of Baron Muchausen is an inventive and really rather ingenious little adventure picture built on wild episodes one cannot help but get caught up in and enjoy. On this level, I thought it was a better film than Time Bandits; a film about the hopping from fantastical set piece to set piece but doing so with a better sense of transition between such things. We additionally sense there is more at stake and the character content to do with the lead starting out as he is before learning the things he does through the innocent presence of a child is more rewarding. Those with closed minds do not need Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen; those with open minds, open to wonder and dizzying spectacle and brash creativity where no episode is too offbeat and yet somehow feels reigned in, will take to it and, like me, hopefully really rather enjoy it.

The campaign is headed by Jonathan Pryce's snarling and deliciously amoral General, the The Right Ordinary Horatio Jackson whose duty is to sit comfortably in his tent giving orders whilst his men continue to be slaughtered. On occasion, he will order the execution of the odd trooper that shows great courage in trying to win the battle out the fact it might cause the dozens of other soldiers to question their own ability and thus, feel demoralised. The film is not interested in the war nor in terms of who's fighting who; the Turk appear to be defending their land from a force hazy in their identity made up of brash Europeans forces whom the director, a certain Terry Gilliam, essentially represents as a broad metaphor for brutish Western imperialism.Amidst the strife; chaos and murder of the battle lies John Neville's eponymous Baron von Munchausen and the sheer outlandish escapism he is able to bring through a travelling show; a sentiment encapsulated by the lone poster that advertises his performance amidst the pained announcements of war. At least, we assume it to be him upon first observing he of the title and the extravagant travelling show he puts on &#x96; alas, it is indeed a man posing as the Baron and the gentleman is swiftly put in his place by the true incarnation whom later arrives. The film doesn't cover a particularly pleasant lead, but the film's desire to paint ugly and somewhat alienating characteristics in regards to the titular Baron serve only to make it more interesting when the nature of the skirmishes he will later find himself in come about. Von Munchausen has on him a bit of a mouth, and there are particular degrees of arrogance about him one might find unlikable in another lead in another film so inclined to romp through the sorts of content on show here. We are inclined to get behind The Baron, not because he is an especially likable character, but more-so because he is a lone beacon of identification around which some fairly off the cusp content unfolds.After an establishment that he is unafraid to stand up to Pryce's tyrant, there is a retelling of a very specific story about one time wherein he displayed great bravery in the face of adversity during which he made a dangerous bet with a rich Sultan. This episode involves four other very particular allies, allies of whom are quite the motley bunch of oddballs acting as an indelible mixture of characters specialising in speed; agility; sight and marksmanship. Along with the Baron, they once made up an indomitable five-some stumbling from locale to locale; a group whom, many years ago, spent their time getting into adventures and foiling what was often a beastly, unpleasant force. It it to this extent the idea is hit upon that this crew, of whom are now occupying their own respective sociological pits of despair and failure where they've tried to make it by themselves, may be able to aid in the defending of a small settlement on this front-line and could go a long way in helping to defeat the Turkish forces if they were each present.We observe von Muchausen take off in his faithful hot-air balloon along with an infant Sarah Polley, playing a girl named Sally, to recover said allies of days of old so they may help in the campaign; Gilliam's movie settling into a neat groove of surreal episodes complete with a number of wacky creatures and often eerie supporting acts peppering an overlying message of teamwork and defeating one's self-doubt being really good things. The director has a large body of work which always seems to be able to combine wanton ideas and a real sense of adventure with varying degrees of substance. In 1981, he successfully to some extent pulled off the periodic adventures of a young boy in Time Bandits; here, applying a similar approach to a film more creative and better unfolded whilst feeding off a premise that bares more than a striking resemblance to Sturges' The Magnificent Seven.The Advenutres of Baron Muchausen is an inventive and really rather ingenious little adventure picture built on wild episodes one cannot help but get caught up in and enjoy. On this level, I thought it was a better film than Time Bandits; a film about the hopping from fantastical set piece to set piece but doing so with a better sense of transition between such things. We additionally sense there is more at stake and the character content to do with the lead starting out as he is before learning the things he does through the innocent presence of a child is more rewarding.

A time when the planet is smothered in Artificial Intelligence, dominated by invasive targeted advertising and intrusive security extents, a world existing in the midst of a technological domination. The District Of Columbia is 100% murder-free thanks entirely to the astoundingly reliable specialised police department Pre-Crime, which identifies killers before they commit their murders. It is captained by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a Father crushed by the disappearance of his son Sean, living a hollow existence lined only with the self- destruction of guilt. To compensate, he joined Pre-Crime. The system relies on the precognitions of thePre-Cogs, Arthur and Dash &#x96; the twins &#x96; and Agatha (Samantha Morton), the natural leader, the most gifted. Three mutated humans with psychic abilities. And yes, I tell you now, those names are indeed references to the three great mystery writers Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Dashiell Hammett. But when Anderton is framed for a future murder, he has just 36 hours to prove his innocence. The Pre-Cogs are surviving examples of children born from parents addicted to the fictional drug Neuroin (a heroin-like drug) under scientific experimentation. Most of these children wouldn't live past the age of 12, yet these three were seen as gifted, graced with a certain talent. They would wake up at night screaming, shaking in the corner as they saw murder over and over, an image that continually haunted them. It wasn't long before someone realised that these dreams were murders that were actually happening and so they were exploited for use in Pre-Crime. Hyper-sensitive brain scanners read activity in the brain tissue of the Pre-Cogs and an intricate electronic system displays the images they see onto monitors. That is what Pre-Crime is dependent upon; three genetic mutants heavily drugged, generally unaware of their surroundings and conditions, predicting the future. From there, it's up to the officers to analyse the images they're given on the screens to find where this murder is taking place. And, seeing as it'll be going nation-wide soon, cocky Department Of Justice representative Agent Danny Witwer (played with excellent charisma by Colin Farrell) comes along to supervise&#x85; and ultimately dictate everything.

The Red Queen Hypothesis is most certainly a relevant factor in this world. The streets are littered with ruthlessly efficient Eye-Dentiscanners that identify the passing civilian and plagues them with targeted advertising from one of its countless gloriously attractive holographic advertisements, calling their name directly to seize attention. John Anderton! You could use a Guiness right about now! shouts one of the invisible voice with its corny fiddle soundtrack from the remarkable glass walls that dazzle and distract passers-by. This film is crammed with product-placement visual telecommunication screens by Nokia, exotic holidays with holographic Hawaiian girls for American Express, GAP clothing, Bvlgari perfume, and even Lexus designed an entire car for this film! The greatest element of 'Minority Report' is its believability. All this incredible technology, from transport pods that drive themselves on vast freeway networks with vertical inclines to singing cereal packets, has been presented in a fashion so rich and affluent in detail that it seems so real. To ensure the utmost plausibility of a world where even the walls of alley-ways are technological, alive with grotesque public announcements, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists. The effect of all this is a result so immaculately polished that even now, nine years after release, it is still realistic. There is so much to admire, adore, appreciate, and question in this deliciously complex film. I reserve it specially as the only film I have ever seen in which Tom Cruise presents a clear ability to act. Most films starring Tom Cruise feature Tom Cruise in the cast playing Tom Cruise! Yet in this, with the professional guidance of Spielberg, Cruise plays his character with brilliant realism. He is almost constantly engaging. Other factors to be remembered of this film are its screenplay. The story behind this film is so beautifully active, but the explanation that is presented to the viewers is abstract. This is a rare example of a mystery film, entirely due to the deliverance of its magnificent plot-line; there is never an example when, like many other initially promising but subsequently destroyed films, the plot is given to us on a silver tray. It is flattering to the viewer's intelligence to be able understand this film. Its complexity and intrigue, which is unravelled gradually, makes the wonderful experience of explanation feel so much more rewarding. Another feature is the musical score, by John Williams. The addition of Williams' soundtrack lifts the film, providing one of the finest examples I can imagine of giving suspense to otherwise already extremely exciting scenes. For instance, when Anderton is escaping Danny Witwer and his men through an automobile manufacturing factory, the thumping trumpet blasts and violin shrieks are reminiscent to his Oscar-winning score of 'Star Wars Episode VI A New Hope' (1977).

","genre":"Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 November 2011","score":"","review":" Matilda is not without a certain charm, a charm that has you take to it come the death. You sense that children watching it will enjoy the way it depicts imperialistic grown ups implementing their rule upon young kids, of whom appear to think they know the way of the world, and then later failing to hold up said values as the tots, or singular 'tot', garner revenge and strives to put everything straight in the way they initially envisaged. There is enough to watch and get involved in, a Carrie-esque spin on what would normally be described as Disney does Kitchen Sink drama, as lowly people get in foggy circumstances and expressing their philistinism at any occasion they get - the Home Alone inspired finale does not do enough to extinguish what is a colourful comedy-drama about some rather delicate issues thrust through a tough blender.True, the film is about a very young child getting their own way over certain adults; but when their respective 'own way' is as indelible and forward thinking as it is in Matilda, who's complaining about, or indeed accusing, the text of exuding disrespect towards superiors whilst neglecting authority? In the case of the Danny De Vito directed 1996 film Matilda, those adults are narcissistic parents and tyrannical head-teachers; head-teachers so stubborn that, in spite of the fact the film unfolds in America, make it so that the doors to their offices sport the very British Headmistress engraved on a plaque as opposed to the more American Principal. Later on, we find out such a Headmistress, Mrs. Trunchbull (Ferris) even represented Great Britain at the 1972 Munich Olympics in the Shot Put discipline - one wonders if Team GB's true-to-life athlete from that year in that event ever got round to seeing De Vito's film, and if so, at all got a kick out it.But we'll come to said headmistress. First and foremost, there is Matilda, who is deftly played by a certain Mara Wilson. Matilda is the daughter to Zinnia Wormwood (Perlman) and Harry Wormwood, played by Danny De Vito in a role thus seeing him contribute to the film in one of three capacities (the others being the narrator, who's incarnation is not linked to the body of the movie, and that of the aforementioned director). When we first witness her coming into contact with Harry and Zinnia on the day of her birth, we observe how different they both look in comparison to the other parents at the hospital whom are welcoming newborns; maybe it has something to do with the fact the Wormwoods' first born, Matilda's older brother Mikey (Levinson), arrived before her and had all of that attention and love parents lavish upon their babies, whereas those other newfound folks are here experiencing it for the first time.

Zinnia, her mother, is a stick-thin beauty obsessed vanity piece with a thick New York City accent and an enclosed mind to match; a woman too old to be dressing as loosely as she does and too ignorant to anything to notice everything that is wrong around her.

At school, she meets the wondrous Miss Honey who's played by actress Embeth Davidtz of whom, rather unfortunately in its keeping up to speed with the previous point, three years earlier starred in Schindler's List. Miss Honey is Matlida's teacher; a prim, slim and elegant person; an intelligent woman with a delicate look about her, someone is stark contrast to Trunchball's big blundering brute of an authoritarian &#x96; where Miss Honey will waltz around her classroom clutching a flower by its stem implementing education, Trunchball will stomp around the playground wielding a riding crop instilling fear. The film is one of the more uplifting movies about human suffering, a piece with a nihilistic edge seemingly desperate to burst out but settling for something fantastical and rounded so as to not be too divorced from its audience.

Yes, it's technically impressive, but it feels pretty boring. It takes up too much time, cut with some very tacky dialogue, to get us to the nightclub.

Most of these were about gangsters (even when they were comedies, as in the 1985 movie Prizzi's Honor), but as Moonstruck shows, there were plenty of other stereotypes to be exploited without resorting to gun-toting Mafiosi.Moonstruck features numerous tropes of Italian culture &#x96; vendettas, elderly matriarchs, romantic opera etc., etc., etc&#x85; Often these are in a satirical light, such as Nicholas Cage's absolutely pathetic excuse for bad blood. But none of this is actually very funny. The movie is really a mess of clichés and crisscrossing romantic subplots, with occasional musings on the nature of love and fidelity, none of which seems quite as intelligent or cohesive as it seems to thinks it is.Cher carries the movie's Italian American cliché through to her performance, which is full of extravagant gesture. She just about keeps the lid on theatricality, and does some fairly good emoting later on, but she was nowhere near deserving of the Academy Award. Nicholas Cage continues his then-current trend of playing the young, pretentious tortured soul, and while he's not outstanding there aren't many actors who could make such a ridiculous figure into a credible romantic lead. Danny Aiello is always fun to see but he is underused here. It is Olympia Dukakis who really gives the picture its only great, solid dramatic performance.Director Norman Jewison directs with an eye towards beauty and eye-catching imagery. Early on, Cher is often duplicated in reflection, concentrating us on her visage. There's a really neat set-up when Cher is on the phone to Aiello, with Aiello's dying mother in the background of one shot and the healthy Dukakis in the equivalent position of the other shot. The whole thing has that wonderful late 80s\/early 90s look, of a city glowing in the night, and this is perhaps the only thing I really like about it. That, and the fact that at 100 minutes it is mercifully short. As a romantic movie, it moves me not at all.
