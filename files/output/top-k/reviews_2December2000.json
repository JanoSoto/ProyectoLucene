A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch.  Luckily though, I had a good feeling about this director. This movie was wonderfully written.  The dialogue is in the old southern style, yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated.  The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie.  Toby Maguire was awesome.  I thought he was good (but nothing special) in Pleasantville, but here he shines.  I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor (but nothing special), but here he is excellent as well.  The big shocker for me was Jewel.  She was amazingly good.  Jeffrey Wright, who I had never heard of before, is also excellent in this movie. It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand.  A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa. This movie had the perfect combination.  The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular.  This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others.  It lets you really get to know the characters, which are all very dynamic and interesting. The plot is complex, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing, and ready for anything at any time.  Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet (brilliant directing).  This was also a beautifully shot movie.  The scenery was not breath taking (It's in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings. Has that rough and rugged feel, but keeps an elegance, which is very pleasant on the eyes. The movie was deep.  It told a story and in doing so made you think. It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story.  Specifically, it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for. There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie, too many to pick out.  It was like a beautifully written short story, filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done. If you like great acting, writing, lots of action, and some of the best directing ever, see this movie!  Take a chance on it.

Actually, to say that it even arrived is close to an overstatement -- made on a 35 million dollar budget, the film grossed less than a million in the United States and althought it was released in order to get Oscar attention, it was completely ignored. Frankly, it's easy to see why Ride With The Devil has a very peculiar rhythm and only occasionally goes where you expect it to and these things are both to its advantage and its fault.Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich play lifelong friends who are drawn into the ragtag skirmishes and battles that made up the Civil War in Missouri\/Kansas. Both young men are Confederate sympathizers, but politically speaking it's tough to know why until a man putting the fighters up for the winter explains it Basically it's about being able to do your own thing in your own time, as Peter Fonda explained it in Easy Rider. It's about being able to live your way of life and not being forced into another even if it happens to be obviously more fair. To which one can only say, OK.But as war films go, Ride With the Devil is plot-light and character-heavy. At times the script (by frequent Lee collaborator James Schamus) seems slow and clunky (largely in the film's first act), but at other times the dialogue falls in to a uniquely relaxed pace and the film becomes structurally quite impressive. Basically, there's little going on at the surface that you haven't seen before. In war, some people are innocents, stunned by the brutality of the endeavor, but still bound to fight for honor, dignity, or some code. We've got Toby Maguire to fill that roll. Then there are some people who fight with a passion bred of revenge. James (or Jim) Caviezel there for that. And sometimes people just fight because they're more than a little bonkers. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers fits that bill.You also know that since the film's leads take the side that we're raised to believe was wrong,  there'll be a character inserted so that our heroes can show dignity and tolerance. Jeffery Wright, as a freed slave who may not really be so free, takes that job.Ride With The Devil's greatest virtue is an amazingly assembled cast. Somewhere down the road this film will be rediscovered (or perhaps simply discovered) when it becomes clear how many amazing actors are on display. Toby Maguire has already established himself as a leading man capable of carrying a film. His talent at playing man-children has been used to great effect in excellent films like Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules. James Caviezel is a star waiting to happen. While I would view him as a less quirky (and also slightly less talented) Billy Crudup, he holds the screen well and knows how to deliver a line with emotional gravity. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers may be an actor designed for British costume dramas, but trust me, the guy can act. And Jeffrey Wright, who broke out with Shaft, but has a Tony and several fine performances in indie films, is simply a fine actor. For reasons discussed above, his character is crucial to any success the film can have and he ably carries the burden as much as he's able. Oh and Skeet Ulrich isn't bad. The fact that he looks like Johnny Depp, but doesn't act as well is a bit of a drawback, but the movie does not fall when he's on screen. In smaller appearances, Mark Ruffalo (currently breaking out onscreen in You Can Count On Me) and Jonathan Brandis give solid support.As for Jewel, there are two ways of looking at her performance in this film. The first Does she damage the film in any way at all? Answer Nope. She's perfectly serviceable and sometimes even very good. The second question Since she inevitably got the part because she's Jewel, could the part have been better played by a more experience actor? Answer Of course the part could have been better played by a more experienced actor. The question of who comes to mind, but whatever... It can only be said that she is fine.Ride With The Devil rises to no obvious military climax, so all of the weight of the film must be on a series of emotional high points in the final act. It's worth noting that the film improves as it goes along, ending on a number of satisfying notes.It's of course a little tempting to wonder why Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director best known for intimate family dramas, would want to make a movie about the US Civil War and if it was a good decision on his part. In the early goingthat question seems valid. The brief preamble centering on the split in the Missouri community between Union and Confederate supporters is supposed to pack a punch that carries the movie.  It fails, as do the first few encounters involving the band that Ulrich and Maguire run with. Around 30 minutes in, though, things start getting interesting. Of course this occurs around the time Wright's character begins to be foregrounded. Anyway, Lee produces an ample epic sweep and is very comfortable with the slow build of the various relationships. The cinematography by Frederick Elmes is beautiful even if all of the actors he's shooting seem to have designer dirty faces with designer scruffy beards and designer hair extensions.Ride With The Devil requires a little work. It's not the obviously crowd-pleaser that, say, Glory is. And probably it's not as good a movie as that Civil War effort. If you can make it through the bumpy parts at the beginning, though, the rewards are there.I'd probably give it a 7 out of 10.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"2 December 2000","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Ang Lee's 1999 film Ride With The Devil came and went at the US box office. Actually, to say that it even arrived is close to an overstatement -- made on a 35 million dollar budget, the film grossed less than a million in the United States and althought it was released in order to get Oscar attention, it was completely ignored. Frankly, it's easy to see why Ride With The Devil has a very peculiar rhythm and only occasionally goes where you expect it to and these things are both to its advantage and its fault.Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich play lifelong friends who are drawn into the ragtag skirmishes and battles that made up the Civil War in Missouri\/Kansas. Both young men are Confederate sympathizers, but politically speaking it's tough to know why until a man putting the fighters up for the winter explains it Basically it's about being able to do your own thing in your own time, as Peter Fonda explained it in Easy Rider. It's about being able to live your way of life and not being forced into another even if it happens to be obviously more fair. To which one can only say, OK.But as war films go, Ride With the Devil is plot-light and character-heavy. At times the script (by frequent Lee collaborator James Schamus) seems slow and clunky (largely in the film's first act), but at other times the dialogue falls in to a uniquely relaxed pace and the film becomes structurally quite impressive. Basically, there's little going on at the surface that you haven't seen before. In war, some people are innocents, stunned by the brutality of the endeavor, but still bound to fight for honor, dignity, or some code. We've got Toby Maguire to fill that roll. Then there are some people who fight with a passion bred of revenge. James (or Jim) Caviezel there for that. And sometimes people just fight because they're more than a little bonkers. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers fits that bill.You also know that since the film's leads take the side that we're raised to believe was wrong,  there'll be a character inserted so that our heroes can show dignity and tolerance. Jeffery Wright, as a freed slave who may not really be so free, takes that job.Ride With The Devil's greatest virtue is an amazingly assembled cast. Somewhere down the road this film will be rediscovered (or perhaps simply discovered) when it becomes clear how many amazing actors are on display. Toby Maguire has already established himself as a leading man capable of carrying a film. His talent at playing man-children has been used to great effect in excellent films like Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules. James Caviezel is a star waiting to happen. While I would view him as a less quirky (and also slightly less talented) Billy Crudup, he holds the screen well and knows how to deliver a line with emotional gravity. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers may be an actor designed for British costume dramas, but trust me, the guy can act. And Jeffrey Wright, who broke out with Shaft, but has a Tony and several fine performances in indie films, is simply a fine actor. For reasons discussed above, his character is crucial to any success the film can have and he ably carries the burden as much as he's able. Oh and Skeet Ulrich isn't bad. The fact that he looks like Johnny Depp, but doesn't act as well is a bit of a drawback, but the movie does not fall when he's on screen. In smaller appearances, Mark Ruffalo (currently breaking out onscreen in You Can Count On Me) and Jonathan Brandis give solid support.As for Jewel, there are two ways of looking at her performance in this film. The first Does she damage the film in any way at all? Answer Nope. She's perfectly serviceable and sometimes even very good. The second question Since she inevitably got the part because she's Jewel, could the part have been better played by a more experience actor? Answer Of course the part could have been better played by a more experienced actor. The question of who comes to mind, but whatever... It can only be said that she is fine.Ride With The Devil rises to no obvious military climax, so all of the weight of the film must be on a series of emotional high points in the final act. It's worth noting that the film improves as it goes along, ending on a number of satisfying notes.It's of course a little tempting to wonder why Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director best known for intimate family dramas, would want to make a movie about the US Civil War and if it was a good decision on his part. In the early goingthat question seems valid. The brief preamble centering on the split in the Missouri community between Union and Confederate supporters is supposed to pack a punch that carries the movie.  It fails, as do the first few encounters involving the band that Ulrich and Maguire run with. Around 30 minutes in, though, things start getting interesting. Of course this occurs around the time Wright's character begins to be foregrounded. Anyway, Lee produces an ample epic sweep and is very comfortable with the slow build of the various relationships. The cinematography by Frederick Elmes is beautiful even if all of the actors he's shooting seem to have designer dirty faces with designer scruffy beards and designer hair extensions.Ride With The Devil requires a little work.

Speed is Die-Hard-on-a-Bus, Under Siege is Die-Hard-On-A-Battleship).This was, in my view, the last Try Hard film.  This film did not do too well in the states, this was because of a number of things1) The okhaloma bombing of 1994\/1995, and 2) Willis' boredom of action films.In fact the director of this film tries very, very hard to put some weight in the story just to please Willis' boredom of the McClane character - this meant giving Willis a sidekick in the shape of Samuel L.Jackson - who plays a badass black guy (as always!) - and they must stop a bored Jeremy Irons with a bad German Accent (if his brother can speak english - why can't he?) - who is trying to do one over the gold deposit in New York (err - isn't this GoldFinger - actually this is referenced when Irons says Fort Knox is for tourists!).The film isn't actually all that bad.  It explodes brilliantly with a bombing on a busy NY street - and it makes you sit up and pay attention, but it slowly goes down hill.  The interracial jokes and bad cop, good cop idea that Jackson and Willis play is funny at some times, but mostly it is predictable.Irons doesn't play the character evenly enough.

Its a shame I was disappointed with the film and especially at the end - Willis was supposed to be on the floor - with a chopper hovering over him, he had lost the game - but the way it was directed - it made it felt that Willis STILL had the upper hand - even in the closing minutes when he whispers Say hi to your brother for me.The character of McClane is gone.  You can see Willis is bored, but is given something to do in the solving of silly puzzles which don't add much to the film, and through the humorous conversations with Jackson.Its no wonder why Willis doesn't want to do more Action films, but having seen this film I can see why.Lesson Learnt Hire Die Hard again.

However, I can help but be annoyed by simplification and inaccuracy of Hollywood History.  So for those who'd like an understanding of reality for the events depicted, I'll give the most important, so read on.  Skip this comment if you think a movie should be entertaining and nothing else.Strongly misrepresented at least initially is the most central of characters, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.  The filmmakers would have him be a saint, but in reality he was a complex individual.  He initially refused the Colonelcy of the what was to be the 54th, before his sense of duty and honor took over. He even called himself a Ni--er Colonel.  Despite his parents being abolishionist, he had never known any blacks growing up.  His ignorance should come as no surprise, and it must also be remembered that the n-word was not considered nearly as vulgar as today.  As the men were trained, Shaw began to develop an affection for his men, and was quite like the character he was portrayed as at the end of the film.  This is the important thing- He overcame his prejudices.  The filmmakers obviously decided that the audience would get the wrong impression of Shaw if they let him know he wasn't an egalitarian from the outset.  Too, they fabricated the letters read by Shaw in the movie. Shaw wrote many letters, which are a valuable insight into the war, but they are usually not philosophying or proclaiming the perfection of blacks.  Like most soldiers writing home, Shaw wrote about daily life, not writing for elegengant entertainment.  Also, in the film there is no mention or sight of Shaw's wife, whom he engaged shortly after accepting the Colonelcy and married shortly before moving out to South Carolina.  I guess that would distract everybody from Perfect Shaw.I'm curious of why all the 54th men besides Shaw were made composite characters rather than out of reality.  There are several accounts by surviving officers and men, on which I'd imagine they could have created characters.  Although Forbes is my favorite character of the film, I don't know why Ewles's character is not Lt. Colonel Edward Hallowell, who had a similar (for the movie's purpose) relationship with Shaw and looks just like him too!  And a note-The 54th men aren't all perfect either-Shaw notes before leaving camp that they have had 20-30 dessertions. The film seems to imply that there were none except for those looking for shoes.  I don't think less of the black fighting men because a small portion of their number were not worthy enough.Colonel Montgomery was a very interesting man, and the flat portayal of him in the movie is not accurate.  He was one of John Brown's close followers in Kansas, and while I can't be sure if he was the racist as depicted in the film, he was undoubtbly a fervent abolishionist. A true detail was his tendancy to shoot at any man who disobeyed an order.The movie's depiction of the buring of Darien is relatively accurate. There is not a note of looting taking place as in the film, although Shaw really was shocked and greatly disapproved of the destruction of property in a town without rebels.  He wasn't threatened with court martial if he refused to participate, and did not revile Montgomery either.  Indeed, Shaw was awestruck by the Colonel-He admired his dedication to orders and abolition, although he was uneasy that Montgomery could be so brutal at times. Montgomery's superior in the film is named Harker-Really this is General Hunter, mentioned at the beginning of the film.  Contrary again to reality, Shaw blackmails Montgomery and Harker into getting a combat transfer. Hunter had really already been relieved, and Shaw wrote General Strong, who he greatly admired, for permission, which was granted.The film assault on Fort Wagner is actually very  authentic, moreso than a previous comment gave in the IMD gave credit for.  The size of Wagner is not exaggerated much, and Shaw did indeed ask Strong to participate.  The only thing that's wrong is rather surprising-All accounts agree that Shaw was hit in the fort, not at the base of the wall as in the movie-Shouldn't saintly Shaw lead his men that far?Now don't get me wrong, even with all these errors, I still think it's a splendid bit of work by all the actors and film staff.  Still, I'd like to see Hollywood not vilify the complex or simplfy the great.  Great music, cinematography, excellent battle scenes, and a perfectly executed ending, without a doubt the best done ending of a war movie possible. Enjoy the film and then go see the impressive Shaw Memorial in Boston Commons, The West Building National Gallery of Art, NY, or NH where castings are displayed!

Then there is Jared's girlfriend (Jennifer Connoly) who is the daughter of a rich fashion district mogel who is in love with jared and the same goes for him. She also does drugs for fun. They come up with the idea that if they start to sell drugs, they will be able to make money and become something. From here the story moves fast through each season to their final downfalls. NO matter what anyone says, this movie is incredibly real, almost like a documentary. The acting was incredible. They all did fantasic jobs but the most surprising of the bunch was Marlon Wayans. He really can act with being foolish or joking. Ellen Burstyn will be nominated for an oscar. All these 4 actors should. You must, MUST see this movie. It is very disturbing but so real and sad. You feel for the characters because they are all people you would like. They just want happiness in their lives and to live for something. Unfortunately they think drugs are the way. If I was a teacher in a health class I would show this uncensored depiction of how drugs can ruin people with such promise and hope. See it!

Having skimmed through some of the comments it appears people are either embracing it as a masterpiece or reviling it as a boring piece of garbage.  I won't go so far as to suggest this film is a masterpiece, but it certainly skews closer to that end of the spectrum than the other.Things I Liked1) Bruce Willis.  Lots of people said he was really really boring, which is their way of saying, He wasn't being John McClane, he wasn't the Bruce Willis I am used to.  I don't get it.  Understated acting does not necessarily mean boring.  He was playing a sad, confused Everyman (at least emotionally), it would be ludicrous for him to spout lame one-liners and start crawling into ventilation ducts.  I thought he did a great job.2) Samuel L. Jackson.  The Willis-Jackson chemistry is great here, better than their DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE team-up, and Jackson by himself is fantastic as he almost always is.  He had the more flamboyant and unusual of the two lead roles, so perhaps he had the advantage over Willis, but he manages to keep his character from flying up into the camposphere by delivering fantastical dialogue seriously.3) The comic book as modern mythology idea was interesting although underdeveloped, like the movie itself really.  I wish they had trimmed a good fifteen or so minutes of longing stares and slow motion shots of people standing around so they could have afforded more screen time to developing the movie's central premise, that is, that the power and truth of Mythic Reality can and does exist in the modern world, filtered and diluted though it might be.Things I Didn't Like1) Okay, I hate to sound like a Bruckheimer-loving yokel, but this movie really did drag.  I'm not asking for even one gratuituous car chase, but please, Night, zip it up a little.  I felt every one of this movie's one hundred and fifteen minutes.  2) Like THE SIXTH SENSE, this is a film more or less without plot.  The plot, such as it is, is the growth and self-realization of a character.  That's fine and dandy, but I kept waiting for Clark Kent to finally move to Metropolis, so to speak.  Willis spends the whole movie stuck in Smallville here, and when it finally does look as if he's about to maybe tear open his shirt to reveal the big red S (metaphorically speaking of course), they hit us with the ending...3)....which, to put it the least, I did not like.  It was an interesting twist, I'll grant the filmmakers that.  I loved Jackson's final rambling speech, it was great, sad and horrifying all at once.  But then they go and ruin it by stapling a very clumsy, very awkward text card Epilogue onto the final frames.  Ugh.  First of all, it's not like this is true story (I expected another title to read (so-and-so) is still at large.  If you have any information as to the whereabouts of this person, please notify the theater manager.) so that makes no sense.  Secondly, the movie was so drawn-out and elongated (which at times worked and at other times did not) that to truncate the ending like that, to resolve the story in a rush and not even visually but with text, felt like a huge cheat.Overall I give this movie a 7.

I'm afraid that Matthew McConaughy and his character are just plain boring! This film is two hours of nothing, it ambles on spouting sentimentality ( as do most American films)without doing anything interesting. The acting is really poor especially from Woody Harrelson and Ellen DeGeneres. If there was ever a Channel called True TV and it showed crap like this movie then it would last 5 minutes.

Like any dictator boss, he has people who run errands for him and well act like puppets for him. Whaley is the guy who pitches a great idea for a movie and Spacey steals it for his advantage along with trying to use Whaley's girlfriend. The rest of the film deals with Whaley abusing Spacey (god I loved those parts) by any means possible The ending though leaves you unsatisfied.If you havent seen the ending here it isWhaley must decide between shooting his boss (who has it coming at this point) or his girlfriend (who was being blackmailed into having sex with the evil boss). Now who do you think he is going to shoot? His boss? Wrong!!The movie doesn't even explain why Whaley shoots his girlfriend. Before this had happened Whaley was in control and if he had shot his boss in self defense ,everyone would believe because his boss was the worst person you could think of.It makes you think though maybe there was some sort of homophobic element the writers were thinking.But again it was directed by a no-name director.I cant imagine why Whaley who is a decent actor (The Doors, Born on the Fourth of July) did this, he must have needed the money.A very underrated actor.

No doubt, it is a somewhat watchable film, for the most part.  If you want to know what's good about the movie, read one the multitude of idiotic reviews singing this movie's praises.First, I realize some people accept that the film was not historically accurate, but some maintain that it largely is true to the period.  The latter point is nonsense.  For starters, the film opens with a battle of such historical inaccuracy that it is almost literally laughable (at least chuckle-able).  This is spoiler, but not for the plot.  If you don't want itty bitty spoilers, skip to the next paragraph and just take me at my word. Okay, here we go Ridley Scott sacrifices historical accuracy to spice up this battle, big time.  In five hundred years, a Roman Legion never fought so poorly.  If one did, it would have retreated and the general been killed. Let me tell you something every Junior High Social Studies grad should know Roman Legions (like the Greek Phalanx before it) dominated not because of individual skill, but because of regimented formation combat. Individually, the barbarians were by far the better warriors.  The bulk of a legion would get into tight formation, and either advance as a unit or await the enemy advance.  As the range closed, the legionnaires would throw their pila (remember those spears the Romans were carrying for no reason in the movie?) at the enemy, then draw their gladius swords.  They would remain shoulder-to-shoulder, to give them their advantage.  They did not use cavalry or artillery in any major way.  I have to ask, why couldn't Scott have shown it as it was?  It was just as bloody, and would have actually educated a few people.Ridley Scott is at his worst as a director in this film.  It is time he got some psychological help, to conquer his phobia that the audience might actually be able to see what is happening.  Must every action scene be either pitch black or featuring a cut every ten frames?This is yet another Hollywood film destroying historical accuracy, and it is only mediocre (in the worst sense of the word).  Believe the hype at your own peril. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 December 2000","score":"","review":"  What is it with critics?

Some terrific stunts, obviously, Martin Campbell learnt a lot on Goldeneye!The screenplay needed beefing up, especially during the training of Zorro, this part was very weak. It all seemed a bit too hurried. The Spanish setting in Mexico seemed a bit too American, it seemed very small. I found the climax to be predictable but still, rather enjoyable. The ending was disappointing, will there be a sequel?The performances are excellent, Banderas IS Zorro, perfect for the part. Catherine Zeta-Jones was good, but didn't use the entire acting spectrum. Anthony Hopkins was pretty good, he seemed to enjoy the role.The director did well, but I feel he didn't get into the characters enough, didn't add the flesh to their performances, especially Zeta-Jones.The photography wasn't bad, a bit too soft and lacked some colour.The score by James Horner is one of his better efforts in recent years.Overall, good fun but required a beefy screenplay and more accurate settings and history.
