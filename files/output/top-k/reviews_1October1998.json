After Pink Flamingoes, the hysterical Female Trouble, and Polyester, we were expecting more shock.  He ended up delivering his most satisfying film to date.  Ricki Lake is unabashed and completely perfect in the role of Tracy Turnblad, a chunky 60's teen who's dream to be a dancer on the Corny Collins Show comes true.  Her dancing makes this movie, and her scenes with Divine, who plays Mrs. Turnblad, are a riot.  It is such a shame Divine died soon after filming, this close to achieving the fame he deserved.  Waters' casting was brilliant, including Sonny Bono and Debbie Harry as manipulative parents, Ric Ocasek and Pia Zadora as beatniks, and Seinfeld's Jerry Stiller as Tracy's dad.  My favorite Waters regular Mink Stole also has a part, it is still my dream to see Mink Stole make it big (She had a more memorable role as Dottie Hinkle, the neighbor Kathleen Turner cusses out on the phone in Waters' film Serial Mom).

Although the soundtrack may not be very original or the directing very innovative, it seems to me there is definitely a kernel of genius underneath. The plot and moral seem to me to be very meaningful and deep, but after the gloss-over by the PR department and the consultants it's possible to watch the movie as a very funny comedy. Although all of the characters are straight-from-the-box stereotypes, I don't think any other movie portrays them so colorfully or so life-like. Every character in this movie reminds me of someone I know and it seems like the dialog is recorded straight from the halls of my highschool. The main moral of the movie, that fate does exist and love is more important than anything else, may be a factor in many movies, but in no other movie is it made clear just how important it is. This is not strictly a chick's flick, anyone can enjoy this movie. This movie is perfect for any high school senior or college freshman interested in a pop-romantic comedy.

The truth is, this film was designed for the class of '98, and that is who it appeals to. The movie was very Hollywood, that can't be denied. Although the soundtrack may not be very original or the directing very innovative, it seems to me there is definitely a kernel of genius underneath. The plot and moral seem to me to be very meaningful and deep, but after the gloss-over by the PR department and the consultants it's possible to watch the movie as a very funny comedy. Although all of the characters are straight-from-the-box stereotypes, I don't think any other movie portrays them so colorfully or so life-like. Every character in this movie reminds me of someone I know and it seems like the dialog is recorded straight from the halls of my highschool. The main moral of the movie, that fate does exist and love is more important than anything else, may be a factor in many movies, but in no other movie is it made clear just how important it is. This is not strictly a chick's flick, anyone can enjoy this movie. This movie is perfect for any high school senior or college freshman interested in a pop-romantic comedy.

The attention given to minute detail and photography is simply outstanding. Technically brilliant, the film strikes at every man's primal fears when faced with danger. The themes of heroism, cowardice, loyalty, existentialism and redemption are beautifully woven into a fictional story revolving around the finding of one man, namely Pvt. Ryan. But realistic (awesome, I may say) battle scenes aside, I still say it is not the best war film ever made. Still sitting upon that mantle is All Quiet on the Western Front. For better or worse, Pvt. Ryan does not take a holistic view of war as it affected all sections of society. Of course, it may have not been intention to do so, and the films certainly have a different focus. But for depth of story, Quiet is unparalleled for content. All that aside, Pvt. Ryan is still tied, along with Schindler's List for the honor of the most important movies of the past two decades. In my opinion Pvt. Ryan is to war films as 2001 is to sci-fi films. As an ex-Marine I was forced to think about the 12 landings my grandfather made during WWII against the Japanese. Did he go through hell? Did he think about the meaning of bravery and honor? Or did he shake and cry, and pray to God for forgiveness and hope for a better life for all? Go see Pvt. Ryan and allow your mind to wonder and explore the meaning of humanity. If you come away unmoved, then you're not human.

So, what went wrong? Well, when the running time of a film goes from 120 minutes to 90 minutes, it's not hard to guess.

Ralph Fiennes was excellent, opting to take the role seriously rather than send it up, while Sean Connery showed that he'd make a damned good Bond villain. The fights and stunts were well arranged, and the set design truly startling - especially the snowbound Trafalgar Square. Against all this, Uma Thurman seemed to be paying more attention to her accent than to anything else.

Or in my case, to my mother's horror the 9-inch carving knife out of the kitchen drawer.  It is a by the numbers action\/comedy\/adventure movie that has all the visual sight gags (complete with classic jumping on to a horse that moves at the last moment) one liners, action, plunging necklines (provided by Catherine Zeta Jones), evil nasty bad guys and romance to keep everyone happy.  Antonio Banderas's (Zorro) performance is charming and witty, as a thief turned hero at the hands of an aging Zorro (Anthony Hopkins who turns in a trade mark value performance) who is looking for revenge and his long lost daughter.  It is nicely shot with fairly interesting sets and scenery with some very impressive sword duels, the kind that would have done Errol Flynn proud.  It doesn't dwell for two long on the `How's' and `Whys' of the plot and for good reason, in places its REAL thin.  The writer's just expect us to accept various things, like the training of the new Zorro (Banderas) for example; appears to happen over night. What ever happen to years of practice?

It has achieved what a lot of action films of late haven't managed, simplicity.  You don't need a hugely elaborate plot involving twins, aliens and big special FX scenes. All you need are some well meaning Mexican peasants in a death trap.  For me personally this was a very refreshing movie, it didn't bore me with needless complications whilst not insulting me by treating me like an idiot. All in all I felt it was money well spent and recommend it all Zorro fans new and old alike it is highly enjoyable and proof that comic style heroes can make the translation to the big screen successfully.  Perhaps the makers of the last Batman movie should see this and take some notes.
