[{"date":"5 January 2009","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, set aside the fact that L. Ron Hubbard, the father of Scientology, wrote the book this movie is based on, and you may find the ability to enjoy this film for the campy sci fi goodness that it is. Another thing you will need to set aside is any knowledge of how things REALLY work, and what their shelve lives are. Matter of fact, just set aside everything, dumb down a few levels, and you can enjoy this movie.Overall, there are so many gaping holes in this story, it is absurd to even remotely think it could be remotely possible. Of all the alien invasion films, this is the least believable. After a 1000 year occupation, I would have to believe the Earth's resources would have long been depleted. Especially since the aliens are vastly technologically superior to humans. And, on top of that, I would have figured that an uprising would have taken place LONG before a thousand years would have even come up.This is why L. Ron Hubbard is referred to as a Failed Science Fiction Writer in many circles. Come on, even his Xenu based alien mythos that is the basis to all of Scientology sounds like a really bad, and borrowed, science fiction story. Go to Wikipedia, and look it up! Aside from the Canyon like plot holes, the acting, special effects and musical score are NOT that bad. I have scene a LOT worse than this, trust me. I doubt many of the humorous lines were intended to be as humorous as they were, but that is one of the little quarks about this film that make it a guilty pleasure to watch.I would dare say that this films is a good starter sci fi film for the youngsters as it does not require thinking to enjoy the action and adventure qualities. For the more astute viewer, there is a lot of films out there that are better, and don't even come close to the standard that Star Wars and Star Trek have established.Don't buy this film. Hell, don't even steal it. Also, remember this... Friends don't let friends with IQ's watch Battlefield Earth.

(They even had a Chancellor Gorkin, sounding much like Gorbachev, and a Chernobyl-like energy accident.With the euphoria gone (The Russians are still a pain in the backside, friends or not), some of the films more dubious elements don't work as well, such as Kirk saying Let them Die about the Klingons. (Shatner himself has said he was uncomfortable with this scene.) Nichelle Nichols, to her credit, refused to say the line, You wouldn't want one to marry your sister. In short, they had to turn the cast into bigots to make their understanding at the end more sincere. The problem was that we never got the impression from the series or previous movies that our beloved crew were a bunch of bigots. They had a problem with the Klingon Government, to be certain, but not with Klingons as a race, and could even reach accords with them when needed.Despite that, a lot of the characterizations and cast interactions are solid, the battle scene at the end is still exciting. It was a high note for most of these actors to do their last appearances as these characters.Nick Meyers, like a lot of creative people, went with what worked for him in the past. A Melville quoting Khan, why not a Shakespeare quoting Klingon General? Well, okay, it strains credulity a little bit.
