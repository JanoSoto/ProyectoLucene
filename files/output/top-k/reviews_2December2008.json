It is interesting and fun to watch old-man Darby match wits with the King of the Leprechauns. They each continue to try and outwit the other. 3. It has a pre-bond Sean Connery. 4. It has really good extras on the DVD. It has a 'World of Disney' episode with some added adventures of Darby and the Leprechaun king. Walt Disney is searching for the Leprechaun so he can star in his movie. You learn some more of the myth of the Leprechaun which is Christian in origin. 5. It's a good and fun fantasy film.The only drawback is the on screen depiction of the banshee. Its some lights and vapors. Not really convincing. But this little wisp of pre-computer effects doesn't dampen the great special effects that bring the Leprechaun's to life.This magical movie deserves a place in your video library next to Disney's 'The Gnome Mobile.'

I know I was too, so I wasn't anxious to check out the movie, Remember the Titans (2000). However, from the moment the opening credits started rolling, I knew that this was not only a movie that would hold a place in my DVD collection, but in my heart as well. Due to the fact that this film was based on a true story, it draws the audience in. The story begins in 1971 Virginia at a time when race is a major conflict. A school by the name of T.C.Williams had just been established, forcing black and white students together. The battle of overcoming prejudice was raging not just in the schools, but also on the football field. Players and coaches alike needed to find a way to put aside their differences and work as a team to reach the common goal, a perfect season. The task was not easy, however, as we witnessed several heartbreaking altercations between the players. The turning point of this inspirational tale proved to be an early morning run as part of training camp at Gettysburg College. Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) delivered a speech telling how the team was still fighting the same battle as their ancestors did during the Battle of Gettysburg. Upon returning from camp the team is finally viewed as one, instead of the black players and white players.It seemed that every scene in this film filled me with a different emotion. From one moment to the next the audience is thrown about from the excitement of winning the first game to tears whenever the unexpected happens. The movie is shot in a way that the viewer experiences what the players are going through. This is evident during the football games when I found myself on the edge of my seat, feeling as if I were a Titan.What seals the deal for Remember the Titans is the stellar cast. As always, Denzel Washington nails the part of Coach Boone, giving the character passion, but also determination. His counterpart, Coach Yoast (Will Patton) delivers a love of the game that fuels the boys' desire to win. Standout performances by Wood Harris (Julius Campbell) and Ryan Hurst (Gerry Bertier) allow the audience a glimpse into the inner workings of the team. I was very impressed by this film. From the intense football drills to the touching portrayal of the characters, Remember the Titans has me hooked. At the end of the movie, an adult Sheryl delivers the following quote People say it can't work,black and white; well here we make it work,everyday. We have our disagreements, of course, but before we reach for hate, always, always, we remember the Titans. After watching this movie, I promise that you will too.

Also, seeing its astonishingly high ranking on the IMDb Top 250 prompted me to watch it as well. I am glad to say that it was not the mainstream violence fiesta I expected it to be, but an original, clever, and plot-twisting drama.The plot contains a few different stories, one of a boxer, hit-men, and some others, that intertwine throughout the film. Tarantino's style of visual narration is one of boldness, as he uses a frequently often mixed up timeline that really leaves the viewer guessing what's going to be revealed next. His directorial excellence in this element really made me appreciate the film and screenplay that much more. At times, some points in the story seemingly became meaningless, and may have possibly ended up being that way, but it was the brilliantly entertaining dialogue that effortlessly filled these gaps in my attention span and didn't let the odd tales cause a dismay in my opinion on the film. All of Tarantino's scripts ooze humor, intelligence and emotional suspense, and this film I believe to be his most orally inventive. No conversation goes without a laugh or a provoked thought. The dialogue in this movie was just plain amazingly real, as these could have likely been real conversations. It is for this reason, I hold Pulp Fiction in such high regard as a movie, and as a game changer in the industry as far as screenplays go.The acting, I'm sure to nobody's denial, was excellent. All the characters, Samuel L. Jackson's being my personal favorite, executed their lines with the power and connotations that their writer intended. Many fans of the actors in this film will see their favorite stars portray unlikely roles, as all of the interestingly weird people in the movie are abnormal, and great, if I might add. Without argument, the acting in Pulp Fiction propelled its story and settings to a whole new level in cinema. Though the awesomely smart, action-packed, and witty Pulp Fiction had some slow areas in its story and development, its excellent dialogue and quirky characters pushed it to cinematic glory.

Inspection of the film's poster, emphasizing pink and the suggestively positioned bodies of its luscious female stars would leave the viewer prepped to expect yet another example of the frothy romantic comedies Marilyn Monroe established herself as an icon starring in during the 1950s. However, rather than the superficial fluff it is often dismissed as, while it may function as such, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes demonstrates surprising subtle underlying complexity to its extravagant exteriors, making it one of the more memorable and enjoyable entries to the genre of its era.However, while deceptively complex it may be, consistent the film is not, being comprised of an an odd myriad of cinematic and thematic contradictions which somehow manages to remain charming and infectiously entertaining throughout in spite of it all. These seeming paradoxes are discernible on numerous fronts while director Howard Hawks retains his general tendency for interpersonal relationships usually being fast talking (the film's screwball style lightning quick dialogue exchanges are hilarious), caustic and often thriving on unhappiness, he simultaneously attempts to inject real pathos into the film's midsection (which lags somewhat) and attempts at genuine jubilant joy for the ending. This grasping at more conventional, forced emotion rather than Hawks' typical smarmy cynicism and dark irony makes the film feel somewhat imbalanced, but it is saved by the consistent sense of fun keeping it aloft throughout. Similarly, the moralistic stance of the film flip-flops throughout, alternating between satirically sending up the opulent lifestyles the two gold-digging protagonists seek and relishing them, basking in the glitz and splendour of hedonistic wealthy excess.Even the musical component to the film feels sporadic, as the pacing between the musical numbers interspersed throughout the narrative is erratic, some being nearly back to back and others having large expanses of time between them, as if Hawks only decided partially through filming to make the film a musical rather than planning his song and dance interludes beforehand. Nonetheless, once they turn up, the song numbers do not disappoint. Despite not being the most memorable compared with other entries in the genre, the cheeriness, exuberance and sheer fun factor make up for it in spades, Monroe's timeless Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend being the highlight, though Russell's Is there Anybody Here for Love proves a delightfully subversive take on gender objectification by having a scantily clad chorus of men paraded around instead of women). However, inconsistencies and all, the film is kept aloft by its consistent sense of irreverent fun, making the occasional bout of complexity all the more welcome, serving to differentiate the film from its many contemporaries with simpler aims and establishing it as one of the more intriguing genre examples of its time.The casting of Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe proved the film's defining element, the two sharing pitch perfect chemistry and serving to ably demonstrate two examples of strong, capable female characters in a genre far too often plagued with submissive females. Despite their superficial aims, Russell and Monroe know exactly what they want and how to get it , and the viewer can't help but cheer them on, dubious motives or not. The two also make a sublimely comedic double act, with Russell's motormouthed assertiveness perfectly counterbalancing Monroe's bubbly, naive persona (although the case can be made for her allegedly simple-minded floozy being a crafty act, with lines such as the titular quote suggesting ulterior motives behind her silliness). Charles Coburn also raises several hearty laughs as the obscenely stuffy millionaire affectionately dubbed Piggy, and Elliot Reid makes for a wonderfully subversive potential love interest figure, always ready to contribute a sarcastic wisecrack or cynical comment.Despite structural and thematic inconsistencies and the occasional bout of unnecessarily contrived emotion, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes asserts its place as one of the most delightful and memorable musicals of its time, mainly because of subtly subversive subtexts and the charming chemistry between the two radiant leads. For any in search of an enjoyable, witty and sophisticated vintage comedy with some extravagant musical numbers thrown in for good measure, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes should prove an ideal pick.-8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 December 2008","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" For any charting the origins of the cliché don't judge a book by its cover, films like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes must have proved excellent early examples.

Similarly, the moralistic stance of the film flip-flops throughout, alternating between satirically sending up the opulent lifestyles the two gold-digging protagonists seek and relishing them, basking in the glitz and splendour of hedonistic wealthy excess.Even the musical component to the film feels sporadic, as the pacing between the musical numbers interspersed throughout the narrative is erratic, some being nearly back to back and others having large expanses of time between them, as if Hawks only decided partially through filming to make the film a musical rather than planning his song and dance interludes beforehand. Nonetheless, once they turn up, the song numbers do not disappoint. Despite not being the most memorable compared with other entries in the genre, the cheeriness, exuberance and sheer fun factor make up for it in spades, Monroe's timeless Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend being the highlight, though Russell's Is there Anybody Here for Love proves a delightfully subversive take on gender objectification by having a scantily clad chorus of men paraded around instead of women). However, inconsistencies and all, the film is kept aloft by its consistent sense of irreverent fun, making the occasional bout of complexity all the more welcome, serving to differentiate the film from its many contemporaries with simpler aims and establishing it as one of the more intriguing genre examples of its time.The casting of Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe proved the film's defining element, the two sharing pitch perfect chemistry and serving to ably demonstrate two examples of strong, capable female characters in a genre far too often plagued with submissive females. Despite their superficial aims, Russell and Monroe know exactly what they want and how to get it , and the viewer can't help but cheer them on, dubious motives or not. The two also make a sublimely comedic double act, with Russell's motormouthed assertiveness perfectly counterbalancing Monroe's bubbly, naive persona (although the case can be made for her allegedly simple-minded floozy being a crafty act, with lines such as the titular quote suggesting ulterior motives behind her silliness). Charles Coburn also raises several hearty laughs as the obscenely stuffy millionaire affectionately dubbed Piggy, and Elliot Reid makes for a wonderfully subversive potential love interest figure, always ready to contribute a sarcastic wisecrack or cynical comment.Despite structural and thematic inconsistencies and the occasional bout of unnecessarily contrived emotion, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes asserts its place as one of the most delightful and memorable musicals of its time, mainly because of subtly subversive subtexts and the charming chemistry between the two radiant leads. For any in search of an enjoyable, witty and sophisticated vintage comedy with some extravagant musical numbers thrown in for good measure, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes should prove an ideal pick.-8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"2 December 2008","score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Milos Forman's $65,000 black comedy, which clocks in just above one hour, takes place as small town firemen reckon on their festivity, are present at it, and endure it. They've arranged the titular ball in honor of their former chief, though it may be in the chief's eleventh hour. The beginning scene seems to promise an airy screwball comedy with lines like, We should have given it to him last year, when he was 85 instead of now when he's about to die. As is made clear while the simple men theorize on the reasoning contrary to that observation that the antiquated fireman, diagnosed with cancer unbeknownst to himself, will be awarded a princely little fire ax in a velvet-padded box. Following this opening scene, a fireman balances carefully on a high ladder to carefully singe the sides of a paper banner until his ladder loses its footing, he is left dangling, and the poster bursts into flames. Beyond these actually quite underplayed scenes, the comic feel diminishes in consistency.One scene which stands out is easily one of the funnier moments, but even still it could have been funnier In the course of the ball, a local barn catches fire, and the firemen rush the rest of the town to the scene. But their truck getting stuck in the snow is much more pivotal and potentially funny than its execution here, as by the time they get there, the barn is overcome by an inferno. Nonetheless, there are laughs to be had at this point The sullen farmer is staring longingly at his blazing barn, the firemen heed the suggestion that his chair be turned away from it, but the farmer simply turns his head to continue staring longingly at the barn. And when the farmer whines that he is cold, the firemen do the only thing they really can and move his chair closer to the fire.The swelling to that scene consists of the firemen's struggle for a beauty pageant, with the queen deputized to bestow the ax. They fill a table with raffle prizes that are salivated over, as implied in a very restricted sense within the context of the film's time and place. So, the prizes begin to depart a bit too early from sight. The beauty pageant is a catastrophe of ignorance and disorganization, and not least owing to hardly any of the neighborhood girls, none of whom are beauties, have any desire to be involved.Siding very much with the film itself concerning its treacherous political history, Forman is not scoffing at his characters, but at the system they populate. Frankly, I think the censors knew this when they condemned it as a damaging picture of Czech society, because that is the reactive approach in a fragile system that panics about criticism. Censors have always feigned the role of patriots, regarding any criticism as unpatriotic, when in effect criticism is a patriotic responsibility. Even now here in America, when the media is judged for disapproval, it most often merely signals that someone has had the nerve to probe the guiding principles of the party in power.So, this presently obscure installment in the tremendous Criterion Collection appeals to me as a historical example, particularly with which to further open the elements of the Bush administration, and not so much for the film's content in and of itself. As a raucous comedy by Milos Forman, it today sponges no oomph from its hazardous time, as it clearly did then. And it is as a indirect topical commentary where this film gains momentum, and alas Forman cleverly for the sake of his film's spirit did not urge his political arguments, leaning back with a grin to let them make themselves, insinuating with poise from the histrionics.

Suffice to say that the story is somewhat complicated and not everything is as it seems. It is all cleared up in the end, but you have to pay attention.The story begins in modern times, when Matthew McConaughey as Fenton Meiks shows up in an FBI office, and proceeds to tell the agent that he knows who the mysterious serial killer is.

I have recently seen Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid and I don't think I'll ever forget it. This movie simply blew me away and, even though it's from the 60's, the film is just as fresh and relevant today and certainly holds up to any Western produced since. (I hesitate to even call it a Western either - it has more wit than most comedies I've seen lately.) What made this movie so great for me is the undeniable chemistry between our outlaws, Newman & Redford - it's absolute perfection. This is one of the all time greatest 'buddy' films I have ever seen - you'll definitely be rooting for 'the bad guys'! The characters are so endearing and so real that I could not believe they were acting. Nothing feels forced or even scripted, it's just naturally one great ride! One of my personal favourite features of this movie is the way George Roy Hill chose to shoot the 'possey' that is sent after our two main characters - he makes the film that much better by choosing to shoot long sweeping scenes which prove highly effective. Even more intriguing is how there are several shots throughout the film where the characters are seen through objects and not always dead on (like through fences or window panes, etc). It gave me the feeling of being a voyeur instead of right there with them; which is a somewhat new feeling that I really enjoyed. Hill is an excellent story teller and I simply did not want this picture to end.Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is sure to please any movie lover despite age or favourite genre.

I was into anything that was considered subversive or artsy and involved happening young people smoking and delivering profanity-laced dialogue. At the time, I loved this film--it was flashy, violent and angst-ridden, basically everything I wanted to be. After I quit smoking, stopped dressing like a techno-druggie and stopped worrying about who had weed I could buy, I decided to view this film again. Man, this film is pretty flipping retarded. First off--I know that the director was trying to make a surreal road movie and that many of the elements of the film were subject to deus ex machina. However, I kind of had a problem with the fact that these kids were on the road for like two weeks, never really changed their clothes, never exercised, smoked like fiends and ate quick-stop chili dogs for breakfast lunch and dinner yet they all still looked like they just stepped out of a Hot Topic fashion shoot. White teeth, blowed dried hair and great skin adorned all of the teenagers in this film. Now, maybe I'm just being a movie snob I don't know. But if this film had been any good, I think I could forgive incongruencies such as the aforemntioned hygiene issues. However, the film itself was pretty much self-indulgent crap that I'm sure symbolized the fleeting nature of youth and innocence and hope or some other goofy avant-garde bull. However, if you can somehow accept this film for what it is--over the top, overly artsy-fartsy and trying to make a myriad of nonsensical statements, then at least the crap becomes somewhat beautiful. In fact, I think I can only recommend this movie to people who are fans of the stars--it features a pre-Donnie Darko James Duvall and a pre-fame Rose McGowan (both actors are featured in pretty hot sex scenes, for those of you wondering). Jonathon Schaech I couldn't really give a crap about since he was the worst actor in the film He was pretty good in That Thing You Do but after that he fell off my radar. The cameos are kind of cool, early ones include Margaret Cho and Perry Farrel of Jane's Addiction. The best however come from Nicky Katt who plays a mentally unstable Burger joint employee who mistakes Rose McGowan's character for his ex-girlfriend.

Filmed in almost one room, Hitchcock tried to keep the same feel as the stage play it was based on. The effect is nothing but wonderful! The story takes place over one evening, the setting is a simple dinner party which isn't really simple at all. Past school chums (and now roommates and partners), Brandon and Phillip, take their former professor's words to much to heart and set out to pull off one of the most brazen acts imaginable - the perfect murder. They decide to kill their friend in cold blood and then have a dinner party with his family, his girlfriend and their former professor (Jimmy Stewart) - concealing his dead body within a trunk in the living room. When their college professor starts questioning one of the boys' inexplicably nervous behaviour, Brandon's 'perfect murder' just might not be as perfect as he once hoped... The cast of characters is excellent and each one is given great attention and careful detail - a real testament to the flawless script! It's a shame movies today feel the need to treat the viewer like an uneducated simpleton, spelling every single detail out for you. In Hitchcock's Rope, things are implied but it's really up to the viewer to get involved in the film and with the characters to discover what's really going on. The subtlety is so refreshing! All in all the suspense, perfect acting, great dialogue and amazing cinematography make for one superb little film!

She said it is one of her favorites and now I know why. It tells a story that never gets old, of friends and family supporting each other.Set in 1914, near the beginning of what became WW I, Liesel Matthews is young Sara Crewe, living with her British father in India. They are well off and she is happy there. But the conflicts heat up and her father, Liam Cunningham as Capt. Crewe, must join the British forces in battle. For Sara's safety arrangements are made for her to move to a boarding house for girls in the East Coast of the USA. There she gets the best room in the tall mansion of a boarding school.While all the girls are of similar ages, Sara seems to be the most mature of them, and her education in India put her ahead of the others. While they were just learning French, for example, Sara was already fluent. This brought her the admiration of many but others became jealous, particularly the head of the boarding school, Eleanor Bron as Miss Minchin.Sara misses her dad but they write often. However one dark day in young Sara's life a messenger comes with the news, her father apparently died in combat. To make things even worse the British government confiscated the Captain's business and assets, and little Sara went from rich to poor in an instant. Miss Minchin is not quite evil, but she is not a very generous person. So, to avoid putting Sara out on the street she was given a cold, leaky room in the attic, and made to work hard doing housekeeping chores every day.Sara isn't happy about the developments but takes it in stride, and becomes fast friends with the other child housekeeper, Vanessa Lee Chester as Becky, who had an equally spartan room next to Sara's. But Sara's gift for telling stories cheered both of them up, and even had the other girls sneaking up to her room after bed time, to hear Sara's stories.One of Sara's favorite stories is about a Prince and a Princess, and Sara tells all of the girls that each one of them is a Princess too, thus the title of the movie.I enjoyed this movie, the story kept my interest all the way through. It is about having a positive attitude, and about the importance of family, friends, and loyalty. Liesel Matthews was an inspired choice for the role of Sara, she is such a good, natural actress and made the story seem real. (I understand she, of the Hyatt Hotel family, is worth perhaps $500 Million now so we may not see her acting much more.)SPOILERS FOLLOW After Sara was put into domestic slavery in the boarding school, a mysterious wounded soldier was brought to the residence next door, because he was thought to be the son of that man. But he wasn't. It turned out to be Sara's dad, Capt. Crewe, who had bravely saved others but then wounded and had lost his memory. The mean Miss Minchin was being mean and was about to have Sara arrested for something she didn't do, when the Captain remembered who he was, and went to embrace his daughter. In the process Minchin lost her job, and at the end we see her joining a chimney sweep for her new career!

She said it is one of her favorites and now I know why. It tells a story that never gets old, of friends and family supporting each other.Set in 1914, near the beginning of what became WW I, Liesel Matthews is young Sara Crewe, living with her British father in India. They are well off and she is happy there. But the conflicts heat up and her father, Liam Cunningham as Capt. Crewe, must join the British forces in battle. For Sara's safety arrangements are made for her to move to a boarding house for girls in the East Coast of the USA. There she gets the best room in the tall mansion of a boarding school.While all the girls are of similar ages, Sara seems to be the most mature of them, and her education in India put her ahead of the others. While they were just learning French, for example, Sara was already fluent. This brought her the admiration of many but others became jealous, particularly the head of the boarding school, Eleanor Bron as Miss Minchin.Sara misses her dad but they write often. However one dark day in young Sara's life a messenger comes with the news, her father apparently died in combat. To make things even worse the British government confiscated the Captain's business and assets, and little Sara went from rich to poor in an instant. Miss Minchin is not quite evil, but she is not a very generous person. So, to avoid putting Sara out on the street she was given a cold, leaky room in the attic, and made to work hard doing housekeeping chores every day.Sara isn't happy about the developments but takes it in stride, and becomes fast friends with the other child housekeeper, Vanessa Lee Chester as Becky, who had an equally spartan room next to Sara's. But Sara's gift for telling stories cheered both of them up, and even had the other girls sneaking up to her room after bed time, to hear Sara's stories.One of Sara's favorite stories is about a Prince and a Princess, and Sara tells all of the girls that each one of them is a Princess too, thus the title of the movie.I enjoyed this movie, the story kept my interest all the way through. It is about having a positive attitude, and about the importance of family, friends, and loyalty. Liesel Matthews was an inspired choice for the role of Sara, she is such a good, natural actress and made the story seem real. (I understand she, of the Hyatt Hotel family, is worth perhaps $500 Million now so we may not see her acting much more.)SPOILERS FOLLOW After Sara was put into domestic slavery in the boarding school, a mysterious wounded soldier was brought to the residence next door, because he was thought to be the son of that man. But he wasn't. It turned out to be Sara's dad, Capt. Crewe, who had bravely saved others but then wounded and had lost his memory. The mean Miss Minchin was being mean and was about to have Sara arrested for something she didn't do, when the Captain remembered who he was, and went to embrace his daughter. In the process Minchin lost her job, and at the end we see her joining a chimney sweep for her new career!

After a drink in the saloon he pops into the barbers for a shave where he is interrupted by three locals spoiling for a fight. Clint quickly dispatches them before they can get off a shot. It turns out that these three had been hired to protect the town from three murderers who had killed the town marshal, this crime the town covered up but to get rid of them they framed them for a robbery. They swore revenge on the town and are due to be released from prison the next day.The townspeople approach the nameless gunman, played by Clint, to help then protect the town, he isn't interested until they say he can have anything he wants if he helps. He soon takes advantage of the offer getting free items from just about every shop in town and making the local midget both the sheriff and the mayor. The more he takes the more the townsfolk start to argue amongst themselves, some even make the mistake of trying to kill him. By the time the three murders arrive the gunman has literally painted the town red and renamed it Hell.In many ways this is similar to his later film Pale Rider, in both it is strongly suggested that the protagonist is an avenging ghost and he even rides a similarly coloured horse. The acting in the film is solid and includes many people who where regularly in Clint Eastwood's films of the time. As well as the action the film is memorable for the haunting music. This is one of my favourite westerns, I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.

It's the kind of film you need to watch twice in a relatively short period of time to truly understand the script's mastery. I've seen the film twice, but years apart, so my insight into the tremendous cinematic achievement of director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie is there but limited.Suspects is derived from a concept of a line-up of hardened criminals who have been brought in not with any evidence, but just because they are the usual suspects. Their union, however, soon finds them all on a job that ends up with a giant boat explosion and only two survivors, one of them being only one of the criminals, Verbal Kint (Spacey) a constantly rambling cripple who must explain the entire situation to the police. The story is told almost entirely from Kint's perspective, which already adds a shade of suspicion to the plot.The film lines up in strong cast with Spacey including Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Toro and Chazz Palminteri. Their characters, especially the criminals, all add an interesting dynamic to the film, keeping all the scenes interesting when the greater mystery is really the film's greatest asset.McQuarrie has lined the script full of gems so carefully that when he unloads one of the best twist endings in cinematic history, you are slapped across the face and filled with absolute glee. There's no other way to put it. Credit for this also should go to Singer and Spacey. There's no question that Singer's direction keeps up the intensity. It romanticizes the criminal lifestyle a bit, but it's necessary. Spacey's incredible portrayal of Kint, not only in his mannerisms but in his dramatic highs and lows keeps the storytelling engaging too.You simply have to watch this film and then watch it again. Then you will unquestionably like it to some degree. If you need a heavy dose of action in all your crime films, that degree will be lesser. This movie does rely heavily on script and character to keep your attention. However, as far as pure mystery goes, you can't beat The Usual Suspects.

I think I finally got it. The execution, by Orson Welles and his comrades in arts, is superb but the story itself almost buries its implications for modern society under one of those multi-dimensional generational narratives, like The Young Philadelphians or even Peyton Place. Young George Amberson Minafer (Tim Holt) grows up from a spoiled brat in a rich Indianapolis family to become a spoiled brat in a family that's on its way downhill, while the older Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten), whom Georgie hates, and Morgan's daughter Lucy (Ann Baxter), whom Georgie loves, turn into a wealthy automobile manufacturing family. Georgie gives up what little he has left in order to support his Aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) and, in the end, everybody comes to appreciate Georgie for his self-sacrifice. Not that it appears to help Georgie very much, since by now he's broke and in the hospital with two fractured legs, having been run over by one of the automobiles he loathes.This was Welles' follow-up to the magnificent Citizen Kane. It was shot in 1941. And it would be nice to say that it's up to the standards of the first movie but it's not. There's a good deal of shouting, running around, and dancing, but it's rather a slow slog through the years. The theme that would most impress modern viewers is similar to that of How Green Was My Valley, the virtual destruction of intimate, small-town life, by the spread of an ugly industry. That's my impression anyway. I'm old enough to remember standing on the streets of a city -- Phoenix, Arizona -- and being able to look down a thoroughfare and see the desert at both ends. Old enough to remember New Jersey before its last inch of greensward was paved over. Yes, it's true. I don't like smog and urban sprawl. Oh, where did it all go? (Sob.) Well, not to be too depressing, some people seem to love look-alike shopping malls. A chaque a son gout. Welles' film doesn't spend enough time on what I consider a pretty powerful theme. It's most hinted at. In the opening scenes, Welles' jovial narration tells us how much time everyone had and how simple life's more mechanical aspects seemed. Later, we notice telephone poles have grown alongside the city's roads. And towards the end the narration tells us explicitly what the screen shows us -- an ugly city, befouling itself. I should add that there's something else that got by me on previous viewings. Without setting it up in flashing neon, Welles deals with the same problem here that he did in Citizen Kane, namely the loss of youthful and innocent determination or, to put it more broadly, aging itself. It seems a very personal issue for him. Even in his first, clumsy, amateurish short movie, Death is omnipresent. Now that I'm ancient myself, it may be easier to grasp his obsession with the problem of age, impotence, and death. Sartre once suggested that anyone reaching the age of twenty-five should blow his own brains out. That strikes me as a little excessive. Better sublimation than suicide.Not that there's anything wrong with the performances or with Welles' directorial technique or with Bernard Hermann's score or Stanley Cortez's photography. The camera work is artful in fact. Cortez shot several lengthy scenes following the actors around with a sixty-pound camera strapped to his chest.I'm not sure that the faults of the film belong to Orson Welles alone. The shooting was interrupted by Pearl Harbor and Welles was sent off to Latin America to make sure the good folk South of the Border didn't make any critical mistakes in choosing their allegiances. So some of the remaining scenes were directed by committee. And Welles wasn't available to supervise the editing. He tried doing it long distance, sending Robert Wise six-page telegrams full of instructions that were, to Wise, incomprehensible. A final shot was filmed that would have evoked the last warehouse inventory of Citizen Kane, a long survey of the empty Amberson mansion with its furniture shrouded in sheets, but the studio cut it out. Who knows what else wound up on the floor? There isn't enough room to examine the film -- its virtues and its flaws -- as thoroughly as it should be, so let's summarize by saying it's worth watching.
