This movie is what could be considered the bridge between the classic horror movies and the more blood soaked modern movies; for the reasons that it's in black and white and still keeps the classic tone but at the same time adds more violence, a focus on the humans and of course the horror craze that is The Zombie. Yes that's right for those of you that don't know, Night of the Living Dead is considered to have created the modern zombie. This movie completely shocked audiences at the time, its was unlike anything they've ever seen! Now for the review, the movie starts in a graveyard, one of the main staples of horror films, your given very little set up and then BAM! Zombies attack. Its great because it catches you off guard much like the characters in the film. Then really quickly your projected into a lone house on the plains, this is were the movie turns from good to downright masterpiece. This is when more and more characters start to be revealed, the writing of these characters is just great, sounds very much like real people talking\/arguing. The movie is also a good character study showing how people's true selves are shown in a time of complete chaos. My favorite of the characters being Ben mainly because he's the only person who looks at reason. The zombies (although never called zombies) are the monsters of this movie, now compared to today's zombie they're very very different, this also goes back to the movies violence at the time it was just unrelentingly gory, now though it's very tame. Many of the scenes in this movie are iconic, from zombies just moping around to They're coming to get you Barbra. Two more things I'm going to talk about, first being the ending. Night of the Living Dead's ending is one of the greatest movie shockers of all time, I'm not going to spoil it but it's a brilliant twist. And the final thing I'll talk about is  the movie's impact. The movie was incredibly influential again with the violence but also that it dealt with a big issue at the time, Civil Rights. The main character of this movie was a black man back in 1968 that was unheard of, but George A. Romero went ahead and made it happen. In the end Night of the Living Dead is as of now the best movie I have reviewed for The Movie Guy's Halloween Horror Movie Spectacular 2013 with it being a excellent movie with great witting, good horror and shocks, Night of the Living Dead gets a 9.6 out of 10. Pretty good for a cheap little public domain movie, and actually because its public domain you can watch it right now for free legally.

These 10 movies will forever be near my heart and always influenced me to be a movie director in the future. The Bridge on the River Kwai is definitely one of the top 10 favorite films on my list. Of course, I also enjoyed and love other great movies as well. Other movies included on the my list are 2001 A Space Odyssey, Bullitt, The Terminator, Thief, Lethal Weapon, The Wild Bunch and Alien. The Bridge on the River Kwai is also included. The movie is set in Burma during World War II. The year is 1943, and British POW's are being held up in Japanese war camps. One of those British POW's is Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role in this movie. Nicholson and his fellow men are assigned to build a bridge that will be used for a railway that will go through the Burmese jungle. Meanwhile, another POW, an American, played by William Holden, plans to blow up the bridge and sets off into the jungle to escape from the camp. Eventually, Holden and his recruits are all rounded to destroyed what is being constructed. David Lean is a cinematic master. His work is eye-popping and very vivid to look at. However, he is not one of my favorite directors. But, what I like about this movie is the way he tells the story. Some people may called it a war movie. But, others, like myself, would say that this movie is both a war movie, but most importantly, a war movie about individuals. So many war movies reflect on the pain of war. A lot of them reflect on the horrors of war itself. The Bridge on the River Kwai is a war movie about people. The people in this movie are devoted to be put into a plot that involves having to struggle and survive this snaring scenario. As we watch Bridge on the River Kwai, we are reminded that the two leading characters are different men coming from different backgrounds. One is honorable, but arrogant among his men. The other is not honorable and damaging, perhaps. These two men are stuck in a story where the only thing that stands in their way is a bridge. As a matter of fact, the bridge also plays a significant role in the movie. The bridge is a mark of the Japanese colonel, who assigned Nicholson to build the bridge. The Bridge on the River Kwai won 7 Oscars, including Best Picture. I like it a lot. Much of it is based on the story, direction and characters. I like when movies break new ground with their original stories. It's films like this one that reminds us how much we love movies. David Lean should be proud of making this movie, since it struggled through a troubled production. An excellent movie for the generation of film-makers. ★★★★ 4 stars.

I'm not American, I'm Canadian. Maybe I don't have the right to speak out about Presidents. I just know what I like. Everyone has a different opinion, but I haven't cared for any of the presidents since I've been alive, and I'm 28 years old. Politics bore me to begin with, but this movie is so likable, I couldn't help but enjoy myself. Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors, and he's rarely been more charming. This is a president I pine for. One that is sharp, witty, caring, genuine, and human. He's not perfect, and he's not ashamed to be human. He actually cares about what the public wants. I get awfully tired of presidents giving people what they want to hear, and not follow up on it. Andrew Shephard (Douglas) will make people pine for a president as good as he is. Douglas was excellent. Annette Bening makes for a solid love interest. Her chemistry with Douglas was great as well. I do have a minor complaint, and that's how the opposing candidate (Richard Dreyfuss) is written. He is shoddily thrown in, without much background or development that is needed. He suddenly shows up to do undermining tactics towards Douglas, and it wasn't enough for me. Maybe I'm being too fickle on this, but it fell flat for me. I will say it's nice to see clichés evaded for once, when it comes to a daughter meeting a love interest of their Father's. I get so tired of the Screw you, I want my Mom attitude that they do in movies with daughters, so it was refreshing to see a scenario where the daughter accepts the love interest. I give all the credit to Shawn Waldron for being such a likable daughter to Douglas. Martin Sheen is great as Douglas's right hand man, and Michael J. Fox is solid as support. I loved Michael Douglas's monologue at the end as well. Final Thoughts Watch this movie whenever you get depressed with the current president.

In 2000 Hollywood was not completely sure what to make of M. Night Shyamalan so they threw a lot of cash at him and stood back to see what would happen? (They tried the same strategy with AIRBENDER and got a very different result). In this case, the slot machine cranked out coins. Not only a great film but possibly one of the top 100 of all time. The story is iconic, action-packed, mysterious, subtle, interwoven, symbolic -- basically he hit every base but romantic comedy. That, deep within the workings of the script, there was a hint, a soupçon, that comics (er, graphic novels, sorry, my bad) might have a grain of truth, merely added another few million viewers to the already-long lineups, as one fanboy told another told another. Moves along brilliantly, both engages and challenges the viewer. Willis is great (as always -- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF CASTING A MIDDLE AGED BALD GUY IN THIS ROLE? WOW!) and M. Night even managed a good performance from Samuel L. Jackson, an actor so overexposed, and so one note, that if you look closely at your cousin's wedding photos, you will see he played the bartender.

So director Roberto Benigni picked a very controversial and somewhat extreme subject to put this idea in The Holocaust. Hardly someone would think in a good side of the Holocaust, and certainly it hasn't any. But we can only cheer and appreciate what Benigni tried to do. He dared a lot doing that.And Benigni seems to be really the star in all aspects of this film. His acting was very impressive, it reminded me a bit of the Jerry Lewis performances, but it obviously has much more serious tons than the latter.

He was perhaps the biggest star on Earth for a brief period in the early 90s. Then came Waterworld. Then his boring 1997 flop The Postman. Though he still gets plenty of work, his star dimmed considerably after the mid 90s. Its kind of a shame, too. Waterworld was one of those films already declared a flop even while still in production. Though it underperformed at the box office, there have likely been many worse flops recently. John Carter, anyone? Any Lone Ranger fans out there? I haven't seen either, so let's just focus on Waterworld for this evening. I just saw it again for the first time in some years. Truth be told, it isn't bad. Some elements of it are down right brilliant. But there are others that almost make you cringe. Dennis Hopper's mugging would come to mind. Waterworld is just the damnest of movies. So close to being an epic action film, but just cannot get out of its own way.The plot is something out of the Mad Max realm of films. We have a futuristic world in which all the land seems to be submerged. We are led to believe this would have happened due to global warming which was more of a 90s buzz-word as opposed to climate change of today. Anyway, instead of petrol being the most sought after commodity, now we have dirt as being the most precious thing. Small groups of people live together in floating atolls where there is some semblance of organized society. So much of this plot and production design seem completely lifted from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, that someone probably got sued. I believe both films used the same cinematographer (Dean Semler) too! Basically if you made Barter Town float you'd have the atoll from Waterworld. But like Mad Max 3, this film also lacks any true sense of menace. The villains play almost every scene for laughs. Though Costner as the anti-hero Mariner is tough and resourceful like Gibson's Max, he needed a more compelling adversary. Dennis Hopper in this film is hardly as evil as Tina Turner. The supporting cast doesn't offer that much, either. Look closely for Jack Black in an early role as a pilot(!).What Waterworld has going for it are some incredible set pieces and action scenes. How cool is Costner's boat?? The tricks he uses to take care of himself and keep one step ahead of Hopper's army are what makes this film more entertaining than not. This film could have also helped itself by being a little more subtle, especially when defining its villains. They're a bunch of dirty pirates known as smokers who apparently use former Exxon tanker Valdeez as their flagship and regard its disgraced former Captain Joseph Hazelwood as some sort of hero. Uh huh. Overall, Waterworld is not terrible entertainment, however. Its inconsistent tone, and awkward pace are typical of films that had major production issues, and too many script treatments floating around. You want to see something really terrific by director Kevin Reynolds? Find a copy of The Beast or The Beast of War, as its sometimes called.

Naturally, Kevin Williamson didn't do it first. Dan O'Bannon, a hugely successful and influential screenwriter that never got his due in his life time, beat him by a decade. Originally designed for horror-hack Tobe Hooper, O'Bannon injected the screenplay with his trademark inventiveness and quirky humor. Return of the Living Dead is textbook post-modern, referencing Night of the Living Dead explicitly. O'Bannon makes his intentions clear immediately with a sarcastic title card declaring the film to be a true story.Hardcore horror fans like myself hate on fast zombies while conveniently overlooking that this beloved cult classic has fast zombies in it. Unlike the inexplicable MTV zombies Zack Snyder inflicted on the world, Return's zombies have a reason for running. As Freddie and Frank's in-progress zombificaiton shows, Trioxin keeps the higher functions alive while causing the rest of the body to die, allowing for awesome, goopy zombies that run, talk, and use complex tools. The comic book tone prevents that from coming off as ridiculous, as it would in a more self-serious film. Zombies eating brains, a behavior this film popularized, is explained as curtailing the pain of rot. Of course, the brain contains dopamine and other tasty hormones. Makes perfect sense.The movie reinvented zombies in other ways. Romero always made an effort to give his ghouls personalities. Due to the microscopic budgets of his films, this usually didn't go beyond nurse outfits, clown wigs, or no clothes at all. Return, on the other hand, came right in the golden age of eighties creature effects. The Yellow Man bobs around with no head, a double amputee zombie waddles after his pray, and a skeletal corpse rattles a dangling spinal cord. The Tar Man stands in an undead league of his own. I seriously don't think there's a better example of what a zombie can be on-screen. Zombies are too frequently faceless hordes, an impulse this movie laughs at.Also unlike Romero's epics, Return is probably too much of a spit-take to examine from a sociological viewpoint. And yet&#x85; This movie set out to reinvent zombies for the eighties. Eighties, the cocaine decade. These zombies eat brains to dull the pain of death, like coke heads snort to dull the pain of life. When they've had their hit, the undead are hopped up, running and leaping all over the place. Freddie's slow death represents another type of drug abuse, a junkie fading to sedatives. Until, finally reaching rock bottom, he's not recognized by love ones, transformed into totally different creatures. Notably, these zombies don't pass their condition on through bites. It's born out of the air, out of the crowded, urban cemeteries they live in. The government's response to the pandemic? Nuke it from orbit. Reading too much in to it? Probably.Return is widely regarded as a hallmark punk movie. No doubt, when cast members wear tattered leather and have chains in their faces. But punk wasn't as homogeneous in 1985 as it is now. Suicide, Scuz, Spider, and Trash would fit in fine at a Circle Jerks concert but Chuck and Casey would probably be more comfortable in a new wave club. (This almost justifies squeaky-clean Tina hanging out with the bawdy punks. Almost.) The soundtrack isn't straight-ahead either. You'd be hard-pressed to hear psychobilly like Surfin' Dead or sleazy dance-pop like Tonight (We'll Make Love til We Die) on a punk station these days. The punk aesthetic was chosen to distinguish the cast from typical eighties slasher fodder. It succeeds in that regard, even if the teens aren't developed much. Mark Venturini's hilarious monologue about his punk bonafides and Miguel Nunez being the first black guy to make it to the end are the only time the kids truly shine. Linnea Quigley, decked out in a Ziggy Stardust wig and not much else, is either intentionally playing her character deadpan, a bad actress, or stoned out of her mind. Either way, she's hilarious. Her nearly feature-length nude scene is the stuff of eighties horror legend.The older cast members truly own this one. James Karen and Clu Gulager both get uproarious bits to themselves. Karen, when he goes from panicky to calm with just a sip of coffee. Gulager when he has to explain the rabid weasel situation. The film makes excellent use of both veteran character actors. Don Calfa's Ernie, who is almost definitely a Nazi, is maybe the stand-out, reacting calmly to the escalating situation, never loosing his hilarious, morbid matter-of-factness.While predominantly a pitch-black dark comedy, Return isn't without scares or pathos. A zombie leaping through a window, disposing of a pesky phone, is a great jump scare. Frank's final fate is weirdly sincere, as are the character's genuine panic over the increasingly bleak predicament. Yes, Return of the Living Dead is truly one of the best zombie movies ever made. Pretty much zero other films in the sub-genre matches its balance of wit, inventiveness, and sense of fun. Especially its' four sequels, all lackluster affairs.

For six years, Jaime and Michael Myers have been in the care of a druid cult. Jaime escapes with her newborn baby, is pursued by Michael and killed. But not before leaving her baby in a safe location. The baby is found by a now-adult Tommy Lloyd and a retired Dr. Loomis. Meanwhile, a branch of the Strode family, fathered by Laurie's previously unmentioned uncle, takes up residence in the Myers house. Michael returns to Haddonfield on the first Halloween to be celebrated since his absence and begins to kill the remaining Strodes. The cult attempts to abduct not just Jaime's baby but the son of the oldest daughter of the new Strode family. They succeed, grab her, the kids, Tommy, and Dr. Loomis, dragging them all to Smith's Grove for our conclusion. Considering this is a series that started out with crazy guy escapes hospital, kills babysitters, that's some needlessly complicated nonsense.I don't know if we needed an explanation for Michael's powers. Being pure evil was always enough for me. The titular Curse is the Curse of Thorn, a Celtic rite in which one member of a family is cursed to become a super-slasher and murder his family as a sacrifice to the god Samhain. (Which is actually pronounced Sah-wan and also not a god.) Myers annual appearances are tied to a corresponding constellation appearing in the sky. Instead of revealing this information gradually, this is dumped on us as raw exposition.Tying the Shape's origin in with the history of Halloween makes sense but this is a deeply unsatisfying explanation. Instead of being a naturally occurring evil, Myers was chosen by a cult. Instead of killing randomly, Myers is eliminating his family. Instead of being a normal boy who became a killer inexplicably, young Michael heard voices urging him to kill. Myers isn't a unique phenomena but instead one in a line of many ceremonial killers. This goes against what the original movie was about.The screenplay structure is all over the place. The extended Strode family was obviously introduced to up the body count. Older brother Tim and girlfriend Beth are attempting to bring Halloween back to Haddonfield as a political statement, which doesn't make sense. In order to do this, they invite obnoxious shock jock Barry Sims, a cross between Howard Stern and Art Bell, to town. Sims is murdered for no reason while Tim and Beth get naked before getting murdered. This subplot has little impact on the film. The Strode parents aren't much help either, existing only to die. This business is unrelated to the cult storyline.The direction is frequently questionable. Scenes are repeated in slow motion, color is inverted, and the editing haphazard. The sound design is atrocious. Punishingly musical stings pop up. Slashing sounds are randomly inserted. The music switches between the traditional Halloween theme, an awful techno remix, and heavy metal guitars. This is more frustrating since director John Chapelle is not without visual sense. The blinding white hallways of the sanitarium are striking.The film completely implodes in the last act. The identity of the Man in Black is underwhelmingly revealed. The cult is planning to perform a surgery. This is not elaborated on. There's a suggestion of genetic manipulation, which has no business in Halloween. Myers turns on the cult for no reasons, signaling the film's transformation into a chase-and-slash flick.The acting and characters are terrible too. Barry Simms, performed by a shouting Leo Geter, is incredibly obnoxious. Amazingly, he's not the most annoying character in this film. That dishonors falls to John Strode, the constantly ranting patriarch of the Strode family. Actor Bradford English plays it as exaggerated theater. Mom Debra is played by Kim Darby, who deserves so much better then this. Darby plays a bitty version of Velma from Scooby-Doo, even loosing her glasses at a pivotal moment. Marianne Hagan, as the final girl, is incredibly flat. Her screams of help during one moment are hilarious. Young Paul Rudd plays Tommy Doyle. He's obviously set up as the new Dr. Loomis, the well-meaning but possibly unhinged knower of evil. Rudd can't pull it off, acting like a socially awkward conspiracy theorist. All the acting is exaggerated, lending an air of unreality. Even the random old lady is a terrible actor! In the middle of this is dying Donald Pleasence. Donald is in high spirits, laughing and smiling in-between dialogue about evil and rage. A consummate professional up until the end.The only thing Curse gets right is Michael's look. Part 4's George Wilbur returns but skips the shoulder-pads. The mask is the best since part two's, even if the long hair throws me off. Michael, once again, is tearing people apart with his bare hands, using axes and machetes, teleporting all over the place, and playing possum on the floor. The gore is exaggerated, including an exploding head.Halloween Curse of Michael Myers was a troubled production, with daily rewrites, extensive reshoots and re-editing. Still, I can't imagine any movie hassled with the Curse of Thorn plot line being good. No wonder all future sequels ignore mess of a film.

Steiner and Maximilian Schell as the newly arrived, dapper, Junker aristo, eager for the Iron Cross, the decoration given only for heroism in battle. It has Pekinpaugh's signature on it -- an abundance of painful deaths, more explosions than have ever before been committed to celluloid, and all in slow motion. The story is such that, if it weren't for some cogent lines, it could have been directed by Sam Fuller.I'll give one example of what I thought was a good line. At the end, both Coburn and Schell stand face to face, armed, and about to be overwhelmed and killed by the onrushing Russians. It's only a brief pause, but Schell admits his status still requires the winning of the Iron Cross. You come with me, says Coburn, and I'll show you where the crosses of iron are. It's neat because by a simple transposition of words within the phrase, Coburn has turned a medal (the Iron Cross) into a grave marker (crosses of iron). It has its weaknesses. It's really too long and too loose-limbed for what it has to say. As Steiner, Coburn is a monument to military perfection, while Schell is a stereotypical cowardly and spiteful traitor. Coburn does well enough by the role of the humanitarian but dedicated sergeant. Schell is a marvelous actor but he has only one scene in which he's able to put his chops on display -- when he tricks a subordinate into admitting that he prefers the company of men to women. He said YES! He said YES! Schell is in a transport of delight at having finagled his subordinate into a possible admission of homosexuality which, as far as we can tell, isn't true. The effect, though, is to make the subordinate a compliant slave.It's not a bad film in any way but it lacks poetry of any kind. Pekinpah by this time in his career was describing himself as a functioning alcoholic. He's lucky he got it out at all.

He had previously shown that he was both aware and serious about keeping it secret. And despite his beef with his company about getting his compensation in writing (deservedly), it never shows him being willing or interested in betraying the secret, only that he was exploring talking to a lawyer about getting his share of the money.And like most plots, when too many people are involved in a conspiracy, it starts to get ridiculous.

When Jimmy Dell gave the guy the book and asked him to take it personally to his sister, what did he think would happen when he found out, as he later does, that it was an old woman?
