It's trying to tell too many different stories and so, even with nearly two and half hours screen time, each story feels too short and incomplete. There are at least a half-dozen major plot threads running concurrently; give the director credit for at least TRYING to fit everything that matters in from another of Tom Clancy's super-fat bestsellers. The other problem though is Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford). He is not the action hero of 'Patriot Games.' Here, he is a dupe at first, then a decoy at the end, and in between sort of a standard-issue government official (albeit a rare honest one). John Clark (Willem Defoe) is the closest thing to a 'hero' present. There is a large ensemble cast, everyone has a role to play, and Ryan frankly is reduced to being just another member of that ensemble. In short, the US President orders (without stating so explicitly, to cover his own butt) a covert military operation against drug cartels in Colombia. Clark heads up a small, elite squad that then begins going around blowing up labs and generally disrupting the drug business. In apparent retaliation, the FBI director and his entourage are killed in their motorcade while on a visit to Bogota. A Cuban intelligence expert working for one of the drug lords approaches National Security Adviser Cutter (the president's right-hand man) for a truce, and a deal-in exchange for his cutting drug exports to the US in half, he wants the inserted military team cut off and abandoned, so he can kill them. As mentioned, there are several other side-plots (Admiral Greer has terminal cancer, an FBI secretary is seduced by the Cuban intelligence agent and murdered) so there is a lot of jumping back and forth among the various players and situations. Among the best scenes is the ambush of the FBI director's motorcade in Colombia; very well-staged and realistic, it's a real nail-biter of a sequence. But there are several other good action set-pieces as well. 'Clear and Present Danger' does not seem as long as it is. It's just too bad the director, Philip Noyce, and the trio of screenwriters couldn't make the film a more cohesive package and found better ways to pump up Ford's role. After 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'Patriot Games,' we have certainly come to expect more from the Jack Ryan character than to be a fall-guy for a slippery Prez and his corrupt underlings, even if he belatedly turns the tables on them.

He also brought on Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day to make it a commercial viable picture (unlike the 1934 film, which only has Peter Lorre to remember it today for the cast). And by the mid 1950s, anyway, he was so far along as a technical marvel with suspense, timing, building dread and moments of psychological tension with just the simplest and tactful glance or direct dolly of the camera or twist of the lens that he could far surpass his creative flaws of the early 30's. It's a fool-proof thriller, if you will, one that can draw in audiences all over for its plot that involves a kidnapping, but with no ransom, and a murder plot that runs like a clockwork mousetrap game.The plot is as is Stewart and Day are a married couple with a boy in Marakesh on vacation, and after they witness the murder of a man they just met the day before on a bus- and who whispers some dying, crucial words to the doctor Stewart- their child is kidnapped and taken to London. No cops allowed, no funny business, just strict instructions, more or less based upon some of the other dying words from the man killed in Marakesh. After Hitchcock sets up some visually compelling and striking scenes in Morocco, ones that also have early on the typical-but-yet-not scenes of the doctor and his wife in the mundane joy of a vacation spoiled at first by an uneasy feeling of being watched or followed, he plunges into the terror of the situation. There's even a moment for an extra human dimension, where Stewart gives Day the pills to keep her calm before telling her the news of the kidnapping. This won't be some run of the mill case to be dealt with; it's a case of leverage more-so than profit in taking the kid, for the 'plot' to go off without a hitch.Then in England, Hitchcock delivers some interesting scenes involving a man (or rather, a place) Ambrose Chappel, including a classic bit inside the chapel itself. But while already scenes have been extremely well acted by the two stars, and all the supporting players (especially the creepy looking fellow who's to do the big murder) are top-notch, nothing can top what Hitchcock has been building towards- and more than hinted at with the very opening of the movie, as though giving hints to a riddle that the Master loves to unravel like a careful kitten- which is the Royal Albert Hall sequence. Herrmann, conducting himself, sets the exact tempo for the suspense of the sequence while also acting as a procession of the plot, and every little piece falls in with the delicious glee that the director has in his finest moments. If for no other reason to see the Man Who Knew Too Much, and there should be many, this sequence is an essential movie-viewing experience.

Anderson takes an advertisers eye to this film and inverts it, into around 40 or 50 short vignettes, some with recurring characters, like the man seen on the cover who has burned down his business to collect the insurance but bumbled the job, while most include walkons, and many characters drift in an out of scenes before the movie ends. These short vignettes are nearly all deadpan and absurdist tragi-comic advertisements for peoples lives broken or on the verge of breaking. The antagonist, if there must be one, is capitalism(a subject which the commercial making Anderson is very much aware), and it's de-humaizing effects on all its touches. As bleak as all this sounds, the material is played more often than not for laughs. There's a traffic jam which has clogged the city as if everyone were leaving at the same time, a girl who is blindfolded and lead of a cliff by her village elders, a man accidentally sawed in half by poor magician, men and women in business suits walk down streets in parade's flailing themselves as an act of penance to God so he will prevent the further falling of stocks, and a man followed around by ghosts of friends and strangers.

I'm not sure why people make such a comparison to Misery (I'm unfamiliar with that movie), or feel Ms. Bates was looking for something better to star in. For me, Fried green Tomatoes certainly gave her a great venue, again providing her with a chance to use all of her talents. Claiborne did the same, and she made good use of its doleful story. Jennifer Leigh-Scott (?) was excellent as the repressed, abused daughter upon whom Dolores lavished such love. Judy Parffit was a wonderful, cynical ice-queen; to me, there wasn't enough filmage to show how she got from queen to nut. However, Dolores had to have some person to lavish her strong love upon without her daughter and an abusive husband.Christopher Plummer (Det. John Mackey) certain shouldn't have to again prove his acting ability in any role. He was fabulous, although cold, for which the role called-for. Jesus of Nazareth should have convinced any viewer he has star-power.

The premise of the movie looks too simple but there are a very few movies that are as powerful as Shawshank Redemption. You can watch this movie time and again without getting bored. The first time I saw the movie, by the time it was almost coming to an end I felt that it was a pretty good movie and then there was this unexpected and a memorable ending followed by an explanation in Morgan Freeman's deep voice that made the movie simply great. I couldn't help but stand up and clap at the completeness of the movie. It captures every possible human emotion and portrays them every possible way you wanna see it. The movie runs at a pretty good pace, no lags or halts or irrelevant scene added to enhance the effects of the movie, and a simple background score. Or in other words this movie has its own natural flow, nothing in it seems out of place. Add to all this is the fine acting of Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and all the other support crew. This is a classic and not to be missed for any reason whatsoever.

Like many Hitchcock films, we see the inner working and reasoning of a serial killer in such a way as to understand his motivations, and Carl Boehm gives an excellent and subtle personal portrayal of a soul tormented by his own desires.On the surface it is a creepy psychological drama - rather kitsch-y by now with the pin up girls. But when you have Moira Shearer giving possibly her best performance, lively and humorous, as one of the murder victims, you have something special, and something deeper.This film has a lot to say about the voyeurism and destruction that persists within the industry.

How would we feel if we discovered that a whole multitude of people were working exhaustingly away so that we could live in the lap of luxury? I would imagine if we ever were to find out, we would be extremely scared and apprehensive to the fact that our lives were in the hands of others. Actually, the way I work, I would probably not be surprised to find out that WE were part of the underground city, slaving away for those above! Fritz Lang's Metropolis was the movie that I devoted my time to. Even being a silent film, it captivated me in a sort of disturbed way. The movie's thesis is stated several times throughout the movie. At the beginning of the film, words popped up onto the screen. They were, THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!. At first, that meant absolutely nothing to me, but as the movie progressed, I slowly began to see how the thesis panned out.I thought that the film Metropolis showed, very contradictorily, how much technology had advanced and how much it still was so lacking compared to what we have today. Even though it was a silent film, I had absolutely no problem understanding everything that was going on. I even think that awareness is heightened with no words, only the music of the orchestra. Of course, music plays a vital role in movies today. It sets the mood, whether happy or sad or dangerous. The music definitely portrayed every urgency excellently.One thing that I was hoping to see in the movie was an encounter between the real Maria and Robot Maria. As soon as Maria was able to escape from Rothgang's house, I was waiting and waiting for an encounter between the real and the fake Maria; and perhaps a conflict as to whom the people would believe. Obviously, technology was not so advanced then that it could accomplish such a feat, like was done in the movie The Parent Trap, where one girl played two girls in one scene.Although certain parts of the film were a little creepy and disturbing, I thought that Metropolis was a good film. Even though the trials took the characters through tumultuous highs and lows, the thesis came to fruition in the end with a happy ending.

I would imagine if we ever were to find out, we would be extremely scared and apprehensive to the fact that our lives were in the hands of others. Actually, the way I work, I would probably not be surprised to find out that WE were part of the underground city, slaving away for those above! Fritz Lang's Metropolis was the movie that I devoted my time to. Even being a silent film, it captivated me in a sort of disturbed way. The movie's thesis is stated several times throughout the movie. At the beginning of the film, words popped up onto the screen. They were, THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!. At first, that meant absolutely nothing to me, but as the movie progressed, I slowly began to see how the thesis panned out.I thought that the film Metropolis showed, very contradictorily, how much technology had advanced and how much it still was so lacking compared to what we have today. Even though it was a silent film, I had absolutely no problem understanding everything that was going on. I even think that awareness is heightened with no words, only the music of the orchestra. Of course, music plays a vital role in movies today. It sets the mood, whether happy or sad or dangerous. The music definitely portrayed every urgency excellently.One thing that I was hoping to see in the movie was an encounter between the real Maria and Robot Maria. As soon as Maria was able to escape from Rothgang's house, I was waiting and waiting for an encounter between the real and the fake Maria; and perhaps a conflict as to whom the people would believe. Obviously, technology was not so advanced then that it could accomplish such a feat, like was done in the movie The Parent Trap, where one girl played two girls in one scene.Although certain parts of the film were a little creepy and disturbing, I thought that Metropolis was a good film. Even though the trials took the characters through tumultuous highs and lows, the thesis came to fruition in the end with a happy ending.

Scream out loud, hold your partners hand or just cover your eyes and look through the gaps. This is certainly not a modern trend, it has been around since the days kids gather around the fire to hear the eldest of the tribe tell his stories of werewolves or Wendigo. Later, there was the printing press and books such as Dracula or Frankenstein appeared. But since the 20th century, humans have found another way to portrait our darkest corners inside our minds.A reason for this nature is simple. We like to read or watch people in scary situations, but still knowing that we, as audience are kept safe from the evils portrayed.If we are to name one character that on the late years has managed to gain a position on popular culture, it has to be Anthony Hopkins' Academy Award winning portrayal of Hannibal The Cannibal Lecter.Along with its counterpart, FBI trainee agent, Clarice Starling, played by Jodie Foster, these two characters are placed as #1 villain and #5 hero of all time by the American Film Institution. Also to add, that this movie is one of the only three movies to have won the five major Academy Awards for Best Actor in Leading Role, Best Actress in Leading Role, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture.The movie is directed by Jonathan Demme and is based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harrison. It deals mainly on this two characters, and how the young agent interacts, relates and tries to understand the once psychiatrist and now psychopath, in order to find and capture another psychopath by the nickname of Buffalo Bill.Previously to their encounters, Starling's superiors warn her to beware of the subject and not to reveal any personal information about her, information which she needs to share in order to get clues about the whereabouts and identity of Buffalo Bill. The movie proved to be a success and has given several sequels and prequels in order to explode the license. To me, the movie's success and position on almost any list of the best movies, is due not only to the great performances, but its also achieved by its directing. Jonathan Demme has created a style of his own, this can be observed on the changes from third person to first person and back again, and the many first shots of faces that reveal to us the reactions of the characters.This is a movie I would like to recommend to anyone interest in cinema, though it has some scenes not proper to the young audience.

No matter if he plays a bad guy, a good guy, a cop, a killer, a cripple, or a terrorist, George Clooney will always somehow use his charm and wit to seduce the people after him or pretty much anyone he meets, and gets out of a sticky situation. This time they ridicule the US Marshals by having us believe that a hot sexy young woman (Jennifer Lopez) is a US Marshal and totally falls for him. I'm sorry but I just couldn't swallow that no matter how hard I tried. Maybe if she was FBI or CIA, it'd be more passable, but please do not insult the integrity of the US Marshals Service. Samuel L Jackson is great as always but his role is a bit different here and unexpected. I'd like to see Tommy Lee Jones go after Clooney, because I know he won't fall for any tricks and take his ass down proper.The film has decent pace and editing that shows a bit of the present and the past blended together, but the storyline was far too cliché and unacceptable.

They also discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding a booby-trapped temple known as the Temple of Doom! Thuggee is beginning to attempt to rise once more, believing that with the power of all five Sankara stones they can rule the world! Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl, and conquer the Temple of Doom.Right from the beginning, you'll know that this sequel will be bigger and much grander than the first film. The visuals in here are fantastic, not to mention the action scenes, and the light humor throughout the film! This is surly as entertaining and as good as it's predecessor.Now, I really enjoyed this film. I loved it from beginning to end. In here, you'll find it to be more or less darker and more or less lighter than the original. I don't know what to say about that, though. This is obviously the most disgusting in the trilogy and well, you'll see why when you see the movie.The sidekicks in here are a bit weird. One is an Asian kid, played by Jonathan Ke Quan, who well, doesn't seem to fit in the movie but you won't mind it when he shoots jokes at every scene he's in. The other is played by Kate Capshaw, who also provide a lot of laughs and eye candy.Apart from that, the set pieces in here are bigger and better. The special effects are done really well. When watching this film, don't expect logical sense. There are some scenes that are just random and out of place but just go along with it. Other than that, buy the movie and enjoy the ride!
