That is how I feel about the Empire Strikes back And I haven't a clue how I am going to express myself in less than 1000 words, but by god I will try.These days, it's tough to find a movie sequel that is worth watching. It's the kind of thing that causes critics and casual fans alike to roll their eyes and say Really? Another one?? And it's true, sequels are usually the victims of poor script, less than decent acting and ugly visual effects.But don't lose hope my friends, if you are sick and tired of the sequels of the 21st century, I present to you Star Wars The Empire strikes back (1980), directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Lawrence Kasdan. The sequel to the astronomically (haw) successful film Star Wars (1977).Arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and definitely one of THE best films ever made of the 20th century, TESB surprised and astounded audiences of all ages. Who knew it could get any better than blown up Death Stars and Garbage compactors? To begin, the film is relentlessly suspenseful right off the bat. Not even ten minutes in, and our main heroes are already in a spot of trouble. Something the last film accomplished but not to the same degree. And then, just when we think everyone is back together and all is well, a great snow battle ensues between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. I would say that this is the jist of the plot of the film, but that's taking it way too lightly.What Kershner does so well is he takes the characters that you have grown to love and pits them up against their darkest, most sinister fears. Everyone is broken up, vulnerable, misguided and tortured (mentally and physically). And yet...the film can be quite humorous at times. While it does delve into deep, dark places, it never goes so far that you start to feel depressed with our heroes situation. It is still an extremely fun ride no matter which scene you're watching.One of the most enjoyable aspects of TESB is Frank Oz's incredible puppet Yoda, or rather, his incredible portrayal of Yoda, because at the end of the day, the little green creature is another character in the story. Now when I saw this film when I was younger, I of course believed that Yoda was a real thing. I didn't really know how movies were made back then. Now of course, seeing it through adult eyes, now I know how the film makers operated Yoda and brought him to life, but the whimsy is still there, he still feels completely real in every shot he is in. And I always feel like a kid again whenever he starts talking.The performances in ESB are so much better, no doubt because of the stronger script and stronger direction. Also that these actors have had three whole years to get to know their characters a bit better. Mark Hamill in particular, who may have rushed a few of his lines, or sounded maybe just a pitch too whiny in the previous film, has become such a grown character, not fully grown, but you can see a maturity there that simply didn't exist before. To Hamill's credit, he is also a big reason why we can believe the existence of the non-human characters such as R2-D2 and Master Yoda. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have perfect chemistry and none of their romantic scenes ever felt out of place.And lastly, although I have decided not to spoil anything, I will say that the ending to TESB is so incredibly unique and different to anything we have seen before, and we will never see anything like it again. The group is divided, characters have been injured, they aren't in the best of shape, but what do they do? They move on...they keep their optimism and hope. Their situation is not perfect, but they are able to find a small shimmer of light in the growing shadows. And that's what makes this film so incredibly moving, what a perfect lesson for movie goers of all age demographics. That no matter how hopeless a situation is, somewhere there is an answer.Therefore I give The Empire Strikes back a 10 out of 10. I struggled to find any faults with this movie, and was pleased that I could think of none. So I hope you go out and enjoy it as much as I have, and will continue to do so. May the force be with you!

Alan Alda's Hawkeye Pierce was just too tame and almost a reversal of everything the original Hawkeye stood for but I guess 11 years can do that to a guy. Anyways if you are not too PC and not too easily offended. And want to see a true piece of history. MASH just might be your type of movie. To me it was funnier then Dr. Strangelove and any of the other anti war movies that came out.

To say that it is anything short of great would be an insult. Winning two Oscars and being nominated for four others (including being nominated for best picture), this film truly broke the bounds of what animation can really do and put Disney on the map as a production company not only for kids but for all audiences.The music is fantastic, some of the best I've ever heard. All of the songs succeed in not only being catchy and whimsical but also with developing the plot and furthering the development of both the characters and the story. The songs run through different genres of tune and pitch while still maintaining a central sound and general feel. The characters are also some of Disney's best. Belle will always be my favorite Disney princess, she has too many good qualities to not be. Her character, despite her name being the French word for beauty, isn't focused around her looks entirely, instead focusing more so on her existential feelings of just wanting to find something greater than herself. This along with Paige O'Hara's terrific job as the voice, bringing the character to life and performing excellently in all of her musical numbers. The Beast, voiced by Robby Benson, is wonderful too in his journey that takes him to understand compassion which is done beautifully. Gaston, voiced by Opera singer Richard White, is fantastic as the movie's villain. Normally in any other Disney movie Gaston would play the part of the dashing handsome man who woos the heart of the main heroin, but this movie takes a delightful twist that may be painfully obvious to some, but to me is wonderful nonetheless. The supporting cast is great too. Legends like Jerry Orbach(Lumiere), Angela Lansbury(Mrs. Potts), and David Ogden Stiers(Cogsworth) add their talents to the film and just make it all the more grand.The animation is also so wonderful. The town looks great, the castle looks great, the woods look great, the people, the animals and everything else just looks beautiful and still can manage to take my breath away.Now with all of my seemingly endless praise for the film out of the way I have to address the films one flaw. The one thing holding this film back from being perfect is one thing that I absolutely can't stand. The ending. For those that haven't seen the film please don't read the rest of this review. The ending scene where the beast turns human just could've been done better. If the movie had ended the same way as Shrek (another great movie) and the beast would've stayed a monster, the movie would've been so much stronger. The whole movie is trying to convey a message of beauty isn't skin deep and all that jazz but if this is what they are trying to convey, then why does the beast have to become handsome for there to be a happy ever after? Wasn't the fact that a beautiful young woman could fall in love with a giant hairy monster the driving emphasis behind the whole freaking movie?But in conclusion, this movie is wonderful. I would without a doubt recommend checking it out and seeing for yourself what a great piece of animation this really is.

I recently caught her in 1981's Escape From New York as another reminder of her presence on the Hollywood scene of the era. The thing is, she never really disappeared; her credits continue to the present day, so she has some staying power as they say.Well I always get a kick out of the underlying pseudo-science that goes into these kinds of films. This one had that bit about recombinant DNA structures involving vegetable cells with an animal nucleus. A pretty good way to turn Dr. Alec Holland (Ray Wise) from a pioneering scientist into a walking tree. I read a few 'Swamp Thing' comics back in the day and thought they did a good job here with the creature make-up, but when you get right down to it, Swampy didn't look all that scary, especially when making nice with Alice Cable (Barbeau).You know what that madman Arcane (Louis Jourdan) should have done? Instead of going for some magical fountain of youth formula, how about licensing that chemical concoction that shrunk his henchman Bruno (Nicholas Worth) into a munchkin style midget - the formula shrunk his clothes too! Now that's got significant commercial potential.Now I'm not saying the picture was all bad, but when Arcane turned into that wolf-man looking hairy creature I didn't know whether to laugh or spit. I wonder how many creative writing sessions it took to come up with that thing. The idea behind the green elixir was that it 'made one more of what you already were' so in that sense I guess it worked, but man, he sure looked goofy. By comparison, it almost made Swamp Thing look noble in character, even if everything else about him seemed rather, shall we say, wooden.

Starting out with the original movie, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed. I definitely enjoyed it, but I'm just hoping this isn't the best installment in the series. A New Hope focuses on the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, and its attempt to destroy the Galactic Empire's space station, the Death Star. A farmhand named Luke Skywalker acquires droids that have the architectural plans for the Death Star. The Empire searches for the missing droids, and Luke agrees to help Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to get the plans to the Rebel Alliance and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyrannical rule. The only reason I was slightly disappointed by the movie was because the first 45 minutes or so were just plain boring. The initially slow-moving plot and cornball dialog didn't really impress me much. What kept me watching was the amazing set pieces and cinematography; it really made up for the flaws the beginning of the movie had. The last half of the movie, however, is incredibly entertaining, fun and action-packed. The climax especially was breathtaking and impossible to forget. The imaginative world also makes me excited to watch the rest of the series. There were quite a few flaws with the original Star Wars that disappointed me a bit, but once it gets going, A New Hope is an undeniably fun ride that I wish to take again.

The first ten minutes of the film was the most mesmerizing first ten minutes of film I've ever seen, from the gang fight to the long shot of the droogs in the car to then go the 'Singing in the Rain' sequence, I was blown away by how far Kubrick went to make some of the scenes in this movie as disturbing as possible but yet visually stunning, and that just reflects on Kubrick's genius directing.The fact that a lot of the violent scenes in the film were covered with classical music make it very stylised and sophisticated. The acting was great and casting Malcolm McDowell as Alex was perfect as he suits role fantastically and gives a very haunting but yet charming performance of Alex, so much so that it's one of my favourite movie performances of all time. The violence in the film isn't very graphic but of a psychological violence and the thought of these scenes happening in real life is what makes the violence so effective. Despite the violence in the film there are a number of moments of comedy in the film, McDowell said he thought they were making a black comedy and after watching the movie again recently I can see what he means, the way some of the lines are daredevil, some of the situations in the film and the scene where Alex is eating spaghetti and he thinks the wine is poisoned. To see a film that came out over 40 years ago but still have an impact and effect on people and still timeless and doesn't age is a massive achievement that reflects all on both Kubrick and Anthony Burgess. This is a masterpiece in every aspect of film-making that should be watched by everyone, This is probably in my top 5 of all time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 November 2015","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' tells the story of young Alex Delarge who is an antisocial thug who enjoys going around with his friends beating, raping, stealing and break into people's houses for simple amusement to then be thrown into prison after his gang members turn on him.

And by that, I include all teenagers, not just 17 year olds or older.This movie though, is so extreme, that its not even remotely close to the reality of what its like to be a teenager. First of all, the movie portrays everyone from the ages of thirteen to eighteen as living lifestyles that are pretty much the same. The truth, however, is that people change tremendously throughout their teenage years. I know quite a few people who told me they wouldn't be promiscuous, drink, or party when they got to High School as thirteen or fourteen year olds and then did all that when they got a little bit older.The parties in the movie were truly bizarre as well. There were scenes where preteen kids were smoking joints at a High School party. That makes absolutely no sense, in all my years in High School, I can tell you that nobody invites twelve or eleven year olds to a High School party. Some people don't even want to invite freshmen much less someone who just started Middle School.The screenwriter also seems to be under the impression that any random person can just walk in on a high school party. Real High School parties are very secretive, people don't want their parents, neighbors, or the cops to find out so they go to great lengths to make sure that it looks like nothing is happening. People park their cars in different streets and walk, the doors are locked, windows are shut, sometimes even the music will be turned down if you think someone is coming. In the movie though, a thirteen year old girl is able to simply walk into random orgies happening all over the city. Not only this but is also able to walk around the streets at night, no problem, just another day in these crazy teenagers' lives where no curfew, police, or parents exist.Despite what I've said though, wild stuff still happens. High Schoolers do party, sometimes the parties are unsupervised and when they are, there is often alcohol, there is often grinding, making out, and sex happening, sometimes there are even drugs. There's a lot of stuff my mom doesn't know about that I've done or participated in. As far as the language goes, teenagers do curse a tremendous amount and conversations or jokes about sex are very frequent and graphic. Even Middle School teenagers can surprise you, I saw people do some pretty sexual stuff when I was in 8th grade.So while I do want to point out that you shouldn't have unrealistic expectations of what what we're like and use that to impose restrictions that don't make sense... This movie, is fantasy. Even the parts that are somewhat true, are portrayed incredibly unrealistically and I can't think of one person who acts like the characters in this film. I can't speak for the 1995 teens since youth violence was supposed to be much higher then but as far as physical aggression goes, most High Schoolers rarely if ever fight people, and rape is considered abominable.
