Most fans of the genre of Horror and of the sub-genre of WereWolf movies either love this movie...or hate it.Let me begin by saying that I admire this movie very much. I enjoy watching it, and the two subsequent sequels. In my opinion, after the third Howling, they got stupid, hokey, campy, and just plain bad. Also, let me warn you that this movie is dated, slow, and has large blocks of uneventful moments where even the most base character development is not being utilized.But, with that having been said, the story is a good story. It is poorly executed due to the large slow spots I mentioned before, but the story was a sound and well-written one. Everything does not just magically come together. The reporting team there as moral and emotional support for ace reporter, Karen White (Dee Wallace), is working very hard to put it together. Their discoveries do not come easy, but rather as a result of hard work, open-mindedness, and diligence. Not luck.The cinematography is mostly unremarkable, except for the scene in which Bill is attacked. The filmography is beautiful there, with the moonlight streaming out from behind two great trees, and the scene between is clear and lit by a beautifully brilliant silvery moonlight. Very good stuff.I also loved the use of The Wolf Man, 1941 with Lon Chaney, Jr. as a source for information in their research. This is an instance in which a movie used a real movie to quote, rather than some made-up movie. Wes Craven's use of this element was highly praised in the Scream Trilogy, and yet, here it is, twenty years earlier.This production also features a cameo by Forrest J. Ackerman, movie actor with credits in over 20 B-grade horror flicks, and a very good (if somewhat over the top) supporting performance by John Carradine.Naturally, most fans of the horror genre want to compare this movie to An American Werewolf in London. That is, of course, like comparing apples to submarines in that the former is a B production, with a small budget and the latter is a much larger funded project at exactly TEN times the budget. The Howling had a 17M return from a 1M investment, while AWiL had a 30.5M return from a 10M budget. Let's see...17X the investment\/3.5X the investment. I'd have to say The Howling is the big winner, here, as far as profit goes. I use profit as a measuring stick, because it seems that profit is all Hollywood cares about anymore. Art and artistic expression no longer seems to be the point of film making these days. But for the sake of art, I loved both movies, this one and its competitor. The make up artistry used here was excellent, and actually worthy of the story. That, along with truly professional performances by Dee Wallace and Christopher Stone, make this an enjoyable and memorable film, which I have recently added to my DVD collection.All in all, I consider The Howling to be a benchmark film in the sub-genre of werewolf movies.It rates a hard-won 7.9\/10 from...the Fiend .

Kilmer, himself, fancies himself a hunter, (in fact, he killed a lion earlier in the movie with just one shot) but I got the impression right from the first time that they met that Kilmer knew what Douglas was all about and let him call all the shots.The one thing I did not understand was why Douglas got top billing in this film.  He did not enter the picture for almost the first hour of it and then, the story still seemed to focus on Kilmer's character and his problems.As far as theatrical value goes, this is an excellent movie!  The characters meshed with each other in a way that kept you in the story.  And even though you might not have understood why things were done the way they were, the plot seemed, somehow, to find a way to explain it to the viewer.  It took a while for me to get over Kilmer with an English accent, but, once I got past that (in the first ten minutes, or so), I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed. Most action movies don't necessarily have to have strong plot points, but I think that Raiders did an excellent job at mixing together the right elements with the story and sustaining great flow for the physical scenes.What do you mean you haven't seen the movie? It's a classic! Here's a brief Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist who is hired by the US Govt to search for the Ark of the Covenant. He's not the only one who's looking for it, though, as Nazi Germans are also trying to track it down. Eventually, Indy will have to come face to face with the Nazi's to uncover the secret of the Ark. In between, there's chasing, flying, jumping, fights, and even a little love.Taking off old cliffhanger movies from the 1940's serials, it's difficult to pick a favorite scene! Was it the sword-wielding man in Cairo? (and Indy just 'shoots him'!) The boulder scene with all the traps? The chase scene with the Nazi's at the end?  There were many rip-off's and copy cats after this movie came out, and most of them were rubbish (a few were good, but i can't think of any!). It established Ford as an action\/thriller actor, Spielberg was a household name, and the following sequels weren't bad either! The movie remains watchable, and re-watchable, years and years later.

While you shouldn't argue that this isn't Spielberg's best directed film, it certainly stacks up as one of his most action packed. Most action movies don't necessarily have to have strong plot points, but I think that Raiders did an excellent job at mixing together the right elements with the story and sustaining great flow for the physical scenes.What do you mean you haven't seen the movie? It's a classic! Here's a brief Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist who is hired by the US Govt to search for the Ark of the Covenant. He's not the only one who's looking for it, though, as Nazi Germans are also trying to track it down. Eventually, Indy will have to come face to face with the Nazi's to uncover the secret of the Ark. In between, there's chasing, flying, jumping, fights, and even a little love.Taking off old cliffhanger movies from the 1940's serials, it's difficult to pick a favorite scene! Was it the sword-wielding man in Cairo? (and Indy just 'shoots him'!) The boulder scene with all the traps? The chase scene with the Nazi's at the end?  There were many rip-off's and copy cats after this movie came out, and most of them were rubbish (a few were good, but i can't think of any!). It established Ford as an action\/thriller actor, Spielberg was a household name, and the following sequels weren't bad either! The movie remains watchable, and re-watchable, years and years later. Going to see the movie again? Go out of your way to get the new DVD set.

Robert Conrad and Ross Martin played James West and technical\/scientific genius Artemus Gordon. They were both excellent actors who had great rapport with each other. And the stories were fun and exciting.But Jesus, this movie, seems we can't dog this dog enough. The casting of the main characters is okay Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon, and I can slightly accept Will Smith as Jim West. Although a black guy doing the work he is doing, during the tail-end of slavery, is hardly believable, suspension of disbelief would have been easier without the friggin' asinine story and the infantile dialogue. For some strange reason, their characters were adversarial and foolish, and not those who are to guard a United States President. Every actor here was misused and Barry Sonnenfeld should have known better!Kenneth Branagh is a bad guy with a thick southern drawl and no legs, WHY? Kline and Smith in drag, WHY? A prolonged, double-entendre', sitcom-like conversation about fake boobs, WHY? A racist\/cripple exchange between Branagh and Smith,*rather than a gentlemanly but tense chat!* WHY?? Salma Hayek's ass crack, WHY??? A giant mechanical spider, WHY?? The Fresh Prince in a Western, WHY????Seriously, if there ever was a modern day western to see, then watch the TV show, Shanghai Noon, or The Quick and The Dead. WWW may warrant a look for it's excellent special effects, notably a well-crafted chase scene involving flying buzzsaw discs (but topped considerably by a similar chase scene with Dash from The Incredibles). However, to sit through this entire film, you'd have to be a fly that likes horse crap.
