His epic saga is the ultimate tale of Good against Evil-- pure in every sense--  and with the fifth installment, `Star Wars  Episode II, Attack of the Clones,' Lucas carefully inserts more of the integral pieces into that puzzle, leading us ever closer to the full and complete picture that will be revealed in Episode III, the sixth and final chapter that will at last bring the story full circle.\tIt has been ten years since the events depicted in `Star Wars  Episode I, The Phantom Menace' unfolded, and the ramifications of galactic politics has brought the galaxy to the brink of war; the life of Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman)-- now a member of the Senate-- has been threatened, and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), have been called upon to protect her.  Not an easy task, however, as the dark side of the force has grown in strength, clouding the future to such an extent that not even Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) can discern what may be in the offing.  Jedi Council Leader Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) is concerned with the threat of the impending war and the possible outcome, for he realizes that the Jedi, though strong, are too few; they are the peace keepers of the galaxy, but there is simply not enough of them to fight a war.  But the one who is perhaps the most troubled of all is Anakin Skywalker, who in his zeal to cling to his autonomy is beginning to feel the pull of the dark side, that part of the force that will eventually seduce him, and to which he will ultimately dedicate himself.  And when it happens, it will drastically affect not only Anakin, but Obi-Wan, as well; and most especially, the young woman with whom Anakin has been in love since the first day they met, Padme Amidala.\tGeorge Lucas is a visionary filmmaker; he is to film what Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and J.R.R. Tolkien are to literature, with a touch of Aesop and The Brothers Grimm thrown in as well.  If you take a step back, pause and reflect upon what Lucas has done, it's awe-inspiring.  Not only did `Star Wars' spring from his fertile imagination, but he managed to translate it all vividly to the screen, with all of the myriad plot twists and turns, characters and intricacies, in a cohesive, accessible way that makes it riveting entertainment that has been embraced by audiences around the world and from one generation to the next.  And with `Episode II,' he does not merely give you more of the same-- the forte of most sequels, especially beyond a second installment-- but develops the story and characters with meticulous detail that takes you one step closer to that moment when all is revealed and the final link is established, tying it all together. \tBeginning with the original, and right on through the (now) five films, Lucas demonstrates what a master craftsman he is, delivering an engrossing story that is visually astounding, as well.  And throughout the series, he maintains a continuity and consistency in the presentation; in the storyline, the way it is acted and the overall `look' of the finished product, and with a pace that it always perfectly attuned to the moment-- accelerated for the heart-pounding action sequences, more deliberate when needed, to effect the personal drama that lies at the core of the story.  In the final analysis, George Lucas is one of the few artists to whom the title `filmmaker,' in the absolute purest and truest sense, can be attributed.  He is a brilliant storyteller; a genius who has perfected and advanced his chosen medium perhaps more than anyone else before or since.  And, inexplicably-- like Chaplin and Welles during their respective lifetimes-- Lucas has never been truly or properly recognized for his many accomplishments; recognition that is deserved and overdue.  It's time to stand up and acknowledge him as the gifted artist he is.\tIn his second outing as Obi-Wan, Ewan McGregor continues to amaze.  Creating the younger version of the character already established so indelibly by Alec Guinness-- and making him convincing-- had to be a tremendous challenge; and McGregor comes through with banners raised high.  He does not merely imitate, but truly captures the essence of the character established by Guinness, almost as if channeling Guinness' spirit through his performance.  He has the mannerisms, the speech patterns, expressions and body language, all of which leads to a seamless transition from McGregor to Guinness in Episode IV.  And it's all done in a subtle, unassuming and quite natural way by McGregor, which makes his Obi-Wan believable and real.  It's a studied, discriminating portrayal, and a real accomplishment for this talented young actor.\tAnother of the strengths of the film is the performance by Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.  Knowing that the engaging young Anakin will one day become the evil Darth Vader, it is pivotal that the actor playing the role at this stage of the character's development is able to capture and convey what it is in his personality-- and deeper, in his heart-- that allows him to be turned to the dark side.  And that is exactly what Christensen accomplishes with his portrayal.  Perfectly cast, he is believably the older version of the character created by Jake Lloyd in Episode I, and most importantly, he displays the dark, inner rumblings and angst that will ultimately be his undoing.  Finally, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman makes the inevitable romance viable, and `Attack of the Clones,' another triumph for George Lucas.

I personally hated the other too but this one pleasantly surprised me. The script is loaded with some great pokes against the horror genre and the movie business in Hollywood as a whole-I'm sick of being 35 playing a 21 year old, which certainly sums up one of my movie-pet hates.Also, there were actually some genuine chills in this one. These were primarily provided in the form of Sydney's mother's ghost (outside the window and underneath the blood stained sheet), which proved a refreshing change from the slasher action in the rest of the movie. Carrie Fisher also makes a hilarious cameo in the film. This movie also highlights the complete pointlessness of Scream 2 (which might as well have been called Scream 2 Billy's Mum Gets Even!) In fact, you could go straight from Scream to Scream 3 and not really miss anything.However, there were also some terrible, terrible things about this film. Firstly, all those needless supporting characters that seemed to be there solely to bloody the killer's knife. Secondly, the (characteristic of a Scream movie) woefully weak ending. With all the bloody unmasking that goes on, you'd swear you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo- And I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for you pesky kids!(-coincidence that two of the Scream actors have gone on to star in the forthcoming Scooby Doo movie?) What follows the customary killing-of-the-killer-then-killing-him-again scene is a sort of epilogue, with symbolism as subtle as a sledgehammer (Sydney opening the gates). Weak, weak, weak.Thirdly, there were a mishmash of setpieces that were no more than blatantly reworked scenes from the other two movies somebody trapped with the killer behind a soundproof screen, one of the characters getting &#145;killed' then reappearing, unharmed, transpiring to be the killer. Fourthly, the reappearance of Randy- don't get me wrong, I really liked his character, but that whole video thing was just waaaay too contrived for me. It's as if Craven was so obsessed with killing off as many people as possible in the second film, that by the time he made the third one it was a case of whoops, I've already killed off the character who recites the rules in every film, now how do I bring him back?

The tale opens when Fenton Meiks Matthew McConaughey walks into the Dallas FBI office to tell the story of the 1970's era killings.  Agent Wesley Doyle Powers Boothe listens as the story unfolds.  Flashback some 30 years to the Meiks family; Fenton, younger brother Adam and Dad Matthew O'Leary, Jeremy Sumpter and Bill Paxton, respectively live a `Leave It To Beaver' life.  The family unit is honest, hardworking, caring and reverent. Fenton cooks dinner and Dad helps the boys with homework; Mom has died some years ago.  One evening Dad has a vision where angels direct him to kill demons. Tools of the trade and designated demons are made know to him.  The father easily influences Adam, but Fenton is not so quickly engaged; none the less, the brothers are bonded by murder.  The story that follows closes the loop between Fenton the younger and the man being interviewed by the FBI.Frailty is a dark, blood curdling yarn with strong style similarities to Momento, the 2001 mind twister.  This story is grounded in considerable religious doctrine; whereas, Momento relied upon a psychological theme. This is one of those movies that, as the end approaches, you wish you'd paid more attention at the beginning.  Enough said.  The movie is being compared to the likes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974 and that's misleading. Frailty is much more about the darker side of parent \/ child relationships and how kids do \/ do not react to an errant parent.  The film also helps explain why Texans as a culture subscribe to the death penalty.Frailty is actor Paxton' debut as a director and he makes the cut. Paxton, the director, appropriately typecasts himself in a lead role as the multifaceted father under the influence.  The sweet spot in the movie is the young actors, Matthew O'Leary and Jeremy Sumpter, who play the juvenile Meiks brothers.  O'Leary in particular is perfect as the defiant but scared teen who is torn between parental dedication and `doing the right thing'.

Of course there are some works of art that have hyped themselves to being the in thing to see in order to prove your intelligence.  But I don't believe 2001 is one of those.  For me the message is simple man will never completely understand his destiny, and, especially, man will never completely understand the universe.  There are other great images and metaphors in the film.  For most of the film we see people as astronauts living in a technical, cold, sterile environment. Then, HAL, the super-computer with artificial intelligence (a very advanced concept for 1968) suffers a nervous breakdown.  Then there is a battle of wits between HAL and Dave who must shut down HAL's higher functions.  Is this a metaphor for the struggle we face now and in the future to preserve our humanity in spite of attempts to control our lives through technology? Whatever the answer is, I enjoy watching this film on DVD with as big a TV as possible and lots of high quality sound.
