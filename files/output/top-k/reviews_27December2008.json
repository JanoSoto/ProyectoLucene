[{"date":"27 December 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" R&B is not the sort of film I usually enjoy to watch...however, I have to admit that I kinda liked this movie. It has its ups and its downs but in the end, it was simply done for a few laughs.First the positives. Jason Alexander plays the role of Boris in such an exaggerated manner that its hilarious watching him act. He reminds me of that Russian voice you hear in Vodka commercials, only he's more retarded.De Niro does a surprisingly small role as the fearless leader. I guess we've seen him in so many serious films that we are not used to this level of mediocre acting from him. Nevertheless, he ends up being OK in the movie, not really getting in the way.Of course, there is the ever so awesome flying squirrel Rocky. He was always the best part of the show and even in this film coming off as a 3d character, he's still as furry and as lovable as in the original cartoon.Finally, a story line ripped of Roger Rabbit and a narrator which interacts with the characters bring a small smile from the audience. That smile however, is a result from the over retardness of this movie. I guess that was the biggest flaw in the film, it made so many bad jokes and had so many predictable gags that the retardness just got blown out of proportion.WAIT! NO! I take it back! the retardness was not the biggest flaw, i'll tell you what the biggest flaw in the movie (and the cartoon for that matter) is BULLWINKLE.He is the most annoying, not funny, not cute, ugly, dumb, clueless character in the HISTORY of cartoons. His voice makes you want to hang a puppy and he is useless when it comes to solving problems.If they would have killed him at the start of the movie, it would have been a good movie, instead, its a mediocre movie.Drop dead you LSD addict moose.5\/10P.S. I know retardness is not an actual word but there is simply no other adjective to describe this movie.

Critters is one of these examples. Critters is not only good, but exceptionally amazing when you would not be expecting that from such a film. The movie is excellently played out with amazing aspects and attributes that make it a fun, instantly enjoyable and totally rewatchable gem that I am glad to say I have enjoyed for many years and will enjoy for many years to come.The performances, while some are questionably mediocre, are all very likable and pertain to the film quite well. The main lead, whose name escapes me, did a very good job in this and the sequel, as did Dee Wallace who was a great horror star of the 80s, and the cameo by a young Billy Zane is just as enjoyable as all the other performances. The story, while could be greatly criticized by many people, I thought was stupendous. The critters look fabulous and are very threatening and cool, while at the same time as being laughable and cute, yes, I said cute. Their qualities give them a sudden likability, even though they are the villains, and the bounty hunters, while probably my least favorite thing about the movie, pass the time and fill some space well.It is very entertaining in the utmost sense with some nice kills, thrills and well, not really any chills, but I have nothing else that rhymes. While it is not a masterpiece, I greatly enjoy it as one of my all time favorite B-movies and honorably own it and it's two following sequels. I suggest, if you can handle it for what it is, you watch it right away if you have not, because it is highly lovable, in my honest opinion.
