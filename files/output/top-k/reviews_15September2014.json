This timeless film is one of the best sequels, which equals, if not, surpasses the original film. Part two continues the story of the mafia family, the Corleone's. Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino has come into his own as the new Godfather with the passing of his father Vito Corleone at the end of part one. Marlon Brando played Vito Corleone, in his older years, portrayed in part one. In this film Robert De Niro plays the younger version, shown through flashbacks, of Vito. The beauty of this film is in the flashbacks. The flashbacks give the audience the full back-story of how young Vito became the Godfather and how the Corleone family became one of the most influential and feared mafia families in America.Unlike, the film Goodfellas, also starring De Niro, a great film in it's own right, this film shows how Michael uses calculated decisions in business to handle conflict. In Goodfellas the main characters tend to fly from the hip and the theme is based more on the friendship of the main characters and how corruption tears their friendship apart. Part II of the Godfather's theme is about a young man that never wanted to be apart of the family business but out of necessity he was thrust into being the Godfather. Michael struggles in this film, because I think he's ultimate goal is to make the family legitimate. The character Michael is very intelligent and sinister; he will do anything to keep his family safe. This makes Michael very relatable to the audience, as most men have that same desire to provide and protect their family. Pacino's portrayal of Michael is nothing less than brilliant. Throughout the film you have flashbacks of young Vito that correspond with the same conflicts facing Michael in current time that provide a highly specialized mood. Coppola's genius becomes apparent, as the audience is privy to this cycle of corruption and danger that this lifestyle brings. What makes this so compelling is how the same conflicts arise, but are handled differently due to the changes in society. The way Coppola cuts the scenes in to the flashbacks are flawless and makes the story flow in a very unique way. The film uses an objective camera placement throughout much of the film. The use of this technique, in my opinion, was used to make the audience feel as if they were watching the plot unfold as a spectator, because the audience isn't a member of the Corleone family. The respect and secrecy of the family business requires Michael to keep things within the family. The scene when Michael tells his older brother Fredo, to never speak outside the family again reinforces this key element to the plot. The cinematographer used an array of angles, but the most significant angles come from the mid-to extreme close-up shots of Michal and Vito. The audience can see and almost feel the emotion in the faces of these two characters. In fact, most of the flashback scenes end and begin with a mid-to extreme close-up of these two characters. Wardrobe and music in this film must be mentioned as well, as both won Oscars in their respective categories. The costume design used in this film was excellent and portrayed a very realistic sense of the time period being told. Each character had a specific wardrobe that fit the year, scene, and the overall plot seamlessly. The music in the film is extraordinary as well, providing chilling and exciting effect in key moments throughout the film. The score of this film rates very high amongst other films. The theme of family, the need to provide and keep them safe, and the desire to elevate your status is relatable to a vast audience; this is why this film is timeless.

It's a perfectly charming and sweet 80's comedy that pairs up two of the greatest comic stars from that generation John Candy and Dan Akyroyd. The premise is simple and rather well-treaded, but there is nothing like a movie that spends time outdoors and persuades others to do the same.Howard Deutsch's film is about a family man named Chet who is going away for a vacation in the woods with his family. However, Chet's step-brother, Roman decides to surprise him and when he does, it's time for chaos to run amok.John Candy and Dan Aykroyd are comedy legends and this film shows why. They don't have to star in perfect, career-defining films (though they do) in order to make their audience laugh. They showed enough chemistry with each other to ensure that everyone is having a good time. They're rather likable though they both show split personalities.Overall, this is a solid comedy and one that is a nice addition to both of their resumes. The movie is obviously played safe, but there are some big laughs to be had. My favorite scenes involved Chet and his encounters with the big, bad bear. I also loved the raccoons and their subtitled chitter. This is the old-fashioned comedy that is rare to see nowadays. I rate this film 9\/10.

The story revolves around a group of teenagers in Southern California (where the film was shot). Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) is a geeky student with a jock best friend who looks out for him (John Stockwell), especially when he's picked-on at school. After Arnie buys a beat-up '58 Plymouth Fury and fixes it up he slowly starts to change. At first, the changes are good as he starts dating the new cute girl at school (Alexandra Paul), but things take a dark turn when Arnie goes after his abusers.As with most King movies the story takes place in a small town and there's a comic book air to the proceedings and, of course, something supernatural and dark. This is a great teenager\/school movie as the social dynamics ring true with slight exaggerations. William Ostrander stands out as Arnie's hoodlum nemesis at school, Buddy. Ostrander resembles a young John Travolta and would've been perfect to play Wolverine (in the 80s and early 90s anyway).Memorable scenes abound highlighted by Christine's stunning attack on the hoodlums at a gas station, the ensuing chase and Christine's supernatural restoration. Stockwell's great as Arnie's best friend and Gordon is excellent as the protagonist turned antagonist. What I mean by that is that the viewer's sympathy is with Arnie in the first act and we celebrate with him in the second act as Christine (the car) gives him the push into cool-ness he needed, not to mention the gonads to stand up for himself.

Ostrander resembles a young John Travolta and would've been perfect to play Wolverine (in the 80s and early 90s anyway).Memorable scenes abound highlighted by Christine's stunning attack on the hoodlums at a gas station, the ensuing chase and Christine's supernatural restoration. Stockwell's great as Arnie's best friend and Gordon is excellent as the protagonist turned antagonist. What I mean by that is that the viewer's sympathy is with Arnie in the first act and we celebrate with him in the second act as Christine (the car) gives him the push into cool-ness he needed, not to mention the gonads to stand up for himself. But Christine's malevolence takes over in the last act and, well, you know.Christine ranks well with best teenager\/youth films, horror-tinged or otherwise, like The Rage Carrie 2 and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.The film runs 110 minutes.GRADE A- ","genre":"Action, Drama, Horror"},{"date":"15 September 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I can't do better with this review than others have done, and I wholeheartedly agree with everything they have said.

I was familiar with it, but what I did not know that there was a live-action movie. The movie is great, it is so cool and the theme song is so catchy. I knew that in the cartoon the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man was a nice guy with a dopey voice, but in the movie, he was a terrifying monster! My brother and I enjoyed Slimer as well. Just look at that big fat green blob of slime (inspired by Bluto from Animal House). I always wanted to see the movie as a kid (despite the fact that I saw the cartoon and clips from the cartoon Muppet Babies), but my parents wouldn't let me due to the creepy nature of it. I saw it on TV a few times whether it was on Bravo, Esquire, or VH-1. Finally I saw it on the big screen recently and it was like the time I took a time machine and went back to the 1980's! 1984 to be specific. Kind of like the time I saw the original King Kong at an old art house theater, was like going back in the 1930's. Specifically 1933. Speaking of which, there were a lot of scenes that paid homage to King Kong. For instance, the giant temple with gate that opened with Gozor in it, looked like the gate with Ann Darrow being sacrificed before Kong's arrival. The Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man climbing up the building and getting destroyed at the end was like the climax in the old 30's horror film. Apart from the films theme song, there was another cool song that screamed 80's, Saving the Day by Alessi. When my brother and I were very little, the cartoon was as popular as the movie. We had this coloring book called People in your Neighborhood (not related to Sesame Street), and there was this page that showed firemen fighting fires with hoses shooting water. I went haywire coloring it all up and my brother said that looked like Ghostbusters, so we ended up turning their hoses to zappers that shoot electricity we drew a ghost in it and he is loosing. My dad had a friend named Bob and he came to visit us when we were little and my brother called him Peter Venkman because he looked like the one in the cartoon than the film. OK, childhood memories aside, as for the special effects, they changed a lot over the past 30 years. I have been watching a lot of movies with special effects that used a ton of CGI such as those super hero movies and monsters such as The 2014 Godzilla, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Transformers Age of Extinction, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Guardians of the Galaxy and Michael Bay's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. People these days are wondering that if we are spoiling ourselves with a ton of CGI. Are we getting tired of it and do we miss practical effects? Seeing the Terror Dogs growl and leap made me think about it. Fortunately, J.J. Abrams is making Star Wars Episode Seven and he will use CGI and practical effects marry in this movie. James Rolfe of Angry Video Game Nerd fame made movie based on his web series and he used practical effect like those seen in old Japanese monster movies like the original Godzilla. Jurassic World, which is coming out next year, is said to have practical effects with the help of CGI. Bottom line this is a great movie! I highly recommend it. Followed by an animated series and a sequel. Rated PG for violence, profanity, peril and a ton of scary scenes.

However, while I do agree that it is not perfect, I still think that it is a ball of disaster movie fun.Good What makes this work the most is the cast. I really do like the cast in this movie as they provide a lot of funny banter and chemistry between each other. Plus, aside from Paxton and Hunt, you get supporting characters in Elwes, Seymour Hoffman,and Alan Ruck. I also really liked that it is a big budget disaster movie and it doesn't involve any big cities or landmarks getting destroyed. Just focused on farms and small towns. De Bont directs this movie with a lot of energy with great sweeping shots of fields and towns and a lot of great camera angles. The effects and destruction are still top notch here also.Bad Like most disaster movies, there is plenty of logical holes in this movie where these characters escape death nearly every moment in this movie. Also, there is some dialogue that feels like just filler or just dumb.Overall, in terms of disaster movies, it is one of the better ones out there with some great action and funny characters.

The Mothman Prophecies is about a reporter that is drawn to a small West Virginia town to investigate a series of strange events, including psychic visions and the appearance of bizarre entities. The movie has a whole eerie feeling to it and one of the main reasons that makes it so eerie is because it is apparently based on actual events. I especially found the sub- plot of John and Mary Klein's relationship to be sad, an example of this is where Richard Gere's character, John Klein, said in the aftermath of his wife's death played by Debra Messing, Two weeks ago, we were house hunting. One day you're just driving along in your car, and the universe just points at you and says, Ah, there you are, a happy couple. I've been looking for you. I've been looking for you., I really found this to be an incredibly moving sentiment, does this mean that the universe has plans for us and that there is no hiding place from destiny no matter how happy we are?
