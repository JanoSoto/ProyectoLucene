We also get to see X's private life away from the camera's, from the influence Baines (Albert Hall) had on him to the life he lived with his wife Betty (Angela Basset).I was already familiar with Spike Lee's work before this film, but this is the movie that turned me into a Denzel Washington fan.  Before I saw this, I brushed him off as another star gliding by on his looks - not because of his choice of roles or anything, but because I had never seen him in any films and tend to be skeptical about everything.  When I saw this, I realized what a powerful presence he has.  The glimpse we get of Malcolm X's transformation has Washington virtually portraying three completely different people.  The scene where he breaks down when he meets Elijah Muhammad for the first time is one of the most powerful moments on film.  I suppose the soundtrack helped that scene, but both Washington and Freeman Jr. were breathtaking there.Basset was great, but she always is.  Not to diminish her talent, but to be honest, I haven't seen her give a merely average performance yet, much less a poor one.  So, I wasn't expecting any less of her.  Lee was very unbiased in his portrayal of X, showing the audience how angry he was, and how when he first converted to Islam, he didn't do it because of religion - he did it almost as a means of channeling his anger.  I also like how Lee shows him eating with white Muslims in Mecca at the end.  Some of my family adhere to the Nation of Islam, and they seem to forget that Malcolm quit hating white people near the end of his life.  It is just too bad that his life was ended by other black nationalists.  In Islam we have something called maktoub - you cannot escape fate.  So, I suppose he was meant to go down for taking a stand.  Very sad, yes, but out of all the ways to die, it's probably the most honorable.Both Lee and Washington were amazing here.  I used to keep up to date with Oscar nominations (until films like Titanic and Saving Private Ryan started sweeping the awards - they were good, but not the best), and out of the 1991-2000 decade, Washington's nomination for Best Male Actor was probably the biggest snub.

Kubrick paints a dark and moving picture of life in boot camp, and just what it's like to live the intense life of a Vietnam soldier. Everything is incredibly done The casting, the action, the drama, and the realism. But if there's one thing that makes Full Metal Jacket a great film, it's the intensity. This is the kind of film that makes you stop breathing a bunch of times, anxiously waiting to see what will happen. This is so mainly because of the large absence of music, bringing more heart stopping twists and surprises to thrill viewers. Put shortly, this has to be, without one single little doubt, one of the greatest films (war or regular) of all time.SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Full Metal Jacket's plot revolves around boot camp patrons such as J.T. `Joker' Davis (Matthew Modine), Leonard `Gomer Pyle' Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), and Private Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard) as they go through the living hell of boot camp, led by the fiery Sgt. Hartman (real-life boot camp instructor R. Lee Ermey). Hartman spares no mercy for any of the recruits, but he mostly takes his ferocity and vulgar out on Lawrence because of his struggles and his weight. Things keep getting worse for him, and he gets into more and more trouble with Hartman. However, with the help of Joker, Gomer improves his skills and earns more respect from their explosive trainer. But after all of the recruits have graduated and have been assigned, Joker finds Gomer sitting in the bathroom loading a rifle magazine late at night, even though they're not allowed in there. He has become darker in personality during the training course, and when Hartman comes in and orders Lawrence to drop the rifle, he shoots him and himself.After boot camp, the movie then focuses on Joker as he starts his tenure in the Vietnam War as a reporter. Joker is sent with other troops such as `Animal Mother' (Adam Baldwin) and Pvt. Eightball (Dorian Harewood) on brutal and heart-pounding missions in Vietnam, including one where he and a small band of troops seek a dangerous sniper amidst a bombed and rubble-laden city. It's scenes like these that leave a lasting impression on you, and when the movie ends you'll be thinking, `Wow. That just blew my mind.' The hilarious and scathing dialogue is some of the best you'll ever hear when it comes to movies.  For example (please excuse some of the language)Hartman `How tall are you private?'  Private Cowboy `Sir, five-foot-nine, sir!' Hartman `Five-foot-nine? I didn't know they stacked s*** that high.'Hartman `Were you born worthless, or did you have to work at it?'Joker `Leonard, if Hartman finds us here we'll be in a world of s***.'Gomer `I am in a world of s***.'Hartman `What's your name fat-body?' Gomer `Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir!'  Hartman `Lawrence? Lawrence what? Of Arabia?'What more is there to say? Why, Stanley Kubrick deserved every shred of appraisal he received for this incredible masterpiece. Like in most of his films, there are no clichés, predictable outcomes, or likely story lines. It's a different kind of war movie, and it shines like a thousand diamonds. It just has to be seen to be believed. Hopefully by now I have implied a sense that this film kicks butt. Even though Apocalypse Now is currently the best war movie in my book, this still has to be considered a contender for that title. So go ahead and give it a whirl.

The third installment in the Austin Powers series accomplishes little more than proving that the first sequel was not the full depth to which the series planned on sinking. The second movie fed completely off of the success and original comedy of the first movie, recycling the same jokes and trying vainly to get people to laugh at the same things, with a few new tasteless and downright bad jokes thrown in between. MiniMe and Fat Bastard (who, combined, provided about 20 seconds of amusement in the first sequel) are both back here and neither provides anything new or even anything amusing.There are sporadic moments in the film that are funny (even two scenes that made me laugh out loud), but they are so hidden in a slog of garbage that they are not worth the rest of the movie, and they're both only briefly funny anyway. There is a scene where Dr. Evil gets hit in the groin by a swinging object and screams out what you can find in the summary line of this review and, even better, Austin has a touching and lengthy flashback remembering his flaky father and how he was never there for him to see his accomplishments, and when he comes out of the memory and we see his emotion-stricken face, Dr. Evil (locked up in a glass cage like Dr. Lecter) says, 'Oh, boo-frickety-hoo!'That's funny, isn't it? Well, I laughed at it. But then you have to deal with the rest of the movie. The old scene with Dr. Evil and his son Scott arguing at the table is brought back from the dead, this time so overdone and so tired that it literally dissolves to the point where Dr. Evil is simply grunting and groaning and making strange noises, which I assume are meant to be funny. They're not. If you haven't, in fact, gotten to the point where you're raising your eyebrows and looking around at the people next to you to see if they're as mystified as you are about how this has gotten so bad, you definitely will here.Beyoncé Knowles plays the part of Foxxy Cleopatra, coming off as one of the most nerve-gratingly aggravating characters ever to set foot in this doomed series, and vainly trying to fill the tiny shoes of Heather Graham from the first sequel, who provided probably the first thoroughly boring character in the Austin Powers movies. Her wooden acting and total incongruity to the character she was playing made me think that they would have simply taken out the heroine completely for any third movie that they might be greedy enough to make, but instead they throw in the exact same thing. Both are characters put into the movies for no other reason than to have a popular face playing a tasteless character in an Austin Powers film.I think that the trilogy is such a common occurrence in movies that it's safe to say that this will be the last installment made in the Austin Powers series, but I think it's also worth mentioning that this is the first time I have ever made a specific effort to hypothesize about whether or not they will ever bombard us with another crapfest from a series of movies that is so obviously dead and gone (and I'm still terrified that someone is going to come up with the fool idea that they should make a third Scary Movie - I could stand about 25 more Austin Powers' movies before another one of those). The second movie should never have been made in the first place, and the third one is more than overkill.And by the way, I saw this movie at Leicester Square in London when I was in England doing a study abroad program through the University of California, Davis, studying Shakespeare in the summer of 2002. PLEASE believe that you have not the slightest idea of what I missed out on when I went to see this movie.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"14 February 2003","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Just in case you missed it in the last movie, the Austin Powers series has completely fallen off a cliff. The third installment in the Austin Powers series accomplishes little more than proving that the first sequel was not the full depth to which the series planned on sinking. The second movie fed completely off of the success and original comedy of the first movie, recycling the same jokes and trying vainly to get people to laugh at the same things, with a few new tasteless and downright bad jokes thrown in between. MiniMe and Fat Bastard (who, combined, provided about 20 seconds of amusement in the first sequel) are both back here and neither provides anything new or even anything amusing.There are sporadic moments in the film that are funny (even two scenes that made me laugh out loud), but they are so hidden in a slog of garbage that they are not worth the rest of the movie, and they're both only briefly funny anyway. There is a scene where Dr. Evil gets hit in the groin by a swinging object and screams out what you can find in the summary line of this review and, even better, Austin has a touching and lengthy flashback remembering his flaky father and how he was never there for him to see his accomplishments, and when he comes out of the memory and we see his emotion-stricken face, Dr. Evil (locked up in a glass cage like Dr. Lecter) says, 'Oh, boo-frickety-hoo!'That's funny, isn't it? Well, I laughed at it. But then you have to deal with the rest of the movie. The old scene with Dr. Evil and his son Scott arguing at the table is brought back from the dead, this time so overdone and so tired that it literally dissolves to the point where Dr. Evil is simply grunting and groaning and making strange noises, which I assume are meant to be funny. They're not. If you haven't, in fact, gotten to the point where you're raising your eyebrows and looking around at the people next to you to see if they're as mystified as you are about how this has gotten so bad, you definitely will here.Beyoncé Knowles plays the part of Foxxy Cleopatra, coming off as one of the most nerve-gratingly aggravating characters ever to set foot in this doomed series, and vainly trying to fill the tiny shoes of Heather Graham from the first sequel, who provided probably the first thoroughly boring character in the Austin Powers movies.

The story leaves much to be desired; it relies too much on coincidence, has an overly-simplistic `war is bad' message, and plays up its melodramatic aspects once too often. Nevertheless, it remains entertaining due to William Wellman's talent as a director and the genuinely exciting action scenes that interrupt the preachy tone with a much-needed jolt of energy.This was the first movie to win the Best Picture Oscar, which is a perfectly appropriate place for it in history when you consider the kind of film that the Academy usually rewards with its top prize something made on a big budget that can draw in a large audience and has just barely enough quality that critics can manage a thumbs up. It also had '20's superstar Clara Bow leading the cast, which gave it more than sufficient star power. Some of the people who worked on the film went on to do better things director William Wellman improved during the sound era with The Public Enemy, the original version of A Star is Born, and the American classic The Ox-Bow Incident, and up-and-coming actor Gary Cooper, in one of his first credited performances, would go on to win a pair of Oscars himself.So is `Wings' an integral part of silent cinema? No; in fact, it even pales when placed next to silent epics like Gance's `Napoleon,' Griffith's `Intolerance,' or anything by Eisenstein. But perhaps that's setting the bar a little high; the silent era had its share of the good, the bad, and the downright ugly, just like movies today, and `Wings' remains likeable enough, perhaps because it is made with all the spirit of something by Gance, Griffith, or Eisenstein, albeit not with the same skill.

I have watched the movie three times.  Initially, after the first two movies, my wife and I thought this movie was garbage (2.5 out of 10).  Now, after watching it a third time and listening to your comments, I have revised my rating to a whopping 6 out of 10.  I will not repeat much here but did anyone else notice that when Reeves drove up to Sara's digs in the Mercedes and turned the ignition off and doused the lights that one fog light remained lit -- very weird!Basically, I love Theron -- like someone else said, I would have a hard time saying no to any request she made but then again, I am not Nelson, the hard driven ad exec - come on, this movie is out in left field.  Reeves is bad, but I thought he was not terrible - he did try hard.  The plot was just too much Hollywood crap for me but I did like the originality, I loved sound track, and since I live near SF, I loved the location.  The ending was made on MARS, I think.

Yes there are a few alterations, but it's a vaguely similar plot with Tommy Lee Jones trying to find the person on the run&#133; again. But despite these similarities, Double Jeopardy is an above average (if not predictable) cat-and-mouse thriller.The lead role goes to Ashley Judd who plays a woman trying to find her son after being imprisoned for six years, though she didn't seem to age at all, and find her husband who framed her. Judd gives her breakthrough performance and is quite convincing aswell. She got the role when a pregnant Jodie Foster pulled out (who would have delivered the role with equal oomph). Tommy Lee Jones plays the parole officer\/policeman trying to track her down (does that not seem a tad familiar). He's standard for the part but didn't exactly jump off the screen. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat up until the end, but after watching it you'll probably instantly forget it. There's nothing really wrong with the film, but it's just not very memorable.

It was HUGE--a true blockbuster. Lines formed around the block and people kept seeing it again and again and again. Yet today it's virtually forgotten. Seeing it now over 30 years later, it's easy to see why.The story is simple Boy (Ryan O'Neal) meets girl (Ali McGraw), boy gets girl, girl dies of an unnamed terminal disease--the end. The movie has a lot of good things about it the absolutely beautiful views of Harvard University and Harvard Square in the winter; O'Neal and McGraw are both gorgeous; the theme music (a deserved Oscar-winner) is haunting and truly beautiful; seeing Tommy Lee Jones in his first movie is fun; old pros Ray Milland and John Marley are having a great time (and give the only good performances) and seeing what Cambridge looked like in the early 70s (it was working class back then--it's now wall to wall condos). Unfortunately there are bad things which greatly outweigh the good. The bad O'Neal can't act and McGraw is truly abominable--her character is very foul-mouthed and her acting is wooden; the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book (with swearing); that line Love means never having to say you're sorry is the STUPIDEST line I've ever heard, and two characters you really could care less about. I'm a sucker for sappy movies like this, but I was dry-eyed when McGraw died at the end. All I could think was, Good! Maybe she'll stop swearing now! But what really bothered me is these two characters had no personality or attraction to each other. I spent the whole movie wondering why they were together. Also the dialogue is pretty horrendous.A better script and actors would have helped. I'm only giving it a 6 for the music and the scenery and one exchange--Oliver, you're driving like a maniac!

I agree with most of the positive reviews already written about this movie. After having seen it again tonight, I wanted to attempt to add two new ideas.1) Roger Ebert has called Orson Welles's entrance in The Third Man the greatest entrance in the history of cinema.

I still get goosebumps when we, the audience, are treated to the offscreen sultry German accent finally announcing her presence in her husband's attorney's chambers.
