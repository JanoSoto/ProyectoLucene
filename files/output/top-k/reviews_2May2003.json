However, if you saw this movie in 1999, you were likely blown away.  Enough said about special effects, in my opinion, because the hundreds of other posts have done a fine job explaining them. Additionally, the styles were very stylish at the time, but people viewing it 10 years from now may laugh at the costumes, simply because styles and technology change.When I first watched this movie, my first reaction when I saw Trinity disappear from the phone-booth was that this was some new virtual-reality\/lawnmower-man crap rehash.  Boy was I wrong!  In fact, a superficial viewing of this movie will miss 90% of what makes it a great movie.  Science fiction at its best, forces the viewer to view himself\/herself from a different perspective.  As a story, this movie placed the viewer into a perspective that most of us had never imagined before, and asked many fundamental questions from this very unique perspective.  What is reality?

I watched it several times before really getting a good grasp on the Oracle, and exactly what she was communicating to Neo.  I don't think I could discuss it in a couple paragraphs, however, and indeed, you should draw your own conclusions anyway.I can imagine that for a younger viewer to watch this, they may be impressed by the action sequences, the styles, the effects, but that later on in life they will be impressed by a completely different set of ideas that are much deeper.  In fact, I get the impression that there are things in this movie that even I (34 yrs old) don't quite grasp yet.On a side note, what I don't like to hear is for people to pick apart science fiction by saying, You can't do this or that.

That it's title translates into 'F*** Me' in English was hardly promising - but I tried to keep an open mind throughout.Within minutes - I was left baffled by a plot that barely makes sense, acting that makes daytime tv soap operas look like Oscar material, and some of the worst directing I've ever seen.The violence within the film is highly graphic, but nothing particularly terrible.  There's much worse in several critically acclaimed films that I really enjoyed - so that in itself isn't a problem for me.  What is a problem is that the film's protagonists have no reason for doing what they do - other than their graphic rape at the beginning.  If this film can be compared to 'Thelma & Louise' in any way, its that Themla and Louise were both likeable people who ended up in a bad situation they couldn't escape from.  The leads in this film are not exactly likeable at the start of the picture, let alone when they go on a killing spree murdering anyone and everyone that gets in their way.The rape sequence is very graphic - and certainly more realistic than your average Hollywood attempts.  But there is no real explanation as to why it causes the characters to lose control - it just does.  Obviously, rape is a tramuatic experience - but this film seems to just trivilise their order in an attempt to score cheap 'shock points'.The explicit nature continues with sex scene after sex scene.  Blow jobs, sex from both front and behind, standing up, lying down, on all fours - whatever your dirty favourite - chances are its in here... and seemingly for little reason other than titilation.Chances of the film being saved by feminist undertones are not taken.  Thelma and Louise took revenge on the kind of men who raped them, this women just kill whoever they feel like.  Not even 'Ms 45' killed everyone she could - only men who she had an understandable fear of following her ordeal.Certainly not a film for the faint of heart, I thought I could stomach almost anything - but watching them murder yet another person unjustly whilst having sex with yet another person who they later murder - it all became a bit too much.  I didn't so much find it shocking, as entirely boring after a while.  That the potentially enjoyable scenes were scuppered by violence seconds before they could've gotten interesting didn't help either!To conclude - I learned nothing from this film.  It's appalling direction and somewhat hammy subtitles (in English, possibly identical to the French - but I couldn't tell you for certain), as well as some dreadful acting from its leads... and worst of all - a jumpy nature that effectively ruined every murder - simply left me unable to find any merits within this picture.

All films have tried to demonstrate the power of a white Italo-American boxer, generous, kind with his wife, son and friends. But this Rocky V reminded me part of the sad story of one of the most famous all-time boxers, Joe Louis, who had to come back to the ring to fight against a young and strong Rocky Marciano. At that time Louis was far to be the one who was unbeatable during the 40s, he came back because suddenly debts were coming to him, nobody knows how, and he was simply compelled to fight for his survival. Everybody of that generation in US knows that Louis was simply killed in life for giving the championship sensationally to white Marciano. So nearly the same is what happened to Rocky in his end as a professional boxer, and he had to train a young and strong fighter who had no ethics and no human feelings. Unfortunately, life is like that. In this film there is also a very terrible manager, George Washington Duke, played by Richard Gant, who reminds me the person of Don King. The latter is well known because of his fight arrangements and other movements in the boxing area. Therefore I saw the film arranged with some pieces of true story of another great boxer (Joe Louis) as well as the problems of dirtiness of this professional sport, which should be prohibited one day in the future for ever.
