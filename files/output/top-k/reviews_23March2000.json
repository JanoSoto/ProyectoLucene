And the main villain, Darth Maul, rapidly took Boba Fett's place in my list of coolest Star Wars character, even though (SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT) he has the lamest death scene in film history.

In all the other Star Wars, the mythology, story, characters AND special effects are the attractives. There isn't enough character depth or much of a plot line in Phantom.

I've liked the book. I realize that the movie truly has nothing in common with it aside from the fact that an artificial man is brought to life in both. But none of the above took away from my enjoyment of James Whale's rightly considered classic film. The tacked on introduction scene and the obligatory happy ending are indeed laughable when one thinks of what is horrific in this day and age, but I was hooked from the surreal credit sequence on. To me, the real ending of this film will always be at the burning windmill, an ending of an all-too-believable tragedy.Colin Clive is a little bit overblown as Herr Frankenstein, but he does a capable enough job with the title role (something that is usually tacked onto the monster instead). Edward Van Sloan, a favorite of mine from the Universal stock company, does quite well himself as Frankenstein's old teacher, Dr. Waldmann. As for Karloff...*exhale in admiration* what can I say? I first knew him as the narrator and voice of the Grinch in Dr Seus' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (I didn't find this out until years later, but find out I did). Frankenstein marked the first time that I'd ever seen him on the screen for real. From the stiff walk to the eternally mournful face, he made the misunderstood monster his for the ages (it is also telling that, in spite of this, Karloff went on to a long, illustrious, if underappreciated, career). Two other facts that stick in my mind about this movie the creation sequence and the naming of two of it's characters. The heavy-industrial machinery used to create the monster was inspired by the silent Fritz Lang classic, Metropolis (indeed, many films, from the original The Mummy and Bride of Frankenstein to Dark City and The Matrix owe a debt to this excellent science fantasy), specifically the grafting of Maria's image onto the android. This machinery, I am told, would later go on to a return engagement in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein. Fact #2 anyone who has read the novel will know that the first name of Frankenstein is Victor and his best friend's Henry.

This movie is side-splittingly funny every single time. Bill Murray just seems to play the part so naturally, the script is genuinely funny and original, containing wit, sarcasm and hilarity. Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis play their parts like they were born to play them and transferring every character from their script onto the screen with its own individuality, giving each actor a chance to shine. There are so many bonuses to this movie that you just don't find in others. Besides the three ghostbusters providing all the laughs, there's Rick Moranis in still his best role ever, Sigourney Weaver in her first comedy, but playing the character straight, sincerely, and sexy. There's Ernie Hudson, providing the film with even more reality, with his black new-yorker's point of view. Then, besides all that, you've got some impressive special effects, some great ghosts, a cool eighties soundtrack, and perfectly fitting, ghostly, musical score. And don't forget Annie Potts or the student who keeps getting electrocuted! This movie has so many memorable lines. Every scene is a classic, obviously handled so well by director Ivan Reitman and edited into a perfectly quick-paced running time. There is no limit to how may times you can watch this movie. It couldn't have been any better, but the sequel sure could have!

I saw it a week ago, and I still think about it everyday, and the questions it poses.If you're reading this, you probably already know what FINAL DESTINATION is about. But I'll cover the bases anyway. A student named Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a dream about a plane that he and his french class are on exploding in mid air.  When he wakes up, things start happening just as they had in the dream.  Alex freaks out, and is removed from the plane, along with five other classmates and a teacher.  As these seven are grounded, their classmates are Paris bound, and everyone is mad at Alex for disrupting their plans.  But lo and behold, as the seven (and the audience) watch in horror, the plane they have just left explodes shortly after takeoff.  The rest of the story is like this  they cheated death.  Now death has to come back and finished what he started.Now that I've set you all up, here is my personal review.  In one word WOW!!.  Sure the plot may sound a bit cheesy, but believe me, this film is one heck of a roller coaster ride.  The first twenty minutes will hold you breathless as you await the inevitable plane crash.  After that happens, the film sustains the gloom created from the disaster, adding creepiness to the mix because you never know what's going to happen next.  Who will die next? And how?  The movie hints at how the people will die, but it's not until after the fact that you say oh, so THAT'S what they meant by that image!Speaking of images, this movie is filled with images you won't get out of your head for a while.  The horrific plane explosion is just one of many. The writing is such that you actually care for these characters, so when one of them dies, you feel a sense of shock and sadness.  And acting wise, the cast does a great job of showing us that what is happening is real to them. Sawa is terrific as the one who knows deaths design and must convince everyone else, and Ali Larter (who's great in everthing she does) is extraordinary at showing us the human factor of the tragedies.  I was hoping that Amanda Detmer would have more screen time, but she was unforgettable in what little role she had.  And cheers to Kerr Smith.  Not for a second did I see Jack from Dawson's Creek.  He was all Carter.Even though there are some flaws in the film (you can clearly see a dead body's eyes moving) some of the explanations get confusing (at least they did to me) and some of the lines are corny, it's a wonderfully terrifying film that, on more that one occasion, made me jump out of my seat more that any film has in a LONG LONG time.  The story is an interesting idea that could have easily become a terrible B-movie, but all the writers, directors and cast bring such a maturity and sense of seriousness to it that you can't help but be engrossed by it.  And the film makes you think of your everyday life as well, making you think about what fate (and death) have in store for you. Finally!!! A teen movie that everyone can enjoy!!For a great hour and a half of stunning entertainment, pay the money and see FINAL DESTINATION.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 March 2000","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  WARNING  This review contains SPOLIERS!Not in a long time has a movie stayed with me long after I left the theatre.

And the anti-society message is forced home by Fincher's most stylish, and yes, his best, movie to date. 'Fight Club' is much more stark than 'American Beauty'.  It does not seek to find the beauty in living, but seeks to tell us that one day we are going to die, and that only by destroying ourselves can we ever hope to make something better.Perhaps where the film suffers is by its establishment of a concept which cannot be given any satisfactory conclusion.  The film itself loses itself towards the end.  But this reflects the film's message, and is unavoidable.Such minor criticisms aside, 'Fight Club' is a film good to see at least twice, for reasons that will become obvious once it has been seen once.

Also, his technique of having characters speak while showing their unmoving faces was particularly jarring... looking for the world like a poorly dubbed foreign film. Taking out those 10 minutes of repetitive and unnecessary flashbacks and flash forwards, and substituting more character development of the Limey himself would have greatly improved this movie. Those scenes with Cockney Wilson and Hispanic Ed, and with the Black DEA Agent, were inspired cultural interactions. Also on the plus side, Soderbergh or someone else came up with the brilliant device of using a 1967 Stamp appearance in the film 'Poor Cow', editing in clips of him so effectively to portray his youth that I scoped the credits to find out if his son was cast for those scenes.

I got a cheap $5 copy of it at my local Wal-Mart (I'm guessing the 93 minute version, although the run might have been closer to two hours). It had no soundtrack whatsoever (a REAL silent movie, if ever there was one) and so it gave me a cold reaction that first viewing. I wouldn't look at it again until several years later, when I was recovering from an injured foot. This time, I scored it to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the post Sgt. Pepper segments of the 1967-1970 collection of their greatest hits. Some of the tunes actually fit in rather well with my version, in an ironic way (It's Getting Better for the factory vision of workers being devoured, A Day in the Life during Maria's sermon, Hello, Goodbye for the creation sequence...the list goes on and on). To this day, I wonder if my enjoyment of the film has more to do with the Beatles or Lang. But I do enjoy this film so much now.Lang was critically blasted up one side and down another by several reviewers when this first came on the scene. When I think about how accurately this film predicts the class divisions, hazardous conditions of blue collar workers, and the resulting discontent of later decades, it just proves to me that truth is never welcome when recognized as such. On a different note, I have yet to see any mad scientist quite equal the demented Rotwang in terms of sheer madness and design (that artificial hand sticks in my head more anything else about him). Though he does die, it is telling that all is still not quite well between the masters and the workers by film's end. Though Freder has helped all of them take a step in the right direction, it is truly only the beginning. But I'd like to think that what Maria finally did come to pass.

I got a cheap $5 copy of it at my local Wal-Mart (I'm guessing the 93 minute version, although the run might have been closer to two hours). It had no soundtrack whatsoever (a REAL silent movie, if ever there was one) and so it gave me a cold reaction that first viewing. I wouldn't look at it again until several years later, when I was recovering from an injured foot. This time, I scored it to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the post Sgt. Pepper segments of the 1967-1970 collection of their greatest hits. Some of the tunes actually fit in rather well with my version, in an ironic way (It's Getting Better for the factory vision of workers being devoured, A Day in the Life during Maria's sermon, Hello, Goodbye for the creation sequence...the list goes on and on). To this day, I wonder if my enjoyment of the film has more to do with the Beatles or Lang. But I do enjoy this film so much now.Lang was critically blasted up one side and down another by several reviewers when this first came on the scene. When I think about how accurately this film predicts the class divisions, hazardous conditions of blue collar workers, and the resulting discontent of later decades, it just proves to me that truth is never welcome when recognized as such. On a different note, I have yet to see any mad scientist quite equal the demented Rotwang in terms of sheer madness and design (that artificial hand sticks in my head more anything else about him). Though he does die, it is telling that all is still not quite well between the masters and the workers by film's end.

I can't describe how much this film rocked. It had everything, drama, romance(somewhat), comedy and unbelievable action sequences. Jet Li has just started to show his potential. He is a force not to be messed with. Move over Jacky, Jet Li has taken over. I have never seen a film that had an audience so into the film. They were screaming, hollering, and cheering. The action sequences in this film are the best I've seen since The Matrix. It's got that Matrix feel of cutting edge technology, very cool fight scenes, and high bullet gun battles. Delroy Lindo does his normal powerful job as the Black gang boss. DMX has a small but cool appearance as a club owner. Russell Wong is great as the Chinese point man. I'd like to see him in more films where he can headline. He's both evil and cool at the same time. But it is Aaliyah who is the shock here. The r&b singer in her acting debut is very good as the Delroy's daughter. She steals each scene she in. She also tough which isn't that normal but becoming normal for action movie heroines. For those action junkies this is a must see. For Martial Arts junkies its a blessing. For everyone else, if you don't see this film is a crime against humanity. I gave The Matrix a 25, this definitely gets a 19 1\/2. It the best movie of the year so far. Romeo Must Die is an amazing action film that will leave you breathless.

We wouldn't mind, but none of them seem to be that good. Of course we haven't actually made any ourselves, so we're hardly in a position to criticise, but the really sad thing is that the teen-com concept is full of potential. Finally, someone was daring enough to explore the outrageousness of lusty adolescence. American Pie was born!Make no mistake; the main strength of this film is it's sheer vulgarity. The usual patronising moral preaching that accompanies, and spoils, so many films of this type is absent. Replacing it is a no holds barred look at teenage angst, sexual curiosity, and the art of bodily function jokes. In addition, the subject of masturbation has never been approached with such an unflinching eye!!The young cast, all relatively unknown, offer some impressive performances. The individual honours belong to Sean W Scott, who is repulsively likeable as Stifler, even if it is nothing more than a role as the typically moronic American Jock. However, the most skillful moments of the film are provided by Jason Biggs and Eugene Levy, who offer an excellent double act as the son with strange methods of experimentation and the father, whose methods of sex education are at times equally bizarre. The sense of awkwardness as they endure their 'man to man' talks is remarkably convincing.The film isn't consistently funny, but the half dozen side splitting moments are more than enough to keep you amused, even if you have been told of them in vivid detail prior to watching. (Like I was)At times though, American Pie can certainly be accused of feeling a bit familiar. After all, the guys trying to get laid routine has been done a thousand times before, and some of the jokes (such as the old classic of post laxative attack panic) are hardly original, but the film does include some touches that save it from being totally predictable. For example there is the character of Finch, the mysterious member of the sex-obsessed quartet with sophisticated mannerisms, and the way the Jock element is played through Lacrosse, rather than a more obvious or traditional American sport.The purists will no doubt, make criticisms about it's over explicitness, and other such garbage about the corruption of the young, but as usual they are looking deeper than is necessary. While you could argue that American Pie brings attention to the awkwardness, anxiousness and confusion of adolescent sexuality, it is really just an entertaining comedy, with grossness that lifts it head and shoulders above the rest.
