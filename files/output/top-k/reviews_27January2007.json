Having seen the film six times in the theater at age nine, I may be biased of course, but I found the world of fantasy that Altman, crew, and cast created, utterly brilliant. From the enchanting town of Sweethaven (built from entirely from scratch on the island of Malta off Italy's coastline) to the costumes and larger than life characterizations and double talk, it's all truly inspired. I still believe Robin's portrayal of Popeye is one of his great acting achievements of his career. He managed to harness something intangible about the cartoon that neither I, nor anyone most likely, had ever really seen to the full extent... the true heart of the irascible sailor. You feel like you're watching an emotionally three dimensional human being, a cartoon come to life. And some of the best moments are in the mumblings and mutterings that Mr. Williams seemed to improvise to a large extent. For example, when he interacts with Olive Oyl's mother and asks about their room for renk she responds in a mind-numbingly odd way that leaves Popeye bewildered. He looks at the mailbox and sees the name Oyl and mumbles to himself, Oyl. Dat explains it. She must be a quart low. Witty, clever, brilliant. Altman's direction is also key because he lets scenes play out and breathe so that the quirky, uncomfortable moments that happen in real life are also there in this fantasy world. It lends such credibility to what could've been an overblown, vacuous cartoon movie. It's a tribute to Altman's understanding of the human condition that he injected vulnerability and caring into the characters. Ray Walston's portrayal of Poopdeck Pappy is a great example of this emotional layering. We see his disconnect from Popeye and the bitterness and regret of years lost with his son which eventually gives way to love, acceptance and true joy. It's a heartfelt subplot that, again, adds to the broader canvas of honest emotion in the film. Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl is also one of the great casting moves of all time. Has there ever been a person more suited to play a part? Her physical resemblance to the character is incredible, but it's what she does with her voice, her walk, her eyes, and just about every single part of her being that makes her the embodiment of Olive Oyl. Finally, no review of Popeye would be complete without talking about the incredible soundtrack from the legendary Harry Nilsson. It is another truly overlooked gem. Best known for the classic theme Everbody's Talking from the film Midnight Cowboy, what Nilsson does on the Popeye soundtrack is as imaginative and emotional sonically as the film is visually. It is an anthology of the entire film, a storyline told in song. From Popeye's initial arrival into the sleepy harbor town of Sweethaven which is punctuated by Nilsson's small town celebratory anthem Sweethaven to his triumphant self-affirming declarations of I Yam What I Yam and I'm Popeye The Sailor Man, the music takes you on a journey along with the characters. Since Popeye is essentially a musical in large part, all the main characters get their theme. Bluto sings with conviction, I'm Mean while blustering around and intimidating locals. Olive Oyl croons, He Needs Me as a plaintive ode to Popeye's love for her and her realization of that love. Even Poopdeck Pappy gets in on the act as Ray Walston belts out the grumpy, It's Not Easy Bein' Me and Kids, an analysis of the parent\/ child dynamic that could be an addendum to any Freudian psychology class. Really listen to the lyrics as Pappy uses double talk and double negatives to hammer home his litany of irritations with little tykes. Quite amusing. When it was released in 1980, Popeye was universally panned by critics, and it was partially responsible for sending both Robert Altman and producer, Robert Evans (former head of Paramount) into tailspins. They had both been legendarily out of control on set with partying and drug use. In an episode of Inisde The Actor's Studio Robin Williams spoke about this in response to a question about what working on that set was like. He said It was Altman and Robert Evans. Whoa! Throw in Harry Nilsson, and you've got yourself a weekend. Even Betty Ford's going 'I'm booked. Very funny way to sum it up. A side note of interest the song He Needs Me is also used by Paul Thomas Anderson in his film, Punch Drunk Love to great effect. Anderson is a self- confessed Atlman fanatic, and his films are reminiscent of the Altman style with the naturalistic over-talking and large, talented casts. Okay, that's it. Go rent the Popeye DVD and sit down with the kids to enjoy a fun ride. ***No spoiler below, just a hidden treasure to look out for**** There is only one curse word in the movie, but it was clearly thrown in almost as a subversive afterthought when Popey jumps off Poopdeck Pappy's ship into the ocean near the end of the film, listen closely to the word he screams on the way down. It's a colorful one that nearly slips by if you're not really paying attention. It ain't geronimo that's for sure.

I have however, seen the musical live and the 1978 Richard Jordan\/Anthony Perkins version. Although I liked much about the 1978 version, I prefer this 1998 version. It is only slightly better acted, but much better as a film in its cinematography, pace, editing, sets, and most importantly its illustration of the contrast between law vs. grace from a Christian standpoint. The two mains (Neeson and Rush) are especially powerful in their roles. I don't mind the romantic interest between Valjean and Fantine, since it makes his relationship to Cossette more understandable and less suspect of other motives, if you will. The major flaw I see in the film is the ending between Javert and Valjean. There is no way it is consistent with the Valjean character to allow Javert to cast himself into the Seine without Valjean jumping in after Javert to save him. That ending really bugs me, I must confess. I have no idea why they had to do it that way, except so that Javert could have his final speech, telling us all why he is what he is and why he must kill himself. He should have waited until Jean was gone before his suicide, knowing that Jean would otherwise rescue him. Otherwise, this is a fine and moving film, all bias aside. It stands alone as a top-notch effort that works on its own merit as a film and a great piece of storytelling.

It is only slightly better acted, but much better as a film in its cinematography, pace, editing, sets, and most importantly its illustration of the contrast between law vs. grace from a Christian standpoint. The two mains (Neeson and Rush) are especially powerful in their roles. I don't mind the romantic interest between Valjean and Fantine, since it makes his relationship to Cossette more understandable and less suspect of other motives, if you will. The major flaw I see in the film is the ending between Javert and Valjean. There is no way it is consistent with the Valjean character to allow Javert to cast himself into the Seine without Valjean jumping in after Javert to save him. That ending really bugs me, I must confess. I have no idea why they had to do it that way, except so that Javert could have his final speech, telling us all why he is what he is and why he must kill himself. He should have waited until Jean was gone before his suicide, knowing that Jean would otherwise rescue him. Otherwise, this is a fine and moving film, all bias aside. It stands alone as a top-notch effort that works on its own merit as a film and a great piece of storytelling.

I've never met anyone who did NOT like this movie. It seems to appeal to a lot of people, young and old. The three leads - Steve Martin, Michael Caine and Glenn Headley - were all in top form, on top of their game, so to speak.Martin's facial expressions and physical humor are terrific and Caine played his part magnificently, too. I enjoy Caine much more in here than Martin (and in most films) but Steve seems to have the funniest moments in this movie. At any rate, both are superb as antagonists Lawrence Jamison (Caine) and Freddie Benson (Martin). The two men have the talent to pull off slapstick as well as subtle comedy. Headley, as Janet Colgate, meanwhile, is a joy to watch and to listen to, with that sweet voice of hers. I can't say more about her without giving away too much but she is not only the objection of attention in the movie, but the key character. These three combine for almost a laugh-a-minute.This also is a good example of how to make a modern-day comedy without all the sleaze and profanity. There is some in here, but not much. Why most comedies do not follow this lead is a sad question. It's still an adult movie about con men, not a film teens and below would enjoy.

True, but right is right and wrong is wrong. It doesn't matter what everyone else does, even if every person involved is guilty...that doesn't make it right. I didn't go to Vietnam - was in the service at that time, but state side duty. But I know Vietnam vets who, even though in heavy combat, brought honor to themselves and our country in what they did. And then there are others I've heard about. Which brings up another question that has been debated endlessly...was the conduct of our troops in Vietnam worse than in other wars? Thats a matter of debate and I'm not qualified to get into that one. But back to the movie. I've never been a Micheal J. Fox or Sean Penn fan, but their performances are awesome, especially M.J. Fox.

Thats a matter of debate and I'm not qualified to get into that one. But back to the movie. I've never been a Micheal J. Fox or Sean Penn fan, but their performances are awesome, especially M.J. Fox.

Mel Brooks, however unintentionally, achieved this with Blazing Saddles, which through off-color humor shows how truly idiotic racism is. That's not to say the movie is preachy or maudlin; on the contrary, it's easily Brooks's most outrageous film. Blazing Saddles is filled with shameless ribaldry and constant use of the n-word. The fact that Richard Pryor assisted in the scriptwriting must have compounded the shocking humor (he was originally going to play Black Bart, but was considered too controversial). It also contains the now legendary campfire scene with its symphonic chorus of flatulence. It's the American west in 1874, and the verbose and dastardly Hedy, er, Headley Lamarr (Harvey Korman) has an evil scheme to drive out the citizens of Rock Ridge in order to build a railroad through the town. He devises a way to scare off each and every one of them send a new sheriff who is so shocking, so offensive, that they leave in fear and disgust. Who is chosen to drive away the inbred (all the citizens' last names are Johnson), racist, citizens? Bart (Cleavon Little), a black railroad worker, who immediately earns the hatred of Rock Ridge's rednecks. Yet the ever cool and unflappable Bart refuses to be cowed by a little bit of prejudice, so he sets out to earn some respect from the townsfolk. He first achieves this by taming wanted menace Mongo (Alex Karras, who would later play George on Webster), a monosyllabic brute who rides an ox and can lean his who body into a fire to light a cigar without getting burned (even fire's scared of him!). Once everyone gets wind of Headley Lamarr's scheme, Bart unites everyone to win back Rock Ridge in the longest, funniest drag-down fight ever. The plot is tissue thin and the ending is utterly absurd, but Blazing Saddles is such shocking fun and full of hilarious characters, you won't mind. There plenty of appearances by Brooks's staple actors including a laid-back Gene Wilder, taking a break from his usual neurotic shtick, as the Waco Kid, a washed-up gunslinger who becomes Bart's loyal sidekick. Then there's the ever-reliable Madeleine Kahn as Lili Von Schtupp, a sexy, lisping Marlene Dietrich-style saloon singer who tries to ensnare Bart. Brooks himself plays incompetent horndog Governor LePetomane, a cross-eyed fool whom Headley Lamarr easily manipulates. All the actors seem to enjoy tweaking the familiar formulas of westerns. Prissy-faced Korman is uproarious as an effete and utterly ineffective villain, and has some of the best lines (You will be risking your lives, whilst I will be risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for the Best Supporting Actor!). Cowboy star Slim Pickens is also a hoot as Lamarr's sidekick Mr.Taggart, who's long on ethnic slurs but short on intellect. Little is slick and hilarious as Bart, even though he sometimes comes off as Richard Pryor Lite. It's a shame he never became a bigger star... he truly had a charismatic screen presence. There is a sort of potential star-making scene when the newly appointed Sheriff Bart rides to town in his color-coordinated cowboy suit, horse, and Gucci bag. As always, Brooks uses his patented formula of combining edgy humor with tried and true vaudevillian buffoonery and cartoon slapstick. For instance, Bart pulls a Bugs Bunny by trapping Mongo with an explosive candy box (they even use the familiar Looney Tunes theme at the end of the scene). And when Bart and a colleague take a railroad cart and sink into quicksand, an overseer rides up and lassos&#133; the railroad cart, leaving Bart and his friend to suffer. Yeah, this movie may have all but killed the Western, but, when it's Mel Brooks, who cares?

It does have humor. The script is well-written, but that doesn't mean you will enjoy it. I also only watched a half hour of the movie because I wasn't in the mood to waste my time. In my case, I have to relate to the characters in some way to enjoy a movie. These people acted very immature. I think that is the point of the movie, but I also believe that this would not appeal to most audiences over 40 years old. The movie got very good ratings, but beware, ratings are not enough.
