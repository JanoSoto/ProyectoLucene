On the other hand, the cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth is fuzzy and unfocused, while the performances of Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, and Valerie Perrine are better suited to the Batman TV show than to a $50 million epic.  They camp it up far too much and never convince me that they pose a serious threat to the world or the Man of Steel.  When Hackman returned to his Lex Luthor role in the superior 1981 sequel, his tongue-in-cheek portrayal was offset by the more serious emoting of Terence Stamp, the evil General Zod, who proved himself a more formidable opponent to Clark Kent's alter ego.  In that film, Hackman's camp portrayal added to, rather than detracted from, the movie's quality because Stamp and Sarah Douglas provided the major source of villainy.  This one works best in the first hour when the origins of Superman are nicely presented by director Donner.  Once the fully grown Superman arrives on the scene, the film heads downhill until the surprisingly moving climax, almost wholly dependent on the excellent performances of Christopher Reeve (absolutely perfect in a very difficult role) and Margot Kidder (an unlikely--and better for it--Lois Lane).  The special-effects aren't bad, but the flying scenes improved considerably with the next film. This one is still worth seeing, but Superman II really flies.As for Marlon Brando...when the film was released at Christmas 1978, no major film had ever been based on a comic book hero and, I suppose, the presence of such a prestigious actor sounded the alarm that this was not just a kid's movie.  Now that epic films based on the comics are a fact of life, Brando is simply another big name actor, walking through yet another movie.

This movie pretty much has it all, and it does it all well. Keanu was good in his role, basically because he didn't have to do too much acting, and was able to carry off the action scenes.  And what action scenes they are!  The cinematography is great, every shot is well set up and thought out.  The special effects more than live up to their advance billing.  Most action movies today would be content to stop there.  However, The Matrix also has a very good plot, one that keeps you guessing till the end as to what will happen.  One element that I feel makes this movie better than the usual action movie is that you actually care about the characters, and whether they will live or die.  The opening scene will hook you, and will also introduce you to the freeze time camera effect.  This effect appears throughout the movie, so get used to it.  I guess the highest compliment that I could give this movie is that i didn't want it to end, I just wanted more action, more effects.  All in all, I highly recommend this movie.

There are fx in Matrix that have never been done before, or at least extensively used throughout the film. Such as, what the Wachowski brothers call bullet-time photography, which provides dynamic camera movement around slow-motion events that approaches 12,000 frames per second, thus the super smooth slow-motion scenes seen occasionally in the film. This is also one of the first films I've seen that effectively recreates the Anime action feel. This is how John Gaeta, of Manex, describes it The Wachowskis are from the comic-book culture, and are therefore familiar with the Japanese animation style called anime, which we re-created with live actors for this movie. Anime takes advantage of 'the physics of decimation' &#150; it breaks down action into its components and allows those elements to be meticulously controlled to build the most dramatic effect from dynamic movement.

Partly, because of the obvious reason, if you're like me, you hate spoilers and you want to see it for yourself. Partly, because although it's in a way a simple enough concept, it has to be seen to be really understood.That said, let's get to the meat.  If for no other reason than to see some great visual effects, this movie is well worth seeing.  The effects are wonderful and innovative without becoming a look what we did with CGI movie.  The sound is also great, well worth looking for a Dolby Digital theatre to see it.  This is one that will likely be snapped up quickly once it's out on DVD by people who want to showcase their 5.1 systems.As for the story, as I said, it's a simple yet intriguing concept of the future.  There were a couple minor plot holes, but nothing you can't overlook.  I won't go into what it's all about since I'm sure you've either heard it all before or want to see it for yourself.  Rest assured though, it's good.Character wise, the movie holds its own.  I've yet to be disappointed by anything Laurence Fishburne has done and he certainly doesn't disappoint here as the enigmatic resistance leader Morpheus.Personally, I'm not one for Keanu Reaves bashing, he has become somewhat typecast as the brooding, strong-silent type and he pretty much sticks to that character here.  I know, everyone's thinking about Johnny Mnemonic (Moronic), frankly, the suckage factor of that movie cannot be entirely laid on Keanu's lap.  They could have put anyone in that role and the movie would have still out-sucked Electrolux.The supporting cast supports well, even though the only characters you really get to know to any degree are Neo (Reaves), Morpheus, and Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss).It's hard to really critique this movie further without lapsing into spoilers and cliche, so I'll leave it at this;  The Matrix is an entertaining two hours and well worth the price of admission.

It would be a shame because this film offers so much more to the emotions and, surprisingly, to the character.  It is a unique work, combining introspect and exuberant expression, delivered through innovative displays of seemingly timeless ideals.  It tells us, perhaps, that while beauty and wonder can be found in nostalgia, there might be more to be found in expressing oneself through it.  It also tells us that, while grim hardship and sparse opportunities may be at hand, there are many wonderful moments to be found. Certainly these are not new ideas, but they are delivered in such a sensitive and delightful way that the is possible for the viewer to feel freshly inspired by them.  Jane Horrocks has been deservedly lauded for her performance (not to mention her impeccable replicas of some of the century's best-known voices), but the rest of the cast, especially a marvelous Brenda Blethyn, are instrumental in conveying the film's bright messages. Little Voice is also thoroughly respectable in less conceptual terms. The performance scene featuring Horrocks in all her impersonating glory is nothing short of exceptional it is easy to see why she was one of the biggest things to happen to London theatre in years. I regret not having the opportunity to see this film until 1999, because it may have been my favorite of 1998.  I was not entirely satisfied with the way in which the film ended, but I cannot imagine any better way to bring this film's brilliance to an adequate close.  Nevertheless, it is still an inspiring and rich film; one of the best I have seen in the last two years.
