[{"date":"22 March 2013","score":"","review":" I have to say that Lon Chaney Jr. makes the best Lennie Smalls from all the actors that played him. Chaney is the son of famed silent film actor Lon Chaney Sr. who had appeared in more than fifty films to this point in his career, but 'Of Mice and Men' was his first major role. Chaney's performance is just amazing. John Malkovich's 1992 acting as Lenny Smalls seems out of place due to his short status and his well use of American English. Lon Chaney's acting match the role. Not only does he have the body for Lennie, but the great use of facial expression that he got from his father. Lon has the physical strength that Steinbeck is trying to say about Lennie whom couldn't control as he can't help stop accidentally killing mice due to petting them too hard. I have to say in this version, I'm not wild about Burgess Meredith's portrayal of George. Burgess's George acts like a freaking psycho killer as he doesn't show much of an emotional range. I do prefer Gary Sinise's 1992 portrayal of George. Here it feels like Burgess Meredith was saying to himself, OK I'm just gonna go in there and be angry with Lennie throughout the movie. Sinise was like, I'm gonna go in there and Lennie's disability is not gonna bother me at all but then of course it does. Burgess's George acts like he wanted to kill Lennie! The movie starts out with the two men, George and his mentally challenged partner Lennie, trying to survive during the dust bowl of the 1930s. They are pursuing a dream of owning their own ranch. They are fleeing from their previous employment where they were run out of town after Lennie's love of stroking soft things resulted in an accusation of attempted rape when he touched a young woman's dress. Of Mice and Men is not kind in its portrayal of women. In fact, women are treated with contempt throughout the course of the book and the movie. Steinbeck generally depicts women as temptress who bring ruin on men and drive them mad. Of Mice and Men offers limited, misogynistic, descriptions of women who are either dead maternal figures or prostitutes. At their newest ranch, the dream appears to move closer to reality as long as Lennie stays away from ranch owner's son Curly's wife (Betty Field). They meet a number of interesting supporting characters that wants a part of their dream such as Candy (Roman Bohnen) the aged, one handed ranch hand whom own an old dog and Crooks (Leigh Whipper) the black stable hand, with a crooked back. One of the movie's major themes and symbols revolve around Candy. Candy worries that the ranch owner will soon declare him useless and fire him due to his age and injury. Candy's dog, once an impressive sheep herder was taken out to similar reasons. This event helps supports Candy's fears. Candy's dog serves as a harsh reminder of the fate that awaits anyone who outlives his or her usefulness. Its serves a foreshadowing for both Lennie and George's lives. There is a bit of predatory nature of human existence in the story. All of the characters, have a profound sense of loneliness and isolation. Each desires the comfort of a friend. The characters are rendered helpless by their isolation, and yet, even at their weakest, they seek to destroy those who are weaker than them. Perhaps the most powerful example of this cruel tendency is when Crooks criticizes Lennie's dream of the farm and his dependence on George. Having just admitted his own vulnerabilities. Crooks zeroes in on Lennie's own weaknesses just to feel better. The book and movie makes the idea of the American Dream seem childlike. An impossibility paradises of freedom, contentment and safety are not to be found in this world. The ending scene is still sad. The movie cheesy music ruins the mood, the newer one is much sadder and has more of a hard hitting end to it. This music was so dumb. It felt like a ragtime suspense film where the murderer is sneaking up on his victim. That is not what the book meant to portray at all. Shame in both films they never put Lennie's vision in, I thought it was a very important element to the book. Chaney's performance as he truly believes he sees his new home is heart breaking. Beautiful. Most people here wouldn't know good acting if it shot them in the head from behind. The remake's ending was too rushed and happened too quickly. This one much more dramatic. This ending is more tasteful done than the color ending. This film followed the book more than the other films. No matter what version of the movie you watch, it's still an awesome story.

Jim despite being a bit of loser does try to do the right thing and does seem like a nice guy. There's nothing particularly wrong with him, he just wants to know what sex feels like and you do become invested in him as time goes on.

Finch is an oddball who takes himself a tad too seriously but still means well and Kevin is more mature than his counterparts but still having as much fun as his friends. Each of them are very likable and the way they interact with each other is very funny. When they fall into these ridiculous situations, it's all the more hilarious than it would be to less interesting characters. The two scene stealer's though are supporting characters. Steve Stifler is the obnoxious womanizing asshole who you love to hate. Again kind of generic of a characters but Sean William Scott kills it in the role. He's just so funny and has so much fun on screen. And the other scene stealer is Jim's Dad(Eugene Levvy). This guy is so supportive of his son that it's kind of embarrassing for Jim. I think we can all admit we've had embarrassing conversation with our parents about the birds and the bees but this is just taking it to another level. For the viewer though, it's hilarious.

To all viewers, I won't talk further in riddles, but there are some important elements you need to consider when you watch this movie1. Each segment is important, so be careful to watch and let it run through your minds.2. This movie relates and centers around a woman and what goes on in her mind, and beyond the conjured up world.

Movie can be complete but still incomplete - that is how mind works and there is a limitation on how all things\/patterns fit together based on observer and what is being observed and what are the colorings of the thought stream that have been witnessed thus far.5. Movie has some sexual acts that some may find disturbing, but again its mind field, in the world of mind-field anything is possible, we all have fantasies, we all have hallucinations, we all have objects of affections.Many of the elements seem apparent but they really have deeper meaning to them, like It is an illusion &#x85; or Silencio&#x85; at the end.

(No Spoilers for you guys reading this and have come this far).4. Movie can be complete but still incomplete - that is how mind works and there is a limitation on how all things\/patterns fit together based on observer and what is being observed and what are the colorings of the thought stream that have been witnessed thus far.5. Movie has some sexual acts that some may find disturbing, but again its mind field, in the world of mind-field anything is possible, we all have fantasies, we all have hallucinations, we all have objects of affections.Many of the elements seem apparent but they really have deeper meaning to them, like It is an illusion &#x85; or Silencio&#x85; at the end. Overall I would say, this movie requires a lot of patience to understand and grasp, if you are looking for pop-corn drama, go watch inception or some other flick that gives you just that, there's a lot of those out there (nothing against those as well, they are fantastic but they are too apparent and too easy to follow). Movie often is like life - it can be as easy as you make it to be, or as hard as you make it out to be&#x85; Overall a fantastic value for money.

I wasn't a huge fan of the 1978 Superman movie. So this review, I will have to compare these two films.'Superman II' focuses once more around Clark Kent whose love affair with Louis Lane isn't going too well until she eventually finds out that Clark is Superman and is willing to marry him. In order to marry a mortal, Clark must give up his power and become a mortal. All the while, Clark is unaware that three Kryptonian criminals that were locked up by Jor-El have escaped following an event at the very beginning of the play and plan to make chaos across Earth whilst finding Jor-El's son, Ka'El, Superman! The acting in this movie is better than it was in the original. Christopher Reve was fantastic in the movie and provided some truly hilarious moments. His constant transition between a socially awkward newspaper reporter and the Man of Steel was hilarious and truly drove the film along. The woman playing Lois, I thought did a better job in this one than the first. Terence Stamp was great as Zod.The way Superman II starts with Clark realizing that some terrorists have taken over Paris and are planning to blow up is priceless, where he quotes That's terrible! only for his boss to casually reply, That's why they're called terrorists. From that moment on, I was glued to my seat.Everything to me is superior here than in the original, except one thing. The acting was better, the visuals had slightly improved, the story was far better, the villain was better and the action sequences here actually were quite entertaining, despite being made in 1980. I loved how this movie managed to bring villains from Ka-El's home planet instead of having some criminal mastermind who barely did anything that truly excited or truly gave any suspense. In the first film, Lex Luthor is so lightly focused on and when his plans really come, they are so rushed. Here, the three criminals are given plenty more screen time and are funny, they are dangerous and more like superhero villains.There is so much that happens in this movie over 2 hours, that when it was over, I was disappointed that it wasn't a little longer. Everything in this film was entertaining and more importantly, done well from Lois trying to expose Clark's truly identity, to the criminals taking over Houston, to Clark giving up his power for Lois. There was so much good in this movie. The action was good, much better than any in Superman (1978). The only thing I truly found better in the original was how they did Superman's origin story and how he came to Earth....That, and of course the ever so legendary Marlon Brando's performance of Jor-El.At the time of its release, it was the greatest superhero movie and until Nolan's Batman trilogy came, I think that it truly deserves to be the greatest superhero film.

Why? Because it's very different then what we're used to, and anything we see related to anime is usually kid oriented or just flat out weird that we turn a blind eye to this form of animation.But we should not, anime is a fantastic genre in both animation and its own form of comics called manga. We should not ignore this, and open our eyes to some of these wonderfully animated films and shows from Japanese animation. And I think a good start is with the Studio Ghibli films, who have been partnered with Disney for quite some time now actually, and almost all of the films to come out of this studio are wonders. Like Princess Mononoke.Here's an animated movie that is definitely geared towards a more older teen\/adult audience, but not only because of the bloody violent or scary moments, but because of the surprisingly compelling message that it tries to get across. That not only should nature be cherished and preserved, but also that whenever there is good and evil conflicting, there is no fairy tale guarantee that good will conquer, or even if both sides would be spared by destroying something far greater than either could have ever imagined. The film does so incredibly well with pulling you right into it, with it's compelling storyline about a young man Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) who is poisoned by a demon and will inevitably die, and makes a journey to find out how this demon originated, eventually having to make the more then tough decision of what side he should be assisting nature, or man. And after coming across an ever determined princess of the wolves, Mononoke\/San (Claire Danes), he is confronted with obligations greater than he could have comprehended, whether or not he should help man conquer the pest of nature and the Forest Gods that fight for it, or protect an essence of life itself, the Forest Spirit.Even if all the trees grow back, it won't be his forest anymore. The Forest Spirit is dead. -San\/Mononoke Never. He is life itself. He isn't dead, San. He is here with us now, telling us, it's time for both of us to live. -AshitakaAlong with some of the most gorgeous animation you've ever seen in any animated feature, this film is brimming with luscious scenery, creative creature\/characters constructs, and both luminous and dreary settings to go through. Action scenes can be quite engaging, and even the most calm of scenes where characters are just talking, the animation just never ceases to amaze. The English-dubbing for the animation is just fantastic, each voice actor putting forth some of their best performances in their career, including voices like Billy Bob Thorton, Corey Burton, and even Jada Pinkett Smith. Simply every aspect of this film is fantastic, and it shines tall as one of the best animated features to date. Everything from its great animation, stellar voice cast, a moral\/meaning that even adults can learn from, and all from the, again, brilliant Hayao Miyazaki.Even if you're used to the traditional Disney or Warner Bros. animation and don't really plan on venturing too much into the world of anime, it would be unwise not to give this a watch.

She is afraid of telling him about her feelings towards him. She is supposed to be sent to Paris to learn how to cook. The night before her journey to Paris, she sees David dancing with a girl and decides to commit suicide, but Linus stops her. On her journey to Paris, she learns how to live and love instead of learning how to cook, and she decides to take part in life instead of watching it. So she comes back as a beautiful, sophisticated, young lady. David, who hardly noticed her existence at Long Island falls in love with her. Naturally his family objects to this relationship and Linus, David's brother, plans something to get rid of this situation. He tries to make her fall in love with him himself, and they really fall in love. Sabrina who has been in pain and agony of David's love all her life finally finds a cure, but she has to deal with the cure now. It seems the cure for a love is another love, so love is incurable and inevitable. As she says herself  I don't want to run away from life any more. David finds out about her and his brother. Then he, who knows much more about love than his bother who has been working on business all his life and never felt such feelings, decides to help them get to each other. Finally Sabrina goes back to Paris, where she found how to love, with her love.

It's a fairly nasty film with some truly brutal and gory moments but dismiss it as a vile, repulsive trash is just wrong. This film is a cut above the rest slasher films and pretty much ranks up with the best like Nightmare on Elm Street. The main reasons being the excellent performances, top notch direction and surprisingly good script as well the superb effects from Tom Savini.Joe Spinell wrote and starred as the titular maniac Frank Zito. He does a fantastic job playing the character. When he is alone he plays the traumatized manchild and gives you the creeps. But when he meets Caroline Munro character he plays it like a normal person, being all charismatic and cool. It's a wonderful performance and he manages to be both very cruel and brutal and also pathetic at the same time. Caroline Munro plays the survivor photographer and she is wonderful. She has a fantastic chemistry with Joe Spinell and in the few scenes you see her, she leaves a great impression. It simply shows that she isn't just a pretty face but can act too. The rest of the cast mainly consist of victims and they are decent but that's because the film doesn't really spend all that much time on anyone else but the killer.The direction by William Lustig is very good. He manages to capture the dirty, gritty look of the early 80's America very well. It's well shot and the scenes of killer doing his nasty work is very well executed. The score perfectly works together with the direction and gives the film a really good atmosphere of dread and unease. The visual effects by Tom Savini are very impressive for the surprisingly small budget they had. Also it's only 90's minutes long so it never really overstays it welcome and never wastes your time with pointless in irrelevant subplots or side characters. Unlike I Saw the Devil, Maniac knows that it's a horror film and doesn't pretend that it has something more to it.If I had to point out some problems, then the most obvious one was the ending. It's the classic slasher film ending where the killer is not really that dead. I didn't like the fact that they needed to go for the most obvious ending in the world. Could have done something more clever than that. Also could have used more of Caroline Munro, since she was so good in the film.Maniac is very good slasher film that's made by people who knew what they were doing. It's very well acted and has some really tense and brutal scenes. If you want to see very good 80's slasher film, Maniac is as good as it gets. It's much better than those horrible Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camps, Silent Night Deadly Nights and other horrible wastes of time.

How Stephen King came up with such a poignant and heartfelt tale is beyond me, maybe it was divine intervention, but the story of the Green Mile is a unique and moving film, the likes of which I've never seen before. The story centers around a man who is sent to death row, and once there he is able to doing seemingly impossible things.

The combination of a strong sentimental story along with the acting power of Tom Hanks made this film one for the ages. The supporting cast, in particular Michael Clarke Duncan and Sam Rockwell, were tremendous assets to the film and their careers were launched with the help of Hanks's experience and King's amazing words, but this film is far from perfect. As an avid Stephen King fan, I know his attention to detail has often times been his downfall and to be honest, this film is about an hour longer than it needed to be.

When word reaches Simba's uncle, Scar, he isn't very pleased as you would expect to and plots the deaths of Simba and Musafa so that he may rule 'Pride Rock' Escaping Musafa and death, Simba then grows up to be a pretty much nobody until his old friend, Nala comes back and tells him that he must be ready to be king. The story simply evolves around Simba's life.This film is just an animation masterpiece. Not only a genre masterpiece, but a masterpiece in general. The voice acting for this movie was superb. Jeremy Irons as Scar was amazing, Mathew Brodrick as old Simba was fantastic both delivering the performances of their lives. The animations, to this day, look amazing, the music is breath taking,the songs are so amazing and iconic that it is impossible to possibly ignore any of these aspects. The film is superbly directed and the dialogue is great.The characters were done so amazingly in this movie. All the characters were interesting. Until Disney classics, like, say 'Beauty and the Beast' there wasn't a character that I didn't truly care for.Overall, 'The Lion King' is quite possibly the greatest animation film and one of the greatest films ever made that gets everything right.

They gloss over any American fault in the conflict and substitute flag waving propaganda and unabashed military patriotism.The action in the movie is uninspired and generic, almost every shot could have been in another movie and there isn't an original idea to be had.Even the climax of the movie when the 'heros' are escaping via vehicle shows so many shots of rooftops lined with terrorist looking dudes that if I cared I would have rewound some of it to see if they used the same footage multiple times.If you're an American that believes their military can do no wrong, by all means enjoy this as much as you're able.If you're not American or you are an American who is not pleased with the military direction of the country then you might not enjoy this movie.However, I don't like to encourage people not to see a movie just because I didn't like it so if the cover looks interesting to you and you like war movies give it a chance I guess.

I'm amazed at how smart and funny this movie is. The film is a humorous and yet sad satire on how blacks are betrayed in film and television. The film focuses on Bobby Taylor (Robert Townsend) as he attempts to become a successful actor. It features over the top white Hollywood casting agents, producers, and directors who provide feedback to black actors (in some cases classically trained) on how to act more black or be like Eddie Murphy. The film is set-up as a series of vignettes which are all good but I had two favorites. One is a vignette that involves a television show called Sneakin' in the Movies which is a parody of Siskel and Ebert reviews, involving two ghetto teenagers. They review four movies Amadeus meets Salieri, Chicago Jones and the Temple of Doom, Dirty Larry, and Attack of the Street Pimps. They're assessments, especially on what would really happen to Dirty Larry (a parody on the movie Dirty Harry) involve so many funny quotable lines that I dare you to not find yourself repeating one of them. The other vignette features Keenen Ivory Wayans as Jheri Curl. Now this second vignette might be hard to get unless you grew up in the 80s.Despite the topic, the film is not mean spirited but uses humor to educate us on the stereotypes we frequently see (even today) when it comes to blacks in film and TV and it's not hard to see how this enlightenment we have obtained would expand to other minorities and diverse groups like Hispanics, Asians, or gays. It's good to learn and laugh at the same time &#x96; Enjoy!

Or it could be a real one that judy was suffering from, after all who could resist kissing those beautiful lips? Anyway, a great film, I never tire of it and one of Mr Poitier's finest performances' yes the theme song does get used quite a bit = but to me it is never obtrusive as its such a great song sung by one of England's greatest girl singers and it enhances the mood of the scene.Possible the finest example of the high school film genre.Also- perhaps this film UK TV series Please Sir, there are some obvious differences but perhaps the makers of Please Sir decided to take the basic plot and give it a comedic twist? A great iconic 60's film.
