[{"date":"10 October 2015","score":"","review":" You can always tell, that you're watching a Wes Anderson's film, due to his many, now, iconic film signatures. While, the 1996 film, Bottle Rocket was his debut work; most of his well-known monikers were establish, here in his second film, Rushmore. Rushmore tells the story of a gifted precocious young student, Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), whom is incredibly bright, but scatterbrained, preferring to do extracurricular activities, instead of actual schoolwork. When, an attractive new teacher, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) arrives at his school, Rushmore Academy, he became so smitten with her, that he willing to do, anything to be, with her. Even, fight with his mentor\/friend Herman Blume (Bill Murray), a local business, over her affection. Can Max's young heart win Rosemary's love, or will the seasoned, Herman gain the upper hand, in this romantic comedy? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, thank goodness, this love-affair movie remains lighthearted and whimsical throughout, because it really could come off, as disturbing and particularly dark, with the wrong director. After all, a comedy about two intimacy seekers, a perverted middle age man & a teenager boy hopelessly stalking after a woman, can seem a bit Erotomania in the wrong eyes and could be frown-upon, by others. Also, it's a bit hard to watch to see, two friends, nearly kill each other, over something stupid. Somehow, Wes Anderson was able to make the concept seem likable, without really changing much of the story to fit, a family-friendly mold. Often, others obsessive love-story movies for me, always seem a bit annoying & exaggerated, but Rushmore was not only, able to be, entertaining, but very well-received, kinda funny. No wonder, this quirky coming of age movie has a cult following. It's weird to think, that this was Jason Schwartzman's first film. He looks so seasoned. Bill Murray, on another hand, save his then dying-career with this film. He pretty much, owns a life-debt to Anderson. He has been in every Wes Anderson films, as of this writing, ever-since. Still, he was just alright for the most part, in this role. I love both of their off-kilter performances, here, even if it's not much of a stretch, in 'let's say, acting'. After all, Jason Schwartzman in person, is kinda an oddball, and Bill Murray, looks so wore-down by age, that it's hard to say, that he even, acting any differing. Still, I love their chemistry, together. It reminds me, so much of 1971's Harold and Maude, with their May-December friendship. Anderson has always been noted for his unique 'literary geek chic' writing style. Anderson's films are often known for its character-driven plot full of melancholic elements. Themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, adultery, and unlikely friendships are some of his best. It shows here. I love his exclusive way of fitting in, the oddest of cultural references such as Jacques Costeau & Jacque Henri Lartique in his own unique, ingenious style. Any scene with the Max Fischer Players performing on stage is a great example of that. I also love his taste in music. Anderson frequently uses a lot of British pop music from the 1960s and 70s on the soundtracks of his films. In Rushmore, Cat Stevens and British Invasion groups are used, very well. It's doesn't drown out, the visually on the screen. Much has been written about director Wes Anderson's style in filmmaking as well. Visually, his films always stand out, due to his often bright, but also limited color palette. I love, his often retro look. Anderson has also been noted for his extensive use of obsessively symmetrical compositions, flat space camera moves, snap-zooms, and slow-motion walking shots. All-well used here. His use of hand-made artwork by his brother, Eric Chase Anderson also worth-noting. These stylistic choices give his movies a highly distinctive quality in surrealism. His films has often provoked much critical study, discussion, supercuts and mash-ups, and even parody. Rushmore is no different. However, while the movie is quirky, colorful, and highly glamorous. I, personally, don't think, its director Wes Anderson's best film. I like his later works, somewhat more. His kooky European hyper-realistic imagery style is more of my taste. It was somewhat limited here, due to the films modern U.S settling, and lack of fantasy elements. Overall While, the movie does have some faults. Rushmore is still, an intensely intellectual film worth checking out. It's compelling visually as well, as verbally. I do recommended.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"10 October 2015","score":"","review":" After Friday part 5 was a commercial failure, fans screamed out for the return of Jason (the REAL Jason)and the answer came in the form of a Frankenstein lightning bolt. This one movie changed Jason for life by making him a zombie and separating him from the slew of slasher villains(namely Michael Myers).The films starts off with Tommy Jarvis digging up Jason's corpse and preparing to burn it, but out of nowhere a lightning bolt strikes Jason's corpse. Jason has now been reanimated, Tommy's worst fear. Tommy runs to the police, but unfortunately for him Sheriff Garris ( David Kagen ) knows that Tommy as spent time in a mental hospital. Thinking that Tommy is crazy, Garris locks him up for the night. The next morning, His daughter Megan and some counselors show up, hoping that the police will know where some of the friends are, not knowing that they were killed by Jason the night before. Megan takes an interest to Tommy, which leads to her helping Tommy in his quest to stop Jason. The thing that gives this movie an advantage over most installments of the franchise is has a bit more plot than your average Friday the 13th movie. This movie does not have an amazing story by any stretch of the imagination but it is nice to see some effort put into the story, rather then just go with  Jason's on the loose . The thing I like most about the narrative is that the director (Tom McLoughlin) makes his characters self-aware , a decade before Scream did this. In order to fit this happy-go-lucky slasher flick Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) is altered appropriately. Tommy had a serious case of P.T.S.D in the previous film, but that all changes. Tommy is now just guy with some issues. Tommy's nerdier aspects are changed too, like his love of making masks and special effects. These changes make Tommy less complicated and interesting, but I personally like Thom Matthews as Tommy. Matthews has this kind of charisma that makes for an entertaining performance and he has good chemistry with Jennifer Cook as Megan. Megan is a little different from the usual Friday The 13th final girl. The usual final girl in a Friday film are mature and not heavily involved with someone, the exception being Amy Steel's Ginny Field. Megan is more assertive and outgoing then the others before her, and is definitely not mature. Sheriff Garris is almost a secondary antagonist in the film. He is always locking Tommy up and all together, just making stopping Jason more challenging. He does do the logical thing for a person in his position to do though, like when he locks up Tommy for grabbing for some guns. Would you let a guy you know has mental issues go and grab a loaded gun? Or when he fires his gun at Jason, sees they have no effect, and instead of just standing there like most slasher film characters, he makes a runs for it. Now about Jason Voorhees, the REAL Star of the movie. While Jason does not change much physically except for a rotted head, he does get this bad ass utility belt which makes him a horror movie Batman. Some people complain that Jason is too zombie like but I think this is a fine as Jason still gets the job done and he has never been the fastest killer around. It became a problem in later sequels when Jason can punch off heads or twist head around with a push. Speaking of the kills, they are not as over the top or creative as the kills in the previous films and pretty light on the gore and that can sometimes be a deal breaker for slasher films for some people. Also this film has no nudity, something that all the others have. The films score is made by Harry Manfredini and is not the usual Friday the 13th theme. The usual themes in the previous movies are here, but there is some new additions. One particularity memorable theme is the one that plays as Jason dawns his hockey mask. The new themes had some freshness to the series, which was really needed at that point. The film also features a few songs by Alice Cooper. There is a particularly good song  The Man Behind The Mask  that was made for this movie, that is really fitting. And finally at the end of this film Tommy Jarvis chains Jason to the bottom of Crystal Lake, bringing the series full circle. There is a cut ending where Jason's father is shown and it is hinted that he would make an appearance in the series. It sucks that this ending was cut from the film because if Jason's father had made an appearance in a sequel with Thom Matthews as the lead, this could have actually created a story in the series. Unfortunately Paramount took the easy way out and this did not happen. All and all this is a great slasher movie and easily one of the best of the series, if not the best. It sure as hell is my favourite, and I would recommend this movie to newcomers to the series (or the first one) even though it is the sixth installment, because in the Friday the 13th franchise almost all of the movies are the same. Although this movie lacks any actual horror, it is still an entertaining and great sequel.Worth a watch for slasher movie fans7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 October 2015","score":"","review":" After Friday part 5 was a commercial failure, fans screamed out for the return of Jason (the REAL Jason)and the answer came in the form of a Frankenstein lightning bolt.

Robocop 2 was a flawed , but decent sequel that was almost universally hated by the audiences and the critics. Too bad , because it stayed true to the original. It didn't had the freshness , depth or heart of the first one , yet the violent action and dark satire was still there. The franchise still had potential and I believe that with some effort there was still a chance for interesting next installments. Unfortunately the Orion studio had financial problems . They decided to make Robocop 3 as a family friendly action movie rated PG-13 in desperate attempt to gain as wide audience as it is possible. Robocop 3 was filmed in 1991, but was not released until end of 1993 due to production company Orion going bankrupt. The result ? A movie that is one of the worst movies EVER and a final nail to the franchise coffin.Making a Robocop 3 movie with PG-13 rating makes just as much sense as making a porn movie with no sex at all ( maybe with some brief nudity here and there). ITS TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT of the original movie ! It has no heart, no brains, sly social commentary and no hard violence. Robocop 3 became the very thing that first two movies were often laughing at &#x96; a politically correct hero in a gutless , soulless and brainless Hollywood movie.To be honest a PG-13 Robocop 3 movie COULD work. The story has some potential and you can make a exciting and deep PG-13 action movie (The Dark knight). Unfortunately the whole movie seems to be aimed at kids and has a cartoon approach to it that just doesn't works. I'm amazed that this even is rated PG-13 , not PG.Peter Weller made a wise decision not returning to the role of Robo and choosing Naked lunch to do instead. I recommend to watch that movie instead of Robocop 3 . It may not be for everyone , but at least it's entertaining. Orion tried to hire Michael Dudikoff (American ninja) , but ended with Robert Burke . I can't say anything else about him except that he was in this movie. And that for some reason the studio modified his voice so it sounds annoying. Dan O'Herlihy, the old man from the first two films, does not appear in this film. The rest of the regular cast is back , unfortunately they don't have too much to do.Robocop here is basically a zombie with no personality. He also disappears for a large part of the movie. The regular cast has very little screen time and awful dialogue to work with. The new characters are annoying , especially Nico &#x96; kid genius hacker. The main villain is not one bit interesting or menacing. The acting here is awful with people either underplaying or overplaying their parts.The story here takes some elements from what comic book writer Frank Miller prepared for Robocop 2 . Mind that both Robocop 2 and Robocop 3 were heavily rewritten and have only few elements from Miller's original script. The story here could work. Unfortunately the screenplay is filled with cheap humor , predictability and stupidity. I found a site on internet which points out that Robocop 3 has faults in every scene ! The direction by Fred Dekker is apathetic. The pacing is lackluster. The action scenes are pathetic. The special effects are embarrassing , especially when you consider that Jurassic Park was in theaters that same year.This movie deserves every bad comment it gets. There are no redeeming qualities to this junk. After this movie there were two lame TV shows and cartoon. The franchise was slaughtered. I give it 1\/10.

The direction by Fred Dekker is apathetic. The pacing is lackluster. The action scenes are pathetic.

Robocop 2 was a flawed , but decent sequel that was almost universally hated by the audiences and the critics. Too bad , because it stayed true to the original. It didn't had the freshness , depth or heart of the first one , yet the violent action and dark satire was still there. The franchise still had potential and I believe that with some effort there was still a chance for interesting next installments. Unfortunately the Orion studio had financial problems . They decided to make Robocop 3 as a family friendly action movie rated PG-13 in desperate attempt to gain as wide audience as it is possible. Robocop 3 was filmed in 1991, but was not released until end of 1993 due to production company Orion going bankrupt. The result ? A movie that is one of the worst movies EVER and a final nail to the franchise coffin.Making a Robocop 3 movie with PG-13 rating makes just as much sense as making a porn movie with no sex at all ( maybe with some brief nudity here and there). ITS TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT of the original movie ! It has no heart, no brains, sly social commentary and no hard violence. Robocop 3 became the very thing that first two movies were often laughing at &#x96; a politically correct hero in a gutless , soulless and brainless Hollywood movie.To be honest a PG-13 Robocop 3 movie COULD work. The story has some potential and you can make a exciting and deep PG-13 action movie (The Dark knight).

Make sure you're not squeamish by the sight of decapitated limbs and swords smashing into samurais. Kurosawa is the original master of the violent Japanese samurai flick. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino gets down on his knees and prays to him by his bedside at night. This genre of film that he created is based upon the period of Jidaigeki, which has its origins in Kabuki theater. It's the music of the swords. It's the story of brave samurais fighting in honor of their families and towns. It might sound foreign to you, but it's really not. Jidaigeki genre movies supplied many concepts and ideas that inspired what we all know as the Spaghetti Western. Well, you should know, it was a little too inspired, but that's a story to get into another day. Kurosawa's films have an amazing shelf life to cinephiles across the globe, and none more important than Rashoman. But I have just watched, what I feel to be the best example of Kurosawa's influence on the western genre, and what I feel to be an especially compelling and entertaining piece of work, Yujimbo. Yojimbo has a story, not that complicated, and told so many times, you'd think you've sat down to watch some clichéd schlock. As I've stated before, it's about the lone hero, or in this case, the lone samurai, who somewhere along his travels comes upon a village that has been split between two rival gangs. In the town are the struggling families and business owners that are victimized day in and day out by the constant robberies and assaults from the gangs, as well the insufferable and corrupt police officer that gleefully capitulates to the two rival gangs. They ravage throughout the town, and out of sympathy for the townspeople, or perhaps just for the hell of it, the lone samurai decides to pit the two against each other in order for them to fight to death. It is out of his virtue to save the town from the hands of crime, and he's well aware of it very early on in the film, as he notices a dog carrying a severed human hand around the town. This is the Wild West, or shall we say, the wild east. In this little town, the lone samurai helps cause chaos and showdowns abound as the rival gangs fight for territory. It's almost comedic how much manipulation he has over them. I loved how it didn't always work out. For instance, the lone samurai is seen overhearing a conversation of the hotel owners planning to kill him in order to not pay for his stay. It seems like he's been causing a lot of trouble, much to the chagrin of the town's people. I really enjoyed the balance between action, story and humor. Unlike Rashoman that captivates with a rigid, dramatic story with a lot of unsightly, gruesome characters trying to eat each other alive, this is a fun little western. It's a classic in the genre as it gets. The lone samurai even bears a strange resemblance his American counterpart, Clint Eastwood, complete with his squinty eyes and scowl. The man in question is Toshiro Mifune, and he has a spectacular track record with Akira Kurosawa. Every time he collaborates with him, you're going to get an unbelievable performance. In Rashoman he was the insane, giggling bandit, and here, he's the silent, master of the sword, who could cut your arm off with a single blow. He's the original badass movie star. Even when he goes down, he goes down hard. When the lone samurai gets captured towards the end of the film, he is seen slowly and painfully making his mistake. This probably was my favorite scene, for it demonstrates Mifune's range as an actor, and his willingness to discomfort himself for the benefit of the story. The picture also has a really unique soundtrack. I overheard someone in the audience chuckling about it, for it sounded a little similar to Big Band. The music fits the attitude of the picture splendidly. It's a big, loud soundtrack to a big story. The cinematography was also very ambitious for it's time, and Kurosawa's main cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, noticeably builds upon his great talent of the image since Rashoman. The battle sequences are sweeping and detailed with all the blood and guts intact. The spectacular scene in which the lone samurai is escaping is staged and shot beautifully. Miyagawa holds an exceptional gift of bringing the Edo Japanese era vibrantly to life. Yojimbo is a violent epic, and one of Kurosawa's most startlingly good achievements. It's entertaining, thrilling and a credit to the history of Japanese cinema.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"10 October 2015","score":"","review":" Dave is a 1993 comedy directed by Ivan Reitman (of Ghostbusters fame) and starring Kevin Kline who plays Dave Kovic, a man who has an uncanny resemblance to the president of the United States, Bill Mitchell, and is put in his place after he enters a coma.This is a feel-good movie about a simple man who takes a huge role as the leader of USA, and with his generous and kind spirit tries to change things a little for the better as much as he can. Kevin Kline is terrific in portraying both Dave Kovic and Bill Mitchell. The president is a cold man, who has lost all interest in his wife, portrayed by Sigourney Weaver, even cheating on her and also involving himself in some shady business. Enter Dave, a man working at a temp agency with a heart of gold.The cast in this movie is fantastic. As I mentioned, Sigourney Weaver plays his wife, who knows all about her husband's indiscretions and is sick of him. Frank Langella plays Bob Alexander, the chief of staff, and even though he does a great job acting in this movie, his character sometimes feels too much like a cartoonish villain. Ving Rhames plays the head of the security, who must keep an eye on the president at all times, and sometimes shows insecurity about trying to protect a clown, as he perceives Dave at first. Ben Kingsley also has a short role as vice-president Nance and he steals every scene.Of course some of the plot elements in the movie are a tad ridiculous and this could never work, but frankly, it doesn't need to. It's just a movie with a great premise, and for the most part it works. It has the right balance of comedy, drama and character development. A perfect movie for a rainy day, when you just wanna lay on the couch with a blanket on and a cup of cocoa. I give this movie a 8 out of 10!

It bleeds character and emotion of all kinds. It's not very pleasant to watch the whole time despite the joy of some scenes. In the end, it leaves you with a bittersweet aftertaste that you're not likely to lose for a while. As with the Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont is not afraid to horrify us by showing some of the worst treatment that men can give each other. But he rewards us with the righteous actions of the protagonists.Our protagonists are clearly good men who make the best of their job of execution. Paul Edgecombe is our typical passive Tom Hanks character who happens to be present for incredible events, but comes out changed because of it. The secondary protagonist is falsely convicted child murderer John Cofey, a gentle giant with incredible powers and kindness. We get some exposition of the other guards and have reason to sympathize for them. They know how to treat their prisoners, whether by giving them the best death they can under the circumstances, or cracking the whip when necessary. We get to know a few of the other prisoners as well, particularly Dale and Wild Bill. It's great that the two of them have such incredible contrast because it shows us that bad men are still human but that they are also still dangerous. So having the foil of Wild Bill makes us like Dale that much more. Then comes our antagonist, Percy. Now, there are some villains that we're meant to just hate or just love, but Percy is someone that we love to hate. He abuses his privileged background by making the prisoners lives as miserable as he can. The thing that I think really makes him so detestable is that he stays within the rules of the law, but not within the rules of common decency. And he really shows us how bad you can legally be. His actions during Dale's execution are just about the epitome of adding insult to injury. Whenever I thought that the other guards were punishing him too cruelly, I would think back to Dale's execution and think, Yeah, he deserves every bit of that. There are a few other minor characters such as the warden Hal and his wife, Paul's wife, and Arlen the first man they execute. Despite what problems people might have with the three-hour runtime, I would argue that it was definitely worth making the movie that long because of how good it developed the characters.There isn't really a plot outside of the constant character development unless you count the progression of revealing John Cofey's powers and innocence. In these scenes there are a lot of setups and payoffs with the three people that John heals. I think having John heal Paul of a urinary infection was a good move. At first, the choice of ailment seems kind of gross, but making it something that personal and painful I think engages the audience a little better than something like a stomachache would. Then, we see John's power have an emotional impact when he revives Mr. Jangles and cures Hal's wife. One last story point I want to comment on is the development of the electric chair. We get the basics on how the whole execution process works, then see the peaceful death of Arlen. An hour or so later we see Dale's horrible execution and the horrors that occur when something goes wrong. Then at the end, we have the beautifully sad death of John. I don't know quite why, but I thought the sequence that those were shown in was perfect.The script is nice and consistent with each character and has pretty realistic dialogue. The acting is top notch because the actors are there to act and not to pose as models or anything like that. There aren't any great camera angles or tricks, but I guess it was well shot.I would recommend this to just about everybody, even people who don't like long movies. There might be some scenes where you have to close your eyes due to emotional impact rather than gore. I guess the only reason you shouldn't watch it is if you don't like serious movies or have trouble paying attention. Aside from that, I see no reason for anyone to not at least give this a try.

Similar movies to this one are Robocop and Starship troopers (both by Paul Verhoven).

This is an action film that actually has a brain in its head and has something to say.The vision of future world here is undeniably original and memorable. What is more admirable is that many of things seen here are happening in REAL world. The world is obsessed with political correctness and Demolition man shows what would happen if we went to far with it. San Angeles is so nice and non-threatening that it's almost scary. Profanity , meat , alcohol and sex are outlawed. Radio and TV commercials are the pinnacle of music art in this world. Strict morality is enforced through constant computer monitoring of behavior.This is a movie about freedom of choice, about rights. If I want to eat unhealthy food allow me. Otherwise you are a fascist. A perfect world will never exist. The world in Demolition man looks perfect on the outside , but inside it's basically a totalitarian system. . The anti-utopian, anti-utilitarian political message, like that of George Orwell's 1984 or Aldous Huxley's Brave New World couldn't be clearer. Ask yourself &#x96; How much freedom I would sacrifice in return for safety ? Sylvester Stallone wisely plays is character with ironic distance and gives a good performance. Wesley Snipes steals the show as the villain with a Joker-like personality. Sandra Bullock is adorable here and her comic timing is great. I love how she is messing up all the colloquialisms. Denis Leary has small but important and fun role as the leader of rebels. Rob Schneider plays a police phone operator in a small role , but thankfully isn't annoying.

The dialogues are also good and filled with nice one liners. The Schwarzenegger library &#x96; oh man , this joke almost became truth ! In 2003, ten years after this film's release, Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California and shortly after his election, three senators separately proposed amendments to the US Constitution to allow naturalized citizens to become president. The script by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lemkov deserves a lot of praise.Technically, the film is quite solid. The production design, cinematography, effects, staging of the action sequences, score and soundtrack are good. The look of the future as seen in Demolition Man is credible, right now we certainly have the talking cars, video phones & the CCTV.Marco Brambilla did a good job as the director . The movie is never boring , moves like a rocket and the blend of action and satire is perfect. The action scenes are suitably over the top & there are enough fights, shoot-outs, car chases & things being blown up spectacularly to satisfy action fans.Great light hearted 90's sci-fi action flick with a lot of substance and quotable dialogue.

Demolition man is VERY funny and charming sci-fi action movie that has also A LOT of substance . It's sad and annoying when people say that it's a so bad it's good  or  guilty pleasure type of movie. They simply don't understand what the movie is about. It's a SATIRE people ! It is intentionally cheesy and over the top to get the point across. Similar movies to this one are Robocop and Starship troopers (both by Paul Verhoven). If you want to watch it only as a funny action movie that's fine , but you're missing the thought provoking questions here. It's an important philosophical movie done with tongue-in-cheek attitude. This is an action film that actually has a brain in its head and has something to say.The vision of future world here is undeniably original and memorable. What is more admirable is that many of things seen here are happening in REAL world. The world is obsessed with political correctness and Demolition man shows what would happen if we went to far with it. San Angeles is so nice and non-threatening that it's almost scary. Profanity , meat , alcohol and sex are outlawed. Radio and TV commercials are the pinnacle of music art in this world. Strict morality is enforced through constant computer monitoring of behavior.This is a movie about freedom of choice, about rights. If I want to eat unhealthy food allow me. Otherwise you are a fascist. A perfect world will never exist. The world in Demolition man looks perfect on the outside , but inside it's basically a totalitarian system. . The anti-utopian, anti-utilitarian political message, like that of George Orwell's 1984 or Aldous Huxley's Brave New World couldn't be clearer. Ask yourself &#x96; How much freedom I would sacrifice in return for safety ? Sylvester Stallone wisely plays is character with ironic distance and gives a good performance. Wesley Snipes steals the show as the villain with a Joker-like personality. Sandra Bullock is adorable here and her comic timing is great. I love how she is messing up all the colloquialisms. Denis Leary has small but important and fun role as the leader of rebels. Rob Schneider plays a police phone operator in a small role , but thankfully isn't annoying. There is even Jack Black somewhere in the sewer in cameo appearance.The movie is very funny. I love the humor and the sharp satirical edge .Who could forget the three shells. The dialogues are also good and filled with nice one liners. The Schwarzenegger library &#x96; oh man , this joke almost became truth ! In 2003, ten years after this film's release, Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California and shortly after his election, three senators separately proposed amendments to the US Constitution to allow naturalized citizens to become president. The script by Daniel Waters, Robert Reneau & Peter M. Lemkov deserves a lot of praise.Technically, the film is quite solid. The production design, cinematography, effects, staging of the action sequences, score and soundtrack are good.

Lila calls him 'grouchy' but I am forced to call Lenny repulsive. This would be fine but as I said above he is not entertaining and this I cannot forgive or overlook.

She marries him anyway.WHY on why did a female director like Elaine May agree to make this awful, misogynistic movie? I know Lenny divorces her but why did the female director have to dump the lovably human Lila in the second act and focus on Lenny's obsessive and frankly downright creepy stalking of Kelly all the way to snow-bound Minnesota? Lila's continued presence may have helped make the second act more palatable.

I and many other viewers I'm sure would have gladly traded Lenny's presence for Mr Corcoran's. A justifiable homicide would have been a far more plausible chain of events than a girl like Kelly falling for an unattractive, self-entitled loser with no prospects, no charisma, no integrity, no discernible intelligence, and no interests beyond his own gratification. Sure, girls like Kelly have been falling for and marrying jerks like Lenny since time immemorial but usually they guy has looks, money, or personality to blind the girl to his faults. Lenny is just a flat out all-around zero. No jury in the world would have convicted Mr. Corcoran for killing the wretched stalker. Instead, if you watch this movie you must resign yourself to his presence until the literally bitter end.The underlying message of The Heartbreak Kid seems to be twofold 1, that no matter how unworthy or unpleasant a man is he can still find multiple top notch ladies who will marry him; and 2, obnoxious, criminal aggression towards women is perfectly acceptable as long as it wins the day.What were the film makers thinking?

From the casting, to the fight scenes, to the music, there is nothing that I would have done any differently. There is just enough comedy, each turtle is given their own unique, identifiable, and believable personality, and the story is fast paced and gripping. Jim Henson's people did a stunning job on the Turtles themselves, and the Shredder looks even better than he did in the Cartoons. The film really pays homage to the original comics by introducing Casey Jones, dealing with Raphael's anger. Here they are Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, Michaelangelo are bad ass. Splinter, Tatso, Casey Jones they are all bad ass including Raphael. My favorite best movie. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 1990 American live-action, independent film, directed by Steve Barron, based on the comic book characters of the same name. It was released on March 30, 1990. titular characters.A group of mutated turtle warriors must emerge from the shadows to protect New York City from an uprising criminal gang of ninjas.There is everything I love in this film. The acting, Jim Henson's creature shop were awesome. Fighting scenes, the foot clan, children who steals for foot clan. All characters are awesome. The cast, the plot everything is Terrific in this film. Why rebooting this film? Why? The original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) is the only film for me that I absolutely love to death! I grew up with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I had an album of the animated series from 1987, I was collecting action figure from the third film that failed. I grew up watching this film and is always my favorite best action movie of the 90's I have ever seen. The fight stunts are awesome, the Acton sequences are amazing. Everything is just great in this film.The film has some Drama in it, the character development between the Turtles and Splinter was really touching and amazing. Another character development in this film that touches me is between Danny and Charles a father and son. That scene is so touching.Judith Hoag did an amazing awesome Terrific job as April O'Neil, a reporter for Channel 3 News she acted her character very serious and convincing. For me April O'Neal will always and only be Judith Hoag. I don't get it why was she replaced in the sequels which that didn't just work. Elias Koteas did an amazing performance as Casey Jones, a street wise vigilante who becomes an ally of the Turtles. He was the only Casey Jones for me he kicked ass! Seriously he did!!The fight scene on the end of the film is the best I have ever saw. Here the foot clans and Ninja Turtles are using weapons. Like foot clans use Axes in April's apartment to kill the Turtles, but they failed. One of the foot clan Ninja's used a nunchaku weapons similar to Michelangelo weapons. The fight scene with Raphael on the roof was fantastic one of the best scenes in the film I love. This film is highly entertained, it is fast paced, not too over long or boring or lame it is a are real true Comic book Ninja Turtles film. It also has a heart bringing a family together like Danny and Charles father and son together when they were falling apart. The fight scene with Turtles and The Shredder was the best scene in the film, the combat was awesome. Tough the Turtles were no match for him, Leonardo was the only one that wounded him with his sword. The last fight scene when Splinter faces The Shredder is the best thing in a film that ever happened. Splinter come on the roof he confront Shredder and in final showdown he defeat Shredder. Shredder attacked him and Splinter throw's him with Michelangelo's nunchakus and says Death comes for us all Oroku Saki but when you Die it will be without.....honor. And Shredder try's to stab him and Splinter let's him fall in a dumpster! End and Death of Shredder in the original movie.The film opened at the box office in North America on March 30, 1990, entering at #1 over the weekend and taking in more than $25 million.I love this film is my childhood film and Judith Hoag is the only April O'Neil for me. Elias Koteas will always be Casey Jones for me. I love this film to death! I love it. I love it to death!!! The best movie in the whole world. What else would you want in this film? There are a lot of martial arts in it. There were plenty used of weapons in the film Leonardo used twin Ninja-Tou, steel swords of usually inferior make to samurai swords, roughly sharpened and straight bladed, Donatello wielded a bo, a staff made of tapered hard wood, Raphael wielded two sai (both singular and plural), dagger-shaped truncheons with two curved prongs and Michelangelo fought with twin nunchaku. Fight clan also used Axes.

Splinter, Tatso, Casey Jones they are all bad ass including Raphael. My favorite best movie. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a 1990 American live-action, independent film, directed by Steve Barron, based on the comic book characters of the same name. It was released on March 30, 1990. titular characters.A group of mutated turtle warriors must emerge from the shadows to protect New York City from an uprising criminal gang of ninjas.There is everything I love in this film. The acting, Jim Henson's creature shop were awesome. Fighting scenes, the foot clan, children who steals for foot clan. All characters are awesome. The cast, the plot everything is Terrific in this film. Why rebooting this film? Why? The original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) is the only film for me that I absolutely love to death! I grew up with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I had an album of the animated series from 1987, I was collecting action figure from the third film that failed. I grew up watching this film and is always my favorite best action movie of the 90's I have ever seen. The fight stunts are awesome, the Acton sequences are amazing. Everything is just great in this film.The film has some Drama in it, the character development between the Turtles and Splinter was really touching and amazing. Another character development in this film that touches me is between Danny and Charles a father and son. That scene is so touching.Judith Hoag did an amazing awesome Terrific job as April O'Neil, a reporter for Channel 3 News she acted her character very serious and convincing. For me April O'Neal will always and only be Judith Hoag. I don't get it why was she replaced in the sequels which that didn't just work. Elias Koteas did an amazing performance as Casey Jones, a street wise vigilante who becomes an ally of the Turtles. He was the only Casey Jones for me he kicked ass! Seriously he did!!The fight scene on the end of the film is the best I have ever saw. Here the foot clans and Ninja Turtles are using weapons. Like foot clans use Axes in April's apartment to kill the Turtles, but they failed. One of the foot clan Ninja's used a nunchaku weapons similar to Michelangelo weapons. The fight scene with Raphael on the roof was fantastic one of the best scenes in the film I love. This film is highly entertained, it is fast paced, not too over long or boring or lame it is a are real true Comic book Ninja Turtles film. It also has a heart bringing a family together like Danny and Charles father and son together when they were falling apart. The fight scene with Turtles and The Shredder was the best scene in the film, the combat was awesome. Tough the Turtles were no match for him, Leonardo was the only one that wounded him with his sword. The last fight scene when Splinter faces The Shredder is the best thing in a film that ever happened. Splinter come on the roof he confront Shredder and in final showdown he defeat Shredder. Shredder attacked him and Splinter throw's him with Michelangelo's nunchakus and says Death comes for us all Oroku Saki but when you Die it will be without.....honor. And Shredder try's to stab him and Splinter let's him fall in a dumpster! End and Death of Shredder in the original movie.The film opened at the box office in North America on March 30, 1990, entering at #1 over the weekend and taking in more than $25 million.I love this film is my childhood film and Judith Hoag is the only April O'Neil for me. Elias Koteas will always be Casey Jones for me. I love this film to death! I love it. I love it to death!!! The best movie in the whole world. What else would you want in this film? There are a lot of martial arts in it. There were plenty used of weapons in the film Leonardo used twin Ninja-Tou, steel swords of usually inferior make to samurai swords, roughly sharpened and straight bladed, Donatello wielded a bo, a staff made of tapered hard wood, Raphael wielded two sai (both singular and plural), dagger-shaped truncheons with two curved prongs and Michelangelo fought with twin nunchaku. Fight clan also used Axes.

It is one of my favorite comic book films and it is also one of my childhood favorites. You haven't already rated the movie well, please do so we can push the current 6.7 rating as high as it can go!! As a lifelong Turtles fan, I can honestly say that everything about this movie works. From the casting, to the fight scenes, to the music, there is nothing that I would have done any differently. There is just enough comedy, each turtle is given their own unique, identifiable, and believable personality, and the story is fast paced and gripping.

It is the first installment of the Jurassic Park film series. It is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton, with a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film centers on the fictional Isla Nublar, an islet located off Central America's Pacific Coast, near Costa Rica, where a billionaire philanthropist and a small team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of cloned dinosaurs.Jurassic Park is the second Steven's Spielberg Classic cult Film. A great science fiction\/action\/adventure film. This film is great edge of your seat action sequences. It has a wonderful cast with wonderful performance of their characters. John Williams music score is excellent the same like is in Indiana Jones films. Beside Raiders of the Lost Ark is the second Best classic movie in the franchise. Jurassic Park (1993) was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Best Sound, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects.I love this film to death! It is been 22.years since we got this awesome adventure dinosaurs flick. I know a couple of friends of mine that love this film including me. It is a cult classic film and It has a heart. We have Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing the group, Velociraptors chasing Tim and Lex after they are reaching the visitor center and they are in inside the main kitchen. Dilophosaurus killing Nerdy. We also have Triceratops in it and Brachiosaurus. They are other dinosaurs used in the film Gallimimus, Parasaurolophus and Alamosaurus they both had a cameo scene in it. The special effects creating the dinosaurs by Stan Winston are FANTASTIC! The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats. Stan Winston and his team did a great job animating live Dinosaurs on a screen. Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job directing this film, it is definitely my second best childhood film from Steven Spielberg. The first best film would be Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) which I love this film to death. The screen play written by Michael Crichton and David Koepp did a great job and the plot of the film was just awesome. The plot During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.The crew cast all did a wonderful job of acting. The acting of this film was terrific and believable. Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, a leading paleontologist did a wonderful job portraying his character. He act the character like he was written on his skin. Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler, a paleobotanist. did a wonderful job like how she cared about an ill Triceratops. I was really surprised how the character cares about an ill dinosaurs that she barely know and she wanted to help him was out stating! Laura Dern for me in this film was a heart and a key watching this film of how a good hearted person she is. Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and chaos theorist was really good in his acting and his character. Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, InGen's billionaire CEO and the park's creator was awesome playing his character. It is really a shame Richard Attenborough died last year and he isn't with us anymore. Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello as Lex and Tim did a wonderful job portraying John Hammonds grand children. I didn't know Samuel L. Jackson was in this film I really didn't know that. The whole cast was awesome in here.Music by score by John Williams is fabulous and fantastic I always love this song to death. There is everything in this film I love. How Dr. Grant, Lex and Tim are fighting to survive when they are trapped alone in the park. How tough and strong they are they don't panic and screaming they are fighting to come back save home. Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of raptors inside the main kitchen. In one of the most terrifying scenes in the entire film, the raptors stalk through the dark kitchen, searching for the kids. Eventually, Lex and Tim manage to lure one of the raptors into the freezer and lock it in, but the other raptor chases them out of the kitchen. The scene was the most memorable to me and terrifying. Another terrifying scene is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her, that also scared me a lot. After the power was cut off on the electric fences and the kids with Alan are climbing over the fences and the power is turn back on by Ellie and Ray the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence. The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real. I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!!

The scene was awesome but also terrifying and real. I'm not sure what else you would want in a movie like this?! It is a perfect 10. I love this film to death! I love this film to death!! The action sequences are also awesome, the plot, the cast everything is great about this film. 10\/10 Score Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio  Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment Starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Bob Peck, Martin Ferrero, BD Wong, Samuel L.

I was hooked in the first few minutes of the movie and it just kept getting better and better and then the final scene tops it all off. Wonderful movie.By contrast, I didn't really get into Poltergeist. I actually just watched this for the first time and I thought, Eh. One thing I thought that was odd was that they didn't call the police after their child had been missing for a few days. Can you imagine that!? They kinda know where the child is, but not really. And also, after the child goes missing, there are lighthearted moments in which people smile, offer comforting, uplifting words of encouragement, and I think someone might have even laughed at some point.Can you imagine that!? Think if your small child was missing - could you smile about anything? I don't think so, I don't think that that's possible. You'd be overwhelmed by anxiety, fear, doubt, and worry.I guess there was just something that didn't add up psychologically. And the son didn't say, Hey, the tree broke through the window, grabbed me, and threw me out of the house. Nope! Doesn't say a word about it!!! And this is AFTER he mentions that he doesn't like the tree to his father earlier! Ahh, come on.I think this is a really overrated movie. I gave it a 5, and that's just because I like Tobe Hooper. It's probably around a 4 if I'm being honest, but what's the difference anyway. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 October 2015","score":"","review":" My favorite movie by Tobe Hooper is The Funhouse.

Doris Day's music albums sold more copies than any other artist's music during the period (even Elvis Presley), and her films were some of the most popular, beating out Marilyn Monroe by leaps and bounds. (It wasn't until after her death that Monroe became the most iconic female movie star of the era, overshadowing Day.) Doris Day was the perpetual Hollywood virgin, the direct antithesis of Marilyn Monroe.The Pajama Game is typical Doris Day musical fair, a film version of the Broadway hit musical. Workers at a clothing factory which produce, you guessed it, sleepwear, are tired of the bad working conditions and low pay. Katherine Babe Williams (Doris Day) is one of the factory workers but she's also involved with the union leadership which threatens to strike if working conditions aren't improved and they don't receive a raise to bring them in line with industry standards. Enter Sid Sorokin (John Raitt), the new floor manager. Day and Raitt begin to fall in love (no surprise there), but they're on opposite sides of the dispute Day on the worker's side and Raitt on the management side.The typical Hollywood W, a shape representing the up's and down's of a story, forms how the storyline progresses. At first things begin to get better for everyone involved with the arrival of Raitt as a good floor manager. However, when their requests are still not met, Day and her fellow workers begin to pull stunts of sorts to compel the management to agree to their demands. However, Raitt asserts his authority on the worker's floor and Day is forced to take the other side. All the while, the head honcho of the factory, Myron Hasler, has no intention of bending to the will of the factory workers in stereotypical fashion.Overall, the Pajama Game is really designed for the hardcore and fiercely loyal Doris Day fan. The music is a bit corny and the dance sequences go on way too long. Sure, there's nothing offensive about the Pajama Game, as the point it makes about workers and management is not terribly deep. The ending is as you would expect it, although there's a kind of fashion show at the end which is certainly cute. Even by Doris Day standards, this isn't one of her better offerings.
