After reading the book, I couldn't wait to see Ian Malcolm return and I couldn't wait to see the other characters in the book come to life on the big screen.  Little did I know.*SPOILIERS*  Not that it would matter to me.The only thing that remotely connects this movie to the book is the fact that it has the same title, Ian Malcolm, Sarah Harding and Eddie Carr and it takes place on a different island with dinosaurs.  I was highly upset.  Then they put that punk old man back in the movie and I still wanted him to die.Here is my main problem with the movie.  The InGen company has been reorganized with new directors and executive officers.  They want to take the dinosaurs off the island and bring them to the new Jurassic Park in San Diego.  Now, they created the dinosaurs, so what was the problem if they wanted to take the animals off the island and bring them to America?  They belong to the company.So up pops along Vince Vaughn who is a Major League (you fill in the blank) and he decides to take it upon himself to liberate the dinosaurs.  So he ralleys up the troops and he feels like freakin Moses walking around the camp with his chain cutters, breaking the bonds of the dinosaurs who then wreck the camp and kill innocent people.  Then, after stumbling on the baby T-Rex, he brings it to the camp to have it's leg fixed.  But didn't somebody think that maybe mommy and daddy T-Rex had their own medical plans and didn't like humans messing with their child.  So Ma and Pa Rex come through and wreck their base and kills one of their men in the process.  All this so little Vince could play liberator.  If you really think about it, he the one at fault for everything that happens in the movie.  And it makes me so mad during the scene when he takes the bullets out of the man's gun and then the dude can't kill the T-Rex that is trying to kill him and his men.  And what makes it worse is the fact that he is regarded as the hero in the movie.  That was stupid.I like Jeff Goldblum, but he stutters his way through this movie as if he is just reading lines.  Julianne Moore's character made me upset in the movie because I thought she was stupid shouting orders to people who don't even belong to her group.  If I were the Marlboro men in that movie, the second she told me that we have to move now, that would have been the second I'd tie her narrow behind up on the nearest tree, cut open a vein and let her hang with the rest of the meat.  Her and her boyfriend Vince.  (As you can see I have nothing but hate for her.  Just wait until I review the Fugitive.)My suggestions to Steven is that you focus more on the book and stick with that and keep the Earth First concept out of the movie because that's what hung it for me.  Not that I'm against protecting the environment and animals, but what happened in this movie was too much and too ridiculous.  And you have no right taking such liberties as you did in changing the storyline. All and all, I hate this movie.  If it was more like the book, I could have handled it, but unfortunately, this is what I am forced to deal with. My suggestion for you the audience is to stay away from this movie and watch the first one.  It was so much better.

That hasn't changed.But even allowing for that, *this* is a classic film beloved by millions? Why? I mean, the setting is gorgeous, granted. And the actors do OK. But the plot, the pacing, even the music ... is this any better than most other musicals?My DVD player said this movie was almost three hours long. But *nothing happens* until you've watched it for 2 hours and 23 minutes (that's when the Nazi threat comes in). Until that point, here is the plot (and I don't think this is a spoiler for anyone, though maybe some people who haven't seen TSOM, like me until last week, might expect more) Former war captain who lives in inexplicably huge house in Austria with his seven kids and no wife meets former nun who starts as nanny and they fall in love and get married. That's it! More than two hours of kids singing, the nanny singing, the kids and nanny singing while they play, and increasingly loving looks and conversations between the captain and the nanny (though few of them compared to the singing). This plot could have occurred in less than an hour. There is very little original, or new, it. It is very, very slow. There is a minor B plot about a rich woman the captain is engaged to who bows to the inevitable and agrees to end the engagement. But that's all.There is no conflict (which most stories revolve around) until 2 hours and 23 minutes in, when the local townspeople who join the Nazis make a move. Then, when it gets interesting, the movie ends in less than 30 minutes after that point! Amazing! It ended with the family cresting a mountain and I said out loud, That is IT?! I expected much more. Watching a movie with no conflict (and the relationship between the nanny and the captain is hardly a conflict) is like idly following a river's current, with no destination in mind. If you like that kind of aimlessness, great. But if you want something that will hold your interest, and you don't enjoy aimless wandering, then TSOM isn't for you.Also, I thought the musical was amateurish in scenes that required background music. About 90 percent of the time, when two actors were having a discussion and music played in the background, that music was the melodies from various songs used elsewhere in the movie, one after another! So you are watching what is supposed to be a touching scene between the captain and the nanny outside at night, and under the dialogue is The hills are alive, with the sound of muuuuuuuusiiiiccccc! and Edel-weisssss, Edel-weissssssss, and other tunes over and over. It was *extremely* distracting. I kept trying to listen to the dialogue but my mind was filling in the words to the melodies underneath it. Couldn't the film have used the same notes as background music but dropped the melodies? It seemed very odd. I can't remember ever hearing that before in a movie, or being so distracted by it.I'm puzzled by this love for TSOM. So many people care for this film, there must be *something* to it.

However, a friend and I decided to see it anyways on a larth. How wrong I was to assume that this was going to be a simple action movie! Instead of seeing 90 minutes of kung-fu, I saw one of the most intelligent movies I had seen. Fight Club tells the story of a nameless narrator(Edward Norton.)

But as I was watching the movie, I really began to enjoy it and once the movie ended, I said, I liked it.  But, I did have some problems with the movie.For one, everything was made to be mysterious.  Why did everything have to be a big mystery and the sky blackened, and the thunder and lightning.  Fishburne almost spoke in circles the entire movie.  Neo would ask what is the matrix, and Morpheus would say something like, The matrix is what the matrix is not.  And I'm like WHAT!?!?!?!?!??!  In my opinion, all he had to do was tell Neo, this is what the situation is, and we need  your help because you are the one  who has the power to change everything.  Instead, we the audience are forced to sit through dialogue of double talk and misdirected answers in an attempt to make Neo think.  And what is the story with the Oracle?  Were are in a computer, how is she able to make predictions about the real world inside a computer?Where did the humans get the equipment to make the vehicles that they transported themselves in?  They seemed awful high tech for people from the mind set of the twentieth century to come up with?During the shoot out scene, how is it that they were able to move so fast to dodge bullets but when the agents shoot at them, it suddenly seems to be a problem to dodge them.  RE  the scene where Neo first dodges the Agents bullets and Trinity remarks on how he moved so fast.  She moved pretty fast to dodge all of those bullets and do a flip during the SWAT Team shoot out and at the beginning of the movie where she was able to run along the sides of the walls.  And as far as I'm concerned, the bullets in the gun of the SWAT Team members are faster than the one coming from the gun of the Agent.  And there are more bullets to dodge because there are more people shooting at you.And this question, I understand that since your mind is plugged into a computer your liable go brain dead if you are pulled out to quick.  I don't really buy it but I'll go with it, but why is it that if you get shot, you die, or if you fall off a building, you die?  If we know that this is fake and with our mind we can do some outrageous stuff like move faster than bullets and jump over huge gorges and bend objects at a thought, then why can't we just say, this isn't real.  When I'm hit with a bullet or with a car or I hit the ground from a one hundred story drop, I should be able to say this really didn't happen.  I'm Superman.  Where's my Kryptonite?  I hardly felt that punch by the Agent.And here is my final thought.  By the end of the movie Neo has reached his full capacity.  So why do we need sequels to the movie.  I can understand a second one to show us getting out of the matrix, but why a third one?  I don't know, maybe the have this all planned out.  Maybe Neo has what it takes but he isn't quite a Jedi yet.Now here is what I liked about the movie.The special effects were great and the fight sequences were outstanding.  The way they had them fight, I thought the actors really studied martial arts years and were really fighting, except for the obvious scenes when they would jump in the air and do kicks and when Keanu would do the back flips.  Those are what really kept me into the film, but that isn't always enough.  In the case of this movie though I think this was the exception where the special effects is one of the things that kept me into the movie, although I did like the basic storyline which I think helped keep me in the mood for the movie.I liked Carrie-Ann Moss' character and her interaction with Neo and I really like Joe Pantoliano in almost anything ever since I saw him in The Fugitive.  Larry Fishburne was in great form as usually.  I liked the interaction between Neo and Agent Smith and I got a kick out of how slow he spoke although sometimes it was over the top, but I loved it anyway.In a nutshell, I liked the movie.  It had some elements to it that was kind of like, what?  But at the same time it had a decent storyline that most people sometimes wonder, what is real and what isn't and you can use your mind to accomplish anything type story.  It was kind of like the movie Dark City in the sense that one man will make a difference and stop the unbeatable bad guy(s).  I recommend watching this movie on a Saturday night with friends or if you just want something to watch by yourself when you order a pizza.  That's what I do.

Maybe Neo has what it takes but he isn't quite a Jedi yet.Now here is what I liked about the movie.The special effects were great and the fight sequences were outstanding.  The way they had them fight, I thought the actors really studied martial arts years and were really fighting, except for the obvious scenes when they would jump in the air and do kicks and when Keanu would do the back flips.  Those are what really kept me into the film, but that isn't always enough.  In the case of this movie though I think this was the exception where the special effects is one of the things that kept me into the movie, although I did like the basic storyline which I think helped keep me in the mood for the movie.I liked Carrie-Ann Moss' character and her interaction with Neo and I really like Joe Pantoliano in almost anything ever since I saw him in The Fugitive.  Larry Fishburne was in great form as usually.  I liked the interaction between Neo and Agent Smith and I got a kick out of how slow he spoke although sometimes it was over the top, but I loved it anyway.In a nutshell, I liked the movie.  It had some elements to it that was kind of like, what?  But at the same time it had a decent storyline that most people sometimes wonder, what is real and what isn't and you can use your mind to accomplish anything type story.  It was kind of like the movie Dark City in the sense that one man will make a difference and stop the unbeatable bad guy(s).  I recommend watching this movie on a Saturday night with friends or if you just want something to watch by yourself when you order a pizza.  That's what I do. ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"7 September 2000","score":"","review":"  ﻿ *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When I popped in the rental store and finally decided to rent this movie, I really didn't know what to expect because I'm like, this is Keanu Reeves we're talking here.  But as I was watching the movie, I really began to enjoy it and once the movie ended, I said, I liked it.  But, I did have some problems with the movie.For one, everything was made to be mysterious.  Why did everything have to be a big mystery and the sky blackened, and the thunder and lightning.  Fishburne almost spoke in circles the entire movie.  Neo would ask what is the matrix, and Morpheus would say something like, The matrix is what the matrix is not.  And I'm like WHAT!?!?!?!?!??!  In my opinion, all he had to do was tell Neo, this is what the situation is, and we need  your help because you are the one  who has the power to change everything.  Instead, we the audience are forced to sit through dialogue of double talk and misdirected answers in an attempt to make Neo think.  And what is the story with the Oracle?  Were are in a computer, how is she able to make predictions about the real world inside a computer?Where did the humans get the equipment to make the vehicles that they transported themselves in?  They seemed awful high tech for people from the mind set of the twentieth century to come up with?During the shoot out scene, how is it that they were able to move so fast to dodge bullets but when the agents shoot at them, it suddenly seems to be a problem to dodge them.  RE  the scene where Neo first dodges the Agents bullets and Trinity remarks on how he moved so fast.  She moved pretty fast to dodge all of those bullets and do a flip during the SWAT Team shoot out and at the beginning of the movie where she was able to run along the sides of the walls.  And as far as I'm concerned, the bullets in the gun of the SWAT Team members are faster than the one coming from the gun of the Agent.  And there are more bullets to dodge because there are more people shooting at you.And this question, I understand that since your mind is plugged into a computer your liable go brain dead if you are pulled out to quick.  I don't really buy it but I'll go with it, but why is it that if you get shot, you die, or if you fall off a building, you die?  If we know that this is fake and with our mind we can do some outrageous stuff like move faster than bullets and jump over huge gorges and bend objects at a thought, then why can't we just say, this isn't real.  When I'm hit with a bullet or with a car or I hit the ground from a one hundred story drop, I should be able to say this really didn't happen.  I'm Superman.  Where's my Kryptonite?

Their objective is to find the most lucrative client who, in the business, is referred to as the Grand Kahuna or Big Kahuna  Screenplay is built around three main characters Larry (Danny Devito), Phil (Kevin Spacey) and Bob (Peter Facinelli). Phil and Larry have been in this business for a long time and very experienced businessmen whereas Bob is just a rookie. It is only these three characters that ever appear in the big screen throughout the entire movie and the whole thing takes place in one hotel room. The only thing that keeps the movie going is the conversations these people are having with each other especially the speeches -or should I say lectures- of Phil who is the leading man. Kevin Spacey, as always, is a magnificent figure, a towering presence in the screen. Danny Devito is playing the role of a rather quite and a tired man who is at the brink of a divorce. The only fun you might have out of this movie is the conversations for there is no storyline in the usual meaning of this term. That's why I believe this movie would make a good play; the screenplay seems to have been written directly for the play. The movie starts with their getting prepared for the little convention they are organizing in the hope that one of the biggest clients whom Larry invited will show up. To their dismay, the man they had been waiting for doesn't show up. However, they realise that another big client has attended their little convention and had a conversation with Bob. It turns out that he has invited Bob to another meeting that will take place in another hotel. So, Phil and Larry decide to send Bob to that meeting to give the client their business cards along with the message that they would like to talk business with him. However, things get a little out of hand, especially for Phil, when Bob starts selling industrial lubricants and starts selling Jesus. If you like a movie starring 2 great actors with a lot of conversation about sales business, life and death, Jesus and God, you might enjoy this movie. But keep in mind that there are only 3 characters in the movie and the only location you will ever see is the hotel room due to the limited storyline.

Start with a so-so idea an innocent death row inmate and a rouge journalist who's going to uncover the truth as the clock ticks toward the execution, and then completely abandon the plot for 90% of the film as we pursue completely uninteresting subplots.

Clint's alchoholism. Intriguingly raised, but ends up playing no part in the real story (the death row stuff). Strike two. Clint's estranged wife and neglected daughter. First of all, why does every action hero need a cute-as-buttons daughter? Notice it's always a daughter, always an only child, always between the age of 8.5 and 8.75. The point, obviously, is that the hero can be multidimensional if he's forced to balance work and family, but in True Crime's case, Clint gives us no juicy plot to justify neglecting the family. The estranged wife subplot only works if we, like Clint, feel the need to get back to the office to crack this interesting case. But here, our appetites aren't whetted at all.

It is because the story discussed about life.   When we were young,  we will live on our own beliefs, just like Bob, believing himself to have a sound mind; Larry goes into his middle age crisis.... he feared he lost not only his job, but also his career.

It had so much that was hilarious that I don't know where to begin.  One of my all time favorite scenes is when they mock the stunt doubles and you have Jack Spade's mother who is about to beat up some thugs.  She turns around and then suddenly the camera cuts from a black lady to a white male with a mustache and afro wig wearing the same clothes she is wearing, he does some back flips and then beats up the thugs.  Then when the stuntman turns around, it's back to the actress playing Spade's Mother.  I loved it.If you don't see this movie it is a shame.  Wayans did a wonderful job mocking the ridiculous exploitation movies of the seventies.   The cost of the rental alone is worth watching the scene where the guy gets out of prison, and he has been incarcerated for so long that his clothes are out of style.  You'll love the Pimp of the Year contest, Kung Fu Joe, the Big Brim Bar,  Soul Train, Hammer, Slammer, Slade and Flyguy.  The movie was a blast and you'll roll on the floor in hysteria watching as Ann Marie Johnson reveals her flaws to Jack Spade.Rent this movie.  You'll love it.

The names Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks already have the term `Academy Award winner' in front of them, and when you get both of those big names together, you get the best picture made in 1998.Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, a high school English teacher sent off to fight in the war.  The movie opens with a very dramatic 15 minute `massacre' on the beach.  Miller, along with his company of troops, takes out a group of German soldiers manning a huge gun spraying bullets on the rest of the allies.  After the battle, Miller learns of his new orders of seeking out a soldier by the name of Ryan.  It seems this Private James Francis Ryan is the last of 4 sons sent to fight in the war.  The other 3 sons have been killed and the U.S. Army deemed it necessary to extract the last of the Ryan brothers before he is ultimately killed as well.  There is a very poignant scene where Ryan's mother receives a message delivered by some Army diplomats telling her that 3 of her sons have died.  This is a very well put together story, all the way down to how difficult it would actually be to find a paratrooper in WWII.Tom Sizemore (Sgt. Michael Horvath), Vin Diesel (Pvt. Adrian Caparzo), Giovanni Ribisi (Medic Irwin Wade), and Matt Damon (Pvt. James Ryan) round out this star-studded cast.  By far the best performance is by, of course, Tom Hanks.  His ability to act in any surrounding; be it on top of the Empire State Building (Sleepless in Seattle), in cyber-space (You've Got Mail), or in a department store jumping on a large foot piano (Big) Tom Hanks is definitely one of today's greatest actors. Saving Private Ryan takes us on a trip across the battlefields to find Pvt. Ryan and get him home to the states.  The film has some very dramatic sub-stories and a few slightly funny scenes.  Steven Spielberg very carefully created a movie that will have you shocked from the seriousness of the opening scene, to laughing at some of the lines, to crying from some of the very sad moments of this film.The vivid cinematography by Janusz Kaminski made this epic film what it is.  The camera angles used created the feeling of actually being there next to Vin Diesel as he is taking out the enemy sniper.  Due to the heroics shown in the opening sequence, we develop a likening with the main characters especially Capt. John Miller, and throughout the film, we are told more and more about their backgrounds.  Another very cleaver addition to this film if that the Captains men have this continuing bet going about Capt. Millers personal background; and by the middle of the movie we are told what it is he did before being sent to fight in this war. When the Academy Awards handed out the award for Best Director to Steven Spielberg, I was happy, and just waiting for them to announce &#145;Ryan the Best Picture also.  However, when they called out Shakespeare in Love as the Best Picture winner, I was stunned!  To reiterate, I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, just that if Spielberg was deemed the best director, how come his film wasn't considered the best of the year?  It's no surprise that I'm not a fan of giving the Best Director award, and Best Picture award to two different pictures as they have done in many years including &#145;27-&#145;28, '56, '81, and most recently '89.  It just doesn't sound right to me. With all that said, there are a few mistakes in the film as every movie does; however Saving Private Ryan is definitely one of the greatest epic films joining the ranks of Braveheart, and Schindlers List.  This movie must not be missed by anyone who calls themselves human.
