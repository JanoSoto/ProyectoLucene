[{"date":"6 September 2008","score":"","review":" Shrek, Shrek, Shrek. What can i say? This movie is great. The characters are all CGI but it's done very well. Although the actors are limited to just voice, they do a terrific job.Especially Eddie Murphy. He is in a league of his own when it comes to comedy. He's the perfect man for the perfect job. He's the main comic relief. Mike Myers doesn't have many punchlines, but he manages to keep his character(Shrek) interesting. Cameron Diaz has done a pretty good job as the Princess. I like the film a lot and am happy that I watched it when i got the chance.Overall, a great film in many respects.
