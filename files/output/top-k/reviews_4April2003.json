I became obsessed with this film. I was obsessed with hating it. The reason was that it had so much to like about it, so much potential and such a great cast... yet it also chose to be as brutal, clumsy and senseless as it did.This film has fantastic production design. The sets are grand, well conceived, appropriately lit (dark, somber) and appear quite solid and functional. The design is heavily influenced by gothic styles. The space craft of the title is like a cathedral. The interior is designed to appear functional and clean and quite at home in science fiction... when all the lights are on. When the lights have gone down a bit, when a character is alone and anxious, the interior feels oppressive and sinister and there is more than a passing resemblance to a torture chamber; this becomes bluntly obvious later on as it literally becomes one, but for now, it is an impressive world of functional and intriguing design. Of special note is, again, the gothic cathedral appearance of the ship's exterior, and the almost cross-like front view port of the ship.For some reason, the combination of science fiction and horror creates a special mood, one that I love, and Event Horizon sets that mood perfectly through its visual design.The cinematography is, at times, beautiful. Almost every frame is composed with intent and care to evoke some kind of mood and to show you only enough to worry you. The sets are shown off wonderfully with the cinematography.Now, lets talk about fear Setting aside, for the moment, the obvious flaw of boo! I scared you! moments (and there are plenty of lame BOO! moments), this film contains some very scary moments that rely totally on mood, anticipation and suggestion.Minor Spoiler ParagraphThe ship seems to be haunted. But not by ghosts. It seems to be drawing out the personal issues of the inhabitants and using them to instill fear. This is done quite well, though much could be expanded on for further character development. The mood and action suggests that you're about to see something horrible such as a man headed on a walk out into space without a suit or what's that under the sheet??End of Minor Spoiler Paragraph.This leads me to where I must note that this movie has one of the most realistic unprotected human in the vacuum of space scenes since 2001. Here is where movies of old would have shown you a gross and bloody explosion (or lame puffing-out of face and eyeballs, as found in Total Recall). Not Event Horizon. In fact, up to this point, the movie has done an excellent job of giving you almost a hard science approach to its fictional technology. You get to see that there is artificial gravity (something that isn't always on), sleep chambers to hibernate travelers on long journeys, a brilliantly scripted lay man's explanation of FTL travel (bending space), and even one I've never seen before the sleep chambers are water tanks, to cushion the frail humans during the intense G forces of acceleration and deceleration.So, up to now, we have a beautiful and intelligent film. Then comes the part that ruins all that.Before the real spoilers, I thought it would be a good idea to stress that this film is NIGHTMARE FUEL. Do NOT let young children watch it. It deserves the R rating. If your children are easily confused by vaguely intentioned violence (you can't explain why), are easily scared into having bad dreams by scary movies, or especially if they are night-terror prone, this film should be kept away from them until they are old enough (which is probably the film's R rating legal age minimum). I have heard that this film was shortened to its current running length from a longer version that still sits on the cutting room floor. I can only imagine what they had to cut to avoid an X rating. The violence it retains can leave lasting negative impressions. It did on me, and I was already a brave adult at the time.Here is where I warn you of Serious Plot Spoilers from here to the end of the review!The movie suddenly takes a 180 degree turn. A supporting character dies in a relatively pointless and stupid manner, eliminating any chance of knowing more about the character's personal dark background. This leads one of the main characters to change from a good, complex and interesting man (with dark agonies of his own personal life) into an evil and hateful brutal murderer that seems to kill for the pleasure of causing suffering in his victims. His actions directly or indirectly cause the death of several other people (some of which, as an audience member, I really felt bad for because they were somewhat likable and they did nothing to invite their unkind fate, unlike other horror movies where they tend to give good reasons to slaughter some of the characters). The goals and motivations of this changed man are nowhere to be seen. His actions make no sense and have no apparent justification or explanation. The movie itself takes on this personality as it stops suggesting things and starts showing them. Up front. Brutally. Grossly. Most of all, needlessly. It is as though the film's creators suddenly lost all ability to hold back and instead tried to find ways to disgust the audience both physically (visually) and emotionally (justification? motivation? reason? NONE!). This film is one of few to actually upset my insides. Not just through the gore, but the kind of violent gore portrayed and the totally unjustified and random nature of it. I suppose this is the point.The climax of the film is the survivors trying to escape their impending doom. I was amazed that the film allowed the survivors that it did. One last good point for it, I guess.The problem in the film lies in the fact that it was doing a great job at being interesting, frightening and beautiful, but then suddenly decided to throw all that away and go for 100% shock and senselessness. Ending up like that, is to me, an insult to the audience. The audience has been set up for a great treat of intellectual scares (minus the BOO! moments) and then they are bashed over the head with shocking insanity.The part that leaves me the most frustrated about this film is that it appears to have set out to do exactly what it did to me. Set me up with expectations and then bash me over the head with the shattering of them. It worked. I was shocked and bothered. Even somewhat sickened. Yet... oooohh... I still... LIKED a great deal of the content in the movie to a GREAT extent. I was so angry and disgusted with this film, yet I found myself referring to it all the time. Using it as an example of this or that kind of technical accomplishment in films. Using it as a kind of tool to measure other films by (as good or bad example). After years of reflecting on the one time I saw the film and how I was enraged by it, I have a strange desire to see it again!  I find my own creative works influenced by it (positively). What the hell did they do to me?Reading commentary from the creators, it seemed that they intended everything to happen as it did. Does that take away the negative aspects of being clumsy and brutal after having demonstrated an ability to do wonderfully without it? I can't honestly say.If you're reading this as a person who has not seen it, and you're looking for help in deciding whether you should see it, I must admit that this film is an education on both how to make a frightening science fiction horror movie... and how NOT to. Both at the same time. If you love great set designs and art direction and visuals and cinematography, there is a great deal of enjoyment for you to get out of this film. The problem is when all of that is shamed by the brutality and mindlessness of the film's climax.To bring this rant to a close I know nothing about how well this film did monetarily either in the box office or in rental. However, Event Horizon is so confusing on so many different levels that it may leave you totally devoid of the ability to make a solid judgment on it (as it has left me).

The sets are grand, well conceived, appropriately lit (dark, somber) and appear quite solid and functional. The design is heavily influenced by gothic styles. The space craft of the title is like a cathedral. The interior is designed to appear functional and clean and quite at home in science fiction... when all the lights are on. When the lights have gone down a bit, when a character is alone and anxious, the interior feels oppressive and sinister and there is more than a passing resemblance to a torture chamber; this becomes bluntly obvious later on as it literally becomes one, but for now, it is an impressive world of functional and intriguing design. Of special note is, again, the gothic cathedral appearance of the ship's exterior, and the almost cross-like front view port of the ship.For some reason, the combination of science fiction and horror creates a special mood, one that I love, and Event Horizon sets that mood perfectly through its visual design.The cinematography is, at times, beautiful. Almost every frame is composed with intent and care to evoke some kind of mood and to show you only enough to worry you. The sets are shown off wonderfully with the cinematography.Now, lets talk about fear Setting aside, for the moment, the obvious flaw of boo! I scared you! moments (and there are plenty of lame BOO! moments), this film contains some very scary moments that rely totally on mood, anticipation and suggestion.Minor Spoiler ParagraphThe ship seems to be haunted. But not by ghosts. It seems to be drawing out the personal issues of the inhabitants and using them to instill fear. This is done quite well, though much could be expanded on for further character development. The mood and action suggests that you're about to see something horrible such as a man headed on a walk out into space without a suit or what's that under the sheet??End of Minor Spoiler Paragraph.This leads me to where I must note that this movie has one of the most realistic unprotected human in the vacuum of space scenes since 2001. Here is where movies of old would have shown you a gross and bloody explosion (or lame puffing-out of face and eyeballs, as found in Total Recall). Not Event Horizon. In fact, up to this point, the movie has done an excellent job of giving you almost a hard science approach to its fictional technology. You get to see that there is artificial gravity (something that isn't always on), sleep chambers to hibernate travelers on long journeys, a brilliantly scripted lay man's explanation of FTL travel (bending space), and even one I've never seen before the sleep chambers are water tanks, to cushion the frail humans during the intense G forces of acceleration and deceleration.So, up to now, we have a beautiful and intelligent film. Then comes the part that ruins all that.Before the real spoilers, I thought it would be a good idea to stress that this film is NIGHTMARE FUEL. Do NOT let young children watch it. It deserves the R rating. If your children are easily confused by vaguely intentioned violence (you can't explain why), are easily scared into having bad dreams by scary movies, or especially if they are night-terror prone, this film should be kept away from them until they are old enough (which is probably the film's R rating legal age minimum). I have heard that this film was shortened to its current running length from a longer version that still sits on the cutting room floor. I can only imagine what they had to cut to avoid an X rating. The violence it retains can leave lasting negative impressions. It did on me, and I was already a brave adult at the time.Here is where I warn you of Serious Plot Spoilers from here to the end of the review!The movie suddenly takes a 180 degree turn. A supporting character dies in a relatively pointless and stupid manner, eliminating any chance of knowing more about the character's personal dark background. This leads one of the main characters to change from a good, complex and interesting man (with dark agonies of his own personal life) into an evil and hateful brutal murderer that seems to kill for the pleasure of causing suffering in his victims. His actions directly or indirectly cause the death of several other people (some of which, as an audience member, I really felt bad for because they were somewhat likable and they did nothing to invite their unkind fate, unlike other horror movies where they tend to give good reasons to slaughter some of the characters). The goals and motivations of this changed man are nowhere to be seen. His actions make no sense and have no apparent justification or explanation. The movie itself takes on this personality as it stops suggesting things and starts showing them. Up front. Brutally. Grossly. Most of all, needlessly. It is as though the film's creators suddenly lost all ability to hold back and instead tried to find ways to disgust the audience both physically (visually) and emotionally (justification? motivation? reason? NONE!). This film is one of few to actually upset my insides. Not just through the gore, but the kind of violent gore portrayed and the totally unjustified and random nature of it. I suppose this is the point.The climax of the film is the survivors trying to escape their impending doom. I was amazed that the film allowed the survivors that it did. One last good point for it, I guess.The problem in the film lies in the fact that it was doing a great job at being interesting, frightening and beautiful, but then suddenly decided to throw all that away and go for 100% shock and senselessness. Ending up like that, is to me, an insult to the audience. The audience has been set up for a great treat of intellectual scares (minus the BOO! moments) and then they are bashed over the head with shocking insanity.The part that leaves me the most frustrated about this film is that it appears to have set out to do exactly what it did to me. Set me up with expectations and then bash me over the head with the shattering of them. It worked. I was shocked and bothered. Even somewhat sickened. Yet... oooohh... I still... LIKED a great deal of the content in the movie to a GREAT extent. I was so angry and disgusted with this film, yet I found myself referring to it all the time. Using it as an example of this or that kind of technical accomplishment in films. Using it as a kind of tool to measure other films by (as good or bad example). After years of reflecting on the one time I saw the film and how I was enraged by it, I have a strange desire to see it again!  I find my own creative works influenced by it (positively). What the hell did they do to me?Reading commentary from the creators, it seemed that they intended everything to happen as it did. Does that take away the negative aspects of being clumsy and brutal after having demonstrated an ability to do wonderfully without it? I can't honestly say.If you're reading this as a person who has not seen it, and you're looking for help in deciding whether you should see it, I must admit that this film is an education on both how to make a frightening science fiction horror movie... and how NOT to. Both at the same time. If you love great set designs and art direction and visuals and cinematography, there is a great deal of enjoyment for you to get out of this film. The problem is when all of that is shamed by the brutality and mindlessness of the film's climax.To bring this rant to a close I know nothing about how well this film did monetarily either in the box office or in rental. However, Event Horizon is so confusing on so many different levels that it may leave you totally devoid of the ability to make a solid judgment on it (as it has left me). If this was the goal of the filmmakers, then they have been totally successful.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"4 April 2003","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  John Frankenheimer's 1966 film Seconds is a deeply disturbing psychological thriller with a strangely strong sense of paranoia and repression.The story involves a strict, live-life-the-same-every-day businessman who goes to a company that fakes his death, gives him a makeover and creates a new persona for him. The man turns into the late Rock Hudson, and lives life out in a beach condo and still has a strange sense of paranoia around him. But then problems ensue as this morality tale cautions not to play God.From the opening credits to the end, Seconds is very strange, and disturbingly demented at a psychosis level. The photography focuses around a man's face in the beginning. It closes in on his ear, up his nostril, near his pupil. It's very odd and disturbing. And then the film opens with some typical John Frankenheimer techniques. We see shots of a camera pinned over a man's shoulder. We see him sweating like a pig. We see people rushing about around him in fast motion and the camera focuses on him all the while.Sometimes the scenes go too far (the grape-crushing scene was a bit prolonged), but others were cut perfectly.Seconds creates, perhaps, the biggest sense of paranoia I have viewed on screen for a long, long time. It's completely original, disturbing--to say it the hundreth time--and involving. But, unfortunately, some parts of the film are just so odd and demented that it's hard to really enjoy it.Something about Seconds creates a sick sense in your stomach. The same feeling I get when I watch the end of films like Se7ven and some psychological thrillers is in Seconds, only it's there the whole way through. I'm still scarred by the effects of this movie.It's deeply disturbing and creates the grandest sense of paranoia I have ever witnessed on screen for a long time.

In the middle of this conflict Prince Hamlet is dismayed when his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius within two weeks of his father's, the King, death.  When the Kings spirit appears to Hamlet and reveals that Claudius murdered him and took his crown and wife.  As those around him try to work out what is wrong Hamlet descends into madness with only thoughts of exposing Claudius and avenging his father.  Indeed something in rotten in the state of Denmark as plot and counter plot threatens those within the kingdom.What can I say of this magnificent and ambitious labour of love?  It is indeed worthy of praise but I am worthy to praise such a thing?  I can't add many words that have not already been said by reviews professional and amateur alike.  The scale of this film makes it without saying that it will have flaws, but such that there is is minor compared to the sweeping nature of the film.  The story is classic and well told here.  Using the full text was a risk but Branagh the director guides us through the meaning within the words to good effect.  He uses the focus of the camera and other visual interpretations to clarify the meaning.That this film is not difficult to follow is to his credit.  Although I didn't get all of the subplots and understand the significance of every scene I wasn't struggling to keep up with the meaning and direction of the plot.  The length of the film wasn't a problem for me because that is simply the time it took to tell the full story.  However I understand that 4 hours is quite intimidating for most &#150; the only times I have watched this film in 4 years is two days when I was off work!  However I think Branagh saw this criticism coming and he puts a little humorous spin on some of the dialogue.  `This is too long' says Polonius of the first player's speech, `Say on' mocks Hamlet `he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps!'  Also later when directing a player on how to speak Hamlet, he advises him not to go OTT and waste his emotion as the majority of the audience are mainly only interested in `inexplicable dumb shows and noise'.  While Shakespeare himself wrote these lines, I did detect a glimmer of mischief as Branagh delivered those lines, perhaps thinking of the multiplexes where this great play would struggle to draw audiences alongside endless noisy comedies or dumb actioners!If it does have one glaring flaw it is in the casting.  At once the casting is both sublime and ridiculous.  The ridiculous is the use of star names in parts that do not demand anyone of such ability or simply don't fit the star assigned.  An example of the former is the use of Dench and Gielgud in a brief scene used to silently backup the player's dialogue.  Similar why bring in Depardieu to deliver a few lines with no character or understanding.  An example of the latter is the shameful waste that is the use of Jack Lemmon.  He is clearly ill at ease in the role and you can see his discomfort where he is a spare wheel in the early scenes his Marcellus shares with Hamlet and Horatio.  Branagh is clearly living out a dream and for the most part he is perfect.  At times I found his `madness' poorly judged, repeating words like a mocking child and bouncing off the walls like a clown didn't work for me &#150; but this is a small part of his overall performance.  Christie is perfectly pitched and Winslet shows a range that surprised me.  Briers is good as the fool and Jacobi is well cast as Claudius.  So many strong performances that I find it hard to list!  Blessed deserves mention simply because he is uncharacteristically understated and all the more powerful for it.The all star cameos are not as distracting as I feared.  Those given enough to work with are generally able to make a good impression.  Heston gives the best performance I've seen from him in ages. Crystal's wit and style compliments his lines as a witty gravedigger. Jimi Mistry is blink and miss him.  Robin Williams is OK but stands out too much, and why does he play his character so camp?!  Faces like Ken Dodd and John Mills simply flicker onscreen but it kind of adds to the feeling of quality in depth.Overall it is hard to fault this film with reasonable complaints that wouldn't leave me open to being picky.  The production, set and costumes are priceless &#150; the look and feel of the whole film feels as rich and extensive as the dialogue itself.  I acknowledge that it has its flaws, but look at the scale of the production and the scope of the film &#150; any flaws fade to insignificance.

It's too heavy to be considered an entertainment, although it is transfixing throughout. It's not self-consciously artistic, so it can't be an art house drama. Some people criticized it as something that would play as well as a TV movie. Well, the made-for-TV criticism (if it is one) is lousy. I don't know what that's supposed to mean, really. Does it mean that all TV movies are crappy, and this is too, so it should have played on Lifetime? If that's what it means, then it's wrong. If it means that the movie isn't very focused on images, and isn't terribly cinematic, I might see the point. But this is far too emotional and lacking in sentimentality to be written off. Maybe any movie that deals honestly with people and their lives is bound to be attacked.The set-up here isn't much Frank Fowler (Nick Stahl), the college-age son, is seeing Natalie (Marisa Tomei), the older and formerly married mother of two, to the quiet delight of his father Matt (Tom Wilkinson) and the equally hushed scorn of his mother Ruth (Sissy Spacek). Natalie's ex, Richard (William Mapother) still feels attached to Natalie and causes some trouble (his mullet-like bleached hair making him seem even more evil).The performances are all very fine. Stahl, an increasingly interesting actor (the bully in Larry Clark's Bully), is a successful choice as the son. He's set apart, predominantly, from the plethora of young actors because he doesn't look like Josh Hartnett or Heath Ledger. Tomei gives a wonderful supporting performance, and I loved her affected accent. The main criticism Spacek got was that she was in a role any woman over 40 could play. What an offensively incorrect statement. Spacek has a fractured voice and a vulnerability that suits Ruth, and moment to moment she makes her completely authentic. But ultimately it's Wilkinson who owns the movie. (It's also amusing that the lone foreigner has the most convincing American accent.)The tension is built up to an almost sickening level after, and just before, a monumental tragedy occurs about 45 minutes in. The next 45 minutes or so is devoted to the altered lives of the characters. In between the slice-of-life straightforwardness, we see segues of Spacek, a school music teacher, directing a choir singing dirge-like chant-hymns (a nice touch, like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem My Lost Youth that's recited by one of Matt's friends A boy's will is the wind's will\/And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts). In the middle segment, the film has a lot of slice-of-life scenes, like Wilkinson and Spacek watching Craig Kilborn, and it's nice whenever a movie has those. They allow us to soak up the atmosphere and story, and it's a pleasant treat to have scenes and dialogues that don't exist simply to propel the plot.After the tragedy (I'm tiptoeing here), we see how generous and forgiving Matt and Ruth are to their friends, co-workers and students, and how destructive they are to each other, at home (Like a rest in music -- no sound but so loud). Beneath the surface, Matt's a nervous wreck; when he goes to see his lawyer he can only focus on his hand annoyingly shuffling change in his pocket. Ruth becomes the type of woman you'd hate to be around, twisting rational questions and biting back with bitterly sarcastic snaps.I expect the subject, the emotions, and the pain in the movie will strike a note with many middleclass suburbanites, and may be unbearably painful for any family who's gone through a similar tragedy, or who's had to deal with the ineptitude of the law system. It racks up the tension to an excruciating degree -- the best kind of sombre drama that fills your stomach with nervousness and anxiety until you can't take any more. In the closing 45 minutes, there's a sort of vigilante message that's imparted, and someone could write a series of essays on the subject of that message (well, not exactly message, but you know what I mean), but in the context of the film, I wouldn't argue that something had to be done, and that no one should be cursed because of it.I found myself asking, Why are movies like these important? Because they make us feel, and isn't that what makes us human? (That and opposable thumbs, I guess.) They awaken the senses and keep them fresh, and on a larger scale, specifically, because they show us people's concealed private lives that go unseen (but experienced) by many.The film is much less heavy-handed than its 2001 counterpart Monster's Ball; more realistic, but also less graphic; tenser, but less arty. Unlike that film, In the Bedroom is simple; it's impact comes from its simplicity. Monster's Ball starts with impact and then tries to work in the simple realism and character.The film's final image is humbling, and Andrew O'Hehir described it rather eloquently as Matt lying stone-faced in bed, half naked, with cigarette smoke rising from his chest, looking as if his heart were on fire.**** ","genre":null},{"date":"4 April 2003","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  I don't know exactly what this movies is.

Tomei gives a wonderful supporting performance, and I loved her affected accent. The main criticism Spacek got was that she was in a role any woman over 40 could play. What an offensively incorrect statement. Spacek has a fractured voice and a vulnerability that suits Ruth, and moment to moment she makes her completely authentic. But ultimately it's Wilkinson who owns the movie. (It's also amusing that the lone foreigner has the most convincing American accent.)The tension is built up to an almost sickening level after, and just before, a monumental tragedy occurs about 45 minutes in. The next 45 minutes or so is devoted to the altered lives of the characters. In between the slice-of-life straightforwardness, we see segues of Spacek, a school music teacher, directing a choir singing dirge-like chant-hymns (a nice touch, like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem My Lost Youth that's recited by one of Matt's friends A boy's will is the wind's will\/And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts). In the middle segment, the film has a lot of slice-of-life scenes, like Wilkinson and Spacek watching Craig Kilborn, and it's nice whenever a movie has those. They allow us to soak up the atmosphere and story, and it's a pleasant treat to have scenes and dialogues that don't exist simply to propel the plot.After the tragedy (I'm tiptoeing here), we see how generous and forgiving Matt and Ruth are to their friends, co-workers and students, and how destructive they are to each other, at home (Like a rest in music -- no sound but so loud). Beneath the surface, Matt's a nervous wreck; when he goes to see his lawyer he can only focus on his hand annoyingly shuffling change in his pocket. Ruth becomes the type of woman you'd hate to be around, twisting rational questions and biting back with bitterly sarcastic snaps.I expect the subject, the emotions, and the pain in the movie will strike a note with many middleclass suburbanites, and may be unbearably painful for any family who's gone through a similar tragedy, or who's had to deal with the ineptitude of the law system. It racks up the tension to an excruciating degree -- the best kind of sombre drama that fills your stomach with nervousness and anxiety until you can't take any more. In the closing 45 minutes, there's a sort of vigilante message that's imparted, and someone could write a series of essays on the subject of that message (well, not exactly message, but you know what I mean), but in the context of the film, I wouldn't argue that something had to be done, and that no one should be cursed because of it.I found myself asking, Why are movies like these important? Because they make us feel, and isn't that what makes us human? (That and opposable thumbs, I guess.) They awaken the senses and keep them fresh, and on a larger scale, specifically, because they show us people's concealed private lives that go unseen (but experienced) by many.The film is much less heavy-handed than its 2001 counterpart Monster's Ball; more realistic, but also less graphic; tenser, but less arty. Unlike that film, In the Bedroom is simple; it's impact comes from its simplicity. Monster's Ball starts with impact and then tries to work in the simple realism and character.The film's final image is humbling, and Andrew O'Hehir described it rather eloquently as Matt lying stone-faced in bed, half naked, with cigarette smoke rising from his chest, looking as if his heart were on fire.**** ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"4 April 2003","score":"","review":"  Big Boy Matson and Pete Calder are friends who go off to fight in WW2.  On their return they continue to farm in their old ways, however this way is challenged by Jim Ed Love, who has a huge ranch and employs many of the old land owners.  To complicate this Big Boy is having an affair with Mona, the wife of Love's foreman, Les Birk.  However Mona not only threatens to inflame the dangerous relationship between Big Boy and Birk but also between Pete (who loves Mona despite the attentions of Josepha O'Neil) and Big Boy.Despite the poor box office that comes with a modern western (generally) I had heard reasonable reviews and wanted to give it a look.  To call this sprawling is a bit of an understatement, it covers many themes and interrelating stories.  The plots all spin around Big Boy and Pete and they hold together quite well on the whole.  Only Pete's relationship with Josepha didn't get expanded as well as I'd have liked but the sweeping coverage of the main themes just about worked.  Aside from the fact that it might have been very slow, the film could have used another 30 minutes to open itself out a bit more into the side plots.  It is not as slow as it sounds but it does require a bit of patience and grace, so I suspect many will get bored.Harrelson is really good in this.  Some films he seems to work and others he doesn't.  Here his cocky act fits the character real well.  Crudup is more understated as Pete but is good in a different way.  He provides more mystery that kept me interested.  Elliot and Diehl are both strong characters.  Cruz is pretty and interesting but criminally not used as well as I'd like simply because the film turns to focus on Mona.

Here Branagh yet again adapts a Shakespeare play to good effect, trimming the dialogue of some important sections with the aim of creating a lighter feel worthy of the title.  I make no mention of the plot suffice to say that Branagh has done well to keep the essence and feel of the work very true but without forcing the tools that Shakespeare readily used but may not work on modern audiences easily (i.e. not being able to recognise someone easily when they wear a mask, veil or moustache!).The dialogue is very sparky as you'd expect and Branagh has done well to interpret the humour from the words on the page.  I think of the dialogue around the police officer.  Reading it from the page I never realised how much humour could be drawn form this characters scenes in terms of how the other characters view in.  Of course the praise of lies with Shakespeare but Branagh knows the Bard well.The cast is international and all-star (probably to a greater extent than it needed or deserved).  Branagh is pure wonder in the lead and really brings out the whimsy in many of his scenes.  Thompson too is wonderful and the two play off each other well.  The film lost a little when the two begin to woo, but it is still enjoyable.  Briers is excellent and Blessed is a bit hammy and underused (forcing big background laughs).

When he is onscreen he is a little OTT but he is simply hilarious as the fool of the piece, and Ben Elton is an interesting sidekick.  Beckinsdale is good but again is not given much meat to work with outside of her perfect love for Claudio.Overall this is a very enjoyable version of the play.  Those who find Shakespeare difficult could do well to start here with something light and bubbly.  Those who enjoy Shakespeare will enjoy it as another version.  Only those who feel that the Bard should not be put onscreen for the masses (and there are some who think this way &#150; I have met them, they laughably call themselves purists &#150; elitists I think) will find fault here, because this clearly has mass appeal.

Beckinsdale is good but again is not given much meat to work with outside of her perfect love for Claudio.Overall this is a very enjoyable version of the play.  Those who find Shakespeare difficult could do well to start here with something light and bubbly.  Those who enjoy Shakespeare will enjoy it as another version.  Only those who feel that the Bard should not be put onscreen for the masses (and there are some who think this way &#150; I have met them, they laughably call themselves purists &#150; elitists I think) will find fault here, because this clearly has mass appeal.

The spirit of love and happiness is alive in the party and Count Claudio and Leonato's daughter Hero make woo and engage to marry within a week.  To pass the time Don Pedro makes a pledge to engage confirmed bachelor Benedick and the bickering Beatrice together in a tower of affection.  However Claudio's brother, Don John, conspires to break up the wedding by making accusations against young Hero.  Will it all be much ado about nothing?If anyone has done more to bring Shakespeare to a modern audience of multiplex dwellers, I'd like to meet them.  Here Branagh yet again adapts a Shakespeare play to good effect, trimming the dialogue of some important sections with the aim of creating a lighter feel worthy of the title.  I make no mention of the plot suffice to say that Branagh has done well to keep the essence and feel of the work very true but without forcing the tools that Shakespeare readily used but may not work on modern audiences easily (i.e. not being able to recognise someone easily when they wear a mask, veil or moustache!).The dialogue is very sparky as you'd expect and Branagh has done well to interpret the humour from the words on the page.  I think of the dialogue around the police officer.  Reading it from the page I never realised how much humour could be drawn form this characters scenes in terms of how the other characters view in.  Of course the praise of lies with Shakespeare but Branagh knows the Bard well.The cast is international and all-star (probably to a greater extent than it needed or deserved).  Branagh is pure wonder in the lead and really brings out the whimsy in many of his scenes.  Thompson too is wonderful and the two play off each other well.  The film lost a little when the two begin to woo, but it is still enjoyable.  Briers is excellent and Blessed is a bit hammy and underused (forcing big background laughs).

As I've continued to watch subsequent viewings of Evolution, I've come to appreciate the movie for what it is.  Instead of a relatively light-weight, entertaining hilarious comedy, Evolution is more of a dry humor, characteristic of David Duchovny and similar in tone to the wry humor in Lake Placid (1999) where Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda are confronted with a monstrous allegator menacing the populace of Lake Placid.
