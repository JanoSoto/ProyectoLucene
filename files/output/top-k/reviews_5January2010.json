Chapter 1. Original Writing Even though Tarentino has said that his films are throwbacks to many older Japanese films and spaghetti westerns, there is one original recurring part of his films that makes them incredible to watch even if the story sucks and thats the dialogue. His characters are so beloved by many of his fans because they're so interesting to listen too.Chapter 2 . The Way It Was Told If you think about it Pulp Fiction is a simple story but the way that it was presented to its curios audience is why it's such a memorable movie. Even though Reservoir Dogs had the same story arch as pulp I don't believe that it was executed in to it's truest potential. Well Pulp Fiction Filled in the cracks with more character development in a shorter time period because of Tarentino's improving skills in fast and witty dialogue. The way that the characters are introduced and dismissed from us i feel is a type of miscellaneous presentation that I had never seen be done before.Chapter 3. Soundtrack And Acting While watching this incredible experience for a seventh time the other night with the presence of my father who admitted before watching that he is not the biggest fan of Tarentino's taste in music . I on the other hand find that is soundtrack is amazing in every movie. I t influences music lovers and aids the style of the story. Many artists had their debut with this movie such being Neil Diamond.Another aid through the film is the acting in which is very believable and coooool!!!!!!!!!!!! Jackson,and Therman became someone and Travolta was saved at last with a good role. But whose performance really stuck out for me was Ving Rham's when he was down in the basement giving Bruce Willis the low down low. The same goes for Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer's dialogueing at the beginning and end of this fantastic film.Soooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall see this movie. Twice!!!!!!!! Actually see it three times, no four time, no, oh I don't know. Buy it, buy it and cherish it for all of time because it truly is a masterpiece.

I think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone.Many kids movies have some big point they're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message, this one doesn't have any message at all...it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes.The movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to? The acting is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here.. The short, fat, gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious. The kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was maybe the worst kid actor I have ever seen.The movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review. 3 ninjas...yea you know they're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously... Need I say more. Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone.With all that said KIDS WILL LOVE IT. This movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it.

In both movies the format is the same to have as many gags in as little time as possible. Although Airplane will always be my favourite nonsense comedy, It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World has won a special place in my heart for its ability to entertain and delight in every minute of this movie. And it's a long movie. The version I saw has 154 minutes, but I know other versions run many minutes longer. So the screenwriters, the director and the actors deserve a round of applause for never letting the movie become dull for a moment.This movie is like a compendium of comedy fast-paced talking, slapstick, silent film-like visual gags a la Chaplin or Keaton, fun one-liners, well-timed sequences with punch-lines, this movie has every form of humor ever invented. It also has an amazing cast of characters, ranging from Spencer Tray to Buddy Hackett to Mick Rooney.But in spite of all the nonsense going on, this is not a brainless movie. In fact the premise is quite ingenious and goes deep into human nature. An old robber lies dying in a car accident and tells several witnesses that there is $350,000 hidden in a place. A race of wits ensues between the several witnesses to see who gets there first and claims the money. Throughout the race rivalries come up, alliances are forget and destroyed, people double-cross each other, and everyone will be capable of doing anything to do triumph. In other words, it's one of the most brutal portrayals of human greed and stupidity in cinema. The movie makes it very clear under the spell of money, people will become ruthless morons capable of anything. Some noir movies, which specialise in this type of story, had never been as unflattering about humanity as this movie is. Because in noir, there's always someone who retains a semblance of morality, as crooked as they may be. But here everyone's corrupted, even the police.Stanley Kramer and screenwriters William and Tanie Rose made a real masterpiece.

Total Spoilers!!! Read for your own good!!! This review contains spoilers, and I sure as hell hope I will spoil things for anyone out there who is even contemplating viewing this piece of garbage! I have to say I was preparing to praise this movie and to give it a very high rating - until the last 10 minutes or so when the sheer nonsense the plot is based upon was finally revealed! In fact, I feel utterly insulted by how stupid the makers of this movie and particularly the one(s) who wrote the story\/script expect the viewers to be! So, although I was never planning on writing reviews on IMDb, my fury at the hidden agenda this movie seems to have as well as at the fact that I will never be able to regain the one and a half hours of my life that have gone to waste simply compel me to compose this review as a warning to those who value their intelligence too much to be subjected to what I have gone through.Now, at first, during over 80 minutes, the story seems to be about a man who enters the FBI headquarters claiming to be called Fenton Meiks. Now at the time, the FBI are looking for a serial killer nicknamed God's Hands, and Fenton says it is his brother Adam Meiks who is responsible for all those murders. Fenton relates his life story to Wesley Doyle, the agent in charge, and explains how his dad started claiming he had been repeatedly visited by angels and given a task to fulfill. The task mentioned involved killing certain people, who were in fact not people but demons. What happened every time a person\/demon was executed was that the father brought the victim to their home, put his hand on that victim and was able to visualize all their wrongdoings and feel justified in killing them, having previously obtained their names as part of a list given by the almighty. Adam was able to see the sins of each of those executed but not Fenton, who kept saying his father was crazy and a murderer and tried to stop him. Also, the father and Adam both believed that god would make them invisible when carrying out the abductions and would keep their murders\/killings unpunished, because they were in fact killing demons. Does it seem to you readers that it's a movie about how far religious fanaticism can lead a person and that there will be be a plot-twist at the end? Well, the so-called twist, which I saw coming from a mile away, is that the Fenton who is present at the FBI headquarters decides to take agent Doyle to the burial site, where all God's Hands 's victims are found in shallow graves, revealing himself to be in fact Adam, who then (READ IN AWE) puts his hand on the FBI agent, discovering the man had killed his own mother and was rightfully on his list of targets as specified by god (!!!) and murders the agent, who is actually a demon! To make matters worse, the camera that recorded the real Adam's presence at the FBI headquarters gets a blurred picture when he makes his entrance (!!!) and so Adam cannot be recognized as the Fenton who had been there! So, he gets away with it because he has in fact killed the real Fenton and planted all the evidence there to frame him and get himself off the hook.So, to clarify the main concept of the movie Adam and his dad have truly been chosen by god to kill people who are not in fact people but DEMONS! They ARE given the ability to touch a person and see their sins and ARE in fact protected and made invisible yet again (you've guessed!)by god! Fenton, who tried to stop the murders and, in doing so, killed his own father was also a demon, just like agent Doyle. So the message this movie delivers is there are people out there who get messages and protection from god, and have the right to kill others who they consider to be demons!

Now at the time, the FBI are looking for a serial killer nicknamed God's Hands, and Fenton says it is his brother Adam Meiks who is responsible for all those murders. Fenton relates his life story to Wesley Doyle, the agent in charge, and explains how his dad started claiming he had been repeatedly visited by angels and given a task to fulfill. The task mentioned involved killing certain people, who were in fact not people but demons. What happened every time a person\/demon was executed was that the father brought the victim to their home, put his hand on that victim and was able to visualize all their wrongdoings and feel justified in killing them, having previously obtained their names as part of a list given by the almighty. Adam was able to see the sins of each of those executed but not Fenton, who kept saying his father was crazy and a murderer and tried to stop him. Also, the father and Adam both believed that god would make them invisible when carrying out the abductions and would keep their murders\/killings unpunished, because they were in fact killing demons. Does it seem to you readers that it's a movie about how far religious fanaticism can lead a person and that there will be be a plot-twist at the end? Well, the so-called twist, which I saw coming from a mile away, is that the Fenton who is present at the FBI headquarters decides to take agent Doyle to the burial site, where all God's Hands 's victims are found in shallow graves, revealing himself to be in fact Adam, who then (READ IN AWE) puts his hand on the FBI agent, discovering the man had killed his own mother and was rightfully on his list of targets as specified by god (!!!) and murders the agent, who is actually a demon! To make matters worse, the camera that recorded the real Adam's presence at the FBI headquarters gets a blurred picture when he makes his entrance (!!!) and so Adam cannot be recognized as the Fenton who had been there! So, he gets away with it because he has in fact killed the real Fenton and planted all the evidence there to frame him and get himself off the hook.So, to clarify the main concept of the movie Adam and his dad have truly been chosen by god to kill people who are not in fact people but DEMONS! They ARE given the ability to touch a person and see their sins and ARE in fact protected and made invisible yet again (you've guessed!)by god! Fenton, who tried to stop the murders and, in doing so, killed his own father was also a demon, just like agent Doyle. So the message this movie delivers is there are people out there who get messages and protection from god, and have the right to kill others who they consider to be demons! And who are we, the rest of humanity, to stand in their way and attempt to put a stop to their glorious holy crusade! I am positive that all the nut-cases who have killed others after heeding god's call will be delighted to find out they were right all along!

Briefly, it refers to socioeconomically challenged or rebellious boys who wore their hair slightly longer and loaded with pomade or grease. as well as leather jackets and blue jeans, as opposed to the socs (pronounced soshes)- the high society boys who wore short hair, no grease and, as Ponyboy says, madras pants. It's a 50s and 60s take on the age-old conflict of rich vs. poor. Briefly, this movie tells of the clashes between the aforementioned greasers and socs who live in Oklahoma in the early 1960s. Johnny Cade (played so well by Ralph Macchio) and his friend Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) are in a lot one night when a car full of soc boys come after them. Johnny kills the soc who, weeks before, had beaten him seriously. Johnny and Ponyboy, scared and not knowing what to do, seek help from a slightly older mentor and friend named Dally (Dallas) Winston (Matt Dillon), a hardened, incorrigible boy who seems hell-bent on living a life of crime but who genuinely cares about Johnny. Dally tells them to hide out at an abandoned church and for 5 days, the boys do just that, subsisting on bologna sandwiches, peanut butter and water. They spend the days playing cards, smoking, trying to catch small game and reading Gone With the Wind. More dramatic things follow after Dally comes to rescue them from their hide-out.I've seen this move dozens of times and I've always enjoyed it but it is to the greaser genre what the Godfather movies are to organized crime - a romanticized look at a somewhat serious subject - the lives of greasers vs. socs. Is this a criticism? Not necessarily - this is a good movie and I always enjoy watching it. And it features several future stars such as the aforementioned Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio. It also features Tom Cruise, Leif Garrett, Rob Lowe, Diane Lane and Patrick Swayze. The performances of such (then) young stars are excellent and the story flows. The lead music and main theme can be a bit mawkish at times - too sickeningly sweet for a movie about greasers and socs - The Cross and the Switchblade or even West Side Story this isn't. I loved the Robert Frost poem Ponyboy quotes while he and Johnny are on the run. And I love the song Stevey Wonder sings, using the Frost poem for the lyrics. But, again, it's too sweet for a movie about the greasers and the socs. These are minor criticisms but these may be the reason the movie was roundly panned when it first came out. Television tried to make a series out of it and it would have been a good idea but the series did not feature the same actors so it never took. Too bad - stories like this will always find an audience if the storytelling is well done and if the actors are convincing enough. I recommend this movie highly - in addition to the good acting, music and story, there seemed to be a real chemistry among the actors. Seeing the film also makes you want to read the book on which it was based - which is exactly what I did. I even read other S.E. Hinton books but this is my favorite story. Matt Dillon went on to act in Rumble Fish and Tex, films also based on Ms. Hinton's stories, but he was perfect as Dally.

If Kevin was like this, he would have killed his family and Harry and Marv...Ironically, the movie's title refers precisely to Culkin's character instead of Elijah Wood's character (who really is the good son). And why is that? Put it this way because that's the image his family and people in general have of him and because they don't know his disturbing nature.Mac shows his other side as an actor - that is, his dark side. And he is excellent as Henry, a child who can be described as a sociopath, a psychopath, a cold-blooded murderer and mentally ill. Henry is also a perfect actor - he manages to keep his true nature in secret because of his angelical looks and apparent love and respect for the family and others. This is a completely different role for Mac, setting it apart from the others and leaving behind his 'Home Alone' image.Mac, who we are more used to see as a comedy actor with a beautiful smile, here he does some extremely cold facial expressions of dark jealousy. His character Henry also displays aggressive and violent behavior, as we see in some scenes.Elijah Wood is great as Mark. Here we see a younger Elijah Wood (when he was a kid), years before 'becoming' Frodo Baggins. Elijah was a cute kid too. Quinn Culkin is equally good as Connie and she was cute too.This film is quite short, which is a good thing. But it shares the same problem of 'Mikey' we never really get to know how did Henry become so bad. We have an idea when he says «It was mine before it was his» (refering to the rubber duck) and that he became very jealous of his brother Richard and killed him, but is that all? I doubt that's all.It's always shocking to see a child doing the horrible things that Henry does, but this movie is considerably less violent comparing to 'Mikey'. Henry is also less dangerous than Mikey, but don't get me wrong - that doesn't mean that Henry isn't dangerous - he is. It's like they say for this movie - «Evil has many faces» - and the headline for 'Mikey' could be applied here as well - «With evil, size doesn't matter».The ending is an unexpected surprise for those who watch this for the first time.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"5 January 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" We all know that the character Kevin McCallister gets angry with his family twice and that he makes lives miserable for the bandits Harry and Marv. Kevin is, however, a good kid. This is what Kevin could be like if he was evil. Why do I say this? Because the diabolic kid of this film is portrayed by the same boy, Macaulay Culkin. If Kevin was like this, he would have killed his family and Harry and Marv...Ironically, the movie's title refers precisely to Culkin's character instead of Elijah Wood's character (who really is the good son). And why is that? Put it this way because that's the image his family and people in general have of him and because they don't know his disturbing nature.Mac shows his other side as an actor - that is, his dark side. And he is excellent as Henry, a child who can be described as a sociopath, a psychopath, a cold-blooded murderer and mentally ill. Henry is also a perfect actor - he manages to keep his true nature in secret because of his angelical looks and apparent love and respect for the family and others. This is a completely different role for Mac, setting it apart from the others and leaving behind his 'Home Alone' image.Mac, who we are more used to see as a comedy actor with a beautiful smile, here he does some extremely cold facial expressions of dark jealousy. His character Henry also displays aggressive and violent behavior, as we see in some scenes.Elijah Wood is great as Mark. Here we see a younger Elijah Wood (when he was a kid), years before 'becoming' Frodo Baggins. Elijah was a cute kid too. Quinn Culkin is equally good as Connie and she was cute too.This film is quite short, which is a good thing. But it shares the same problem of 'Mikey' we never really get to know how did Henry become so bad. We have an idea when he says «It was mine before it was his» (refering to the rubber duck) and that he became very jealous of his brother Richard and killed him, but is that all? I doubt that's all.It's always shocking to see a child doing the horrible things that Henry does, but this movie is considerably less violent comparing to 'Mikey'. Henry is also less dangerous than Mikey, but don't get me wrong - that doesn't mean that Henry isn't dangerous - he is. It's like they say for this movie - «Evil has many faces» - and the headline for 'Mikey' could be applied here as well - «With evil, size doesn't matter».The ending is an unexpected surprise for those who watch this for the first time. Henry pays for all his crimes by being dropped off a high cliff and then we see his dead body being swept away by the sea waves.The soundtrack is entirely instrumental and consists of beautiful and soft pieces of music. Plus, the sceneries of this movie are a must. We see many beautiful settings and landscapes full of snow (this takes place somewhere in Winter time). Not to mention that Henry's house is lovely.Overall, an okay movie, but not one with enough attributes to become a classic.

Spencer Tracy transcends the boundaries between actor and audience with that memorable, moving speech at the end of the movie. His speech brings me to tears every time I watch this movie. As another writer commented, it's so real and true because Tracy makes his last great speech on screen talking about the love of his life, Katherine Hepburn. Hepburn does not have to act, those tears are real because shortly after filming Tracy died. They all knew he was dying. He was sick during filming. As the characters sit down to eat dinner and we see a shot of Tracy sitting down with his back to us I realize just how much I miss him. I usually never cry during a movie but when you see someone achieve a perfect acting performance and know it's his last moment on screen you cannot help but cry. Tracy remains one of acting's best. He reminds me of my Dad, with a tough outside but loving and compassionate inside. Katherine Hepburn obviously loved him as much as he loved her. She outlived Tracy for many years. This movie moves the soul and should be an inspiration to everyone. Thanks Spencer. We truly miss your graceful presence. I can only imagine that Tracy and Hepburn are gracing Heaven and maybe someday I will be lucky enough to meet them both.

I was within my last few years before adolescence at the time, and may have liked both movies equally when I first saw them. I've watched both of them again twice in recent years, and don't recall ever having an opinion on which one was better before those viewings. I now think the first one, from 1979, is the stronger of the two (I think most Muppets fans would agree), but this 1981 follow-up is still an impressive family movie.Kermit and Fozzie are reporters for the Daily Chronicle, and Gonzo is their photographer. One day, they are out on the street trying to get a good news story, when jewels are stolen from English fashion designer Lady Holiday! This happens when they aren't looking, so they don't notice, and instead write an article on Kermit and Fozzie as twins joining the newspaper staff, which they are fired for. The three of them then travel to London, England in the cargo hold of a plane to interview Lady Holiday. They stay at Happiness Hotel, a decaying building with free accommodation! When Kermit goes to meet Lady Holiday in her office, she isn't there, but he meets her new receptionist, Miss Piggy, instead. Trying to impress him, Miss Piggy lies and says she is Lady Holiday, and they quickly fall in love. However, she obviously can't keep her secret for long, and the jewel thieves are trying to frame her! If you ask me, the main thing that makes The Great Muppet Caper inferior to its predecessor is the set of songs. None of the songs can match Rainbow Connection and certain other memorable ones from The Muppet Movie, and two of the songs here, The First Time It Happens and Miss Piggy's Fantasy, make for two fairly lacklustre and tedious sequences. This second Muppet movie also doesn't have the same poignancy and meaningfulness as the first one. However, there's still a lot to like. The songs generally aren't bad, and of course, there are the same lovable Muppets in the movie. They also didn't forget about the humour, as the film definitely is funny, even if it's not usually hilarious. There are celebrity cameos here (though not as many as there are in The Muppet Movie), including one from John Cleese, of Monty Python fame. He helps make the part where Miss Piggy sneaks into 17 Highbrow Street a comic highlight. The plot also works well for a lighthearted family movie like this.Jim Henson's Muppets made an excellent silver screen debut in 1979, in a film that's still widely admired after just over thirty years. I guess it's no surprise that this 1981 follow-up is inferior, since that's often the case with franchise movies. However, overall, The Great Muppet Caper is a very good family comedy adventure, and is still much better than Muppets from Space, the last theatrical movie featuring the famous puppet characters, released in 1999. I saw that one for the first time over a year ago and had never been so disappointed by anything featuring the Muppets! Anyway, kids could really enjoy this second installment in the franchise, and as usual with these films, it's not just for them. There's enough to make it worth watching for adults who still like the Muppets as well. Just because it's not as good as its predecessor doesn't mean it's not another noteworthy accomplishment.
