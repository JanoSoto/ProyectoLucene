The jocky, smart-ass, racist, child-killing, old-lady beating teens who work out there despise him, and set up a prank which ends in disaster for Melvin. He falls into a barrel of toxic waste and goes through a horrible meltdown, but thats okay because he returns as THE TOXIC AVENGER. Armed with a mop, he seeks revenge on the horrible jocks and their snob-ass girlfriends, as well as the local cretins, thugs and just all-around bad-guys who make up Tromaville. This is one of my favorite movies, right along with Troma's Terror Firmer, and if that sounds lame then keep reading. Troma made a couple of bad-taste teen comedies before this that basically ripped off Porky's, but were in a more Airplane\/Naked Gun league with dirtier, piggish, arm-pitted humor. Here, they took those aspects, added a lot of gore (in a comic-book way) and added a Mad Magazine mentality and created one hell of a good movie. There is a lot of violence in this, but if you can take violence, then you will see the humor here. Like I said it's like Mad Magazine. Bad-taste, gratuitous nudity, and racial slurs run rampant, but it comes off as a slap in the face to all the types of people who glorify that type of thing. It's good gory fun. This is the movie that put Troma on the map. They have made some of the best B movies out there. Class Of Nuke'em High, Troma's War, Tromeo And Juliet are all worth a look. They have released films by other people that are good too. Blood Hook, Cannibal!The Musical, Dead Dudes In The House prove to be good views. See this if you like movies. The sequels to The Toxic Avenger are not bad. The fourth being the best, the third being the worst. I remember this used to play on the USA Network, with all the violence and gore intact (pretty much) and had deleted scenes that were never before seen (by me at least ) until this hit DVD.

That question can be answered on this page, and is likely the #1 reason anyone would be searching for this film on this site. Seagal must have seen My Father, The Hero and asked who the hell was THAT? playing the daughter.This is a very well-done B movie, but the plot is too far above the heads of the crowd that built Seagal's name. Not surprisingly, the movie bombed at the box office.Gone from the original are Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey, and back are actors with names more commonly associated with Seagal films, i.e., names you've probably never heard of. Morris Chestnut (Bobby Zachs) had a bit of a name going into this film, and Eric Bogosian (Travis Dane) had made a bit of a name for himself in Talk Radio, which is where he seems to draw a lot of inspiration for this role.Under Siege reminded me of when the Grateful Dead finally hit the Top 10 with Touch of Grey. The mainstream fans loved it, but the Dead's hardcore fans almost considered it a bit of a betrayal. In Under Siege, Seagal's expression at times conveyed what appeared to be a what are these big-name actors doing in my film? sentiment. No worry about that here, as Seagal is clearly the star. Some considered it a weakness that Seagal had to carry the film alone, but Seagal fans prefer it that way.Under Siege 2 Dark Territory does what On Deadly Ground could not, blending excellent action sequences and political activism seamlessly in a way that complements each other. The plot is even more intelligent than ODG, with Travis Dane as the megalomaniacal techno-villain aided by Mr. Penn (Everett McGill), the stereotypical, military good-ol'-boy-gone-bad who is responsible for supplying the muscle and weaponry. Many of the supporting characters are drawn from other Seagal films, such as Afifi Alaouie, a stripper in Out For Justice, who plays the most competent of the mercenaries in what appears to be a reminder from Seagal that violence doesn't equate to racism.The plot is typical Seagal high-level government agency types, with full presidential approval, do things that would greatly upset us ordinary citizens. In this case, ATAC (apparently an offshoot of NASA) has designed the Grazer One satellite, which has the ability to cause explosions and earthquakes with targeted laser strikes from space. Dane was fired from ATAC, and his revenge involves commandeering Grazer One from a train in Dark Territory (so he can't easily be found), and using it to detonate a secret nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon, picking up a billion dollars for himself in the process because, according to him, I owe people money. While the plot is cerebral, Seagal's battles with Penn and his men are of the offline variety limbs get bent and broken, and the bad guys get disposed of in ways we've come to expect from his films. Seagal, in his own, unique way, manages to take a swipe at the power of computers and how limited they are as he finds what one might call a backdoor flaw in Dane's otherwise perfect programming.All in all, I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and it is the reason I became a Katherine Heigl fan. She was good as the conflicted-but-otherwise decent niece who had just lost her dad and now must travel to his funeral with the uncle she was once close with, but torn away from because of her dad's conflict with him. Seagal makes the most of the subplot of him as the awkward family man and substitute father figure, and Heigl shows that she can handle an action scene, adding some much-needed eye candy to make a slight but very significant improvement to an otherwise underrated film.

Seagal makes the most of the subplot of him as the awkward family man and substitute father figure, and Heigl shows that she can handle an action scene, adding some much-needed eye candy to make a slight but very significant improvement to an otherwise underrated film.

Nick, a journalist, is looking for an apartment in a town where he just moved to. He seems to find the ideal place. A spacious flat rented by a wealthy and seemingly normal family. Daughter of the family is Adrian. She is beautiful, talented and clever. She also has interest in Nick. It is not strange when a girl has interest in an older guy, in this case much older. However, Adrian is a bit different from the girls from her age. She knows what exactly she wants. It is not a smile, or a few flirtatious moment. She wants Nick to fall in love with her. That's the time Nick decides to stop this. Adrian is so dangerous that she does not mind harming people around her and Nick in order to re-win his heart and she is determined to do that in any costs. Okay, we know how dangerous a human being can be. But there are some moments when I thought it was too much. First, a highly qualified journalist writes a piece to be published then a 14 year old girl looks at it, makes a few changes and editor loves it after all those changes. Come on!! You must be kidding. Secondly, she is in Nick flat, knows all hidden corners. So, does she have a spare key? Or is Nick stupid enough to lock the door after what has been happening. Then, Adrian, locks Nick's girlfriend in the photo-editing room and sends all the wasps into the room from ventilation. Again, how does she find out whereabouts she lives. Basically, we have a villain who is 14 years old and victim is helpless. The only person he can get to believe him is his girlfriend. That takes a while too. Acting is average. Not known names as Alicia Silverstone was discovered after filming The Crush. Cary Elwes is always in average movies anyway such as The Shadow of The Vampire, Jungle Book..

When I started watching, I felt it was kind of disconnected from its predecessors, as is inevitable because of a gap of over 15 years between Part II and Part III.The story revolves around an aging Michael Corleone making a deal with the Archbishop and others in the Vatican as a step towards going completely legitimate. But as it turns out, they have plans of their own (along with some other people) to swindle him instead. Michael realizes that the more he tries to get rid of his old ways, the more he seems to be sucked right back in! This is one review which will have to start with its minuses rather than its pluses! 1. It is appalling to see an old, tired, ill Michael Corleone gone all soft! Also, he is no more the brooding, cold, calculating, heartless Michael we've come to know from the later half of Part I and the whole of Part II. Here's a guy who we have always known to not break into a hysterical fit over the death of someone close to him (e.g.'s deaths of Sonny, The Godfather himself and Mama Corleone). He always expressed his grief through his eyes; and always maintained a calm demeanor. Yet, in this movie, he goes completely over the top, insane with grief and screams like hell when his daughter is killed in the end! Not that he is not good in the scene; he is of course, great! But it is rather sad to see a regretful Michael, weeping every now and then! He just seems so weak and helpless.2. Most of the characters I'd come to love after Part II are missing. One most important character is Tom Hagen! He is sorely missed and I cursed the film-maker for not giving Robert Duvall the salary he wanted and casting him in the role of Hagen again! Instead, Hagen's son makes a small appearance! 3. Andy Garcia has been introduced as Vincent, Sonny's illegitimate son! Personally, I have nothing against Garcia, and he has been good in all his other movies I've seen. But he just didn't seem a good fit here! He tries too hard, is short tempered like his father Sonny, but the whole thing just doesn't work for him! I am surprised he got an Oscar nomination! 4. And about Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter Mary...the less said the better! 5. This is a sequel that rips some scenes off from the first and second movies.For example, there is a function in the beginning and Johnny Fontane makes an appearance to sing a song! Then there is Michael telling Santino's illegitimate son Vincent, Never let anyone else know what you're thinking (reminds one of the same thing said to Santino by Don Vito in Part I). The scene of the killing of Joe Zasa looks like a cheaper imitation of the killing of Don Fanucci from Part II! Both killings take place during a festival.Then the arrangement of a meeting with the members of other families, to make peace again a reminder of the powerful meeting scene where Don Vito makes peace with the heads of the other families, from Part I.Now the few pluses 1. Acting from Al Pacino. He is now old, weak and sick, so he doesn't appear to be anything like the Michael we have known from Part II. Still, a great actor that he is, he does justice to what the script demands of him; although I would still have loved to see his ruthless old self! Acting from Talia Shire she is good as the old Connie who is always by Michael's side.2. The climax scene at the Opera. This is one scene that is reminiscent of the brilliance of the first two parts. Wonderfully directed! 3. The final scene of the death of Michael Corleone. I have to admit, it was very sad to see him die alone. That is a very powerful scene indeed.This movie is actually quite watchable and a fairly decent film, if watched as a stand-alone after possibly changing its name! But as a part of The Godfather series, it appears highly pale in comparison to the first two parts, and hence loses points.If only Coppola would've at least tried to come close to the greatness of Part II...6.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After hearing about all the bad reports, I still wanted to see The Godfather Part III, since the great feeling of having watched Part II still lingered!

When I started watching, I felt it was kind of disconnected from its predecessors, as is inevitable because of a gap of over 15 years between Part II and Part III.The story revolves around an aging Michael Corleone making a deal with the Archbishop and others in the Vatican as a step towards going completely legitimate. But as it turns out, they have plans of their own (along with some other people) to swindle him instead. Michael realizes that the more he tries to get rid of his old ways, the more he seems to be sucked right back in! This is one review which will have to start with its minuses rather than its pluses! 1. It is appalling to see an old, tired, ill Michael Corleone gone all soft! Also, he is no more the brooding, cold, calculating, heartless Michael we've come to know from the later half of Part I and the whole of Part II. Here's a guy who we have always known to not break into a hysterical fit over the death of someone close to him (e.g.'s deaths of Sonny, The Godfather himself and Mama Corleone). He always expressed his grief through his eyes; and always maintained a calm demeanor. Yet, in this movie, he goes completely over the top, insane with grief and screams like hell when his daughter is killed in the end! Not that he is not good in the scene; he is of course, great! But it is rather sad to see a regretful Michael, weeping every now and then! He just seems so weak and helpless.2. Most of the characters I'd come to love after Part II are missing. One most important character is Tom Hagen! He is sorely missed and I cursed the film-maker for not giving Robert Duvall the salary he wanted and casting him in the role of Hagen again! Instead, Hagen's son makes a small appearance! 3. Andy Garcia has been introduced as Vincent, Sonny's illegitimate son! Personally, I have nothing against Garcia, and he has been good in all his other movies I've seen. But he just didn't seem a good fit here! He tries too hard, is short tempered like his father Sonny, but the whole thing just doesn't work for him! I am surprised he got an Oscar nomination! 4. And about Sofia Coppola as Michael's daughter Mary...the less said the better! 5. This is a sequel that rips some scenes off from the first and second movies.For example, there is a function in the beginning and Johnny Fontane makes an appearance to sing a song! Then there is Michael telling Santino's illegitimate son Vincent, Never let anyone else know what you're thinking (reminds one of the same thing said to Santino by Don Vito in Part I). The scene of the killing of Joe Zasa looks like a cheaper imitation of the killing of Don Fanucci from Part II! Both killings take place during a festival.Then the arrangement of a meeting with the members of other families, to make peace again a reminder of the powerful meeting scene where Don Vito makes peace with the heads of the other families, from Part I.Now the few pluses 1. Acting from Al Pacino. He is now old, weak and sick, so he doesn't appear to be anything like the Michael we have known from Part II. Still, a great actor that he is, he does justice to what the script demands of him; although I would still have loved to see his ruthless old self! Acting from Talia Shire she is good as the old Connie who is always by Michael's side.2. The climax scene at the Opera. This is one scene that is reminiscent of the brilliance of the first two parts. Wonderfully directed! 3. The final scene of the death of Michael Corleone. I have to admit, it was very sad to see him die alone. That is a very powerful scene indeed.This movie is actually quite watchable and a fairly decent film, if watched as a stand-alone after possibly changing its name!

It is very exciting, a little suspenseful, and funny all at the same time. Pedro Almodovar directed the film in 1988 and it was nominated for the best foreign movie at he Oscars. The movie did not win the Oscar, but it was a huge success in the United States and world-wide. The protagonist, Pepa, is played by Carmen Maura, a very talented actress. Carmen Maura has starred in other movies by Pedro Almodovar as well. He likes to use the same actors and actresses in his movies, for example, Antonio Banderas who is in this movie as the son (insecure and stuttering) of the first lover of Ivan, Lucia. The movie takes place in Madrid during the 1980's. The culture then was recuperating from the dictatorship of Franco. Under Franco the women had little rights they couldn't work, they couldn't take birth control pills, everyone (even men) couldn't be homosexual publicly, and many others. Because of this, after Franco the culture became much more liberal and this movie reflects this movement. For example, Ivan has sex with many women and it seems to be that almost all the characters are having sex with someone outside of marriage, Pepa, a woman, has a very famous and respectable job, Candela as well, religion seems to be inexistent and drugs and sleeping pills are easily accessible. These sorts of things were prohibited under Franco. For the whole course of the movie Pepa, the lover of Ivan, is trying to get ah-old of him so that they can speak, but she cannot find him and it seems that he is avoiding her. Pepa's search for Ivan drives her crazy (because she cannot control her emotions). Candela, one of Pepa's friends and a model, has become frantic herself because she had sex with a terrorist that the police have recently detained. Candela is worried that the terrorists are going to inform the police that she allowed them to stay with her. So, Candela goes to Pepa's apartment for help, but Ivan's son and his fiancé interrupt them. In my opinion, Carmen Maura does a great job in the movie as Pepa. She is very convincing and natural; she plays the role perfectly. Antonio Banderas is good also, but I feel that he was a little inexperienced. The music in the movie is good, especially the mango music in the scenes inside the taxi. All in all, I think that Almodovar made a movie of suspense and excitement. The film showed me a side of women that I didn't know existed; it was a little enlightening for me. I liked the movie because it was suspenseful, the acting is great, it is directed well, and I learned something by watching it. I want my friends to see it because some of them think that women are weaker than men. I think they can learn from watching this movie.

I understand he's a kick@$$ action hero, but the guy is not all American, which is what Guile was all about. The portrayal of Sagat was disappointing; he's supposed to be a terrifying 7 foot tall menace, not some weak looking failed businessman. Removing Fei Long altogether was understandable, but Blanka should've been more prominent, rather than some odd rehash of Charlie and the Brazillian beast. Making Dhalsim a doctor, with NO powers at all, does not do justice to the real Dhalsim. I liked this doctor, but I want to see Dhalsim! Some of the characters were okay though; Dee Jay made a surprisingly good villain, Bison was well chosen, and Zangief was hilarious, but that's about as good as it gets. This movie also lacked any special moves at all, I mean understand they were on a low budget, and it was nearly 12 years ago, but come on, you can have a corny movie with cool colors, a cool movie with no colors, but you can't have a corny movie with no colors and expect people to love it (colors means ha-do-kens by the way). The only move they tried to portray was Bison's psycho crusher, and that kind of failed.

The basic plot is about a girl who wants more out of life than just to be married, (not that she doesn't want to get married- she just wants to find the right guy). Emmy wants to explore and invent and she knows there's a better way out there, so she appeals to the 'gods' of Eqypt asking them to show her the better way. They in turn make a deal with her. She can go through different times in history and seek out who and and what era is best for her but she can only appear alive to the ONE she's testing. She goes through historical figures such as Michelangelo and 'Chris' Columbus and finally lands in 1987 in the arms of Jonathan a nothing special struggling artist who can't seem to find a job. When she appears to him in the store window he fights to get a job to be close to the only thing that's made him feel like a real artist. As she comes to life, (only in front of him), she teaches him to loosen up and be who he his and he falls in love with her while making the most brilliant window displays for Price and Co. With the crazy\/cool story plot, great actors, and awesome music this film deserves an 8.5\/10 (I NEVER give 10's- not even to my favourite film) because it's almost perfect. P.S. I've advise when watching it that you don't think too much. Remember that it's a ROM\/COM and just enjoy it.

Children get their first impressions of the world through the beliefs of their parents. These impressions are indelible. Normally, early childhood is spent in the protection of loving parents, but what if these parents are not the cuddling kind? What if they despise your weakness of crying, instead of saying words of comfort? What if there is no place in your family to share feelings and fears? Even when you later discover that it is OK to feel, the defences you have built around your personality in your early years are very difficult to undo and if you have overcome them they are still triggered when you have to deal with your family. In the film we see four adult siblings who have survived the misery and rebelled, each in different ways. Most people fortunately don't know how terrible it is for the father to put his two boys into his mother's care, his fears seem exaggerated, surely a stern grandmother can't be too bad. But her type of sternness is very damaging not just to overly sensitive people. We see this more clearly as the story unfolds and we learn how each member of the family has coped and yet no one has been able to topple the matriarch from her throne. But as she takes the education of yet another generation in her hands, the tensions mount to breaking point.This film is not a comedy, though it has its funny moments. It is not a complete tragedy either, and it avoids becoming bleak and depressing. I think its greatest value is in showing those who have had a warm cradle -- fortunately most -- what it's like to have had a cold one, if it helps increase a general understanding of the emotional difficulties that these people have to overcome to unlock their shielded hearts to their fellow men.

While it is not for everyone, anyone who is into something truly unique should check out this movie. If the fact that movie genius Tim Burton was involved in this movie did NOT spark your attention, then please continue to read.The story in a nutshell Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloweentown (with a speaking voice of Chris Sarandon) is depressed. He is growing bored with scaring people and now wants to try something different. This is when Jack comes to a fantastic place--Christmas Town. The idea of Christmas excites Jack, which eventually leads to the kidnapping of Santa Claus (or Sandy Claws as the Halloween populace calls him). Without giving spoilers, let's just say that things don't go quite as well as Jack planned.This story, while it might sound a bit cheesy on paper to some people, is pulled off beautifully. The humor is stuck in a very subtle way and despite their appearances, you will grow to love these characters. The wonderfully composed soundtrack doesn't hurt either.The first song, This is Halloween does a perfect job of introducing the townspeople of Halloweentown. It also opens up in a flashy way (that's in a GOOD flashy way though). The slick stop-motion animation pulls you right in, including ghosts carrying packages and wind blowing through a rag-doll's hair (the rag-doll being Jack's love interest, Sally, voiced by Catherine O'Hara). Then within less than 10 minutes of the movie, the problem of the story is revealed.Jack's Lament, which is gorgeously sung by Danny Elfman (who also happened to compose the soundtrack to this movie) describes Jack's problem perfectly. What's This is a polar opposite of the lament, bursting with joy. Danny Elfman excellently portrays Jack's anguish here and through out the rest of the movie.The other voices are nicely done as well, from the vocals in the seemingly morbid song Kidnap the Sandy Claus (sung by a trio of twisted youngsters) to the Las Vegas styled Oogie Boogie Song to the sad Sally's Song. The lyrics in this music (lyrics are also written by Danny Elfman)can range from witty to pure poetry. Don't be surprised if you find yourself singing the songs yourself--they are THAT good.So all in all, a must watch. Buy it or rent it now. You will definitely not regret it.
