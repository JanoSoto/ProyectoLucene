It's a movie I longed for without ever knowing it existed. How can a movie with so little dialogue say so much to those who watch it? First I'd like to say that, if for no other reason at all, 2001 is one of the greatest films of all time solely because it is so visually striking. For a film released in 1968, you would almost be fooled into thinking that Kubrick had futuristic CGI technology at his disposal during the creation of his masterpiece. The space scenes are that vibrant and life-like. All of the set pieces are stunningly authentic feeling, which I attribute to good timing filming a space movie smack dab in the middle of the space race must have provided a great visual guideline for Kubrick to follow. The special effects are top-notch, and although I already mentioned that some shots were CGI like in quality, that's only because you don't assume that such great special effects could be found in a movie from '68. But the reality is that many shots are, in some ways, better than any CGI animation could dream of being. There is no substitute for a highly detailed model or set piece, and that feeling they provide that you could almost reach out and touch them, which is routinely achieved in 2001.There is so much to be said about the feeling of authenticity in 2001. One of my biggest gripes with almost all sci-fi films is just how unauthentic and unrealistic they feel. Am I lacking in imagination and vision? Certainly not, I simply find it much easier to relate to a film that is based in some form of reality that I am familiar with. It goes without saying that I have never witnessed primitive human species in Africa or spacecraft navigation to the moon or Jupiter firsthand, but Kubrick's 2001 makes me feel as if I have. He takes the world we live in and witness on our t.v. sets and simultaneously brings them to our living rooms as well as the other side of the universe. I respect movie makers who create elaborate spacecraft with mysterious propulsion systems, a plethora of alien races and features, technology so advanced that even the explanations of those technologies don't seem to fully make sense. I respect the vision that other directors can portray on scene in other-worldly science fiction films, but I have never related to anything quite like what 2001 created. Everything was believable and authentic feeling. This idea is so often under-looked and left behind in science fiction, as the most outrageous ideas dominate the story and scenery.Onto the story itself, again, I feel that it's simplicity is what makes it so extraordinary. 2001 doesn't center around some unbelievable and extravagant plot, consisting of vast explanations and plot twists that require large suspensions of reality by movie-goers. The plot of the 2001 does a fantastic job of mostly speaking for, and explaining, itself, leaving the mind to focus on the visuals, the sounds (or lack there of) and the magnitude of questioning our origins on earth. Another fantastic quality to this movie that I wish would be emulated more often in sci-fi Hollywood.A review of 2001 without any analysis of the audio would not be considered complete by any stretch of the imagination. Many scenes rely almost entirely on the sounds, music, or pure silence. Kubrick uses powerfully orchestrated music to coincide with the stunning visuals, creating the most positive form of sensory overload imaginable. The music played during the astronauts walk to the monolith on the moon is utterly hair raising. The very same music could be played to a video of two kittens cuddling, and I would undoubtedly feel inexplicably frightened. It's that powerful and moving.All three of these positive qualities that make up 2001 are the qualities I have so often longed for in other sci-fi movies, yet never found. I feel a bit silly to know that there has been a movie out there all along that incorporates all of the qualities almost flawlessly that is nearly 20 years older than myself.Now, for the ending. I have read other IMDb reviews that are critical of the ending, and I must say that it is the only portion of the film that I felt ran a little astray. When David finally reaches the space surrounding Jupiter my attention, intrigue and suspense is at an all time high. Whether it be a product of lack of technological ability to create the desired special effects, time constraints, or possibly Kubrick himself didn't have a complete vision on where he wanted the end of his story to go, the climax of 2001 is rather confusing and unsatisfying. I hate to write those words in talking about what is easily one of my new favorites, if not my absolute favorite, of all time. But it is the truth and I wouldn't be doing the film any justice by giving an incomplete opinion of the ending. I grasped the concept, for the most part, of traveling thru a star gate, but after that I was mostly lost, confused and felt completely taken out of the story that had done so much to bring me into it leading up to that point. The entire world that Kubrick so masterfully created seemed to come shattering down inside the walls of a strange, alien, Victorian bedroom.That being said, it at least ended on some form of positive feeling of familiarity, with the young life-form overlooking earth with the powerful symphony playing behind him.Overall amazing film, outstanding visual\/effects, stunning score, genius film making. No other sci-fi film compares, in my eyes.

","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 January 2013","score":"","review":" A fair number of film scholars and enthusiasts would agree that the career of John Carpenter began with tremendous success, culminated with his much-loved 1978 scare picture Halloween, and has been merely sputtering ever since. I am not one of those people. For me, Halloween was a decent yet unremarkable thriller&#x97;constantly threatened by some very bad acting&#x97;and Carpenter's track record in the years since, at least through the mid-1980s, only grew more impressive, more interesting, and more enjoyable. Hence I feel that his 1980 ghost story The Fog is a step up from the bogeyman fable that made him a household name in the horror genre.One of Carpenter's nicest assets as a director is his choice of subtle subject matter. He tells old-fashioned, simplistic stories without trying to make them over into something profound. After all, Halloween was at heart just a bogeyman story with some slight touches of Sigmund Freud thrown in. Escape from New York featured some social satire, but was predominately a science-fiction spectacle. And Carpenter's best film, The Thing, became so intensely frightening because it understood its base as a 'who's who' monster movie. The same applies to The Fog. There is an explanation as to why the ghosts in this story decide to attack a particular seaside neighborhood on a particular night, but the answer is thrown in our laps right away. Even if you axed the movie's prologue&#x97;which Carpenter originally intended&#x97;we would learn the motives of these specters before the first hour was up and the big string of attacks had begun.It would have been all too easy, and perhaps tempting, for Carpenter and his co-screenwriter Debra Hill to try and weave some mock-profundity out of all this, but thankfully, they did not. As a result, The Fog wisely steps away from being an hour and a half of pseudo-intellectual nonsense and plays itself with a straight face. And not for a second is it boring.The narrative bounces between several of the town's inhabitants, all of whom are represented by very talented actors. Halloween star Jamie Lee Curtis takes one of the starring roles and shows a vast improvement in her acting, starring alongside none other than her mother, Janet Leigh. It does seem appropriate; both of these actresses got their start in movies in which they were stalked by deranged killers with butcher knives (Miss Leigh in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho) so it must have been a dream come true for Carpenter to put them together. Yet he does not go for the obvious tactic of turning them into cinema pals; they do not even share a two-shot until the final reel. And neither actress is allowed to steal screen time from anybody else; in fact, the only one who comes even close to doing so is the one who was the most interesting Adrienne Barbeau as the owner of a lighthouse-set radio station, watching and reporting as the big waves of glowing fog wash over her community.I liked the people in The Fog and I liked the ghouls who emerge from the misty walls, but what I enjoyed the most was Carpenter's visual flair as a director his insistence on shying from ultra-tight close-ups so aplenty in most horror films, the bluish tint he has applied to the lens, how the camera transitions between light and dark settings, and the way he stages bizarre scenarios. There are a number of 'what-is-going-on?' moments in The Fog, such as water bleeding from a piece of driftwood before suddenly catching fire, and the director stages everything excellently. He gives special attention to these seemingly inexplicable moments. In these moments, the audience forgets this stuff is foreseeable in a spook-story and joins in with the characters, pondering what is happening and what will soon happen. And when the ghouls do appear, Carpenter uses the fog motif and the distance between the specters and the camera efficiently. He appropriately does not give us too much of the villains, thereby rendering them more effective. Less is more.On the negative side of the equation, I wish Carpenter and Debra Hill had chosen a straight-forward resolution to wrap up their story. As a matter of fact, they start out with one, only to follow in the footsteps of A Nightmare on Elm Street, where the peaceful yet haunting conclusion is capped off with an out-of-the-blue shocker. It's not bad&#x97;especially not the way it's been photographed&#x97;it just seems unnecessary. In addition, although the ghosts' motive for returning to this town a hundred years after their deaths is spelled out clearly, the selection of their victims does seem a tad hazy. Once again, I'm glad the screenwriters did not try to make some mock-profound social commentary out of the whole ordeal, but just another sentence or two to explain who they will come after would have helped some. Basically everything else is just nitpicks was it necessary to have Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins jump into bed a minute after they meet when the rest of the movie really just presents them as two strangers with a developing friendship?And one does beg the question why do the ghosts target clustered individuals behind walls and barriers when there's a town gathering smack-dab in the open?So what if it's not an impeccable masterpiece? I've never been one to let nitpicks go too far, especially when my mood when viewing the picture has been predominately positive. In the case of The Fog, my mood was overwhelmingly positive; I really enjoyed watching this simplistic ghost fable. Because, once again, it does not make itself out to be anything big, profound, and deep. It just drills as deep into the plot mechanics as it needs to (maybe a tad too shallow, I admit) and lets the director's flair take control of the entertainment value. It's not a perfect movie, but I still liked it very much.

And not for a second is it boring.The narrative bounces between several of the town's inhabitants, all of whom are represented by very talented actors. Halloween star Jamie Lee Curtis takes one of the starring roles and shows a vast improvement in her acting, starring alongside none other than her mother, Janet Leigh. It does seem appropriate; both of these actresses got their start in movies in which they were stalked by deranged killers with butcher knives (Miss Leigh in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho) so it must have been a dream come true for Carpenter to put them together. Yet he does not go for the obvious tactic of turning them into cinema pals; they do not even share a two-shot until the final reel. And neither actress is allowed to steal screen time from anybody else; in fact, the only one who comes even close to doing so is the one who was the most interesting Adrienne Barbeau as the owner of a lighthouse-set radio station, watching and reporting as the big waves of glowing fog wash over her community.I liked the people in The Fog and I liked the ghouls who emerge from the misty walls, but what I enjoyed the most was Carpenter's visual flair as a director his insistence on shying from ultra-tight close-ups so aplenty in most horror films, the bluish tint he has applied to the lens, how the camera transitions between light and dark settings, and the way he stages bizarre scenarios. There are a number of 'what-is-going-on?' moments in The Fog, such as water bleeding from a piece of driftwood before suddenly catching fire, and the director stages everything excellently. He gives special attention to these seemingly inexplicable moments. In these moments, the audience forgets this stuff is foreseeable in a spook-story and joins in with the characters, pondering what is happening and what will soon happen. And when the ghouls do appear, Carpenter uses the fog motif and the distance between the specters and the camera efficiently. He appropriately does not give us too much of the villains, thereby rendering them more effective. Less is more.On the negative side of the equation, I wish Carpenter and Debra Hill had chosen a straight-forward resolution to wrap up their story. As a matter of fact, they start out with one, only to follow in the footsteps of A Nightmare on Elm Street, where the peaceful yet haunting conclusion is capped off with an out-of-the-blue shocker. It's not bad&#x97;especially not the way it's been photographed&#x97;it just seems unnecessary. In addition, although the ghosts' motive for returning to this town a hundred years after their deaths is spelled out clearly, the selection of their victims does seem a tad hazy. Once again, I'm glad the screenwriters did not try to make some mock-profound social commentary out of the whole ordeal, but just another sentence or two to explain who they will come after would have helped some. Basically everything else is just nitpicks was it necessary to have Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins jump into bed a minute after they meet when the rest of the movie really just presents them as two strangers with a developing friendship?And one does beg the question why do the ghosts target clustered individuals behind walls and barriers when there's a town gathering smack-dab in the open?So what if it's not an impeccable masterpiece? I've never been one to let nitpicks go too far, especially when my mood when viewing the picture has been predominately positive. In the case of The Fog, my mood was overwhelmingly positive; I really enjoyed watching this simplistic ghost fable. Because, once again, it does not make itself out to be anything big, profound, and deep. It just drills as deep into the plot mechanics as it needs to (maybe a tad too shallow, I admit) and lets the director's flair take control of the entertainment value. It's not a perfect movie, but I still liked it very much.

I was telling my friends about it and they didn't seem interested when I told them that this movie was made in 1960. After a few weeks, I went over to a friend's house and I made them watch it, no matter what. They think they've seen scary movies, (TCM, Friday the 13th, etc.) but when they watched Psycho, I've never seen someone so involved in a movie. They, just as I was when I first watched it, were yelling at the screen, covering their eyes, gasping every so often, and when it ended, they agreed that it was one of the best movies they have ever watched. They were completely intrigued by diversity of the movie compared to today's horror and thriller movies that they love. I asked them if they would watch more Alfred Hitchcock and they said, Of course! What I'm saying is that this movie is amazing, certainly Alfred Hitchcock's best work and the greatest thriller\/horror of all time, and that if anyone who is reading this and is in the youth of America; give classic (old) movies a chance!!

Many reviewers unfairly criticize the reverse flow as a gratuitous artsy gimmick, but that's actually a necessity. The RF puts us in the same psychological situation as Leonard, the protagonist suffering from short memory loss we can't remember anything that happened earlier because we haven't seen it yet. On other hand we probably have already forgotten what we have already seen, the near future, as it didn't make any sense anyway because it lacked a proper context. So we are as lost and as clueless as him. The best proof of this is Natalie's beer test. We see Lenny innocently taking a sip, some guy at the bar laughing at him and Natalie saying--so you really got a problem. It's only in the next color segment that we make sense of it. The same is true for the other, uglier Natalie's test. There's still another scene where this is proved in a more dramatic way, where he's running down a street not knowing why. He sees another guy running&#x97;OK, I'm chasing this guy--but then the man points a gun at him--Oops, he's chasing me. That was funny, if dramatic.But despite this being a pretty entertaining thriller&#x97;one specially recommended for those who love mental puzzles--I doubt it has much long lasting power, because of the things it lacks rather than for the flaws it may have. Firstly, it lacks philosophical reach, the same depth flicks as Matrix and Dark City got aplenty. They both delve into subjects like free will, the true nature of reality, wondering aloud if such things really exist or if they are just mental constructs by us or by some superior entity. M. is at its core just another clinical report about how messed up our lives can be if we lose our memories, even a minute part of it. It shows how much we depend on it; more of an open-your-eyes-to-this-reality docudrama, so is not surprising that its greatest fans can be found in the medical profession. Also, it can't be seen as a bona fide artwork either because, while its editing is a work of genius and the cinematography and direction are quite good, there are really no unforgettable things about it. This is not 2001,The Matrix, Dark City of which many images have become imprinted in our minds--a spinning space station; millions of people in their plastic pods; the creation by a single man of an entire planet, etc. Neither this is a story of human interest like for ex. A Beautiful Mind--a fable of love, perseverance defeating mental illness; or, for those who love it, A Wonderful Life. And how could it be? This characters are the most despicable bunch to have graced film screens in decades. We don't feel for them and we may even think the world could be a better place if they are dead. The fact is, despite all the glitzy appearances there's is no reason why audiences would want to watch Memento, say, 20 years from. Mind you, French Connection, Bullit, Serpico, were huge events were they came out and who's watching them now..But all this doesn't mean this is not a flick worth watching; quite the contrary as you'll have a lot to look for here, specially--apart from the brainy stuff--the pretty good writing, the tight directing, the superb acting by all, except by Dodd, who while in the closet looks more as if waiting for a formal introduction than suitably scared to death. Pierce look convincingly confused and messed up all along but his best work is in the innocence Lenny thinks he's radiating&#x97;I'm the victim here--blissfully unaware of how despicable he is. See, he thinks nothing of murdering a man with no relation to him and then topping all that by stealing his car and clothes. He slams a door in the face of an innocent stranger and all he does next is to mutter a cursory Sorry to the decked victim before going about his business. All that is suggesting his memories of his wife are just another illusion he has created for his own comfort. Such an angel couldn't have possibly married such a monster! Teddy mentions who Lenny was and who he's now but I don't think that's related with memory loss. As I said in my Dark City review, I don't think memory has any role in building up our identity; if Lenny is a monster now, he has probably always been one. In any case we are not in much better position where he got a memory hole we got fairy tales, constructs of our imagination rather than lucid, objective, recollections of facts. About Teddy, I liked the way Pantoliano delivers his lines, modulating them as if he was doing some opera. That gives a sharp edge to his Teddy, eliminating all need for emphasizing it with action or hamming it up. Moss does a great job also. The married couple is good too, yet the fact that it may be all an illusion takes a lot, if not, of the little human interest the flick had up to that point.An impeccable production from A to Z--I loved that mood creating score--yet it all comes at the end as the tale of a poor sap trying to piece his life together with pictures, notes and tattoos. But I have a beef both stories flow in opposite ways, to meet in the middle, when a Polaroid gets colored. The way it's done is confusing, as the scene where that merging occurs should have been the last one, when Lenny arrives at the tattoo shop. So the right way to do it was to let the B&W last until that shot and then, only then, switch to color for the last few seconds. Anyway, pretty entertaining, at least until the novelty wears off, a 7.5\/10 plus .5 for originality.

Pierce look convincingly confused and messed up all along but his best work is in the innocence Lenny thinks he's radiating&#x97;I'm the victim here--blissfully unaware of how despicable he is. See, he thinks nothing of murdering a man with no relation to him and then topping all that by stealing his car and clothes. He slams a door in the face of an innocent stranger and all he does next is to mutter a cursory Sorry to the decked victim before going about his business. All that is suggesting his memories of his wife are just another illusion he has created for his own comfort. Such an angel couldn't have possibly married such a monster! Teddy mentions who Lenny was and who he's now but I don't think that's related with memory loss. As I said in my Dark City review, I don't think memory has any role in building up our identity; if Lenny is a monster now, he has probably always been one. In any case we are not in much better position where he got a memory hole we got fairy tales, constructs of our imagination rather than lucid, objective, recollections of facts. About Teddy, I liked the way Pantoliano delivers his lines, modulating them as if he was doing some opera. That gives a sharp edge to his Teddy, eliminating all need for emphasizing it with action or hamming it up. Moss does a great job also. The married couple is good too, yet the fact that it may be all an illusion takes a lot, if not, of the little human interest the flick had up to that point.An impeccable production from A to Z--I loved that mood creating score--yet it all comes at the end as the tale of a poor sap trying to piece his life together with pictures, notes and tattoos. But I have a beef both stories flow in opposite ways, to meet in the middle, when a Polaroid gets colored. The way it's done is confusing, as the scene where that merging occurs should have been the last one, when Lenny arrives at the tattoo shop. So the right way to do it was to let the B&W last until that shot and then, only then, switch to color for the last few seconds. Anyway, pretty entertaining, at least until the novelty wears off, a 7.5\/10 plus .5 for originality.

Unfortunately, Walt Disney died two years after, and the studio began failing, and failing, and failing. It had a couple of hits, but they were modest at best, and didn't leave an impact audiences wanted. This went on for about 15 years. This era has become known as The Dark Age of Disney. I mention this period of time because Steven Lisberger came in with a script that would help turn things around at Disney. Tron was one the most original and thought provoking films of the 80s, as well as all time. The story involved Kevin Flynn (played by Jeff Bridges) who seeks to obtain information that a rival (played by David Warner) has screwed him out of ownership and a job at a tech company called Encom. While searching for the information, a rapidly growing AI called the MCP (Master Control Program) transports Flynn to the electronic world in order to get rid of him. In order to break out, Flynn befriends the legendary warrior Tron (Bruce Boxlietner) and both seek to destroy the MCP to free their world and Flynn from its tyrannical leader.The most talked about aspect of this film is the animation (there is a lot of it) as well as new Computer Generated animation. Lisberger teamed up with special effects wizard Harrison Ellenshaw (son of the great Peter Ellenshaw) to nail down the look Lisberger had envisioned. These effects still hold up really well. The back-lit animation is stunning, especially when it lights up on the characters. The light-bikes are totally awesome, and still provides for a neat chase in the middle of the film.The script is very strong, considering it's outlandish ideas compared to its very simple storyline. It takes advantage of the video game culture and the booming advances in Silicon Valley, but makes people think in terms of a religious undertone. The idea between the users and the programs are very touching. There are some shots where Lisberger never makes it clear whether or not we are living in his world or if our world looks like his. Most of it is because of good acting from the indelible Jeff Bridges, and underrated work from Bruce Boxlietner as Tron. David Warner as the villain is an inspired choice, and he delivers a devious minion to the MCP. He is a villain god, nothing less. The only thing that isn't very special anymore is the MCP himself, nowadays it looks like a Super Mario blooper. This film is very often overlooked. It's very unfair that it is because it is a very unique film. For what would seem a dated film, it has a timeless feel to it, and will last longer than other Disney projects from the Dark Era of Disney.

The latter, to tell you the truth, I haven't yet completed reading, it has been in limbo for some two-three years, but though I don't care much about them, has received pleasant reviews indeed. Now to the movie - except for Morgan Freeman, the star cast was pretty much unknown to me. But of course, great acting surpasses popularity.

The Americans may think about slavery, when they tried to control people just because they could. we, europeans,think about the same, but also about how our countries were formed, and how we obliged so many African tribes to form so many fake republics. maybe one they a fog would come and revenge on us. I don't know, but this film made me believe that could be possible. Pure cinema magic, a masterpiece of terror and suspense.

Interiors on the other hand would be like Portland (Oregon) in the middle of February; wet, dark, and utterly depressing.Like most Woody Allen movies, Interiors had some (mostly dark) humor, amazing dialogue, therapists, NYC scenery, deception, and unhappiness. However, there was something about the attitudes, the dialogue which made this movie stand out from the others of Allen's jacket that I have seen. While it always takes me a few minutes post movie to digest everything that just happened, never has a Woody Allen movie produced such a feeling of dismay as Interiors.Despite the obvious darkness, it's hard to put my finger on exactly what made this movie so much more depressing than the rest. The ending was by far the saddest scene I have witnessed (again, in Woody Allen movies), but we were already brought into a world of utter sadness.The movie features three sisters (although one sister plays a small role), two significant others, and a couple parents. The father, at the age of 60something seems to be going through a mid-life crises. After a lifetime of supporting his three daughters financially and his slowly losing her mind wife both financially and emotionally, he is ready to movie on. He breaks it to the family over a somber dinner in quite a monotone monologue. We're shown over the next hour or so, how much the mother relied on the father for almost everything.At the same time, we're shown the relationships of the two older sisters with their respective significant others. The older sister is a somewhat successful (and trust funded) poet, who appears loving and thoughtful. Her husband, a novelist, cannot stand the fact that she is more known than he and takes it out on her in all sorts of ways. He is a bit emotionally abusive and on a drunken evening attempts to rape the youngest sister. The middle sister is a nerdy artist on the inside, helpless middle aged woman on the outside. She is a relationship with a quiet, not too noticeable man.By the end of the film, there isn't much hope for any of the characters, except maybe for the father who has remarried a bit of an idiotic woman whom the family dislikes. After a crazy life, he just wants to see a pretty face in the mornings and not have to think about too much.

But now with Dana Barrett(Sigourney Weaver) in trouble with ghosts again,the Ghostbusters have to revive their business to not only deal with Ghosts,but a new villain named Vigo(Wilhelm Von Homburg,voiced by Max Von Sydow)and a pink mood slime that feeds on negative energy of the city and the Ghostbusters are the only ones to do something about it and when there's something strange in the neighborhood who you're gonna call? I honestly don't know or have any idea why GBII has a mixed reception with most Ghostbusters fans and film critics,although the film made money at the Box Office some fans and critics felt GBII didn't live up to the first film but I have always loved this movie and I think it's very underrated. The reasons why I love GBII and why it works is because it's a great sequel,the characters,the screenplay and the special effects. Doing a sequel can be a tricky thing especially when you do a sequel to a beloved classic like Ghostbusters,but director Ivan Reitman and co-writers\/co-stars Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and Bill Murray manage to pull off a great sequel that I don't think was trying to top the first film,but do a sequel with things that made the first film work. Like the first film,this film greatly balances Comedy and Supernatural terror with laughs that are funny either because of the characters or the situations the characters go through or the dialog. When the supernatural element of the film comes into play the tone and eerie atmosphere of GBII is scary and is up there with the first in terms of matching the spookiness and creepiness and will have images that will frighten you and also make you laugh your head off. I guess with moviegoers a sequel is going to be good or bad,the sequel is going to be like the first film or different from the first film,it's a damned if do,damned if you don't situation and some have said that GBII is a rehash of the first film I can say yes and no to that argument. Yes because GBII has the same characters and a few scenes similar to the first and no because of the story involving pink mood slime and people's negative emotions making the slime is very creative and the villain Vigo is a great antagonist for the Ghostbusters and compared with most sequels that have came out since GBII in which some are done for a quick cash grab at the Box Office,this sequel is pretty creative and done with heart and great imagination. The main characters in GBII Peter,Ray,Egon and Winston like the first film are likable and funny showing the Ghostbusters and how they've dealt with being out of work and of business and how they make a comeback and are accepted again by the city after five years almost like nothing had ever happened in the first film. The screenplay written once again by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis is well-written and funny with great scenes and dialog and creative moments and while the lines,quotes and dialog in this film isn't as memorable or classic like the first(the dialog lacks the grown up edge of the first and was toned down because of the kids and the popularity of the cartoon The Real Ghostbusters),GBII still has a solid screenplay. The Action scenes in the film are great and thrilling mixing suspense and great laughs that will have viewers smiling The special effects in the film are outstanding and wonderful and still hold up to this very day,whether it's the creepy ghosts,the proton packs or the pink mood slime. Every big budget blockbuster seems to always have that real big effects shot where the filmmakers put all of their money into the big effects shot and like the first GB,the big shot at the end of this film is big and not only is it big,it's awe-inspiring,jaw-dropping and unforgettable.The cast does a great job. Bill Murray(Peter),Dan Aykroyd(Ray),Harold Ramis(Egon)and Ernie Hudson(Winston)are excellent and hilarious once again as The Ghostbusters. Sigourney Weaver is wonderful as Dana,Peter's love interest and Weaver has a great chemistry with Murray. Rick Moranis is hilarious as Louis who is now the Ghostbusters lawyer and accountant. Annie Potts fantastic once again as Janine,the Ghostbusters secretary and has great scenes with Moranis. Wilhelm Von Homburg is creepy as Vigo,a guy who wants to rule the world. Peter MacNicol is delightfully fun and over the top as Janosz,a painter who helps Vigo. Harris Yulin(Judge The Hammer Wexler),David Margulies(Mayor Lenny),Kurt Fuller(Jack)and Janet Margolin(The Prosecutor) give fun performances as well.The direction by Ivan Reitman is excellent,brining a lot of energy and style to the film and does a wonderful job mixing Comedy and the Supernatural.

A USAF rocket ship returning from Venus crash lands into the Mediterranean Sea off the little Italian village of Gerra in southern Sicily. Several brave local fishermen enter through a hole in the downed aircraft to extricate two American air force men before the craft sinks underwater. At the shoreline, a local boy picks up a sealed glass cylinder from the wreckage and conceals it. Later he opens it to find a gelatinous mass that he sells to an Italian zoologist\/professor. The zoologist has a laboratory in a trailer. His Italian-American granddaughter, who aspires to be a doctor, sometimes assists him. One of the Americans soon dies in a local hospital; the other becomes the gradual love interest of the woman.From the mass of jelly is born the Venusian creature, which has a human torso although it is reptilian. Immediately it walks upright. Apparently affected by the earth's atmosphere, it grows exponentially. It is apparent that the monster is confused and frightened, and would prefer being left alone. Escaping from the trailer cage, and harassed by humans and dogs, it raises havoc after being provoked. The reptile, resembling a carnivorous dinosaur, eludes capture by the local police, and also by the American military in the area (post World War II occupation forces?). The Italian police would rather kill the strange reptile, but the higher-ranking Americans want to study it. Finally captured, and of enormous size, the sulfur-eating lizard is examined by Italian scientists before escaping a second time. His destination is in Rome, the eternal city of many monuments.Popping his head from the Tiber, the creature destroys the Ponte Umberto (Humbert Bridge); there are nice special effects here. It moves through the old Roman ruins. There is a tough battle with an African elephant from the Roman zoo, which the monster mortally wounds. The Italian army (commanded by the American brass) finally traps the Venusian reptile in the Roman Colosseum, ironically the setting of the wild beast hunts two millennia ago.

As in the case of Gator, here we have a film which fails to fulfil its potential &#x96; sure, it rises to a few comic highlights and features a pretty good performance from Reynolds himself, but overall the film is tediously drawn-out and can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be.Young, good-looking Wendell 'Sonny' Lawson (Burt Reynolds) learns that he has a toxic blood syndrome and will soon die. Taking the most negative estimates of his remaining life expectancy for fact, he believes he will be gone within three months. Sonny visits his hot young girlfriend (Sally Field) for one final tender interlude (or a pity f@ck as he phrases it); he visits his odd-couple parents, his ex-wife, his estranged daughter. He even attempts to attend a confession at church, only to end up seeing a novice priest who envies his hell-raising lifestyle rather than helping him to clear his conscience with God. Ultimately, Sonny decides to commit suicide&#x85; but his attempt to do so is unsuccessful and he ends up in a lunatic asylum where he befriends schizophrenic Marlon Borunki (Dom DeLuise). Marlon helps Sonny time and again to end his life, each attempt becoming more farcical and over-the-top than the one before. Could t be that Sonny doesn't really want to end his life after all? The first half of the movie is better than the second, with some philosophical black comedy concerning the preciousness of life and the inevitability of death. Several scenes are painfully unspooled during this first half, but at least in these early scenes the film seems to have a sense of its own morbid fascination. The second half descends into uneven and ill-fitting slapstick, with DeLuise mugging away madly as Reynolds' comrade-in-lunacy. DeLuise is OK in the role but the entire second section seems strangely unconnected to the first half, creating a jarring swing in mood and style from which the film never truly recovers. The notion that 'death is funny' as a cinematic theme is a strange beast which needs to be handled with an expert touch to have any chance of working. In this case, it nearly works but ultimately doesn't quite pull it off. The End is a near-miss&#x85; but a miss nonetheless.

The titles of both films allude to the ghost in the machine, philosopher Gilbert Ryle's description of Descartes' mind-body dualism. Both films spend much of their time drawing parallels between animals, pets, simple machines, human beings, augmented humans, cyborgs, computers and robots. Oshii then uses these parallels to introduce various questions regarding hard and soft free-will, predestination and nascent intelligence. Bored yet?Today many neuroscientists are quite happy to cast away the notion of both hard freewill and the Sovereign Self. Indeed, many recent experiments are starting to show that a large number of human activities, actions, thought processes etc are preconscious; they occur before we consciously decide to do them. To many eliminativist philosophers, The Self, what you think of as a free, independent agent, is but a phenomenal self model (an accidental byproduct of our senses) whose content is not innate but impersonally programmed by extrinsic sources. It's a relatively recently built neurocomputational model - not a soul or mental or coherent essence - which mistakes itself for an uncaused causer capable of initiating causal chains. Free-will is interpreted in a similarly reductionist light; man is not a free agent but a machine programmed or buffeted by a host of invisible triggers (social, external, environmental, biological, neurological, genetic, cultural, language etc), all of which are responsible for his actions, thoughts and subjective content. If the Self is Other, than Will is likewise.To Eastern religions, this is hardly radical. Indeed, the major religions of both the East and the West can be seen as a response to the Self. Very broadly speaking, Western monotheistic religions assert the existence of a God whose authority, strength, demands and wisdom keep the Self concrete, whereas Eastern religions try to weaken these ideas, and stress a kind of depersonalisation, or collapsing of all barriers. One side's ego boosting (you're real, you matter, free choice, a preoccupation with acquisition etc), one seeks ego death (self as illusion, let go, illusionary self, no bodies, only interconnected matter etc). Giving up the former idea is like man's rejection of geocentricism. When people started to see the earth as just another moving object, man was essentially displaced from the centre of the universe. Many were unsettled and alarmed by this idea. The status quo actively suppressed the Copernican revolution. Today the idea's accepted and viewed as being liberating and empowering rather than a threat.Today it's the eliminativist mindset that's deemed abhorrent. To such scientists, consciousness is severely limited and self understanding is particularly delusional. We are conscious of but a morsel of our external world, and even less of our internal, mental worlds. Our inner and outer experiences are themselves neuro-simulations that have been evolutionary fashioned for survival value, rather than representational truthfulness. The implication is not only that there is no we, and that our consciousness is not ours, but that consciousness is itself unconscious, highly inept. Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and reasons are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is correct, neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how correct it all is. We know little about the processes of decision making and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of choice, teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of ego disturbance. Sufferers are unable to run self simulations and are unable to perceive themselves as being the centre of their consciousness. Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as it, rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional flatness. This &#x96; a conscious subject denying its own existence &#x96; of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an I reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of mineness disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a glitch which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of self concern with something the patients describe as being egoless and bigger.

Most of our explanations and understandings of others, things, people and environments are themselves delusional, self-aggrandising fictions. What we say, think, feel, perceive, and do are but the consequences of deterministic physical (electro-chemical) processes in our neurons, and our own motivations and reasons are oft misunderstood, or may not even exist at all. We never actually decide on any of our actions; rather, our sense of choice and decision, and the reasons and motivations we cite for what we do, are all post-hoc rationalisations of processes that happen mechanistically via electrochemical cause-and-effect. All our rationales, and all our values, are themselves nothing more than consolatory fictions. Suicidal yet? This is taking a certain form of reductionism, or empirical materialism, to its extreme (Metzinger etc), and while it is correct, neurobiology and cognitive psychology are still not advanced enough to tell us quite how correct it all is. We know little about the processes of decision making and scientists are still constantly (Walter J Freeman, Damasio, John McCrone etc) trying to rehabilitate the idea of choice, teasing out nuances between voluntary and involuntary processes. One interesting line of study involves Cotard's syndrome, a pathological condition which results in a kind of ego disturbance. Sufferers are unable to run self simulations and are unable to perceive themselves as being the centre of their consciousness. Cotard's patients thus think they are dead, or deny their own existence. They stop using personal pronounces (I, me etc), refer to themselves as it, rationalise their own non-existence and begin to develop a machine-like emotional flatness. This &#x96; a conscious subject denying its own existence &#x96; of course seems bizarre to most, but such a form of existence denial highlights how incredibly fickle our own concepts of self-hood and existence are. Indeed, Cotard's syndrome heavily resembles the spiritual experiences reportedly induced and experienced by shamans and mystics. In both cases, the result seems to be a transition from a phenomenal self model (a simulational model with an I reference point), or subject model, to an object model (a decentralised simulation); a shift from a first person perspective to first-object perspective, in which the phenomenal property of mineness disappears from the patient's reality. This loss is theorised to be caused by either an extreme suppression of emotions, or a glitch which results in both affectlessness and, bizarrely, a replacement of self concern with something the patients describe as being egoless and bigger. Studies also demonstrate that an increased awareness of the self-model as a model has the effect of making the self seem less real, which of course is akin to a scientific proof of a kind spiritual enlightenment (ie dissolution of the self).8.5\/10 - Shell 1's more of a traditional action-anime, whilst Oshii cites Antonioni and Godard as an influence on Shell 2.
