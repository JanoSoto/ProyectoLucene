I like the old masters directors (where have they all gone and where are the new ones...?) and Kubrick was no doubt one of them. This good movie, after a long time, gave me a proof that movies are worth spending time over, at least some movies, that is.Well written, well shot, cut, directed - the hand of a skilled and experienced author is almost 'visible' behind the scenes. Technically very well done. Storywise - and here some people struggle with the 'two halves' - what more could you ask for? It's a hero journey of sorts, but twisted. It's so nicely tensed, between the peace and war, between the yearning for eternal peace and the ingrained disquiet and need for battle in man. If you ever wondered, like me, how does it happen, and how does it feel, that one finds himself in an army, and then in the battlefield, this film will gradually take you there - if you care to empathize with a bunch of main characters (I don't think there is one central main character in this movie). Training camp is gruelling and accomplishes slowly exactly what it usually does - collapse of individuality, gradual brain wash and eventually trained soldiers actually willing to go to war. But then - isn't some of this in the man already? Don't men feel good in a group of buddies, intoxicated mildly with a feeling of belonging and a cause that is greater than all of them together? I mean, don't we like to play hockey and all?? When the barriers of who started it are long forgotten, and a man is faced with a freshly shot body of his buddy, he will without a doubt devote himself completely to killing the enemy sniper right there. On a grand scale - this is a basic war conflict. The pull and push of the abstract body called war is way too strong to oppose. Only a coward runs away, and the protester asking for 'common sense' is bulldozed over, so the only thing left is to fight. The reality of this, and some other very ambivalent aspects of war fight are hinted on during the movie, especially during the second half.The movie needed to move on from the training camp somehow. The montage of shots and cuts is wonderful, in my opinion, to establish that some time has passed - Joker is clearly more experienced, Vietnam is bombed out and the war drags. During his meetings at the newspaper office, I thought he wanted to experience some combat - and this was reinforced by his buddy photographer who was very hungry for it. After all - if one is sitting in the army base and sees other guys go to battle, then come back (a few dead), hear their stories and see it in their faces - wouldn't he desire to see it for himself? After all - war IS the place and time to become a fighter, to maybe become a hero. Joker has become disillusioned with the reporting job, being openly sarcastic with the chief editor. The story progresses as the base camp is attacked and Joker gets to the big machine gun right next to the gate. At that point, the movie mastery of this director (and the actors) rests in relaying the actual feelings during that fight - shooting with gusto but also with great fear for one's life, then resting with a hope in their eyes that this might as well be it. As it is said in many observations of war - it's one of the most 'real' experiences a man can get, so in a way, he becomes fixated on it. (Hence the adjustment problems of the veterans returning to society - punctuated by one of the soldiers remarking that he might as well miss the days when he could shoot these 'great people' on daily basis).Later on, as Joker and his photographer buddy move closer to the front line, the tension grows and the scenery looks more and more like a battlefield. I thought this pacing was done well - from the training camp, to the base camp, to the 'safe' war zone, and eventually to the deep s*** battle, faced with a possible defeat (and death). At that point, Joker, who started wearing the peace-sign button some time ago, is faced with a wounded sniper, who has just taken lives of three soldiers, one being his buddy from the training camp. With some hesitation, Joker kills her, and earns remarks as this was hard core from other soldiers.But again returning to the topic, Joker, being questioned by a higher rank commander on his wearing a peace-sign button and wearing his helmet with a 'Born to kill' writing, responds that he himself doesn't know why he's wearing both of them, and hints at 'something Jungian'. Jungian psychology helps here with its view of a man as essentially a dual being - consisting of a conscious, civilized part and a 'shadow', often unconscious part, which mix together in one unit known as human being, capable of wanting peace and killing another being in a conflict at the same time. This set up is implemented at very deep layers of human mind and there's no easy resolution. This movie shows that very pointedly - there's no easy resolution to this mess.All in all, a movie that doesn't let up, has pace, has good story, has characters that viewers will find easy to empathize with (or dislike), has poignant points and leaves lasting impressions. They don't make these kinds of movies anymore. (I will have to check the Hurt Locker now). To the point of no easy answer to the question of war, leaving these young men changed forever.

A woman walks through a darkly lit car park . Her car fails to start then she looks to see The Masked Magician standing there . She tries starting the car again the fear written upon her face . Now David Blaine stands alongside The Masked Magician . Morbid panic sets in . The woman realises as this rate the worst thing in the world is going to happen - yes now David Copperfield stands alongside the duo who want to use her in their next trick . Thankfully Charles Bronson turns up to execute these rude magicians only to find he's shot himself and .... it's all been a dream If you've ever attended a class featuring the mechanics and science of screen writing then you'll been warned straight away that never EVER start a film off with a dream sequence , a rule that has just been broken here . Strangely this explains why the opening sequence feels so unreal . It's a dream therefore it's supposed to be surreal so kudos for the production team for at least understanding internal continuity . Unlike DW3 this movie does take place in a recognisable world but the longer it continues the longer you wished the franchise had died in the previous movie for two reasonsThe first reason is that it's deadly dull . Say what you want about DW3 but at least it's amusing if not laugh outloud funny as you're able to point out how it would be impossible for the events on screen to happen in  our world  . Not here where there is a sort of reality involved . There are some ridiculous moments to THE CRACKDOWN such as Bronson having a machine pistol that has a magazine capacity of several hundred rounds but you've seen that type of goof in so many movies it has become part of cinematic convention . Nearly every 80s action thriller suffers from the same flaws The second reason the movie is so bad is the entirely naive attitude towards cocaine . I wish to state I have never tried a class A drug but I know many people who have . I think nothing less or more for them having done so . Drugs are bad I do agree but the almost obscene rant that his movie takes against users and dealers is not even bad enough to be amusing . Teenage girl takes cocaine for the first time and dies .

Maybe being a vigilante he possess a clear insight that if you kill drug dealers no one will take their place unlike what happens in say the real world ?

Take Jan!Without a doubt this is the best comic movie of 1996, but one of the best ever. It got nearly all what I need out of a comedy. The pace was the real hero of it; since uniquely the talented lines don't stop throughout the whole thing. This is compared to the first movie&#x85;What first movie ?! Simply this one learned its lesson out of (The Brady Bunch Movie &#x96; 1995). This time it's brighter, faster, and took the irony to the next level. Now the joke is on you Brady people ! Attractively the matter of making fun of the Brady family Look at the hair, the clothes, the constant cheerfulness was a stroke of genius. It's like what if the Brady Bunch came out of the reruns to our present day ?! This great no-time machine matter put them as they are in the middle of our world to live one of the sharpest paradoxes ever between not only the 1970s and 1990s, but also between the polished, so idealistic, American TV once and the reality's taste after 25 years; where the Brady songs would be misplaced, too gay, and annoying ! Or how the 90s's fashions, drugs, or menage a trois would affect the family.. sorry, THIS family! To be generally a brilliant Brady movie and Brady spoof in the same time !

Ridley Scott's 'Alien' is arguably one of the most notorious sci-fi chillers out there. Now I know It's very easy to jump on the bandwagon and call select movies a classic and given It's high rating here on IMDb. I could be insecure enough to believe that there is something sorely wrong with my personal taste in movies. But to be quite frank I've never been able to appreciate what it is about 'Alien' that so many other fans adore. Indeed It's exceedingly well directed and the set design, production values are mesmerising and the Alien is the pinnacle of inspired, visual terror. But while it Carred the tag line In space no-one can hear you scream. A more fitting one should have been In space no-one can hear you yawn. So why did I find this picture to be such a monumental bore? Well, while the movies plotting is a simplistic and It does deliver what must have been a genuinely ingenious 'shock' about a third or so in to the movie. It's the picture's precision, lengthy slow pacing. A gimmick you could label it I suppose. Utilised to crank up the tension as the crew members of the mining ship Nostromo. Comprising of a cast of talented character actors answering a distress call from what appears to be a derelict vessel on a near by planet. Among the cast are the now legendary Sigourney Weaver as the heroic, feisty Ellen Ripley who would go on to star in the movies three sequels (Alien's bearing the distinction of being the only decent outing). And Tom Skerrit as Dallas who sadly didn't quite have the same success as his female co-star. But is arguably best remembered for his career defining performances in Steel Magnolias and and the deceptively cosy mid-nineties television drama series Picket Fences.When one of the crew Kane (The excellent John Hurt) descends in to a chamber within the enigmatic space craft. He soon emerges from within. With an arachnid like creature locked firmly to his face. Once back on the Nostromo. Attempts are made to surgically detach the beast but to no avail. As doing so would result in Kane's death. When the creature, unseen by the other crew members relinquishes It's all too powerful grip on the incapacitated member of the crew and It is revealed to have mysteriously died. All seems to be well.

And as said before, on paper this did have the potential makings for what could have been a tremendous exercise in nail biting terror. But with It's lengthy exposition, and all too heavy reliance on building up tension rather than relying on more confrontational encounters with the menacing Alien of the title. It fails to really be the roller coaster ride of emotion and fear that the imperfect but superior follow up 'Aliens' (1986) managed to be thanks to James Cammeron's talents as an action\/sci-fi director and screen writer.And while there is the odd flourish of inspired creativity which include an eerie crawl through a labyrinth of air vents as the Alien slowly but surely hunts down It's prey, an ingenious twist which would be expanded upon in the movies sequels and a final surprise confrontation. It's never quite enough to compensate for the abysmal, tiresome monotony.I'm sure I'm not alone in my thinking as I write this review and although I'm not alone in that thinking I'll have to belong to the tiny few who fails to comprehend what makes this such an iconic, cult treasure.

The thing that makes hard target so awesome is that it is truly is a john woo movie ( i hope that you seen the unrated movie).

Van Damme is good in the role and yes he does wear what is maybe one of the worst haircuts in action movie history but he does at least try to act i think that he is trying to do. Yes the movie is a B film but then hey is not Darkman is not True Lies,(really a great action movie but really what in the world is up with that plot) John Woo turns the B story into the film's favor almost giving it a Sergio Leone like feel to it and directing each scene like if it is one of his hong kong movies. The Camera is always on the move the action scene's are directed with care (no Micheal Bay shaking camera work here thank you very much) and the movie is a little slow after the start but really kicks high gear in the movie last hour which is wall to wall violence and bloodshed( which really is not a bad thing). Oh yeah another great thing or not really is the Yancy Butler who really adds nothing to movie but look sad or upset or what ever she trying to do but hey john woo has never truly been a great women director just like sam Peckinpah never was, this is a guy movie and on that note it must be said that Lance Henriksen and Arnold Vosloo who turn such awesome performance's that they are clearly having fun and it seems that they knew that they were filming a john woo movie not a van damme movie.I know that john woo had a budget of around 15 million dollars and woo makes the full use of it.

Yes, it is clichéd, the plot has been done many times before, the script is often disjointed and has more holes than a Swiss cheese, the characters are left half painted, the actors are playing to type (though that never hurt Bob Hope, Cary Grant, Carole Lombard, etc., etc) and elements of the story seem to be largely superfluous (the most egregious example being the climactic hurricane); but it is a romantic comedy... and I found it both romantic and gently funny in places. The weaknesses in the script and the editing can't be laid at the casts feet; and they perform really well. Sandra Bullock and Benn Affleck's romance isn't the most believable you'll come across, but they do work well together and have the chemistry needed to carry the heavily flawed plot. It also should be noted that very little in the story is believable; so much so that, at one point, Affleck and Bullock arrive at a bank where Ben Affleck is due to pick up some money that will enable them to get to Savannah, only to find the bank engulfed in flames. They turn to each other and laugh at the sheer improbability of it all; it's as if the characters are momentarily saying to the audience, yeah! we know that you know that it's all so fantastical and contrived... so don't worry, it's meant to be. Lazy script writing or a foray into the realm of magical realism? The former I suspect, but the film obviously set out to have a fairy tale quality about it, and it has enough charm, wit and warmth to compensate for the holes in the script. Sadly many of the comical shoots do seem to inexplicably wither before they get a chance to bear fruit, but the comedy is without exception well-played by the cast. It just needed tighter scripting.I can't believe it has such a poor rating on IMDb - it has many faults, but I was contented to spend an hour-and-a-half watching Sandra Bullock looking lovely and being charming and witty on screen.

Yes, it doesn't have the excellent hilarity of the original TV show, or the fancy Hollywood adventure (as their next movies, for instance; The Great Muppet Caper). It got one man's dream, insistence and innocence. That's enough for me.

It is their only road movie yet, with all the uniqueness of the case. And, in the same time, it's one of the happiest biography-movies ever; look at the cameo of Henson's other famous character (Big Bird) who at one moment tells Kermit that he's going to New York to break into public television, which already happened through Henson's landmark TV show Sesame Street (1969)! It's like Henson says I Did It. This feel of pride touches you yet in a lovely humble way, as someone chronicles his achievements while making another new one.I loved exceptionally the movie-in-the-movie matter; Henson doesn't get board out of assuring that he and the rest of his creative buddies are basically viewers, simple viewers just like you. So the viewer also can make their own movie\/ their dream. This meaning hasn't been ever clearer before.There is a delightful magic all over it. You feel all the time a romantic sensibility, with a taste of latent dolefulness too. Look at the intro of Kermit.

So you can be the hero of your life ?! Make your own destiny ?! Great men did it. Jim Henson is one. Yet, he's the one who told you that it isn't impossible. You can do it too.
