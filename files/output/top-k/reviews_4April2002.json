There is so much to it that defies simple labels, and each time that you watch it you can find something new.  It creates a memorable picture of life as it was and is, full of struggle and raising questions that do not always lend themselves to pat answers.  It might not be completely perfect - there are a couple of convenient plot turns and perhaps other minor flaws - but it is an excellent movie in every respect.Ethan Edwards is one of the roles that gave Wayne a chance to show what he could do with a complicated character.  He's certainly no hero, but not a villain either.  He's the center of attention, interesting and occasionally surprising.  He has some deep and obvious character flaws, but some important strengths as well.  There are all kinds of subtle details that help you to understand him, but nothing contrived, and the movie allows him to remain an enigma.  Most of the other characters are not as complex in themselves, but are interesting because of their relationships with Ethan and their feelings towards his relentless search.  And all of them are given just enough definition so that they can be understood.  Even the Comanche, whom Edwards hates so irrationally, can be seen in a more objective light by the viewer.  Also worth noting is the fine performance by Ward Bond, certainly one of the best roles he ever had.While it would be hard to say whether or not this might be Wayne's best role, it has to be Ford's best film.  The wonderful photography alone would make it stand out, with so many scenes framed against a background of beautiful scenery, plus the recurring through-the-doorway shots, which are a very effective way of presenting those parts of the story.  The Searchers is also an example of the kind of movie which is much better for having taken an understated approach.  Too many directors would feel a need to over-simplify the questions of right and wrong by using heavy-handed technique.

It succeeds in everything it attempts to do and it bothers me when I read comments from gay readers that absolutely loathe this film.  After thinking about it for a little bit, I think I've found the reason for why all the gay viewers hated this film they're sick of the pity and the sympathy.  I can understand that, and it is basically impossible to make a quasi-realistic film about gay rights and anti-homophobia without exhibiting some sympathy for the alienated gay population. I admit that I have little experience with gays, although I am acquainted with a few.  They are on wonderful terms with their families (even though one homosexual writes here that families are NOT like that).  I disagree with people who think that because their family is displeased with their sexual orientation, every gay person is estranged from their family.  That is untrue.  Another wrong comment I read was that the film gives viewers the impression that gays are the only ones that can get AIDS (and that the disease is always deadly).  That is false, as well, since a portion of the movie deals with a woman who is an AIDS survivor and who contracted the disease in a blood transfusion.  There are many other ways of getting AIDS, but it would be impossible for the film to identify every single way in order to be PC. The most powerful argument against this film seems to be that it is anti-homosexual propaganda in how it shows the relationship between Tom Hanks and Antonio Banderas.  First of all, everyone is making a big deal that Hanks and Banderas do not kiss.  Apparently, filmmakers cannot possibly show love between two people without having them kiss.  It sounds to me that most disappointed gay readers were hoping to see gay pornography rather than a film about two homosexuals and the troubles they face when one of them contracts AIDS.  They do not kiss, fine, but they dance, they talk to one another in such a way that I, a heterosexual man, envied the relationship they had.  The first time we see Banderas is when he is racing to the hospital to see if Hanks is okay.  I know if my girlfriend were in the hospital, I would probably look and act the exact same way that he does.  I disturbs me that so many gay readers would rather see the two of them make out than display affection for one another in more powerful ways. Another argument I noticed more than once was that, aside from Hanks' character, the film portrays all gays as pansies.  Believe me, the critics here are far more stereotypical than this film is.  One scene that comes to mind is when Denzel Washington is shopping in a grocery store and a college athlete approaches him to praise him for his work.  Washington is gracious and it comes off as a surprise when the athlete starts to hit on him.  I suppose that most gay viewers saw that message as something along the lines of Gays are everywhere...watch out!  If that were the case, the film would have glorified Washington's character, but instead we feel sorry for liking Denzel.  Why do we like him?  Because too many of us are like him, just average people who want to take a few steps back every time a homosexual walks nearby.  By presenting someone that we all can associate with and highlighting his flaws (which are, essentially, our own), maybe we can begin to change. As for the film, I find it hard to believe that anyone would rent this thinking that it is simply a courtroom drama.  It is well-written, and well-acted.  I mostly enjoyed some fabulous direction on Jonathan Demme's part.  I remember, in particular, that when Hanks would recall when he was fired, his associates had the appearance of monsters.  The camera would show them in a darker light, up-close, at an awkward angle.  Many other viewers found this to be cartoony, but they're forgetting that these scenes were not reality.  They were simply memories, and although Hanks' character is a noble, honorable, unfortunately ill homosexual, he naturally feels angry towards his former employers.  He's furious, even though he rarely lets out any of that fury directly.  The only way we see these memories is through his distorted memories.  Hanks is frustrated and furious with what happened and he cannot look at his former employers anymore without seeing monsters. In this way, the filmmakers build a connection between Hanks' character and the viewers, gay or not.  This also helps the viewer sympathize for homosexuals and see how they are essentially no different than anyone else. I apologize.  I am sorry that so many gays would rather remain alienated, would rather see Hanks and Banderas act in gay porn than a meaningful film. I am sorry that there is even one homosexual out there who are is alienated from their families that they have no one to really turn to.  This film is not the most accurate portrayal of homosexuals, but is far from the worst. Do not even attempt to persuade me, that this film is nothing but worthless drivel, that it tries to alienate gays even more.  It is as accurate as it has to be.  If it were to go too far over the line, it would be too much for the average person to handle.  Viewers have to remember that controversial topics like these have to be handled carefully, and it could not have been done better than in Philadelphia.  If all gay people are looking for is a depressing, uninventive, inaccurate P.O.S. that emphasizes homosexual kissing rather than acceptance and integration, then maybe they should remain alienated.

I am a huge war movie fan and I usually flock to the theaters anytime an epic is released such as Saving Private Ryan, We Were Soldiers or Black Hawk Down.    This movie, however, I boycotted due to the cast and the hours of romance that I heard were in it. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it, yet it had a few good moments.First off, the movie has many historical flaws, but that is to be expected, and in my opinion, doesn't make for a bad war film (most of the time). The storyline follows Rafe (anyone know anyone named Rafe?) and his romance with the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale, who plays a Florence Nightengale type nurse who falls for Rafe who is an American pilot who fought for Britain before America formally got into the war.  Basically, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy loses girl, girl finds other guy, girl loses other guy, boy finds girl again...tried and true...a Hollywood formula that just won't quit.  Honestly, the whole romance in a war film doesn't necessarily turn me off, just two freaking hours of it does.  It was trying to be like Titanic way too much.  The war scenes, when you finally get to them, are spectacular, with explosions worthy of a Jerry Bruckheimer\/Michael Bay title.  Tom Sizemore, one of my favs, was great in this film, along with Jon Voight as FDR.  Affleck, an actor who I go back and forth on, mainly b\\c of his annoying cockiness on screen, did a pretty good job in this film, but could have been casted with a better actor.  Kate Beckinsale was great, and man, what a hottie...definitely would give you a reason to return back home alive.  And of course, there was Josh Hartnett, in my opinion, the most Overrated, undertalented actor over the past couple of years...his acting was horrible, and I did not sympathize nor like his character at all. It's a wonder where Hollywood is pulling all of these no-talents from...someone like Ryan Phillippe would have been a much better choice, an actor who is serious and charismatic.  Overall, this movie is long and dragged out.  It re-creates the Dec. 7th spectacularly, and features the Doolittle raid with equal splender, yet the movie as a whole is below average.  If you buy it, skip over the romance parts and watch the last 30 minutes, the only redeemable quality of this film.  4\/10.

The trailer definitely caught my attention as something unique, and though only in one location, I knew that David Fincher, director of Fight Club and The Game would deliver.  The good news is, on most levels, he does.First off is his incredible use of direction.  I have never seen such fancy camera work in a film; the camera will squeak through tiny openings and snake around from one room of the house to another within a single shot.  Definitely impressive, and definitely eye candy.  Then we find Jodie Foster and her Daughter, both played very believably forced to seek refuge in the house's panic room when a trio of criminals show up.  I thought that the criminals were the most interesting aspect of the film, though a tad underdeveloped and way cliched (The type of people you might know in real life that would actually be willing to rob a house, yet exagerated in an over the top kinda way).  There were just too many times where they would do things that people in real life would never do.  One of which is at the beginning when one of the three criminals, after establishing to the audience that they have had no prior past together until now, asks for Dwight Yoakam's handgun (the only one who brought one) and he nonchalantly hands it to him.  Why would a professional hand over his gun to someone he doesn't know, let alone an obvious amateur?  Yes, scenes like this really are irrelevant to the story, yet will bother the best of us to no end when we see them.  Still, the criminals are played very well.  Forest Whitaker was superb as Burnham, the conscientious safe cracker with a heart, and Dwight Yoakam was fantastic, as always, as the cold and mostly calm Raoul, a mysterious member of the trio whose screen presence expresses his adherence to violence and mayhem more than the limited dialogue he has at the beginning.  Definitely the most interesting of the three.  Jared Leto was good as Junior, yet his character got annoying very quickly (especially since he demanded that he be in charge and ended up making a complete idiot of himself on many occasions in the film).  The suspense is there, not necessarily enough to make you scared, but enough to hold your attention.  The ending though is very predictable and rather empty, in my opinion.  I feel there could have been more to the ending, something profound to stick with you as you leave the theater (I was also hoping the exact opposite would have happened to Burnham that did.  He did have a good side, you know).  Overall, I enjoyed this film, it was good for what it was, but it could have been great.  This is one of those films that doesn't receive a 9 or 10 for a bad script or bad acting since both were good, but because there is potential for so much more that just isn't there.

It looks wonderful, has some great scenes and the casting is very good, but it does not match the charm, atmosphere and cleverness of the book. Ironically, you may very well enjoy it more if you've never read J.K Rowling's world famous novel, as I and some others who've seen it found it hard to get into the film, as we were watching it with half an eye for how accurately it fitted our visions rather than enjoying it purely for itself. The film's lacks can be summed up by a paradox it is both too true and not true enough to the book. The film is a bit disjointed, with the changes between scenes not being as smooth as they could be, and I think this is because it is trying to follow the plot of the book as exactly as it could. The problem is that books and films are two different media, and what works in one will not necessarily work in the other. The film does not (and probably cannot, as the books do not have a narrator that the film could use) have the hidden voice of the author to fill in the gaps in the plot and add those little satirical touches that helped make the book so enjoyable for adults as well as children. This means that there are parts of the film that do not have the punch they do in the novel for example the early scenes dealing with Harry's appalling foster parents are good, but they do not quite convey the wretchedness of Harry's 'normal' life as they do in the book, and despite Alan Rickman's disdainful drawl, Professor Snape is not as nasty as I imagined him. As a result there is not the tension surrounding whether Harry will get kicked out of the school and why it's so important that Snape's house Slytherin doesn't win the trophy. Perhaps this explains why parts of the film seem rather flat.The other significant problem I had with the film was that Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter, does not have the energy and fun that the character does in the novel. He's not bad, and he does look very like I imagined Harry Potter to, but he seems a bit passive. Other than that the acting was pretty spot on - Robbie Coltrane is particularly good as Hagrid and the actors playing the teachers and the other kids all do an excellent job.The film's strengths are many and far outweigh it's weaknesses some things are even better than I saw them in my head Hogwarts looks magnificent in it's Gothic wierdness, the invisibility cloak is indeed very cool, the chess match is brutally satisfying and, most impressively, the Quidditch match is a triumph full of hurtling broomsticks, violent collisions and flying bodies. It's like a cross between rugby and basketball in mid-air, and it rocks. The story is obviously a very good one and, while it isn't as scary as the book, it's good and dark for a movie aimed at kids as well as adults. I enjoyed it, and might enjoy it more on a second viewing, when it doesn't have the baggage of living up to a modern classic. RATING 7\/10.

I finally saw it opening day at the midnight showing with my two friends, and I remember the awe and silence that filled the sold out theatre.  From the moment I heard Cate Blanchett's voice, narrating the history of the Ring and Middle Earth, to the beginning of the credits, I experienced(as did many, many others in the theatre) one of the most exciting and breathtaking movie experiences ever.  My friends and I had to go see it again the next day.This film has absolutely everything a movie needs.  First of all the cast and their performances were top notch.  I was not disappointed at all.  At first I was somewhat skeptical about Elijah Wood playing Frodo Baggins, and I was never too impressed with his acting ability to begin with.  Now after seeing this film, I can't see any other actor portraying Frodo, other than young Elijah.  I was very pleased by his performance, but very disappointed that he did not get an Oscar nomination.  As for Viggo Mortenson playing the heroic Aragorn, I knew he would be great the moment I saw him in the trailer for the film months before it was released. He looked and breathed Aragorn, just as I imagined Aragorn would when I read the books years ago.  Sean Bean was terrific as the brave, but weak -willed Boromir.  And of course Sir Ian McKellan was perfect as Gandalf the Grey.  In fact, he is Gandalf. Every time he was shown on screen, he stole the scene.  I'm just upset he didn't win the Oscar.  The rest of the cast was great as well.  I was very happy with their performances.The scenery and cinematography is indeed flawless.  After seeing this movie, I immediately wanted to visit New Zealand.  It's as if New Zealand is Middle Earth.  The art direction and costume design is extroidinarily detailed.  Everything from the celestial buildings of the Elves in Rivendell, to the Celtic designs in the Dwarven armour, to the dark and Satanic vision of Sauron's fortress are truly awesome.   The make-up and creature effects are the best I've ever seen.  The Orcs aren't just stupid, mindless killing machines.  They really are terrifying.  The Black Riders were my favorite though.  They stole the scene every time they were on. As for the visual and computer generated effects, you couldn't do any better.  The demonic Balrog was amazing.  It was definitely one of the movie's best parts.  And of course, Peter Jackson's direction was top-notch.  I was so pleased when I found out he was doing the film, and not some huge, big-time Hollywood filmmaker like Lucas, Spielberg or Cameron.  Don't get me wrong, they are brilliant filmmakers, but they all tend to throw in something very cutsey for the little kids so the movie would be more commercial.  I knew of course Jackson would never do that.  The action sequences and battle scenes are very exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.  I felt it ended very well.On a final note, this movie has it all.  An adventure movie that is unlike any other with compelling drama, about a world of people who are facing a common danger.  Everyone in this world of Middle Earth are in one way or another preoccupied with the difficulty of power.  Whether it is political, personal, spiritual or the power to live, or to control, every character is forced to seek or reject power.  This is truly a masterpiece in filmmaking and I cannot wait to see the next two sequels.

It's magnificent - the best fantasy film I've ever seen. O.K, so it is not as great as the book. Even in three hours, set against the gorgious New Zealand landscape and featuring some lavish sets and costumes, it cannot hope to match the richness of detail and historical depth that Tolkien could fit into the 500 or so pages of The Fellowship of The Ring. Nor does it have the pacing of the book - without slashing more parts of the story director Peter Jackson simply couldn't spare the time to make the transitions between the major events as smooth as Tolkien did. At times we seem to jump from one big scene to another in 'Greatest Hits' style;  for example, the shift from Moria to Lorien is too sudden. Having said that, the screenplay by Jackson and his collaborators is an excellent adaption of the book, retaining almost all of the best scenes and lines - 'many who live deserve death, and some who are dead deserve life. Can you give it to them? Do not be so quick to deal out judgement.' - while keeping the plot tight and even improving on Tolkien (blasphemy! the fanatics cry) in some ways, such as by showing more of Saruman's rise to power, adding the big badass orc Lurtz and bringing out several laugh-out-loud moments, particularly with Merry and Pippin, which the book lacked. Jackson's best achievement though is how the film looks. As with 'Harry Potter', my imagination generally topped what was on the screen - but to the filmaker's credit there were plenty of things that were even better than I had envisioned. I cannot emphasize this too much - 'Fellowship' looks AMAZING. Seething hordes of goblins, an idyllic, waterfall-bordered Rivendell, hellish labyrinths of mines and tunnels, thrilling, chaotic battles, and the Balrog. Oh my God, the Balrog. I spent a lot of this movie with my jaw unhinged. In terms of the acting, the casting is just about perfect. Sir Ian McKellern as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Sean Bean as Boromir and Sir Ian Holm as Bilbo are outstanding, and pretty much everyone else hits the mark. To act in this kind of high-flown mythic style and not be  melodramatic is tough, but they pull it off - with the exception of a few moments. Yes, it's not perfect. A few shots of Arwen and Galadriel - all angelic and glowing - are overdone, some of the lines are delivered sentimentally, and the music, which generally excellent, also goes over the top at times. And, reluctant as I would be to do it, if I was editing the film I'd cut out the whole Lorien chapter. It's pretty good but compared to the rest of the film it doesn't add much, has a couple of those creaky moments I mentioned, lengthens a long film and does upset the pace.

Sadly, that wasn't the case in this film.5.5\/10Frankly, the fact that it is so over-hyped and that whenever someone tries to say something bad against it, all the zealots rise up together and immediately rubbish that person's point of view, have made me hate it deeply, and it was difficult not to put a much lower score.

What I am referring to is his devotion to sending a strong message, which is usually a societal critique, within almost every film he has created.Maybe it's because I generally agree with his critiques, but I am surprised to see so few reviewers, both amateur and professional, overlooking the message of this film, and even some of his others.  The NY Times seems to have completely missed it, as have several other critics who have argued Panic Room lacks substance.  This is also funny because the complaints some had of Fight Club was that it was pretentious, over the top, and  intent on sending a message to the audience.  So what does Fincher do?  Actually panders to the critics (whether it was intentional or not is almost irrelevant) by creating a subtle psychological thriller that also sends a clear message about American society and values.  But then it seems that these same critics completely miss it, thinking that this is more of a classic what you see is what you get thiller.Based upon Fincher's history, I found this VERY hard to believe, when I read some reviews.  Then I saw it with my own eyes and once I thought about what he might be saying for one moment after leaving the theater it hit me.I don't think it is anyone's place to tell anyone what that message is, but I suggest to all those who have seen it, or even haven't, to examine the primary themes of the film, the character relationships, and their values, which were all played out in some key scenes.  One being, in particular, the last camera shot in the grand finale, which I read someone here argue meant nothing.  Well, in my opinion, if you saw that and believed it to posses no meaning, then I think you missed David Fincher's message.  Unfortunately, a lot of us will likely miss it because Fincher's style and entertainment value is what they are seeing the movie for.  The problem is he has consistently gone beyond that, but it usually falls upon deaf ears with the audience he attracts.Hopefully one day he will be remembered for his attempt in bringing social criticism and thought provocating scripts covered by conventional and pop appearing Hollywood film making.  Until then most will likely think of him as a Hitchock disciple who incorperates a lot of style and tricky camerawork (all of which are evident here, like his patented camera movement through walls and other solid objects) to gain his audience.  There is more there...just look a little harder.

In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred Goodfellas. The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 April 2002","score":"58 out of 110 people found the following review useful","review":"  One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste.

The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred Goodfellas. The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"4 April 2002","score":"58 out of 110 people found the following review useful","review":"  One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story.

An estranged father of three tries to come together with his family after 22 years of neglect.  Gene Hackman plays the father convincingly and that's it.  The rest of the crew except perhaps Anjelica Huston as the mother and Danny Glover as her fiancé do a decent job.  Ben Stiller as on of the siblings is energetic as always but his part ends up being very stereotypic and almost boring.  There are a lot of good ideas in this movie since the surroundings and expressions tell the story and the jokes as much as the said word but things are predictable and often the cinematography is downright clumsy. Although a comedy this movie has a meaningful undertone and seems to be about forgiveness and family values.  There are all kinds of hidden messages, e.g. the kids wear the same childish clothes their whole life (except the daughter who secretly has been smoking for 22 years) that might be a expression of halted maturity since childhood or what ever.  Perhaps it was just for fun but got boring.  Gene Hickman's character got to change clothes at least and was quite funny in his elevator warden.  All kind of characters are introduced to the story in the beginning in a rather lame way although not altogether unfunny. Gwyneth Palthrow as the adopted sister never rises up to be funny, ever in the whole film and puts a depressing face to the whole story.  Her kinky love affairs never rise to be funny or giving any meaning to the picture.  Gene Hackman carries this movie on his shoulders throughout along with his faithful family servant Pagoda played memorably and intuitively by Kumar Pollana.  In a way this movie reminds me of the French movie Emilé but it (this one) pales in the comparison.  This movie is too stereotypic and slow to ever rise to the hall of fame in comedy, but if the director keeps trying, something good might come out of it later.  7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"4 April 2002","score":"","review":"  I am surprised by the raving critics this movie has gotten.
