It not only has an exquisite sense of humor throughout, but it also contains an element of truth to what it's trying to say to its audience. What I mean by that is along with preparing us for what type of film The Birds will be, the trailer has a whimsical way of explaining man's relationship and history with the entire bird species. For instance, Hitchcock himself mentions that the turkey is always the guest of honor at Thanksgiving, albeit for the wrong reasons. Hitchcock makes similar statements throughout the trailer that might explain why almost all the birds in this picture are acting the way they do. But enough on the trailer, what's the story of this film like? Well, the story for The Birds is pretty straightforward and self- explanatory. At a San Francisco bird shop, a young woman named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren, in her screen debut) meets a man named Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) who is looking to purchase a pair of lovebirds for his sister's birthday. When Mitch is unable to find any before he heads to his hometown in Bodega Bay, Melanie tracks down his address, decides to purchase a pair of lovebirds, and drives down to Bodega Bay herself. Talk about going out of her way for such a trivial matter. I'd say she really likes this guy, even though she claims to have no interest in him. Once she arrives, Melanie sneaks across the bay via motor boat to secretly drop off the birds inside Mitch's house as a surprise to Mitch and her sister. In the middle of doing that, not only does she get caught by Mitch, but she also gets attacked by a seagull for no apparent reason. Melanie reluctantly stays around Bodega Bay for a while to recover from her unusual injury while developing a relationship with Mitch. She even meets his mother (Jessica Tandy), his younger sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright), and his ex-lover Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) all in one day. During her stay, the behavior of the local birds begins to become more unusually hostile. Their behavior ranges from attacking innocent children at a birthday party to invading their neighbor's houses and killing them. Why are these birds attacking everybody? How come they take breaks in between massive attacks? What has humanity done to cause these birds to attack or kill everybody they come across? When will it all end and how? These are just some of the main questions our main characters ask about these sudden occurrences. And while the film doesn't exactly give us an answer regarding why the birds suddenly act this way, the trailer supplies us with the idea that the history between humans and birds wasn't a pleasant one. We're also given the idea that no matter what we're capable of doing, there's no way in which we could exterminate all of the birds anyways. The reason being is that there are many different varieties of birds and each of them are vastly populous. I won't say whether or not the special effects for The Birds hold up since there's practically no point. Modern filmgoers can easily tell when the birds are really there or when they aren't just by figuring out which shots are filmed in green screen backgrounds. What I will say is that I appreciate how Hitchcock creates suspense in this thriller simply through the usage of silence. This picture doesn't contain a musical score of any kind, but the film does use some very minimal sounds in the background which gives it a realistic feel of sorts. There are sounds of birds far away, cars riding across the roads, people breathing or crying heavily, sounds along those lines. And when there's just silence in some scenes, it contributes to the suspense further. So the usage of sound in The Birds is creative in that regard. While the love story involving Melanie and Mitch may not be the most brilliant romantic setup Hitchcock concocted, it works okay nonetheless. The conversations involving the birds can also get a little tiresome at times. But to be fair, it's weird that birds would suddenly attack this town at this certain time, so the conversations are justified to a certain extent. What makes The Birds a strong Hitchcock picture is due in large part to the usage of sound and silence, Hitchcock's direction and storytelling, and the overall idea that birds may have been unfairly treated by humans for many years. It's rare that I discuss a film's theatrical trailer in a review, but in the special case of The Birds, it's necessary to demonstrate the possible ideas that this film's trying to subliminally get across. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to prepare myself a chicken salad sandwich &#x96; then again, maybe not.

His last stop, where he is currently heading, is Vienna, from where he will catch a flight home tomorrow morning. Celine (Julie Delphy), a Parisienne, had been in Budapest visiting her grandmother. She is currently heading back to Paris to resume her studies at the Sorbonne. Jesse and Celine meet by chance on the same westbound train out of Budapest. The connection they feel from their short conversation on the train is enough for Jesse to suggest at the last minute that she get off the train with him in Vienna and that they spend time together in Vienna - just wandering around the city as was his original plan as he doesn't have the money for a hotel - before he needs to go to the airport, and at which time she will board the next train to Paris. If it ends up she feels uncomfortable with him as time progresses, she could ditch him at any point. Celine agrees. As they wander from place to place in Vienna, they talk about their philosophies of life and love. They also talk about logistical issues regarding their time, such as why Jesse was in Europe to begin with, what they are feeling for each other, if there is a future for them together and if so what that future may look like taking into consideration both their current lots in life.Who wouldn't want something like this to happen to them? Its a dream come true to realize that you found the love of your life so unexpectedly in the most unexpected of places and clicked instantly. Of course, its near impossible not to stay in connection with each other nowadays, but the setting in the nineties and the characteristics of these people and their beliefs works wonders here. This is a simple story of love set in the beautiful city of Vienna over the course of a night between an American guy and a French girl, that's told in the most realistic, infectious and delightful way possible. The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy is amazing. You might or might not warm up to Jesse who craves attention and generally has this snobbish attitude but is a romantic inside his heart, but no one, absolutely no one, will not love the free-spirited Celine who may come off as naive, but is so very hopeful and endearing. The sexual tension runs rampant beneath the surface. There are these most inane of conversations about their lives and how they feel about stuff, yet it is scintillating in the hands of these very capable actors who bring such joy, uncertainty, hope and fear to the table. There's no villain, action, slapstick comedy or any of the regular stuff that you expect from movies. The almost loving emphasis on breezy character interaction is quite remarkable. The dialogues flow naturally and is so good that I didn't want it to end.

And I've known about this movie for many decades; I've even listened to the main theme many times from a horror-movie-score-collaboration CD I've owned.I love these experiences. Going into a movie, especially a well-known, cult film, cold. (Well, that's not 100% true in this case &#x96; the score does mention the word witch, so beyond knowing it's famous and it's horror, I knew it had something to do with witches.)The result of me seeing this may not be the same as most people. I cannot comment on the DVD or BluRay version of this since I have not seen either. I wanted to see this one night for my October Horror Movie Marathon of movies I've never seen before and the best I could come up with was a YouTube version. So, maybe the incredibly BAD dubbed and TERRIBLE dialogue was part of that version. I dunno. What I do know is I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt (for the dialogue) since I watched this from YouTube.Beyond that and my free-pass, I observed the movie fully. It wasn't the most original movie, even for 1977 and the acting was subpar. But, I felt a lot of it was well shot and interesting despite the incredibly bad decisions our heroine makes throughout.Basically, the story goes a newcomer to the ballet world ventures to Europe and inadvertently gets involved in a cult academy. Weird scene after the next evolves until the final confrontation.Following this, and a day later, I would watch another one of Director Dario Argento's films to understand how weird this guy is. That movie, Phenomena (aka Creepers,) helped me see what his visions were and they don't mesh with my ideal horror film. So, there may be more out there that like his odd sense of filmmaking, but it's not my cup of European Tea.Unfocused and random this movie may be, it's ten times better than Phenomena (aka Creepers,) but it doesn't match the better horror movies locally made. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts The overall score was meh, but the main theme &#x96; the same one I heard on that compilation CD was fantastic. I just wish the movie mimicked the theme.

While Scorsese perhaps made a more engrossing and colourful adaptation, the '62 original remains tighter and more effortlessly chilling in its execution. Robert Mitchum was the original Max Cady before De Niro, a ruthlessly intelligent, sadistic felon who pursues Sam Bowden and his all-American family relentlessly. While De Niro in the remake felt more like an slasher movie villain, seemingly unstoppable in his almost supernatural pursuit of the Bowdens like a Michael Myers on steroids, here Mitchum's Cady is more akin to a weasel. He has the ability to squirm his way through every attempt to stop him within the confines of the law, using his knowledge of the system to harass Bowden without ever physically laying a finger on him. Some critics say that the remake covered up some plot discrepancies, by turning Bowden into Cady's lawyer, rather than just the witness that was Gregory Peck's character. But I for one find the notion of a phsycopath like Cady pursuing those he felt has wronged him in such an arbitrary fashion to be much more terrifying. It shows more how woefully unlucky Bowden was to wander into Cady's path, being picked out as a victim to pay undue penance for helping to put Cady away. Max Cady in this version is a hypnotic, soft-talking, but thoroughly unreasonable monster. Much more so than De Niro's. Perhaps it is a case of apples and oranges. Are there faults with Cape Fear? Perhaps, but only as a product of its time. Gregory Peck feels like little more than a rerun of his role as Atticus Finch, and the predictable scenario of the child in danger is a well worn plot device. However, the film more than makes up for any shortcomings with a gripping and suspenseful climax in the swamp of Cape Fear, with silent black and white figures grappling in the dark, muddy waters. The inevitable confrontation between Mrs. Bowden and Cady is a fine slice of close contact acting. Watch Cape Fear mainly to see one of the greatest villains to grace the screen. The scene of Mitchum slithering into the water like a reptile full of evil intent is worth the price of admission alone, whatever that may be.

To me, she is a silly person. Her stories are often really ridiculous. She treats murder as a parlour game, as exemplified especially here in this film. Of course, it may well be that people are comforted by murder being regarded as a parlour game, because they are all afraid of death, and the idea that murder can be reduced to a puzzle which one can solve if one is clever (with a little help from good old Agatha, who teases as she pleases) brings them into a calmer state. After all, one could never imagine that any of the silly Agatha Christie plots could ever really happen. So perhaps death can never really happen either. Is that perhaps the clue to Christie's appeal? Or is she the crossword-puzzle solver's type of thriller writer? Murder with her is reduced to five down and six across. Or is it ten down and seven across? Oh well, mental puzzles do divert people so. Isn't murder fun when packaged as an entertaining puzzle for vapid consumption? I only bought this DVD because I discovered that it had been directed by René Clair, the French director normally worthy of serious attention and respect. And by serious I do not mean that one cannot appreciate his frequent use of comedy, with which he laced so much of his work. And there are indeed some comedic touches in this silly film which he made in Hollywood, which was frankly not worthy of him. The cast includes Walter Huston, who does very well. I always find it intriguing listening to his voice and realizing how similar it was to his son John Huston's voice, except that John Huston's was deeper and even throatier. C. Aubrey Smith is marvellous as a deaf old general of the old school. Judith Anderson is suitably sinister as 'Miss Brent', who never stops knitting and quibbling, and who may be a murderess, or not, who knows. Queenie Leonard is suitably hysterical as the butler's wife, though she does not last long, and vanishes early in the parade of murders which are meant to lead to there being 'none'. Barry Fitzgerald is suitably curmudgeonly as a retired judge. Mischa Auer, whom Clair must have known well from Paris, is way over the top as a 'professional guest' and an exiled Russian prince who plays the piano and speaks much too loudly in a high, anxious whine. June Duprez manages some eerie and mysterious expressions and keeps her distance from the others in a way which raises the suspense level. The story of ten people being invited to a lonely island (obviously intended to be Scottish) with a single grand house for a weekend by a man whom they have never met is, obviously, entirely ludicrous. And then the idea that they are picked off one by one because they all committed past crimes and had gone unpunished is equally silly. And then there is the fact that their invisible host, Mr. Owen, has the initials of U. N., hence is 'Mr. U.N. Owen', geddit? 'Mr. Unknown.' How corny can you get? Pretty corny, if you are Agatha Christie, who seems to have been born in a cornfield. Oh well, it is all just harmless fun, and some people like it.

Thus, I want to concentrate on one aspect of the film that I think has genuine contemporary relevance.As the movie stands, Harry Caul is a good example of the struggle between humanity and technology. That is, in order to be tops in his highly technical bugging field, he's having to suppress normal human instincts. As a result, he lives almost entirely within himself. As top man, he's got the best devices, but his relentless drive also requires that he be a complete professional by ignoring the consequences of his expertise, whatever they might be. We learn, for example, that on one occasion his bugging success led to the death of three people. So to escape the guilt, he moved to San Francisco, as though that would be sufficient.However, it's apparent that Harry is having to struggle with an inescapable guilt no matter where he moves to. But if he gives in to moral reservations about his profession, they could worm their way into both his top standing and effectiveness. As a result, he likely depends upon religion as a way of salving these inner recriminations. By doing so, he can convince himself that he's not really a bad person, and continue on with his bugging activities. In the same vein, Harry represses anything like normal interactions with other people, since normal interactions would touch on moral considerations in a very real way. Thus he lives entirely within himself, as his generally frozen composure shows. In sum, Harry is about as affectless as any lead character in a movie I've seen, and likely a reason so many viewers object to the movie as a whole.The trouble is that Harry can repress his moral side, but not completely. That, of course, is illustrated by the showdown at the Jack Tarr hotel where he believes a young couple is about to be murdered because of his successful bugging of them. But notice the thrashing agony he goes through in the next room because he can't bring himself to directly intervene in what may be happening to the young couple next door. In short, even in this moment of internal crisis, his attachment to the professional side wins out. As I see it, in the final analysis, he can't give up his fascination with the technology of spying on others instead of interacting emotionally with them.Of course, the ironic upshot is that in the end, he's hoist by his own petard, as he sits alone amidst the shambles of his room playing a tune that only he can hear. The technology that's given him such power over others is now turned against him, dragging him finally over the brink into madness, which has been close by all along.On the whole, I think it's not too difficult to find comparisons of Harry's predicament with America's emerging surveillance state and its fascination with secret bugging technology. By and large, this national process is proceeding without much regard for the effects on individual privacy and how the information may be used. Moreover, just as Harry separated himself from others in pursuit of his bugging goals, so is the surveillance state becoming more remote from the nation. I don't want to exaggerate the analogy, but it is something to think about, particularly when we consider the movie's ironical upshot.

From all different walks of life, the film continues to come back to the idea that being an individual is okay as each student is forced to spend the day with each other in this detention setting. The kids all have the typical high school stereotypes, such as the bully (Judd Nelson), the cheerleader (Molly Ringwold) and the jock (Emilio Estevez). These kids all spend the day exploring the different things and characteristics in each other that all make them different and all make them alike. In the end, even though they all have their misconceptions, stereotypes and disagreements with each other, they all gain a better understanding of the next going forward from their time together. This film in a lot of ways can be compared to the X-Men film series from the standpoint of the characters in each movie take turns understanding what makes them the same and what makes them different. The X-Men, while all mutants, take a lot of time understanding what makes each mutant different from the next, including powers, geography and age. The Breakfast Club, while not nearly as fictional as the X- men films, takes the same kind of perspective with these high school kids without the action and violence. Angles are particularly important in this movie, because there are certain scenes that have to catch a facial expression without dialogue and without soundtrack. The expression may be in relationship to an action being performed by another character(s) and is most prevalent in Nelson's character. He spends a lot of time in the beginning scenes making the facial expression and following it up with criticism of the character that he is making the facial expression at. Lighting in this movie is not nearly as detailed but is equally important. Because the film's setting is a school, there has to be very bright lighting throughout the movie, because that is the way that most schools are lit. The bright lighting helps give the viewer the feel that they are truly in that setting with the film's characters. In the end, the characters learn more than they had ever imagined about each other, experiencing their quirks and hearing their stories.

These kids all spend the day exploring the different things and characteristics in each other that all make them different and all make them alike. In the end, even though they all have their misconceptions, stereotypes and disagreements with each other, they all gain a better understanding of the next going forward from their time together. This film in a lot of ways can be compared to the X-Men film series from the standpoint of the characters in each movie take turns understanding what makes them the same and what makes them different. The X-Men, while all mutants, take a lot of time understanding what makes each mutant different from the next, including powers, geography and age. The Breakfast Club, while not nearly as fictional as the X- men films, takes the same kind of perspective with these high school kids without the action and violence. Angles are particularly important in this movie, because there are certain scenes that have to catch a facial expression without dialogue and without soundtrack. The expression may be in relationship to an action being performed by another character(s) and is most prevalent in Nelson's character. He spends a lot of time in the beginning scenes making the facial expression and following it up with criticism of the character that he is making the facial expression at. Lighting in this movie is not nearly as detailed but is equally important. Because the film's setting is a school, there has to be very bright lighting throughout the movie, because that is the way that most schools are lit. The bright lighting helps give the viewer the feel that they are truly in that setting with the film's characters. In the end, the characters learn more than they had ever imagined about each other, experiencing their quirks and hearing their stories. The turn those misconceptions, stereotypes and disagreements, and turn them in to understanding.
