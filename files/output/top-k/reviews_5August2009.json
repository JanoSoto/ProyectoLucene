I think the movie is somewhere in the middle of that. First off, it came out only 9 months after part 2 (way to fast, come on, make the people want it more) like when Nightmare on Elm St.5 came out less then a year after 4 and that movie pretty much sucked. whenever you rush out a new movie for the money, it's not gonna be as good. Also when it came out (1991) Horror was already starting to cool down (till 1996's Scream). As far as the actual movie, well if you liked part 1 and 2 then I don't see why you wouldn't like this one. It takes place 8 years after part 2, which was a good idea because we didn't need to see Chucky chasing Andy as a kid again. So Andy is now a teen and going to a Millatary School. Mean while the Play Pal Company Decides to start reselling the Good Guy Dolls (guess they didn't learn after part 1 and 2, and I guess they didn't notice a big mess of Chucky with no head and Blood coming out from part 2 before they started remaking the dolls....how would his blood not be dried up by then??? It's only been 8 years lol). So Chucky's Blood spills into the new batch of Plastic and boom he's back to life. He finds out the School where Andy is at and thus mails himself there (no comment). This little kid Tyler (who befriended Andy early on) ends up with the box and opens it (tampering with mail is a federal offense Chucky tells him) but, he decides Tyler would be a perfect new body for him to transfer his soul into. Eventually Andy finds out he's there, He trys to save Tyler from Chucky, you got plenty of side characters as well whiteherst (the nerd), Lt. Sheldon (the prick), The Funny as hell Barber (forget his name but he's great in Hellraiser as well) and I can't remember the chicks name but there's a whole lovey dovey side plot with her and Andy (zzzz), anyway, People get killed, Chucky laughs a lot. And then there's a big ending at a Carnival. This one almost foreshadowed what the series would become with large doses of comedy and one liners from Chucky. The movie had some OK kills (I don't know why everyone says how gory this movie is....movies like Brain Damage (Dead Alive), Dawn\/Day of The Dead, Evil Dead, etc., now THOSE are gory movies). So overall, I think this is a decent little movie that most horror fans would at least like, especially if your a fan of the series.

While inappropriate for Lucas' 1977 film, it certainly holds true of Peter Yates' Krull, a nonsensical sci-fi fantasy hybrid which indulges in the superficial aspects of both genres without tapping into the common heart of either.We start with a Stars Warsesque opening where a vast ship moves across the frame. A ship that much resembles a strange rock formation like, say, a mountain. And while this mountain\/spacecraft lands, a voice-over invokes the fantasy genre with a prophecy of a Prince who shall defeat the intruders, slay the beast, save his bride, and their son shall rule the galaxy.Thus begins the formula Prince + Mentor + Princess to be Saved + Ragtag group of unlikely allies + Monstrous Villain = Fantasy (throw in rotoscoped lasers, and voila Sci-fi.) Now, I don't have any problem with said formula if said film can convince me to suspend my disbelief for it. Who is the Prince we're supposed to follow? Who is the Bride he's supposed to save? Why should I give a damn about them? I do not need (nor do I expect) full blown character bios and witty Shakespearian asides, but at least give me interesting little character quirks to separate these people from every single bland-to-mediocre fantasy novel, every single fantasy video games, and every single D&D campaign I've ever played.Give me characters with conviction.Unfortunately, everything exists to satisfy the formula, and the movie almost never takes a step further. The prince embarks on his epic quest to gain the glaive, find the seer, track down the fire mares, and engage the black fortress with an adventure loving smile &#x85; nevermind that the villains have his bride and are doing God knows what to her. The mentor imparts no wisdom upon the young hero, rather, exists to connect the dots and keep the plot moving by informing everyone where to go next. When the villainous slayers die, a strange creature bursts from their skulls and burrow themselves into the ground, but no one questions what they are or why this happens. The beast kidnapped the young bride for the sake of kidnapping the bride (why the hell do they care about this planet to begin with, anyway?).Yates introduces a Cyclops, and sets up a potentially magnificent pathos &#x96; that these creatures long ago made a pact with the Beast to see the future. Betrayed, now all they can see is the moment of their own death. In passing, this Cyclops speaks of his curse, but the film never explores it. I must stay here, he informs while everyone else rides on to the black fortress, but never does he state why he must stay there. Then a few minutes later, we see him riding to the rescue for an anti-climactic climax that carries the weight of a man deciding on decaf seconds before the 7\/11 clerk pours his coffee.The only character with any development and anything resembling pay off lay in the comic relief. Yes, Ergo, who describes himself as Ergo the magnificent! Short in stature, tall in greatness, narrow in focus, and wide in vision. Early in the film, we see the extent of his magic as he shuffles through scraps of parchment, mumbling some arcane words, and presto! He magically changed &#x85; himself into a goose. Over the course of the movie, he buddies up with a depressed young boy who lost his father figure. The boy says if he could have anything in the world, he'd want a puppy. So on the road, Ergo turn himself into a cute little beagle, and the boy is delighted. Later on, the two are trapped (inexplicably abandoned by the Prince) with Slayers approaching. Ergo changes himself into a tiger, and strangely steals the sympathy right out from under Prince-what's-his-name who left them both to die.Yes, the Prince flat out abandoned his companion and a small boy, and the scene doesn't bother conveying a sense of loss. The prince starts to go after them, but when it's apparent he'd be trapped with them he hops out of the hole so fast you can almost hear the MST3K crew throwing out the line, Eh, screw this! Is this prince going to tackle rescuing his princess with that level of commitment? What about their marriage? Some happily ever after.Since the film fails so epically on the character level, one can't help but notice the premise's absurdity. Medieval knights will fend off enemies capable of space flight. The bad guys, the Slayers, slowly approach with spears that fire off long range energy projectiles, and then when close these stiff and stilted creatures then use their spears as melee weapons. Why not just stand back and fire until everything is dead? And why have they mastered spaceflight, but not &#x96; I dunno &#x96; cannons? Heat rays? Atomic and biochemical weaponry? That's not to say Krull entirely lacks any redeeming features. Quite the contrary, when the character's actions take a backseat to show off Peter Suschitzky's breathtaking photography of magnificent landscapes, and when the lifeless dialog yields to James Horner's primitive (but charming) score, Krull stands with the best cinematic experiences.It's strangely ironic that Krull is strongest, most riveting, and most inviting when the characters shut up, fade into the background, and just move from point A to point B.

Mosley respond to the scene. Liotta gradually insinuates himself in their lives because he thinks that Stowe is sending up signals that she wants him. This of course sets up the conflict between Liotta and Russell for the rest of the film.

I claimed I'd become a model or creature maker for movies. I'm not, but that's not important. I'm young yet, and may still pursue that one of many dreams.I remember knowing a great deal about the world of the turtles, with all their fighting capabilities etc. It was a major talking point among my male friends. Later I even had a latex turtle arm I begged a friend to give to me. It was a reject from his uncle who worked in the design studio. I wore it around my local Scottish neighbourhood. It was only 1 arm mind. Funny stuff.Then it came time to see the first 2 movies in the cinema. I don't remember whether I saw them with my friend or my mother, or both. I was amazed by how they got the faces to move on the turtle characters and impressed by the actors moving so well in all that latex. I saw some fantastic documentaries on TV at the time about how it was all done. However, even at that age, I began to recognise how atrocious the acting was. In the second one it was even worse. I haven't seen the films since, so I can't have been influenced again.It was a fun time in my life, and I thank the creators for influencing that, but ultimately it was myself and my friends who created the great memories and not the film.I must have moved on to another interest when this third film was released, as I didn't even know of it's existence. I saw it on UK television many years later and to watch it for old times sake. It hadn't improved. The actors moved not so well in their suits, the voices were poorly chosen and vocalised, and there was little comedy. I did like the Japanese set design however, but then I realised that's not what the turtles are all about.

Then I saw this sequel, aware of its bad reputation beforehand, which I could fully understand after watching it! Early last year, I watched the original again.

Alex has been lying to her about his profession. He is actually another police officer, and Annie wouldn't have dated him in the first place had she known. To make it up to her, he gets two tickets for an ocean liner cruise, so the couple can go on a romantic vacation. However, this vacation doesn't go according to plan. Annie and Alex don't know that there is a dangerous passenger on board the Seabourn Legend cruise liner with them, a man named John Geiger! He is an ex-employee of a computer company, who was fired from his job due to ill health. Seeking revenge, he disables the ship's controls, and sets it on a collision course! It's now up to Alex to try and foil the madman's plans and rescue the passengers! My memory of this film is fairly vague, but I clearly remember my feelings as I watched it.

It seems most sequels are generally considered inferior to their predecessors, but not as far inferior as this one! Of course, most sequels feature the main character from the original film, and this one doesn't. Keanu Reeves refused to return as Officer Jack Traven, but even if he didn't, this movie probably wouldn't be any better.

However, at its onset, MGM had a different approach to its political content than that which ultimately emerged in the film. Early in production, Louis B. Mayer called director William Wyler into his office and told him to lighten up the character of the downed German flyer (played by Helmut Dantine) because the United States didn't hate anyone and Mayer had to answer to his stockholders. Selling American films abroad was (and still is) big business and Mayer didn't want to ruffle any box office feathers. I guess that's not surprising from a studio that paid a producer to scan the credits and change names that sounded too Jewish for films being released abroad. Wyler was allowed to make the German character suitably nasty only after Hitler declared war on the United States after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Ironically, while Mrs. Miniver was very popular in the United States and won several Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actress, it was ridiculed everywhere else, especially in England, the country it was supposed to glorify.Mrs. Miniver is the story of the Miniver family and their genteel life in merrie olde, carefree England before Germany invades Poland and begins hostilities. The country life enjoyed by the Minivers (architect Father, shop-'til-she-drops Mother, spoiled Oxford-educated son, etc.) is undermined until they all learn the meaning of sacrifice. One of the reasons the English scoffed at this film is its condescending attitude to the lower classes who were fighting the real war. We're supposed to feel sorry that poor Mr. Miniver nearly wrecks his sailboat trying to help his countrymen evacuate Dunkirk. Most of the actual Dunkirk defenders had no country house to go back to nor a family boat to take them. The middle-class Miniver family represents the kind of people who actively ignored Hitler until he started dropped bombs on them. What are their biggest worries before hostilities' break out? How can they possibly afford the new car father just bought as well as the frivolous new hat mother simply had to have? Will the station master's rose, named after Mrs. Miniver, win the annual flower competition? Do you care? The Minivers are supposed to be the family we all identify with and they make me wish I were an orphan.Not since seeing The Sound of Music have I rooted for the Nazis in a film. (I would have rooted for anyone to shut that Trapp family up. They couldn't walk across a room without breaking into a song.) The creaky mechanisms of cliché melodrama are painfully evident here the young lovers, the noble upperclassmen, the sacrifice of the family house, the brave church rector, etc. Early on I played a game trying to figure out which of the main characters would die. My money was on the cat the littlest Miniver loved. But, as it turns out, I guessed incorrectly, although the actual victim did not take me by surprise. This gung-ho, rally-the-troops agitprop doesn't travel well over time and Mrs. Miniver is hopelessly dependent for relevance on the time for which it was made. The theme of civilians in war is a fascinating one, but Mrs. Miniver fails to convey the terror of a non- combatant waiting to see if bombs will drop on his house. While bombs fall on her neighborhood Mrs. Miniver sits in the basement calmly knitting, thereby carrying the stiff upper lip British attitude to an absurd extreme. Other films like Hope and Glory, The Marriage of Maria Braun and the great Dutch film Soldier of Orange not only portray the tragedy of a daily routine upset by war, but are also refreshingly free of propaganda.So check one of them out before seeing this disappointing film.

It is so fascinating that this young boy didn't capitulate although his father, his brother and all the others first deem him gay. A very important scene is the gathering in which Billy's father and his brother try to collect money for Billy due to the fact that Tony really stands up for his brother for the first time. In this moment Tony doesn't care what the others could think. Till then the strong brotherly feelings for Villy didn't become apparent. However now the audience see that Billy can count on his brother Tony.The only aspect I was bothered by was the music in the beginning of the movie. It was too loud to understand Billy's voice.

I guess the most important message of this movie is that even if the worst circumstances control, a marvel is possible. For this reason I could watch the movie more times. It is so fascinating that this young boy didn't capitulate although his father, his brother and all the others first deem him gay. A very important scene is the gathering in which Billy's father and his brother try to collect money for Billy due to the fact that Tony really stands up for his brother for the first time.

I think The Birds is his scariest and most unique picture. Instead of a murder mystery or a psychological thriller, The Birds at its core is essentially a creature feature, and probably one of the most innovative.The premise is sort of a fantasy. It is a completely hypothetical 'What if' story. A small coastal city in sunny California becomes a hellhole when all the local birds suddenly develop a taste for human flesh. Crows, Gulls, sparrows and even fowl all become predators! The story is told from the point of view of a small family and their guest (Tippy Hedron) she has a crush on ... and decides to surprise him by driving into town and giving his sister a present for her birthday.I'll give you a perfect example of just how clever The Birds is. Picture if you will, one bird landing and perching very casually on the monkey bars in a playground, then another lands ten seconds later, then another then another. It resembles something out of Sesame Street (I am count Dracula! lets a-count a-birds!) The next thing you know, there are up to fifty birds just casually sitting on the playground.

The visual effects by modern standards would hardly be eye-popping but, considering this was almost fifty years ago, it is a fairly impressive job. There are hand puppets, birds on strings, projector silhouettes, and best of all, the movie features at least a couple hundred real birds.

The plot is fairly simple and straightforward a high school girl's parents go out of town so she decides to throw a slumber party with her friends. A deranged killer having escaped a mental institution crashes the party killing the young beauties one by one. You know how sometimes movies will only have vague information released about them with some embedded plot twists or surprises to be found later on in the story? Well, not in this case...When the movie first began I started analyzing the production values. The cinematography and art style were decent for an 80's flick indicating a moderate budget, not spectacular but not the worst either. The musical over-scoring is atrocious and noticeable withing the first fifteen minutes. Back in the 80's production companies were unaware of the importance of the musical score and how it affects the drama on the screen. Good music which compliments and coincides with the visual imagery can make an epic scene feel larger than life (i.e. Gladiator), a dramatic scene compelling (Saving Private Ryan), a horror scene absolutely terrifying (Jacob's Ladder, The Exorcist, America Psycho), or a comedic scene outrageously funny (can't think of any examples at the moment). A good composer knows when to enhance the drama or terror on the screen with the right amount of scoring and when music needs to be absent to let the strengths of the actors to carry the scene. Well, like most 80's films with cheesy scores this film isn't any exception to the trend of its era, but this movie has the worst B budget musical score which detracts from the effectiveness of the film even more. It sounded like midi synthesizer crap composed on an Amiga 64 or Apple IIC and it's way over-scored throughout the dreadful length of the film.The acting delivered by the actors is nondescript and unconvincing for the most part with a few minor exceptions. While a few of the characters are decent, over 95% if them are underdeveloped and unilateral filling the screen with stilted acting. Since the characters really never develop into anything meaningful it's impossible to feel sympathetic for them in their plight of survival. Then there's the killer...the thing that made me despise this film within the first thirty minutes was when they plainly showed the killer's face during the second death scene thus negating any possibility of tension or suspense. When movies keep a killer's identity secret it creates an aura of mystery which can keep audiences on edge because it could be anybody thus formulating the possibility of a plot twist or a double cross, etc. This is not the case in slumber party massacre, they clearly show you who the killer is and boy was he an ignorant looking moron. His presence on film wasn't threatening in any way and he gets my vote in being the worst villain persona in any horror movie. Then there's the matter of his acting...they could not have picked a more atrocious actor to deliver such a horrendous performance as a killer, especially in the climatic scene, if they had wanted to on purpose.Usually when a movie has mediocre production values or worse there's something else, whether it be a plot twist, surprise, imaginative story, well written story, clever direction, etc., which redeems the film from falling into the bad film category. I kept waiting for that plot twist or that surprise in a really imaginative story to understand why this movie merits generally positive reception amongst horror fans. Slumber Party Massacre has none of these elements...nothing could be more linear, dull, or pointless as this waste of time.

Audiences under age 30 may classify this brooding, lethargic, romantic mystery with Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel as downbeat, impersonal, and tiresome. Neither Message in a Bottle director Luis Mandoki and Sharkey's Machine scenarist Gerald DiPego cater to neatly tying up all the loose narrative threads at fade-out nor pander to erratic attention-deficit style editing to ingratiate audiences with their lachrymose cops & lovers yarn. Instead, every scene in Angel Eyes portrays life as an experience where people sometimes cannot resolve conflicts. Mandoki and DiPego dole out plot details like bread crumbs to string us along, and this piecemeal strategy maintained my attention.Angel Eyes will either intrigue you or will infuriate you entirely with the way they draw out the inevitable. They give their characters room enough to develop, and a gifted, first-class cast exploits every opportunity. Admirably, much of this provocative, above-average, but uneven 'chick flick' springs from the characters and their reactions to the obstacles thwarting their desires. Unwisely, Mandoki and DiPego rely on some plot contrivances that undercut credibility but deepen dramatic impact.Angel Eyes opens in Chicago at the scene of a tragic traffic accident. Windy City cop Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez of Maid in Manhattan) comforts an accident victim until the paramedics arrive. Mandoki and DiPego create an intriguing aura of mystery early on in the story, because the victim remains anonymous. Cleverly but effectively, they capture the action from the perspective of the injured passenger. A year elapses, and the main plot gradually begins to unfold. Angel Eyes depicts Sharon Pogue as a tough, resourceful, fearless police woman who can handle anything that the criminal element can dish out. She tackles one big hoodlum, body slams the dastard against the hood of her police cruiser, and the cuffs and stuffs him. Later, at the precinct house, the thug gives her lip and grabs her. Pogue roughs him up without a second thought, only to have her partner Robby (Terrence Howard of Iron Man) reprimand her. Don't bust my balls, Pogue complains irritably as if she were a guy.Indeed, shunning her glamorous pop diva persona, Lopez delivers a persuasive, rock-solid performance as a dedicated but lonely, insomniac cop with a woebegone past who prefers the graveyard shift. Basically, Sharon jailed her abusive father Carl (Victor Argo of The Yards) ten years ago for beating up her mother Josephine (Brazilian actress Sonia Braga of The Rookie), and bad blood has existed ever since between them. Essentially, her father disowned her after his arrest. Surprisingly, her mother invites her to attend a ceremony where they plan to renew their marriage vows. Sharon's working class brother Larry (Jeremy Sisto of The Suicide Kings) isn't overjoyed about seeing his hard-nosed sister. Eventually, Larry batters his own wife Kathy (Monet Mazur of Mystery Men) in a fit of rage. Arriving at the scene, Sharon slugs Larry in the mouth in front of her own brothers-in-blue! The cops refuse to arrest Sharon when Larry cries police brutality.Later, Sharon is hanging out with fellow cops at a diner when black gunmen in a car wheel up and unload a fusillade of bullet at them. The fleeing gangstas wreck their car, and the cops chase them. Sharon pursues a lone gunman, and the suspect ambushes her. Shooting her twice in the chest, he takes aim at her face when a mysterious stranger intervenes. This unshaven Samaritan knocks the assailant off Sharon and saves her life! When Sharon recovers, she learns that her dark-haired hero in a trench coat calls himself Catch (Jim Caviezel of Frequency) and just happened to be across the street when the gunfight erupted. An awkward relationship blossoms from their chance encounter. Catch behaves as if he were suffering from amnesia. Despite Sharon's attempts to draw him out in conversation, he refuses to talk about himself. Aimlessly, he wanders the streets at night and performs good deeds at random. For example, Catch spots a car with its headlamps burning. Opening the door, he reaches inside to switch them off. Just as he does, the angry owner accuses him of stealing. Catch decks himself out in a wardrobe like the Nicholas Cage character from director Brad Silverling's City of Angels, but he is a flesh-and-blood entity, not an angel.Eventually, Sharon and Catch date. At a state park on a picnic, they frolick in the lake, then get intimate on the beach. Unlike most citizens who ask Sharon how many people she has shot in the line of duty, Catch praises her for her unselfish sacrifices. Their oddball but believable relationship endures its share of ups and down like most real relationships. Specifically, Sharon comes clean about herself with Catch, but he retreats into silence or anger about himself as if he were playing hard to get.Angel Eyes rarely strays from the issues at hand. This character driven drama deals with sudden death, dysfunctional families, and spousal abuse, but it offers no facile answers.

Audiences under age 30 may classify this brooding, lethargic, romantic mystery with Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel as downbeat, impersonal, and tiresome. Neither Message in a Bottle director Luis Mandoki and Sharkey's Machine scenarist Gerald DiPego cater to neatly tying up all the loose narrative threads at fade-out nor pander to erratic attention-deficit style editing to ingratiate audiences with their lachrymose cops & lovers yarn. Instead, every scene in Angel Eyes portrays life as an experience where people sometimes cannot resolve conflicts. Mandoki and DiPego dole out plot details like bread crumbs to string us along, and this piecemeal strategy maintained my attention.Angel Eyes will either intrigue you or will infuriate you entirely with the way they draw out the inevitable. They give their characters room enough to develop, and a gifted, first-class cast exploits every opportunity. Admirably, much of this provocative, above-average, but uneven 'chick flick' springs from the characters and their reactions to the obstacles thwarting their desires. Unwisely, Mandoki and DiPego rely on some plot contrivances that undercut credibility but deepen dramatic impact.Angel Eyes opens in Chicago at the scene of a tragic traffic accident. Windy City cop Sharon Pogue (Jennifer Lopez of Maid in Manhattan) comforts an accident victim until the paramedics arrive. Mandoki and DiPego create an intriguing aura of mystery early on in the story, because the victim remains anonymous. Cleverly but effectively, they capture the action from the perspective of the injured passenger. A year elapses, and the main plot gradually begins to unfold. Angel Eyes depicts Sharon Pogue as a tough, resourceful, fearless police woman who can handle anything that the criminal element can dish out. She tackles one big hoodlum, body slams the dastard against the hood of her police cruiser, and the cuffs and stuffs him. Later, at the precinct house, the thug gives her lip and grabs her. Pogue roughs him up without a second thought, only to have her partner Robby (Terrence Howard of Iron Man) reprimand her. Don't bust my balls, Pogue complains irritably as if she were a guy.Indeed, shunning her glamorous pop diva persona, Lopez delivers a persuasive, rock-solid performance as a dedicated but lonely, insomniac cop with a woebegone past who prefers the graveyard shift. Basically, Sharon jailed her abusive father Carl (Victor Argo of The Yards) ten years ago for beating up her mother Josephine (Brazilian actress Sonia Braga of The Rookie), and bad blood has existed ever since between them. Essentially, her father disowned her after his arrest. Surprisingly, her mother invites her to attend a ceremony where they plan to renew their marriage vows. Sharon's working class brother Larry (Jeremy Sisto of The Suicide Kings) isn't overjoyed about seeing his hard-nosed sister. Eventually, Larry batters his own wife Kathy (Monet Mazur of Mystery Men) in a fit of rage. Arriving at the scene, Sharon slugs Larry in the mouth in front of her own brothers-in-blue! The cops refuse to arrest Sharon when Larry cries police brutality.Later, Sharon is hanging out with fellow cops at a diner when black gunmen in a car wheel up and unload a fusillade of bullet at them. The fleeing gangstas wreck their car, and the cops chase them. Sharon pursues a lone gunman, and the suspect ambushes her. Shooting her twice in the chest, he takes aim at her face when a mysterious stranger intervenes. This unshaven Samaritan knocks the assailant off Sharon and saves her life! When Sharon recovers, she learns that her dark-haired hero in a trench coat calls himself Catch (Jim Caviezel of Frequency) and just happened to be across the street when the gunfight erupted. An awkward relationship blossoms from their chance encounter. Catch behaves as if he were suffering from amnesia. Despite Sharon's attempts to draw him out in conversation, he refuses to talk about himself. Aimlessly, he wanders the streets at night and performs good deeds at random. For example, Catch spots a car with its headlamps burning. Opening the door, he reaches inside to switch them off. Just as he does, the angry owner accuses him of stealing. Catch decks himself out in a wardrobe like the Nicholas Cage character from director Brad Silverling's City of Angels, but he is a flesh-and-blood entity, not an angel.Eventually, Sharon and Catch date. At a state park on a picnic, they frolick in the lake, then get intimate on the beach. Unlike most citizens who ask Sharon how many people she has shot in the line of duty, Catch praises her for her unselfish sacrifices. Their oddball but believable relationship endures its share of ups and down like most real relationships. Specifically, Sharon comes clean about herself with Catch, but he retreats into silence or anger about himself as if he were playing hard to get.Angel Eyes rarely strays from the issues at hand. This character driven drama deals with sudden death, dysfunctional families, and spousal abuse, but it offers no facile answers.

The plot worked well with the race scene environment and yes it was stolen from Point Break another movie I loved. The movie relied on a good mix of both the action from the races and the emotions and history of the characters to keep the views involved, the main focus on Dominic, but giving enough of the other characters so the movie was not just all about Dom.

I've always been a fan of the political thrillers with espionage thrown in, and JFK is undoubtedly one of the best (if not the best) of these.

Unless of course, you're the kind who rates a movie's greatness based on the special effects. In which case, I would suggest you go for the Transformers sequel, as most of the world seems to be.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the New Orleans DA, who (after 3 years) discovers that things were just not right with the investigation and findings of the Warren commission regarding the murder of John F. Kennedy. Together with his office, a small yet dedicated bunch, he sets out to investigate. Against all odds and a labyrinth of characters, threats, murders and political intrigue, he manages to bring forth the case to trial. Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the final monologue by Costner has to be seen to be believed. And felt.

Reminds you that Costner is capable of being there with the very best, despite some of the crap he dishes out at times.As for the actual case, was there conspiracy involving the CIA, the govt, the FBI, and the anti-Cuban and anti-communist forces?

I claimed I'd become a model or creature maker for movies. I'm not, but that's not important. I'm young yet, and may still pursue that one of many dreams.A few years later I discovered Fangoria magazine and would gleefully thumb the pages in a large Scottish department store. I got quite a fright once when a friend found me in my own little world of fake blood and gore.At only 8 I visited New Zealand with my mother and happened to find myself in the capital's futurist Te Papa museum, at her suggestion. At that time was an exhibition dedicated to Peter Jackson's backyard ingenuity in making his early comedy horror films. It even had the documentary of the making of Bad Taste, including his mother talking about him using the oven to bake his latex alien masks. I was so enraptured by the arousing disgustingness around me. Amazingly my mother happily left me alone, along with many other kids, in the frankly shocking scenes of the exhibition, including many bloodied props from Braindead. I went on to chase them through a maze of mirrors. It's an obscure memory I hope to never lose, but one that tells a lot about children's acceptance of things.It was over a decade until I saw the featured films. For Braindead I waited until I was able to see the original uncut version on Britain's glorious Channel 4.

I often brought them weird offering to watch together, matched with a smooth spliff and beers for the others.Suffice to say I was not disappointed! What we have in Jackson's early vision is undoubtedly the greatest marriage of comedy and horror in the history of cinema.

It's not that it's bad or such a pale kid-friendly followup to its CLASSIC original, but CtD is just clunky and boring.The biggest problem is that Conan is given way too many sidekicks. It seems every significant scene in the first half of the movie only exists to either set up the plot (which is rather thin and lacking), introduce another sidekick to add to the party, or provide for weak comedy relief! There is absolutely no character building, precious little intrigue, no suspense, and even less excitement. Once the second half comes and we near act 3, the film feels so on autopilot that it's impossible to pay attention to.Richard Fleischer was one of the top action directors from the 50's-70's, but by the mid-80's he had unfortunately been reduced to hired hand status and often given family-friendly dreck he seemed to have precious little investment in. This film is pedestrian and uninventive in every way, especially disappointing considering the crew involved. Jack Cardiff's photography is workmanlike, Giannetto De Rossi's makeup rubs off in a few scenes, and Basil Poledouris's score is just a weaker version of his career highpoint score for CtB. Even Carlo Rambaldi's malevolent demigod creature creation is lacking and not very scary at all thanks to poor movement control and the fact that you never see the entire monster in any one shot. It suffers an acute case of Krakenitis (in reference to CLASH OF THE TITANS) in that it's the climactic cataclysmic monster but upon introduction it just stands around and doesn't do anything! About the only saving grace is the completely wacky cast - with Arnold teamed up with Wilt Chamberlain (in a completely forgettable and pointless role), Grace Jones (as an angry Zulu warrior), Mako (looking half-asleep), Jeff Corey, Sarah Douglas (attractive as usual), Pat Roach (in a rare speaking role), and Sven-Ole Thorson. Thorson's character is given a curiously detailed and important-feeling fight scene with Arnold even though he is just a random low-level nameless villain whose face is never clearly shown. Arnold doesn't seem to care at all that he looks just like one of the villains he killed in the last movie. Perhaps he's meant to be his twin brother? This could have been interesting if the film had done anything with it.That unfortunately applies to everything else in this film - a lot of missed potential in favor of a cynical attempt to make as much cash as possible with as little style or originality as possible.

In some of the most memorable roles in his pictures, he didn't so much cast against type, but teased something sinister out of a performer's existing screen persona. Here, he took Robert Walker's sensitive, vulnerable but above all trustworthy image, and fitted it to a deeply disturbed yet seemingly innocent character. This sort of thing was potentially devastating to the star system, where typecasting was essential to studio marketing methods. Hitch couldn't have got away with it in the 1930s, but by this point things were starting to change in the way the studios controlled their stars, and in any case, Hitchcock was now such a respected figure there was a lot more he could get away with.Speaking of which, this is among the most overtly stylised of Hitchcock's Hollywood pictures. From Robert Walker's Gothic mansion, to shock shots like the painting of St Francis or the twisting carousel horses, it is full of bizarre yet curiously effective touches. The best scene is surely the murder at the fairground, a somewhat light-hearted suspense sequence. This has perhaps the most intelligent employment of sound in a Hitchcock picture, with sudden sharp noises punctuating the tension, off-screen sounds to create red herrings, and what I would describe as a sarcastic use of music.The entire first half of the picture is fabulously constructed, but as the tale unfolds it all becomes a tad dull by comparison. The trouble is, the thrills of this picture are left almost entirely to the acrobatics of Hitchcock's direction. Other than Walker, no cast members really stand out (although the casting of Hitch's daughter Pat was a nice touch), and the comic relief moments are lacking in the charm and warmth that buoys up many of his best pictures. Importantly, I don't feel we are as able to sympathise with Farley Granger, the way we can with James Stewart, Cary Grant or Ingrid Bergman in their various parts for the Master &#x96; we don't feel that this could happen to us.In fact, because Hitchcock's direction is so elaborate, the whole story, every emotion, every grain of characterisation is conveyed through technique &#x96; through staging, lighting, the editing process and so forth. And within this the actors are merely part of the design. Robert Walker, in spite of his being a bold casting choice, is still really just ticking a box, the right man for the job because he is the wrong man. Still, to say Strangers on a Train is only about Hitchcock's direction is saying rather a lot. Here, at the peak of his career, we get something in between the overbearing expressionism of his early pictures and the plodding routine of his later work &#x96; a meticulous piece of craftsmanship, yet still dazzlingly original and visually engaging.

Much of this stemmed from my fascination with creature special effects, animatronics, along with models and other fantasy beings, after seeing films or programs on TV such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Dinosaurs, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Labyrinth, Willow, Time Bandits, and a little later The Thing. I claimed I'd become a model or creature maker for movies. I'm not, but that's not important. I'm young yet, and may still pursue that one of many dreams.A few years later I discovered Fangoria magazine and would gleefully thumb the pages in a large Scottish department store. I got quite a fright once when a friend found me in my own little world of fake blood and gore.At only 8 I visited New Zealand with my mother and happened to find myself in the capital's futurist Te Papa museum, at her suggestion. At that time was an exhibition dedicated to Peter Jackson's backyard ingenuity in making his early comedy horror films. It even had the documentary of the making of Bad Taste, including his mother talking about him using the oven to bake his latex alien masks. I was so enraptured by the arousing disgustingness around me. Amazingly my mother happily left me alone, along with many other kids, in the frankly shocking scenes of the exhibition, including many bloodied props from Braindead. I went on to chase them through a maze of mirrors. It's an obscure memory I hope to never lose, but one that tells a lot about children's acceptance of things.It was over a decade until I saw the featured films. For Braindead I waited until I was able to see the original uncut version on Britain's glorious Channel 4. I eventually managed to download Bad Taste (sorry Peter Jackson) from eMule to share the greatest of New Zealand with my friends. I often brought them weird offering to watch together, matched with a smooth spliff and beers for the others.Suffice to say I was not disappointed! I've only ever seen this film alone, but from discussions with numerous people it's clear that what we have here is Jackson's finest film and undoubtedly the greatest marriage of comedy and horror in the history of cinema. It's that likely ancient way of accepting the utter ugliness of much of existence, by humourising it. Perhaps even accepting these extremes are merely variants of the same great experience. The US had it's own classic series before with The Evil Dead, and I'm extremely proud of the UK's top billing Shaun Of The Dead. However because this film is truly Kiwi I love it beyond all others.Looking back on both the museum exhibition and movies, it appears Kiwis are quite comfortable embracing these themes in daily life.
