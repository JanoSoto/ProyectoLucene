After a pretentious prologue narrated by no less than Charlton Heston (but without plugs for the NRA) and showing the configuration of continents umpteen million years ago as being exactly the same as it is now, the movie pops the clutch and goes into high gear.New York City, the present day.  Under the opening titles, a young man rides his bicycle into Manhattan with his strange looking but still cute dog riding in the basket.  Once in Manhattan he comes into confilict with a street vendor selling Godzilla figures, which the dog promptly tries to eat.  Meanwhile an Asian couple is stuck in traffic, and the woman is complaining to the cab driver that she wants to go shopping.Without warning huge chunks of rock are streaking from the sky, buildings are exploding, vehicles are bursting into flames, the top of the Chrystler Building is sheared off and falls into the street below, crushing cars and pedestrians unlucky enough to be in its path.  A hole is blown in the street and the young man tries to rescue his dog.People are in motion, things are happening at a breakneck pace, adrenaline is pumping.And all too soon we cut away and never see these characters or New York City again.  Director Michael Bay starts all over again with a new setting (an offshore oil rig) and new characters who are neither fresh nor interesting.The rig is run by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis).  His awesomely lovely daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) lives with him and a dozen or so men on the isolated rig.  Harry is amazed that Grace is deep in a romance with A. J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of his crew members.  And Harry is the hero of this movie, the man whose job it will be to save the planet, but he's too dense to figure that his daughter would get in a situation like this on this rig in the middle of nowhere?Lord help us all!  Would someone go over to the auditorium where DEEP IMPACT is playing and see if they can talk Robert Duvall into coming back with them?  Now there's a man who can inspire confidence.DEEP IMPACT was a very good movie on its own.  Compared to what passes for entertainment here, DEEP IMPACT seems more like a latter day CITIZEN KANE.Really, there's noting wrong with Mr. Willis's performance here.  But the script (by a total of ten writers, always a bad sign) doesn't really give him anything to work with.  Late show fans will recall the situation with his daughter and Affleck as recycled from John Wayne's THE HELLFIGHTERS.Pretty soon Willis is in Houston at NASA and the big brass are telling him that he and his crew need to do the whole astronaut training bit in a period of days and then go blow up the asteroid roughly the size of Texas which threatens to crush the world.So he and his crew go through the training (lots of recycled material from THE DIRTY DOZEN HERE) and finally do blast off.  Before they leave Ms. Tyler and Affleck make goo-goo eyes at each other while songs by Aerosmith (featuring Liv's dad, Steve) play on the soundtrack.  If this had been directed by John Waters, he could have had some creepy fun with that.Paris blows up.  Singapore blows up.  But since we don't know any characters in either city, that's just so much special effects.  Oddly enough, it seems as if the killer chunks of rock will not strike anywhere with a population of less than several million people.There's one special effect worth noting, though.  It's a major conceit of this film that if the sun is shining on the U S of A, it's shining everywhere.  There's no nonsense about time zones or the earth's rotation or anything like that.There are two performances of note here.  Most amazingly, Steve Buscemi plays one of the drillers.  After all those independent films he's made, here he is in a big piece of mainstream crap to get a nice check so that he can go on making quirky independent films.  Way to go, Steve.  Cash those checks, hold your head up, and walk on.One of the big cheeses at NASA is played by Billy Bob Thornton.  Billy Bob hasn't made many movies like this, and he creates a three-dimensional and interesting character.  Since director Michael Bay doesn't seem very intersted in the actors, just the explosions, I guess there wasn't anyone to stop Billy Bob from doing good work.  He plays a man who would have been an astronaut were it not for physical limitations, and he's teriffic.The astronauts blast off and the story grinds to a screeching halt for an interlude on the Russian space station, which blows up very loudly as the astronauts make a hasty exit.  Then the astronauts try to plant a big bomb on the asteroid which, for whatever reason, has grass and water on it although there's no atmosphere.The finale involves self-sacrifice, probably because audiences responded so positively to the same element in DEEP IMPACT.  There's a scene that, oddly enough, builds to a point where it actually has emotional impact if Michael Bay had known that, the scene probably would have been cut.More stuff blows up.The surviving astronauts return to Earth, and there's a wedding.  Nothing else blows up.  Except the audience, when they realize that they've blown $5 or more and a whopping two hours and twenty-four minutes.With any luck this will be the end of the current cycle of disaster movies. Anyway, I liked them better back in the 1970's when they featured actors whose tv shows had been cancelled but still had some recognition factor.Parents' note- the PG-13 rating is for some language and sexual innuendo and violence.  The violence mainly consists of stuff blowing up, with very little attention to those people who might be caught in the way.  And it's very, very loud.  The film might be disturbing to children under junior high age.On a five scale, Pops gives ARMAGEDDON 1.5 skyrockets.

The Dude is an unlikely hero if there ever was one, and that is why he is a most refreshing and memorable one.  There's The Dude's best friend Walter  (John Goodman), a well-read and impulsive Vietnam vet; Jesus, the purple -clad sex offender\/bowler; Maude Lebowski(Juliane Moore), the feminist artist who speaks of coitus; and a crazed group of ideologically-confused nihilists, among so many other great characters.  The dialogue is priceless.The plot is very unique and ridiculous, but it fits the movie absolutely perfectly.  The Dude and Walter get involved in a shady world of kidnapping , embezzlement, porn, reactionary cops, and just about everything else, when all the Dude ever wanted was compensation for a rug of his that had been urinated on by confused debt collectors who were looking for a different man also named Jeff Lebowski.

The Dude's dream \/blackout sequences are hilarious (complete with Saddam Hussein handing out bowling shoes and bowling combined with porn imagery).

Yes, it's a little slack on details and some might consider it dull.  While even I hoped for a little more of life inside the club than it actually projected I still amazingly liked it.  Maybe, because it was incredibly short and light -weight summer entertainment or because it had a constant beat to it; either way I still enjoyed it.  I'm not recommending this, even though i liked it myself; because most people won't have interest in seeing a movie on 54 and especially after reading the terrible reviews about it.  The truth is Mike Myers was good as Steve Rubell and the rest give reasonably good performances;enough to believe at least.  This film was incredibly low on sex and drugs considering it was the late 70's in the notorious Studio 54. I was a little surprised that the film didn't ever show rubell's co-partner Ian Shroeger.  If you're expecting a strict copy of the real 54, this will probably disappoint you.  The main story line is featured on a young adult who rises as a bartender in the club and how his life changes in all aspects; his connection with his family deteriorates, his drug use rises along with his sexual activity.  But there is really hardly much sex in it too make it possibly offending.  I love how the beginning and the ending is portrayed.  The film was cut short 30 minutes after it was shown to a test audience-which disliked various parts and the ending i believe.  Whether it was cut for the good or the bad I give this film an 8 out of ten or a B+ or better yet, 3 stars out of 4.

What is news is that a 4 year old girl succeeds in this. That's what Victoire Thivisol is doing. The movie follows her character, Ponette, through the hard times she has after her mother's death. Ponette spends most of the film trying to get her mother back, or at least getting contact with her. The strong point of the movie is that it succeeds in bringing the viewer into the world of thoughts and feelings of Ponette, bridging the large emotional differences between child and adult. I can remember that when her father picked her up from a solitary hiding place, saying 'Your mother is not coming back', thinking to myself 'That may be true, but can't you see how you're hurting the child?'.Jacques Doillon is said to have spent months just going through the movie with the children, and changing the script, based on what they did out of themselves and the reactions they gave. And the result shows it - the movie really enters the children's world. Still, even his great directing wouldn 't have gotten this far without a child that so sublimely could feel in and show so many different emotions as Thivisol. It's not without reason that she was chosen 'best actress' on the Venice film festival.The only disappointment in the movie is the end. On itself this is well directed and played, but the shift from realism to symbolism breaks the film's strength, which lies not only in its portrayal of the child's world, but also in its embedding in the so-called 'real world'. Getting a good end to this movie is indeed hard, but the actual ending still does not feel well.

It might have been good.  As it is, some parts are staggeringly dull, especially while Philippe is on the screen in particular.  Then other moments seem to catch the moments that made this time memorable and movie -worthy.
