[{"date":"20 August 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Shrek is one of the best animation films i've ever seen. It's incredibly inventive and has great humor and great performances. Mike Myers is great as the ogre Shrek. If it wouldn't of had his name on the front cover I never would've known it was him. Eddie Murphy is fantastic as Donkey. Donkey is the highlight of the film, pretty much. Donkey is the best character in the entire trilogy, no character can top Donkey. There's also Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona, who I liked also. The last person is John Lithgow from 3rd rock from the sun. Lithgow is great in this also. With such a great cast, great cast, clever comedy, and many other things, Shrek is one of the best animation films ever. It's second place behind Ratatouille and tied with Finding Nemo. This is definitely Dreamwork's best film. Usually, films from Dreamworks that are nominated for best animated film don't win. Pixar is usually the Oscar winning one. But Shrek actually did win best animated picture, because it's fantastic. It definitely deserved it.The Plot Shrek is a big green ogre who is hated by everyone and just wants peace and quiet. But his life changes when all of these fairy tale creatures are found on his swamp. So to get rid of them, Shrek goes to Lord Farquad and begins his quest to find Princess Fiona, who Farquad wants to marry so then he can be King. But Princess Fiona isn't quite what he expects.
