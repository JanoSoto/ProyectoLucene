Dorothy wants to find and marry a poor man while Lorelei wants a rich man but her already rich fiancé sends a spy (Elliott Reid) on board to make sure she doesn't do anything naughty (which she does, of course). If you think about the film and its story too much then you'll probably walk away disappointed because if you do think too much you'll probably find something in every scene to rip apart. For starters, it's very, very unlikely that these two characters would really be friends as they're simply too different. They have nothing in common and it's doubtful one would put up with the morals or beliefs of the other. You could also argue that the characters just change and go as the film does with them changing personalities just to suit whatever a certain scene calls for. There's quite a bit more that you could rip on but this movie just tries to be fun and for the most part it is. I think the main reason to watch this is for the cast and there's no doubt that director Hawks knew that the skin of Russell and Monroe would bring people in. I'm not sure how the two stays in some of these outfits that they were in as the flick shows enough leg for three movies and how those bodies didn't come flying out at any second must have taken quite a bit of time to get under control. Both actresses shake their hips when they walk and put enough attitudes into their roles to be very charming. Russell, of course, plays the tougher one with Monroe's character, at times, playing smart but at other times being a complete dope. Reid and Gus Esmond are both good in their roles but it's Charles Coburn who really steals the film as a millionaire who Monroe tries to steal on the cruise. I found the entire courtroom scene at the end to be quite bad and there's no doubt that the screenplay has some major issues but, again, I think the movie just wants to be fun. Some of the music highlights include When Love Goes Wrong, Bye Bye Baby, A Little Girl from Little Rock and the now legendary Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.

Still, like Scary Movie, which started the spoof craze (that has LONG since worn out its welcome) the humor is such that one doesn't have to view every movie that is skewered by the film.Not Another Teen Movie takes potshots at a slew of teen movies, but the story (if you can call it that--it's really just a clothesline to string the gags) mainly follows the plot of She's All That. Jake Wyler (Chris Evans) is the most popular guy in school. After being unceremoniously dumped by his equally popular girlfriend, Priscilla (Jamie Pressly), he makes a bet with his friends that he can turn any girl into the prom queen. The selection is of course Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh, who is surprisingly on-target in her portrayal of Rachel Leigh Cook in She's All That). Of course, they fall for each other (duh!).Like all saturation comedies, the humor is hit and miss. Some of the stuff is funny, others don't work or are a bit too obvious.

Chris Evans is one of Hollywood's big why's? He has little to no talent, yet he's making big money. Whatever appeal he may have is not on screen in this movie.

The other problem is more serious because it ruins many of the potential jokes. A degree of exaggeration is key for humor, but even that has its limits. Unfortunately, Gallen doesn't recognize this.

This one sounded pretty convincing with that business about the fusion of Brundle and the fly at the molecular-genetic level.One of the brilliant things about Goldblum's performance is the way he mimics fly behavior starting with the endless cup of sugar. The early touches with the wiry hair effect and the preliminary disfigurement are nicely juxtaposed with Brundle's disproportionate new strength and acrobatic ability. I recall when I saw this the first time that I wondered when we would see Brundle walking around on the ceiling and sure enough, they eventually got around to creating a nicely convincing scene of it.The thing I didn't find particularly believable though was Ronnie's (Geena Davis) willingness to stick it out to the very end with fly-man. The clincher for me was when she hugged him right after his ear fell off. I mean, you REALLY had to take it on faith that she was trying to remain true to her feelings for the man she started to fall in love with. But gee, you can only take that idea so far.Thinking about that pregnancy side story, it seemed pretty obvious that the ending left it open for an eventual sequel that never panned out. On the other hand, I'd hate to put Geena Davis through that again, especially since she would have had to deal with another monster.But you know, I could go along with all the creepy fly stuff and the grotesque makeup job. However the one thing I really couldn't figure out in all this - who would ever name their kid Stathis Borans?

Hart's War, dating from 2002, represents a return to a particular sub-genre of the war film, the prisoner of war drama once represented by the likes of The Wooden Horse, The Colditz Story Bridge on the River Kwai and The Great Escape.The action takes place in the winter of 1944\/45. The title character is Lieutenant Thomas Hart, a young American officer captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge and taken to a prisoner of war camp. In civilian life Hart was a law student at Yale, and although he is not yet a qualified lawyer he is ordered by Colonel William McNamara, the senior American officer in the camp, to undertake the defence of Lieutenant Lincoln Scott, a black airman accused of murder. (The German Commandant has agreed that Scott may have a court-martial under American military law).The murdered man was Sergeant Vic Bedford, a racist with a vicious hatred of blacks, and it is assumed that Scott killed him in revenge for his part in the death of another black officer, Lieutenant Archer. (Archer was shot by the Germans after a tent spike, which could be used as a weapon, was found in his bunk, and Scott believes that Bedford planted it there). Scott, however, denies responsibility for Bedford's death and Hart sets about defending him to the best of his ability. Hart, however, becomes suspicious of McNamara, who is acting as president of the court, and begins to believe that he may have his reasons for wanting Scott found guilty. A complicating factor is that Hart suffers from feelings of guilt after revealing intelligence to the Germans under interrogation.Traditional POW movies could be divided into two categories. The first category, like The Wooden Horse, were pure adventure stories concentrating on the theme of escape. The second, exemplified by the likes of Bridge on the River Kwai or King Rat, were character-driven dramas which concentrated on more serious themes. Some, like The Great Escape, included elements of both types.Hart's War is another film which attempts to straddle both categories. In the first half it appears to be a psychological character drama concentrating on the theme of racism in the US military. This could have been an interesting subject. Black servicemen joined the Armed Forces to serve a country which treated them as second-class citizens in peacetime, only to find that they were treated as third-class citizens in wartime by their white brothers-in-arms, who often hated them more than they did the enemy.This first half is well done; we get to see that Bruce Willis (as McNamara) can play something other than Die Hard type action heroes and we get a good sense of the hardships suffered by the POWs at this time. With the war almost over, Germany was desperately short of food and virtually everything else, and feeding enemy prisoners was not a high priority of the Nazi leadership, especially as the winter of 1944\/45 was a particularly hard one. (I did, however, think it was unlikely that the German authorities would tolerate the prisoners putting on a show which openly mocked their country and the Nazi leadership).Unfortunately, the film goes downhill in the second half as it turns from a study of racism into an escape story. We learn, among other revelations, that McNamara knows full well that Scott is innocent, because he killed Bedford, an informer for the Germans, himself. Unknown to Hart and the other participants, the trial is merely an elaborate charade to cover up a plan by McNamara and a group of other prisoners to escape and destroy a nearby munitions plant, and McNamara seems unconcerned that this charade might result in the execution of an innocent man.This part of the film became unconvincing and difficult to follow; there is an attempt at a discussion of the meaning of duty and the ethics of war, but this is too muddled to be really enlightening. Hart's War is one of those films which starts strongly but finishes weakly, and in this it resembles the Robert Redford vehicle The Last Castle, another film from the early 2000s about soldiers in captivity.

For the life of me I'll never understand some of the negative reviews this film gets. Yes, Lewis had a pretty hard life full of violence, drugs, alcohol and various other items that really don't get shown here but the point of this movie wasn't to be a dark and disturbing movie about abuse but instead it was a movie about the glories of rock 'n roll and on that level the movie is a grand slam with great music and great performances. There's no denying that it appears the spirit of Lewis got into Quaid because he delivers a remarkable performance and it's a real shame that he didn't even get an Oscar-nomination. It's very hard for any actor to try and play a personality like Lewis but Quaid has no trouble and in my opinion delivers one of the best performances by an actor playing a real-life person. The spirit, fire and energy he brings to the film is just remarkable and each time I view the film the performance impresses me even more. He gets a strong supporting cast to work with him with Ryder also turning in a great performance as she really captures the spirit of a 13-year-old who gets caught up with his older cousin and his lifestyle. Stephen Tobolowsky and Trey Wilson are terrific as the Phillips brothers and we get Alec Baldwin in nice form playing Lewis' cousin Jimmy Swaggart. The movie features Lewis doing his own singing and piano playing and it's just so energetic that you'll have no problem shaking your leg and wanting to get up and dance. The soundtrack features all his classic tunes and they sound remarkably well and pack one terrific punch. Again, there were several very dark years in the career of Lewis but this film really doesn't look at them and I don't have a problem with it. Most music bios are full of the dark stuff so it's rather refreshing to see something that has fun with the subject matter. Yes, a dark film could have been made about the alcohol. Yes, a dark film could have made about the marriage. This film could have done a lot of things but what it does is deliver entertainment and an energy that is hard to top.

September is a dismal and quite deliberately humourless psychological drama about unrequited love; Radio Days, a period piece set in the New York of the late 1930s and early 1940s, is much lighter in tone. Indeed, it is also lighter than many of Woody's other comedies, substituting a nostalgic warmth for their frequent tone of neurotic or cynical angst.The film is sometimes described as autobiographical, although this is not quite accurate, even though Allen narrates the story himself. (He is never seen by the audience). The main character, Joe, is, like Allen, from a Jewish-American family, but rather older than Allen would have been at this period. (I doubt, for example, whether Woody, born in December 1935, has any memory of Orson Welles' famous radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds, broadcast in October 1938 when he was still under three years old). The title reflects the fact that the thirties and forties, in America as in many other countries, was regarded as the Golden Age of Radio before television replaced radio as the dominant medium. The film explores the ways in which the lives of young Joe and his family are influenced by the radio shows of the day; Joe is particularly inspired by an adventure serial about a superhero known as the Masked Avenger. There are also anecdotes about the radio stars of the day; showbiz urban legends of this type play an important part in other Woody films such as Broadway Danny Rose or Sweet and Lowdown. An example comes when a well-known radio presenter known for his womanising gets locked on the roof of a nightclub with Sally White, a cigarette girl with ambitions to become a radio star herself. (She eventually succeeds, despite an obvious lack of talent). There is, in fact, no single coherent plot line; the film rather consists of a series of stories and anecdotes, most of them amusing, occasionally sad as in the tale (based on a real-life incident) of the young girl who dies after falling into a well. Compared to the great Woody Allen films like Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters, made the previous year, Radio Days is a slight work. To call it slight, however, does not necessarily imply low quality; it is, for example, far better than September, a film which Allen clearly intended to be portentous and significant but which ended up as dull and depressing. I suspect that Allen's target audience for Radio Days was people of his own age group or slightly older (he would have been 49 in 1987) who wanted to look back nostalgically at the days of their youth; the film contains not only references to the radio shows of the thirties and forties but also much of the popular music of that era. I was not around during that period (I was not born until the sixties) so presumably do not qualify. Nevertheless, this was still a film which I enjoyed. Woody cast a number of actors who had appeared in his earlier films, such as Mia Farrow as Sally, Dianne Wiest as Joe's Aunt Bea whose search for love is a running theme, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels, Diane Keaton and Wallace Shawn, and gets good performances out of all of them. There are any number of amusing incidents; the burglars who accidentally win a big prize for their victims by answering a ringing telephone and correctly answering a question on Name That Tune; Joe's misappropriation (much to the disgust of his rabbi) of funds collected for Israel; his disappointment on discovering that the Masked Avenger is not the handsome hero he had imagined but is played by a short, bald actor; his search with his friends for enemy submarines after the outbreak of war. Despite the episodic nature of his material, Woody manages to make the film hang together as a whole as a warm, loving recollection of childhood. The nostalgic atmosphere is heightened by the lush, warm tones in which it is shot. This is the Golden Age of Radio, not necessarily as it was, but as it should have been.

September is a dismal and quite deliberately humourless psychological drama about unrequited love; Radio Days, a period piece set in the New York of the late 1930s and early 1940s, is much lighter in tone. Indeed, it is also lighter than many of Woody's other comedies, substituting a nostalgic warmth for their frequent tone of neurotic or cynical angst.The film is sometimes described as autobiographical, although this is not quite accurate, even though Allen narrates the story himself. (He is never seen by the audience). The main character, Joe, is, like Allen, from a Jewish-American family, but rather older than Allen would have been at this period. (I doubt, for example, whether Woody, born in December 1935, has any memory of Orson Welles' famous radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds, broadcast in October 1938 when he was still under three years old). The title reflects the fact that the thirties and forties, in America as in many other countries, was regarded as the Golden Age of Radio before television replaced radio as the dominant medium. The film explores the ways in which the lives of young Joe and his family are influenced by the radio shows of the day; Joe is particularly inspired by an adventure serial about a superhero known as the Masked Avenger. There are also anecdotes about the radio stars of the day; showbiz urban legends of this type play an important part in other Woody films such as Broadway Danny Rose or Sweet and Lowdown. An example comes when a well-known radio presenter known for his womanising gets locked on the roof of a nightclub with Sally White, a cigarette girl with ambitions to become a radio star herself. (She eventually succeeds, despite an obvious lack of talent). There is, in fact, no single coherent plot line; the film rather consists of a series of stories and anecdotes, most of them amusing, occasionally sad as in the tale (based on a real-life incident) of the young girl who dies after falling into a well. Compared to the great Woody Allen films like Manhattan or Hannah and Her Sisters, made the previous year, Radio Days is a slight work. To call it slight, however, does not necessarily imply low quality; it is, for example, far better than September, a film which Allen clearly intended to be portentous and significant but which ended up as dull and depressing. I suspect that Allen's target audience for Radio Days was people of his own age group or slightly older (he would have been 49 in 1987) who wanted to look back nostalgically at the days of their youth; the film contains not only references to the radio shows of the thirties and forties but also much of the popular music of that era. I was not around during that period (I was not born until the sixties) so presumably do not qualify. Nevertheless, this was still a film which I enjoyed. Woody cast a number of actors who had appeared in his earlier films, such as Mia Farrow as Sally, Dianne Wiest as Joe's Aunt Bea whose search for love is a running theme, Danny Aiello, Jeff Daniels, Diane Keaton and Wallace Shawn, and gets good performances out of all of them.

Along with another man (William Bendix) the three find themselves in a place that appears to be ran by a gambling hall owner (Brad Dexter) but no one is as they appear. From what I've read von Sternberg was fired towards the end of filming and it's obvious he wasn't overly thrilled with the material. In fact, I'd say everyone involved wasn't thrilled with the material because this is a pretty flat film that has very little going for it. Had I directed this then it wouldn't have been too bad but when you consider the talent involved one can't help but feel this is a major disappointment. I think the biggest problem is the screenplay, which is pretty bland and really doesn't have anything in it to make it stand out from the countless other genre films out at the time. We're introduced to the four main characters but none of them are very interesting. We learn that they're all running from something and we learn that none of them are who we think they are. There's a constant game going on with us trying to figure out who the cop is but in the end it doesn't matter because everything here is boring. Another problem is the cast who appear bored out of their minds. It seems the only effort is for Mitchum to act tough, Russell to look sexy and Bendix to throw in some comic relief. The screenplay really doesn't give the characters anything more to do than that but none of it works. Mitchum appears out of touch with everything going on and Russell doesn't add anything outside her looks. Bendix gets a couple funny moments but the majority of the time he isn't on screen. Dexter is a pretty bland bad guy but Gloria Grahame does a fine job in her small role. von Sternberg's direction is nearly impossible to see as he puts very little effort into the film.

Troughton has a good time as the mad\/eccentric\/genius alchemist, while Whiting owns the film with her delightfully over the top trip into evil villainy.It's presumed that newcomers to the movie know what to expect going into this one, whilst old fans revisiting it should hopefully find that it's holding up rather well considering the genre it sits in. Good old family fun that may be weak on story but strong on popcorn entertainment value. 7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"9 July 2010","score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis seen through the eyes of President assistant Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner who hands perfectly the role )as trusted confidante and with significance importance of Robert Kennedy ( Steven Culp who bears remarkable resemblance )and of course President John F .

This interesting film widely develops the Cuban Missile Crisis that was a confrontation between the Soviet Union, Cuba and the United States in October 1962, during the Cold War. The picture is packed with suspense , drama , historical deeds and is quite entertaining . It's correctly based on facts and the few sacrifices of accuracy are realized in the sense of of dramatic license . The motion picture is very well directed by Roger Donaldson who formerly worked with Costner in another suspenseful movie and also plenty of political intrigue titled ¨No way out (87) ¨ .Adding more details over the widely depicted on the movie the events happened of the following manner  In September 1962, the Cuban and Soviet governments began to surreptitiously build bases in Cuba for a number of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) with the ability to strike most of the continental United States. This action was subsequent to the 1958 deployment of Thor IRBMs in the UK and Jupiter IRBMs to Italy and Turkey in 1961; more than 100 U.S.-built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, a United States U-2 photo-reconnaissance plane captured photographic proof of Soviet missile bases under construction in Cuba.The ensuing crisis ranks with the Berlin Blockade as one of the major confrontations of the Cold War and is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a nuclear conflict .The US President ( Bruce Greenwood) , Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp ),State Secretary Robert McNamara ( Dylan Baker ) and his military staff ( Bill Smitrovich , Ed Lauter , James Karen , Len Cariou) and general Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway ) considered attacking Cuba via air and sea and settled on a quarantine of Cuba. The U.S. announced that it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile bases already under construction or completed in Cuba and remove all offensive weapons. The Kennedy administration held a slim hope that the Kremlin would agree to their demands, and expected a military confrontation. On the Soviet end, Nikita Khrushchev wrote Kennedy that his quarantine of navigation in international waters and air space to constitute an act of aggression propelling humankind into the abyss of a world nuclear-missile war. Fidel Castro encouraged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive first-strike nuclear attack on the U.S. The Soviets publicly balked at the U.S. demands, but in secret back-channel communications initiated a proposal to resolve the crisis. The confrontation ended on October 28, 1962 when President John F. Kennedy and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant reached an agreement with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to dismantle the offensive weapons and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for an agreement by the United States to never invade Cuba. The Soviets removed the missile systems and their support equipment, loading them onto eight Soviet ships from November 5&#x96;9. A month later, on December 5 and 6, the Soviet IL-28 bombers were loaded onto three Soviet ships and shipped back to Russia. The quarantine was formally ended previously on November 20, 1962. As a secret part of the agreement, all US-built Thor and Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Europe were deactivated by September 1963.The Cuban Missile Crisis spurred the creation of the Hotline Agreement and the Moscow-Washington hot line, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington .

Within 30 minutes I had figured pretty much everything about the movie, who's bad who's good, what's happening now and what's gonna happen next, predictable. In fact I was bored for the rest of the movie, it was not suspenseful and not thrilling. The good things that this movie did have going for it was excellent directing and a slightly confusing turn of events from one scene to the next, but again after the first 30 minutes it became very predictable. It was pretty unique, though i have seen a few movies that begin with the end first and work backwards. This is also done in Seinfeld, in the episode titled The Betrayal, which came out two years before. Overall, it is a movie worth seeing, though it is highly overrated.
