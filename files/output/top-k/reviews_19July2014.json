A student at Rushmore Academy falls in in love with his teacher,only to discover she's having an affair with his mentor.Best Performance Bill Murray ","genre":null},{"date":"19 July 2014","score":"","review":" Rushmore is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a very talented cast.For such a short movie it still manages to fit in a lot of character development,we learn so much about the characters played by Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray and Olivia Williams,when it was finished I didn't feel like we needed the know anymore.It is also beautifully directed by Wes Anderson,this is one of his very first films but he already proved that he is a unique and very talented writer and director.Rushmore is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama with some subtle comedy.
