The only Bond film I have liked even a little bit was the most recent Daniel Craig offering, Skyfall, but even it's two immediate preceding Craig offerings left me quite cold. So a film such as The Ipcress File is a very welcome change from all that stylised, macho schtick.It is worth noting that The Ipcress File with Michael Caine (who, admittedly, seems to portray no one else on screen but Michael Caine, though as I like him as an actor, that is no bad thing) was also a Sixties film, shot in 1965, but in its deviousness it is in a different league. The plot is pretty standard, but it is in its execution, by director Sidney Furie and his cinematographer Otto Heller (I had to look it up) is good to very good and, in my view at least, it has helped The Ipcress File stand the test of time.There is none of that utterly spurious spy glamour in Furie's (and writer Len Deighton's) spy world &#x96; the security services are just another department of the Civil Service for those it employs &#x96; and the whole film, when it counts, exudes menace, the lack of focus which is necessarily at the heart of spying &#x96; after all no on really knows what's going on.Forty years on it is salutary to reflect on what can be done with imaginative lighting and camera-work.

Whether it is or not, it's certainly the most unique. The story is not so focused on Rocky himself, but split between Rocky, the troubles of his son, and the rise of his protégé Tommy Gunn. That splintering as well as the change in format and the street fight ending are the biggest issues fans have with Rocky V. And of course, Tommy's mullet.When people fall in love with a film, or film series, the last thing they want is something different. Most filmgoers want to see the same thing over and over with only very modest changes in characterization and story. Rocky through Rocky IV all had roughly the same storyline Rocky wants to quit fighting, someone convinces him to fight, he trains hard, and finally he dukes it out in the ring with a bigger, stronger, larger-than-life opponent. Sometimes he wins, sometimes he loses. This is the Rocky film fans were used to seeing. Rocky V takes a new road entirely and shows our hero in a very different light.Adrian's brother Paulie is definitely the antithesis of Rocky in the films. He mistreats Adrian, drinks like a fish, and at times shows extreme jealousy and aggression toward Rocky. At the beginning of Rocky V, Paulie tops all past shenanigans by gambling away Rocky's fortune, forcing the family to return to the dingy, crime-riddled Philadelphia neighborhood where they started. Why does Rocky keep putting up with Paulie's bad behavior? We all love Rocky in part because his heart is bigger than his brain, but this time around the Italian Stallion seems denser than usual. While it is explained early on that Rocky has actually suffered some permanent brain damage, he is a little too oblivious here.During most of Rocky V, we just want to smack Rocky across the face and tell him to wake the heck up. We can sort of understand why he keeps Paulie under his roof despite his costly blunder, but what follows is nothing less than a string of bad decisions by a Rocky who's clearly asleep at the wheel. He ignores his son's obvious need for attention and guidance, he takes an ungrateful punk under his wing and lives vicariously through him, and he allows a slimy Don King-like boxing promoter walk all over him. Adrian, meanwhile, is wide awake but her repeated attempts to shake Rocky out of his fantasies are in vain because he just won't listen.Probably the biggest complaint fans have of Rocky V is the ending. All of the other five Rocky films spend their final fifteen minutes in the ring. Not this one. Instead, Rocky's former protégé Tommy challenges him to a bare-knuckle fist fight on the street. Since Tommy is technically the heavyweight champion now, and because the fight is relatively short and doesn't take place in the ring, it does feel somewhat unofficial. It makes sense that the audience would want to see Rocky retain his title one last time and that doesn't happen. Furthermore, the closing credits happen over a slideshow of memorable moments from the whole series, making the film feel even more final.Having said all of this, the truth is that Rocky V is still a pretty good movie. It may have some frustrating, even awkward scenes, but it's packed with real emotion and is overall well made. The best news of course is that Rocky V isn't the end anyway. Stallone wisely decided to make another film sixteen years later - the surprisingly good Rocky Baloboa - that both closely mimics the original and gives a proper closing to this spectacular series.I love the Rocky movies. Having recently bought the Heavyweight Collection on Blu-ray and watched them all chronologically, I have nothing but respect for Stallone and love for his series. Each entry in the Rocky series is at least good if not great and none of them stray too far from their origins. From that perspective, I'd go so far as to say the Rocky series is the most consistently good film series ever made.

It's not likely cricket will ever be truly understood by the wider American audience but it was the film which proved to be Hitchcock's big break, only one more to go before Hollywood and its opportunities and coffers beckoned.Young woman Margaret Lockwood on her way to be married befriends an elderly lady Miss Froy on a European train. The only trouble is after waking up she finds Miss Froy has vanished apparently along with the very memory of her existence; everyone is seemingly against her. However, dashing young Michael Redgrave gets interested and lends his exuberant support in trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. It's completely disarmingly quaint and I've always forgiven the convoluted childishness of the plot Lockwood & Redgrave are up against some more Johnny Foreigner's who will Stop At Nothing &#x96; except to kill them to shut them up and push them off the train and so end their problems; the greasy baddie must have awkwardly slid out of the trick cabinet silently behind them and could've polished them off and so end his problems; let's all get off the stationary train have a desultory gun battle from the woods to give the goodies a chance to get away and so end their problems. The model shots are indeed laughable, but perhaps more so by the same people who are in open-jawed admiration of todays reliance on incessant cgi cartoonery. Recognising these points and others has never lessened the entertainment value of this little movie for me, I gladly bought a ticket too to see this journey through to the end. Hitch quite rightly continually satirised British politicians' intelligence and integrity, and presciently has the only philandering appeaser on board shot dead. His usual voyeuristic attitude in the depiction of women was present, although on a side note I wonder even for 1938 did he seriously believe in Charters' statement People don't go around tying up nuns.Is it never considered why Redgrave and Lockwood would behave so childishly and so dense? Could it be because they merely more closely represented the ordinary person, untrammelled with the cynicism and seediness so beloved by all of us nowadays.

I watched this film when I was 13 and was bored to death, throughout the entire film I was wondering what all the hype was about, then I was wondering what rosebud meant, it was listed #1 on rotten tomatoes and I was confused, was it something I missed? I watched Steven spiel bergs masterpiece black and white film Schneider's list and I was mesmerized, I sat down and rematches the film for a second time, and liked it so much I watched it a third, almost a year later I have seen it almost 10 times. Why is Orion Welles considered one of the greatest directors in the world? I don't know either, but all I know is if anyone made Kane as their debut film today, they would within the likes of Charles Chaplin, Nolan, Spielberg, Hitchcock, Scorsese, Clint Eastwood even woody Allen.

The movie differs from the book because of The Hays Code, meaning that it had to be dumbed down. But nevertheless, the movie is still an excellent movie all the same. Murder, My Sweet is a very effective mystery film, featuring a great performance from Dick Powell as Raymond Chandler's legendary detective, Philip Marlowe. Considering the fact that I like mystery films, especially the ones from the 1930's, 1940's, and even into the 1950's, and the fact that I am also quite interested in the films based on the works of Raymond Chandler, I decided to watch this movie. I enjoyed this movie very much, it's tense, it's compelling, and not to mention it's well acted, directed, and written. Edward Dmytryk did very good work directing this movie. With his direction, and with the cast's performances, as well as with the script, we ended up receiving a fine mystery film that certainly does somebody like Raymond Chandler proud.Dick Powell does a fine job at playing Philip Marlowe. His best moment in my opinion was the sequence when he was drugged. The way that Powell handles those scenes are really something to talk about, as it's not like his earlier films (he was known mostly for his roles in musical films and the like), and it also shows that he truly was a talented actor who could play a variety of roles. Claire Trevor does good in her dual roles as Mrs.Helen Grayle aka Velma Valento. Anne Shirley, Otto Kruger and Mike Mazurki also do good jobs with their roles. However, as you might have guessed, Dick Powell gave the best performance in the movie, and one of his best performances of his entire career for that matter. Everyone did good work, but Powell stole the show, he did Chandler proud in his turn as Philip Marlowe.Out of all of the Philip Marlow movies, I would have to say that this one is one of the best. Basically, if you are into murder mystery films, as well as detective films, not to mention the works of Raymond Chandler, then the chances of you enjoying this movie are quite good, as like I said, it definitely does Raymond Chandler proud. This is one mystery film that will have you filled with anticipation as you wonder what will happen next. On a side note, I heard a few people say that they didn't care much for the ending of the movie. But in my opinion, there wasn't anything wrong with the ending, and hey, like I said, because of The Hays Code, there was a lot from the book that had to be dumbed down for the movie.

All this is even truer of Pulp Fiction. This movie is violent, completely off the wall, often downright bizarre, and one of the best films I have ever watched. It contains some of the deepest, funniest, and most realistic dialog put on film, features a highly talented ensemble cast, and manages to be totally original while at the same time paying homage to the best (or at least hippest) pieces of twentieth century pop culture.I won't get into the standard plot summary because there is no way to summarize it. In fact, you could say there is no one plot, but rather several parallel ones that briefly intersect. And none of this is in any particular order. You really don't have any idea what this movie is about until it's over, and even then you wouldn't be able to explain it to someone else. Suffice it to that Pulp fiction revolves around the interactions of one of LA's top gangsters (Ving Rhames), his girlfriend (Uma Thurman), his two best hit men (John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson), their drug dealer (Eric Stoltz) a washed up boxer (Bruce Willis), a pair of small time thieves (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer), and a briefcase of great value and unknown contents.In any case, the plot isn't what's important. It merely serves as a vehicle for blood drenched shootouts and fight scenes, dance offs, pop cultural asides, and fascinating conversations. The best known of these is of course the cheeseburger scene, in which Vince and Jules (Travolta and Jackson's characters) discuss the French terms for McDonald's items while driving through a run-down section of LA. On the face of it, their dialog may seem pointless, or lightweight, but that's exactly what's brilliant about it. From their conversation, you'd never guess that they're on their way to kill someone. They're just a couple of buds chatting it up. They could be going to dinner or a movie premier. But then they step out of the car, remove their guns from the trunk, and become all business. The sudden transition from cheeseburgers to contract killings is abrupt, completely unexpected, and absolutely brilliant.At other times, even in the wackiest settings, the dialog borders on the profound. Take for instance Jackson's Old Testament spiel before killing someone. Ezekiel 2517 would surely be the most awesome verse in the Bible if it weren't cobbled together from three different verses. Or take Travolta and Thurman's conversation at Jackrabbit Slim's. They're sitting in a booth shaped like a Cadillac, being waited on by a Buddy Holly look alike, but they manage to achieve fairly deep insight into the awkwardness and discomfort we all feel when getting to know someone. To quote, Why do we feel it's necessary to talk about bull**** to be comfortable. But before we're given too much time to ponder such matters, the film makes another abrupt turn, giving us an overdose scene that is both shocking and hysterical. It's like a keystone cops routine with a woman's life in the balance, if you can imagine such a thing. This combination of the horrifying and the hilarious is of course one of the trademarks of Terantino's work. A similar dynamic is at work in the entire 'Bonnie Situation' section, in which Terantino makes an extended appearance and gets what might be the Pulp Fiction's best line. And don't even get me started on the 'Bring out the gimp' scene.Besides the graphic violence and the fair amount of sexual content, some of which is thankfully only implied, language is also a big part of the movie's shock value. The people in this movie use more profanity than a high school freshman trying too hard to establish street cred. I lost count of the F-bombs somewhere around 100, and I wasn't even at the halfway point. Yet not a single utterance ever seems unnecessary or added just to shock. Instead, we get the feeling that this is just how these people talk, and why wouldn't they, given their lines of work. And in many cases the screenplay uses profanity to great comic effect, as with the aforementioned Terantino delivered line, which derives its impact from a certain racial epitaph so charged that I dare not say it.Honestly, I'm not sure that anything I write can do justice to this movie. Few films have ever been as original, oddball, or memorable as Pulp Fiction. No other movie in the last twenty years has had the same impact on popular culture or spawned as many imitators. Pulp Fiction is to 70's exploitation films what Indiana Jones is to the pulp serials of the 30's and 40's.

Roberts is kidnapped by Gandolfini as leverage so that Pitt will do as he is supposed to without any attempt to achieve financial gain for himself. What happens between Gandolfini and Roberts is actually the true heart and soul of the film because they learn a lot about themselves through the constant appraisal of her relationship with Pitt. In a second viewing of the film (the first was so agonizing I hadn't watched this in thirteen years), I realized that if Pitt and Roberts, considering the characters they are trapped in, had been on screen any longer than necessary, the experience would have been even more abrasive than it already turned out to be. Roberts can be so likable when sharing time with Gandolfini and an absolute pariah when with Pitt, I thought I was watching two different characters on screen. Pitt works the aw shucks, I'm just trying to keep from being killed and get the gun to where it needs to go part throughout, taking a lot of frustrating developments (that Balaban wanted him dead, that his car is stolen, that a cop takes the gun, that he must tolerate locals and their firecrackers, guns going off in the air, the unfortunate accidental death of Margolese' grandson thanks to the celebration that Pitt is annoyed by, a passport swap accident, interference in the mission of the gun) and holding onto his wits, even after Roberts seems to be okay and back with him. The constant bickering between Roberts and Pitt, seemingly presented as a charming humorous state of affairs in how they spend most of their time together, really gets old fast. Gandolfini's talk with Roberts before meeting Pitt about never giving up on love even when it appears enough is enough is probably one of the best (if it wasn't for Hackman's lone scene about the Mexican's importance) scenes in the film. The violence that does happen in the film is primarily just an example of the nature of Pitt's obligation to gangsters (he is a lousy driver and hit Margolese' car which was carrying a live body in the trunk, leading to Margolese' arrest!), and how it is bound to happen as the Mexican is a desirable artifact perhaps worth quite a pretty penny. Balaban deadpans in the same league as Bill Murray so his stone cold face doling out orders and insults gives him a great villain for the film here. A mixed bag, in my opinion, that could have been better if Pitt and Roberts been more compatible and less combative as a couple in the film. The gun's back story is amusingly presented in differing ways by each person who tells it to Pitt, not particularly knowledgeable in the gun's history but just wanting his situation to be over.

Pitt works the aw shucks, I'm just trying to keep from being killed and get the gun to where it needs to go part throughout, taking a lot of frustrating developments (that Balaban wanted him dead, that his car is stolen, that a cop takes the gun, that he must tolerate locals and their firecrackers, guns going off in the air, the unfortunate accidental death of Margolese' grandson thanks to the celebration that Pitt is annoyed by, a passport swap accident, interference in the mission of the gun) and holding onto his wits, even after Roberts seems to be okay and back with him. The constant bickering between Roberts and Pitt, seemingly presented as a charming humorous state of affairs in how they spend most of their time together, really gets old fast. Gandolfini's talk with Roberts before meeting Pitt about never giving up on love even when it appears enough is enough is probably one of the best (if it wasn't for Hackman's lone scene about the Mexican's importance) scenes in the film. The violence that does happen in the film is primarily just an example of the nature of Pitt's obligation to gangsters (he is a lousy driver and hit Margolese' car which was carrying a live body in the trunk, leading to Margolese' arrest!), and how it is bound to happen as the Mexican is a desirable artifact perhaps worth quite a pretty penny. Balaban deadpans in the same league as Bill Murray so his stone cold face doling out orders and insults gives him a great villain for the film here. A mixed bag, in my opinion, that could have been better if Pitt and Roberts been more compatible and less combative as a couple in the film. The gun's back story is amusingly presented in differing ways by each person who tells it to Pitt, not particularly knowledgeable in the gun's history but just wanting his situation to be over. Gandolfini and Roberts in the diner discussing his sexual orientation is sweet.

For at least one generation, the film served as a major gateway drug to the larger world of anime, with promises of pulpy and unbridled violence that normal American animation would never dare divulge in (and the cult of Akira thrived well on video tape bootlegs, before the advent of optical media). If you are looking for animation with such elements as killer biker gangs, military takeovers, out-of-control psychic warfare, and mass destruction galore, then there's no better place to start than with Akira.The film begins and ends with a bang...literally. Set in the scuzzy streets of NeoTokyo, some 30 years after a cataclysmic explosion that heralded the coming of World War III, the film immediately kicks off with a thrilling biker gang chase. When one of the gang members is captured by the military and experimented on, unlocking latent psychic powers. all hell continues to break loose. Tetsuo's psychic rampage leaves nothing but awe in its wake, as he stops tanks shells and laser beams in the air, destroys entire city blocks, and sends vehicles careening out of control. It all builds up to a huge showdown in the stadium, where evolution suddenly goes into overdrive, and the fate of the world is suddenly at stake.The film is fast and densely-packed with loads of well-staged action setpieces. Even when things aren't blowing up, the visuals are superbly-drawn, and often serve to express more to the story. However, even I'll admit that the experience hasn't always been that endearing. The film felt convoluted and stiff at first glance, but through repeat viewings (and after reading the original manga), I grew to connect much deeper to the story and characters.When comparing the story to its source material, there is some missed potential; the Akira manga is a huge saga with numerous subplots and characters that would require more movies (or maybe an anime series) to fully cover. Katsuhiro Otomo, however, takes his own story and completely remixes it for the film, paring down the whole story and cutting out whole characters to make it all fit in a two-hour time frame. Even though the full story of Akira would be grand to see on the big screen, this film proves that less is more. The movie is entirely set in NeoTokyo, and it methodically reveals all the characters and ideas it needs to to make sense. I believe it actually handles all of this much better than the manga did, where characters seemed to bump into each other at random and then go on the run; in the movie, the characters receive a more pronounced introduction and are gradually tied into the various plots involving military coups, secret experiments, and all-out destruction. The film squeezes in as much characterization as it can; more screen time for everybody would be welcome, but there's just enough to them to make them easy to understand. The plot seems dense with all the different characters and concepts it has to juggle, but the film strings it all together aptly to make all the twists and themes feel natural. Themes of power - the best and worst of it - resonates throughout the entire picture.Made with a larger-than-average budget, the film boasts spectacular animation quality. Every scene is laden with rich, highly-detailed, and brilliantly-colored artwork. Action moves very smoothly. Even character movements and lip flapping is very well-done (unlike other anime films, Akira is pre-scored, with dialogue recorded before the animation, allowing them to animate mouth movements to match the voices). A few computer effects are used in the film, and generally match up with the film well. Designs for all the settings, characters, costumes, vehicles, and things are really cool. Voice acting can be a hit or a miss, depending on what version you see. The Japanese dubbing is decent. There are two different American dubs available, and they're both cheesy and over-the-top in their own right. Writing is pretty well-balanced; exposition is used to condense some parts of the plot and make it more accessible to audiences, but it doesn't sacrifice much, and most lines are punchy and good. Sound design is pretty cool. The music score contains some of the weirdest music I've ever heard, but it's strangely fitting, and perhaps a little catchy.Even though it seemed odd at first, I've grown to love Akira and its dystopian world of warring bikers and psychics. Its style and levels of superpowered action inspired more films and shows in the medium, and it would inspire me (and others like me) to explore more of the exciting world of anime. Even on its own merits, it has always been a thrilling, edgy, and inspiring experience unlike any other. If you're open to watching this type of animation, it's recommended watching at least once for mature audiences.5\/5 (Entertainment Perfect | Story Good | Film Perfect) ","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" As with anybody else exploring Japanese animation for the first time, Akira was one of the first titles that I ran across, for it represents one of the most popular, most innovative, and most explosive experiences committed to the medium.

Soon they encounter some of his hired henchman, led by James Caan. With Taye Diggs, vet Geoffrey Lewis, and Nicky Katt as those either getting caught in the crossfire or offering fire towards Phillippe and Del Toro. Caan's being the father to Lewis adds a bit of gravitas to the gunfight, while Phillippe and Del Toro always attempting to make that big score against him proves to be the great question of will they or won't they? Way of the Gun is a guns-a-blazing shoot 'em up with credible car chases and a really bonafide western standoff at the end with the film's anti-heroes unloading ammunition at Caan and company with a brunt of the damage inflicted on the brothel itself. Not to be outdone, there is plentiful bloodshed and bodies are most certainly torn apart by some of the bullets that don't destroy the walls and shutters. Phillippe and Del Toro most definitely don't escape the film unscathed, and Caan's not even receiving one bullet during the whole affair, considering all the bullets that fire in all directions I found rather clever. There are really few characters in the movie to side with or care about, so Way of the Gun rests almost exclusively on its gunplay which is in abundance and full display. Del Toro is his usual quirky self while Phillippe is so intense he could crack walnuts between his ass cheeks. Caan is&#x85;well&#x85;Caan, so if you like him then here he is. Lewis plays her part relatively straight as the unfortunate barter item as bullets go off all around her. Dyllan Kussman as the surgeon burdened with trying to monitor Lewis' health and deliver the child if needed is like a fawn trapped in a dangerous forest surrounded by bears. I like the way the gunfights are staged and how these men shoot aimlessly mostly, rarely hitting their targets until a mistake of revealing themselves at the wrong time results in their demise. Diggs' fate in particular is rather startling. Phillippe's dive into a dried-up water fountain filled with broken bottles verifies the unpredictable nature of getting in a gunfight in the middle of nowhere when circumstances can rise against you. The draw is given a bit of irony as the film's typical anti-hero doesn't have any bullets left and, as a result, is put down due to his wasted ammo while the opposition has a seat comfortably.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"10 January 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a man stuck in a rut and that rut is one that occupies childlike sensibilities, an inability to adapt to change, and a lack of understanding, or effort to understand, the women in his life. Rob has yet to really come of age and has been stagnant in his ability to mature and grow up, sticking to what he knows in the most primal sense. He runs a record store with his friends Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), spending most of his days engaging in meaningless conversations about which musicians are better than other musicians, what records have a long-lasting impact over others, and so on, almost as if their musical elitism predated the kind you see in the same place where this film is set, Chicago.Rob has just gone through a breakup with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a woman he clearly cared about but had no idea how to act on his feelings in a way that pleased her in a significant manner. She was troubled by his childishness and he was unwilling to change for the better. Depressed and distraught, finally questioning what role he had to play in his breakups, Rob cycles through five of his old romantic partners to see if there's some sort of consistent screw-up he is faced with in all his relationships.High Fidelity works instantly because of Cusack's character and character acting abilities. He embodies Rob Gordon, who we grow to find likable at times, mostly thanks to his quick-witted mannerisms and ability to keep a conversation moving, and incorrigible at others, for his inability to realize that he is his own worst enemy. Cusack's cool guy approach to the material, complete with first-person narration and frequently employed witticisms, make him nonetheless an interesting protagonist because you can fault him and appreciate him for many reasons, but the main one is that he's human. Louiso and Black work well as the side characters here, in addition, particularly Luiso, who is given some of the funniest lines of the picture. Jack Black is your typical Jack Black character here, but ostensibly boasting more controlled chaos than outright chaos here (either that or his craziness gels well enough with Cusack's coolness that typical results aren't as blatant).Director Stephen Frears and the quartet of writers at hand here (Cusack himself, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and Scott Rosenberg) are commendable because they understand the way males think. If a woman goes through a breakup, as least from what I've seen from my female friends and based off knowledge from films I have seen, she often reevaluates herself, checking herself with her friends to see what could've possibly gone wrong and if she had anything to do with the relationship's demise. Men, from what I've seen from my male friends and other films I have seen, are almost too prideful for that sort of thing, rarely showing too much emotion and holding it in for a rainy day. We move on to hooking up, letting our feelings out to only our closest friends, and simply try to find another woman who will provide us not with the same kind of love but the same feelings as the previous gal did.Of course I'm speaking in rampant generalities here; the heart of my argument is that so is Frears and his writers. They're evaluating the character based on terms typical of the male psyche, and are effective in at least portraying a pragmatic situation for a character who has been through a plethora of rough breakups. High Fidelity also features the soundtrack from heaven to compliment our leads characters' musical elitism that works to bring life to a screenplay that could've either showed its worn qualities or lessened in impact over time. However, thanks to Cusack as the center of the film, complimented by two other effective actors, the film stands strong and offers us a glimpse into the mind of a male during one of the most vulnerable times in his life.Starring John Cusack, Jack Black, Todd Louiso, and Iben Hejejle. Directed by Stephen Frears. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is a man stuck in a rut and that rut is one that occupies childlike sensibilities, an inability to adapt to change, and a lack of understanding, or effort to understand, the women in his life. Rob has yet to really come of age and has been stagnant in his ability to mature and grow up, sticking to what he knows in the most primal sense. He runs a record store with his friends Dick (Todd Louiso) and Barry (Jack Black), spending most of his days engaging in meaningless conversations about which musicians are better than other musicians, what records have a long-lasting impact over others, and so on, almost as if their musical elitism predated the kind you see in the same place where this film is set, Chicago.Rob has just gone through a breakup with Laura (Iben Hjejle), a woman he clearly cared about but had no idea how to act on his feelings in a way that pleased her in a significant manner. She was troubled by his childishness and he was unwilling to change for the better. Depressed and distraught, finally questioning what role he had to play in his breakups, Rob cycles through five of his old romantic partners to see if there's some sort of consistent screw-up he is faced with in all his relationships.High Fidelity works instantly because of Cusack's character and character acting abilities. He embodies Rob Gordon, who we grow to find likable at times, mostly thanks to his quick-witted mannerisms and ability to keep a conversation moving, and incorrigible at others, for his inability to realize that he is his own worst enemy. Cusack's cool guy approach to the material, complete with first-person narration and frequently employed witticisms, make him nonetheless an interesting protagonist because you can fault him and appreciate him for many reasons, but the main one is that he's human. Louiso and Black work well as the side characters here, in addition, particularly Luiso, who is given some of the funniest lines of the picture. Jack Black is your typical Jack Black character here, but ostensibly boasting more controlled chaos than outright chaos here (either that or his craziness gels well enough with Cusack's coolness that typical results aren't as blatant).Director Stephen Frears and the quartet of writers at hand here (Cusack himself, D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and Scott Rosenberg) are commendable because they understand the way males think. If a woman goes through a breakup, as least from what I've seen from my female friends and based off knowledge from films I have seen, she often reevaluates herself, checking herself with her friends to see what could've possibly gone wrong and if she had anything to do with the relationship's demise. Men, from what I've seen from my male friends and other films I have seen, are almost too prideful for that sort of thing, rarely showing too much emotion and holding it in for a rainy day. We move on to hooking up, letting our feelings out to only our closest friends, and simply try to find another woman who will provide us not with the same kind of love but the same feelings as the previous gal did.Of course I'm speaking in rampant generalities here; the heart of my argument is that so is Frears and his writers. They're evaluating the character based on terms typical of the male psyche, and are effective in at least portraying a pragmatic situation for a character who has been through a plethora of rough breakups. High Fidelity also features the soundtrack from heaven to compliment our leads characters' musical elitism that works to bring life to a screenplay that could've either showed its worn qualities or lessened in impact over time.

Surely movies have been made in B\/W after 1962, but I can't think of anyone in particular this famous. Psycho, for instance, was released in 1960.Anyhow, this is a true gem, and there's nothing that I'd like to add to it, or remove.Robert Mitchum was magnificent in Cape Fear indeed, he gave life to the odd, inscrutable character of Max Cady. Compare his Max Cady to Lee Marvin's Walker in Point Blank, another impeccable hard boiled 60s thriller (although in color). Marvin's protagonist doesn't really seem to possess any feelings other than Vengeance. Cady shows all kinds of emotion anger, amusement, hate, self-pity, desire, perhaps even love (though I doubt that). The remake of 1991 is not my favorite, and I suspect that Scorsese simply wanted to cast DeNiro in yet a powerful role. In my opinion, DeNiro didn't make it as Mitchum had already been there. (I also tend to think of DeNiro fans as admirers of greasy Mafiosi clichés in one scene in the 1991 version, DeNiro's Cady even tuned in some Italian opera while driving his automobile. Not exactly what Mitchum's Cady would have thought of doing...) Cape Fear of 1962 had a sub motive dealing with apparent shortcomings of the law, that even the ex convicts have rights, and so on. The same motive appears later in the Dirty Harry series. Cape Fear of 1991 blurred all this with religion, and much of the point with the setting, copied from the original, was lost. While Mitchum's Cady is believable as the shrewd legal book reading bum, DeNiro's Cady barely appears to be literate.Other reviewers on IMDb have commented on the Hitchcockian style of this thriller. Well, you can see that this was not directed by Hitchcock. No offense intended here, though.
