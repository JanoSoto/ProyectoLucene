[{"date":"19 October 1999","score":"","review":"  The story of the 'wide-eyed' social servant looking for the opportunity to make things better for the people has been done several times over.  What makes the film Election stand out is that the characters in this story don't make it as far as the White House, the Senate or even City Hall.  The election race in this story is for high school president.Matthew Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a political science teacher at Carver High.  He oversees the electoral process of which Tracey Flick (played wonderfully by Reese Withersppon) is the only candidate.  Tracey fits somewhere on the spectrum between Marcia Brady and Atilla the Hun. She is perky and pretty, but she is also self serving and far too ambitious for a respectable midwestern girl.  Tracey isn't popular at school but this doesn't seem to bother her.  We learn early on that even a nasty little sex scandal can't hold her back.One can assume that McAllister doesn't like Tracey very much, and one can see that he doesn't trust her.  He recruits Paul Metzler, (Chris Klein) into the race for presidency.  A former football hero, Paul's sports career came crashing to an end in a skiing accident.  It seems like Paul would be a shoe-in, not only for his heroism, but also because people feel bad that he is a has-been.The story moves along very quickly.  Subplots are cracked open at every turn.  Paul's sister, Tammy (played by Jessica Campbell) claims she is not a lesbian, but rather, she just happens to be attracted to women.  When Paul inadvertantly steals her current girlfirend, she retaliates by running against him for president.The characters are constantly struggling to deny their true feelings, in favor of the supposed high road.  McAllister knows that Paul's victory would be based on a popularity contest, but he rationalizes that this is best for the school and even for Tracey.  Tracey is furious about Paul's last minute decision to run against her, but she assures herself that this challenge is a good thing.Broderick stepping into a classroom (this time as a teacher) is reminiscient of the classic film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  In several scenes he asks a question of his students.  While he waits patiently for a student to respond (of course Tracey's hand is up all the time, much to his discomfort) I kept waiting for him to utter the line Anyone?  Anyone?Tracey Flick emerges as a new kind of villain.  She is a career-hungry student not to be messed with for she knows the game.  While McAllister dislikes her, he treads lightly for she is dangerous, and any misunderstanding could be career limiting.  Flick believes in her own self-righteousness, and anyone who might disagree cannot be a good person. As she states at the start of the film, 'this would never have happened' if McAllister didn't 'get involved.'While the character of Paul was well played, it remains for me the only unoriginal aspect of the film.  The football jock who runs for class president claiming he should be elected since everyone considers him 'well proportioned', is clever, but it has been done before.  Even cut down to size by a broken leg, the dumb jock feeling sorry for himself (but still getting by with the babes) isn't  memorable.On the other hand, the character of Tammy, Paul's sister, is something we haven't seen before.  Like her brother, Tammy chases after the girls. Unlike her brother, she is smart, bitter and hugely unpopular.  Her campaign slogan I'm not going to do anything for you.' sums up her anger.Election is quirky little dark comedy.  This film isn't for all tastes.

It somehow manages to come up with a partially original idea, but overpowers it with a desperate gimmick--which is the only thing giving the movie a tart of life. Regardless of how unique the movie's concept feels, it still is a philosophy that simply doesn't work.The film opens by introducing an unusual family to us; the Tates. There is the smiling but way overprotective mother, who seems quite unhappy with herself and family, Elizabeth, and her husband, the plain but sensible realist named Radley. Their children, now young adults, are somewhat on the uncommon side. First we have Caroline and Heather, an overworked underachiever and a homosexual with her lover named Michelle. Then there is Carla, a mentally retarded sibling who is very tired of her mother bossing her around all the time, and wants independence precariously.Carla is the center of the film's story. Her lust for freedom from her mother is the motive that drives the production. However, where can a movie go when the driving force is all but a desire? Easy--detail the struggle for a romantic partner. What more would make Elizabeth more concerned? Carla meets a nice young man of her mental abilities at a local school in which she is trying to pass a course on computers. His name is Daniel McMahon. Funny how his past life isn't ever examined, but Carla's looked at through a microscope. This is because of the Daniel character being used as a plot device rather than an actual character. Shame really, for there are many likable qualities about him.The movie is shameless in using the mentally retarded characters as a motive for being so bull-headed. The filmmakers obviously take our intelligence as moviegoers quite dimwitted. They try so hard to pound the concepts behind the two retarded character's into our heads it's migraine-inducing. The film forces us to back away by showing scenes that consist of the following during some sort of festival, Carla somehow manages to make herself look like a fool by interrupting a speech for silly reasons and releasing masses of animals into the crowd causing chaos; a psychologist of Carla's describes her  feelings and emotions to us (this is the story's development of the character) with Elizabeth, through explicit and detailed terms. This only proves to us once again that it is always better to show, not tell. As Daniel and Carla watch the seduction scene from The Graduate, Carla and Daniel discus sexual matters between each other in laughable context; Elizabeth is trying to teach her daughter, Carla, how to dance, but Carla's being dense and does a dirty dancing routine, turning this otherwise charming sequence into another discouraging moment in the film.I can't really say that I ever did care about the characters in The Other Sister, even the title refers to someone insignificant. I'm not quite sure what the flashback scenes in the opening are supposed to do--take us into the past and meet the characters earlier in their existence, maybe? It is almost as if the writers were worried that we wouldn't sympathize with Carla, but if a character is well written we'll empathize with them, regardless of the background or childhood.Another problem I had with the movie is its subtext so outwardly blooming. You see, as I have said, it is much more effective to express a character's feelings through actions rather than convenient conversations. Subtext is the dialogue that explains a character's inner affections. Here are a few examples of how bare naked subtext is used to develop the emotional aspect of Elizabeth, Carla's mother(1) I fell like I'm the mother of a dedicated underachiever, a gay workaholic, and Carla, who thinks she can conquer the whole terrifying world that we live in... (2) Sometimes I think there are better mothers in the world that are better equipped to handle Carla.There are some good qualities in this romantic drama, however. For once, the father isn't the protagonist; the family member causing the tension for others. In fact, the father of Carla, Radley, is quite easy going--it's the mother, Elizabeth, who gives the characters a hard time with life. What a terrific breeze of fresh air. And Elizabeth is very well acted by Diane Keaton, as is Radley by Tom Skerritt. They both create a believable and effect portrayal of their characters. Too bad I can't say that about the actors behind Daniel and Carla, who are played by Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi. They are convincing but mildly exaggerated. The romantic chemistry between them is a given, simply because we don't know them personally--therefore do not know any better than to like them as a couple.Then again, however, the film throws in the typical break up sequence in the prime of Carla's and Daniel's relationships--this one worse than most. And the sisters of Carla are only present to jumble several unneeded emotions. Not to mention the overly long running time in which the film spends by continuously tossing content in the hodgepodge that the filmmakers call a script, which overwhelm the audience even more.Overall, Gary Marshal's The Other Sister is a fair presentation of a bad ideal. I feel obligated to compare the content of this movie's failure to the also defective Mystery Men, released this summer. At least Mystery Men was a good attempt at a bad idea, though. That is more then I can say about The Other Sister.Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures.

And Elizabeth is very well acted by Diane Keaton, as is Radley by Tom Skerritt. They both create a believable and effect portrayal of their characters. Too bad I can't say that about the actors behind Daniel and Carla, who are played by Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi. They are convincing but mildly exaggerated. The romantic chemistry between them is a given, simply because we don't know them personally--therefore do not know any better than to like them as a couple.Then again, however, the film throws in the typical break up sequence in the prime of Carla's and Daniel's relationships--this one worse than most. And the sisters of Carla are only present to jumble several unneeded emotions. Not to mention the overly long running time in which the film spends by continuously tossing content in the hodgepodge that the filmmakers call a script, which overwhelm the audience even more.Overall, Gary Marshal's The Other Sister is a fair presentation of a bad ideal. I feel obligated to compare the content of this movie's failure to the also defective Mystery Men, released this summer. At least Mystery Men was a good attempt at a bad idea, though.

It somehow manages to come up with a partially original idea, but overpowers it with a desperate gimmick--which is the only thing giving the movie a tart of life. Regardless of how unique the movie's concept feels, it still is a philosophy that simply doesn't work.The film opens by introducing an unusual family to us; the Tates. There is the smiling but way overprotective mother, who seems quite unhappy with herself and family, Elizabeth, and her husband, the plain but sensible realist named Radley. Their children, now young adults, are somewhat on the uncommon side. First we have Caroline and Heather, an overworked underachiever and a homosexual with her lover named Michelle. Then there is Carla, a mentally retarded sibling who is very tired of her mother bossing her around all the time, and wants independence precariously.Carla is the center of the film's story. Her lust for freedom from her mother is the motive that drives the production. However, where can a movie go when the driving force is all but a desire? Easy--detail the struggle for a romantic partner. What more would make Elizabeth more concerned? Carla meets a nice young man of her mental abilities at a local school in which she is trying to pass a course on computers. His name is Daniel McMahon. Funny how his past life isn't ever examined, but Carla's looked at through a microscope. This is because of the Daniel character being used as a plot device rather than an actual character. Shame really, for there are many likable qualities about him.The movie is shameless in using the mentally retarded characters as a motive for being so bull-headed. The filmmakers obviously take our intelligence as moviegoers quite dimwitted. They try so hard to pound the concepts behind the two retarded character's into our heads it's migraine-inducing. The film forces us to back away by showing scenes that consist of the following during some sort of festival, Carla somehow manages to make herself look like a fool by interrupting a speech for silly reasons and releasing masses of animals into the crowd causing chaos; a psychologist of Carla's describes her  feelings and emotions to us (this is the story's development of the character) with Elizabeth, through explicit and detailed terms. This only proves to us once again that it is always better to show, not tell. As Daniel and Carla watch the seduction scene from The Graduate, Carla and Daniel discus sexual matters between each other in laughable context; Elizabeth is trying to teach her daughter, Carla, how to dance, but Carla's being dense and does a dirty dancing routine, turning this otherwise charming sequence into another discouraging moment in the film.I can't really say that I ever did care about the characters in The Other Sister, even the title refers to someone insignificant. I'm not quite sure what the flashback scenes in the opening are supposed to do--take us into the past and meet the characters earlier in their existence, maybe? It is almost as if the writers were worried that we wouldn't sympathize with Carla, but if a character is well written we'll empathize with them, regardless of the background or childhood.Another problem I had with the movie is its subtext so outwardly blooming. You see, as I have said, it is much more effective to express a character's feelings through actions rather than convenient conversations. Subtext is the dialogue that explains a character's inner affections. Here are a few examples of how bare naked subtext is used to develop the emotional aspect of Elizabeth, Carla's mother(1) I fell like I'm the mother of a dedicated underachiever, a gay workaholic, and Carla, who thinks she can conquer the whole terrifying world that we live in... (2) Sometimes I think there are better mothers in the world that are better equipped to handle Carla.There are some good qualities in this romantic drama, however. For once, the father isn't the protagonist; the family member causing the tension for others. In fact, the father of Carla, Radley, is quite easy going--it's the mother, Elizabeth, who gives the characters a hard time with life. What a terrific breeze of fresh air.

The film I had waited 16 years for didn't change me. It didn't solve all my problems, nor did it heal my troubled soul. It wasn't until I saw it for a second time, a few hours later, that I began to see what made this movie so special...(WARNING - small spoilers ahead)Now, everyone can wail and whine over how annoying Jar-Jar was, how wooden some of the acting was, how little Darth Maul had to say, etc, but maybe I am one of the few ones who can truly appreciate the true beauty of this film.First of all, the podrace is fantastic. Mr. Lucas has taken the speeder bike chase from Jedi, the asteroid field sequence from Empire, and the final Death Star battle from ANH, and outdone all of them with the 15 minutes or so of the race.The lightsaber fights ? Stunning. You can really see the difference between what Kenobi was when he was younger (headstrong, and a little too cocky), to what he becomes (a slower, yet more cautious warrior, much like Qui-Gon is.) It will be interesting to track Kenobi's progress in the future prequels.Jar-Jar, although mildly annoying, grew on me pretty quick, and I also grew to appreciate what he brought to the film, and those people who want him dead, I only need to remind you of all the other annoyances of the Star Wars universe (ie. Chewbacca, C3PO, The Ewoks, Salacious Crumb, etc.) It wouldn't be Star Wars without them. I'm so glad George decided to keep him for the other films.Darth Maul - easily the coolest villain to pop up on the big screen since Vader. He may not say much, but when you can do what he does, words don't seem to matter. He also has the (two) best on-screen entrance(s) in all the Star Wars films - whether he appears over his master's shoulders like an evil genie in the hologram, or when he makes his final appearance in the hangar.The acting - I enjoyed Ewan and Liam's performances quite a bit, and I had enjoyed Natalie since I saw her in the Professional, but everyone seems to be annoyed with the performance of young Mister Lloyd. All I have to say on that subject is  what did you expect ? He's only a kid (a damned lucky one, IMHO), and even though he isn't Sir Laurence Olivier, he did a good job with what he had to do. The way people bash him all the time, it's like they expected him to be dressed in a mini-Vader costume and start choking everyone in sight from the get-go. Albeit I didn't agree with the whole Yippee thing, but hopefully George can get someone to help him with those small details in the next film.One thing that bothered me came from another IMDb viewer, who asked why the Federation bothered to go after Queen Amidala when they were a democracy. All I have to say is look at England. They are a democracy, with a working government. The Queen has little official power, but if she was being held hostage by a vast army, you can bet that the British Parliament would spring into action and do exactly what she said.I think the only thing I didn't enjoy in the movie was the whole Midicholrian aspect - which made it sound so Star Trek-ian, and the whole immaculate conception thing was a little hard to swallow. I kept expecting Qui-Gon to be the father (a better plot twist IMO).I also enjoyed seeing actual Jedi's using their Force powers, like the Force Push, and Force Speed. And I loved the whole idea that the Trade Federation used a robot task force to do their dirty work, but after seeing them in action, it shows why you can't go wrong with Stormtroopers (mind you, they weren't much better...). My advice to the Trade Federation - stop getting those awful Battle Droids, and get yourself a few more Droidekas (the Destroyers) - they seemed to get the job done pretty well.Also, I loved the four-way battle sequence at the end, it was visually stunning, and my advice to people is, don't look at Jar-Jar during his segment of the battle, look at the other Gungans - it's a lot funnier.All in all, I'd have to say that this movie was well worth the wait, and it just goes to show why George is the master of the movies that he is.

I kept expecting Qui-Gon to be the father (a better plot twist IMO).I also enjoyed seeing actual Jedi's using their Force powers, like the Force Push, and Force Speed. And I loved the whole idea that the Trade Federation used a robot task force to do their dirty work, but after seeing them in action, it shows why you can't go wrong with Stormtroopers (mind you, they weren't much better...). My advice to the Trade Federation - stop getting those awful Battle Droids, and get yourself a few more Droidekas (the Destroyers) - they seemed to get the job done pretty well.Also, I loved the four-way battle sequence at the end, it was visually stunning, and my advice to people is, don't look at Jar-Jar during his segment of the battle, look at the other Gungans - it's a lot funnier.All in all, I'd have to say that this movie was well worth the wait, and it just goes to show why George is the master of the movies that he is. By the way, hurry up with Episode 2 !!

That way they know what he will most likely do, and have several safety nets in place if he doesn't.

The idea of Lynch directing a film like this did not surprise me at all. Lynch has always had a streak of sentimentality to some degree or other in all of his films, he has always appreciated natural beauty, and certain of his sequences have always been painfully slow. So I thought he would be the perfect guy to make the story of Alvin Straight a moving and mystical experience. I was very disappointed.The first half hour of this film is relatively good, with typical Lynch dialogue, shots and characters. But once Alvin goes out on the road, the movie loses its focus. The characters the he meets and interacts with on the road simply don't add up to much. Their stories are not compellingly drawn and are often more then a little too sentimental. The very act of Alvin's journey is also not really very well realized either it its worst moments you feel like Lynch and the editor were sitting around saying well, I don't know what to do here, so let's throw in another cornfield, a cloudy sky, and a shot of the road. I'm left with the impression that Lynch worked well in setting up the journey--where he had a story and plot to work with--but lost his focus once the the journey began and the events and details that drive the film became much more subtle.One big mistake is these extensive helicopter shots flying over cornfields. I think this loses the perspective that Alvin experiences, that of being stuck going very slowly on the side of the road. They just lose the tone of the film. I also expected MORE coverage of the weather as it develops through the day, the small things Alvin sees as he makes his journey. You do get him looking at a storm once, but it mostly looks like a garden hose and a strobe light, and you don't get the sense of power and beauty that a real midwestern storm can display. The whole idea of this film is to slow down and take a careful look at natural things, and that just doesn't come across here. When Alvin tells some people that he's been on the road five weeks it's shocking, because you don't have a sense of the length of that journey at all. Alvin also refuses help on the way, saying he has to make this journey his way. I like the idea of the very arduousness of the journey being part of his act of homage to his brother, but that idea is not reinforced enough, and ultimately the viewer is really left at quite a distance from Alvin and his psyche.Mostly I felt this film was filled with signifiers of things that SHOULD have been moving, but ultimately the connections, when there, had to be stretched and filled in by the viewer. This is obviously a very ambitious film, and a great idea for a film, but I'm afraid the thematic connections just were not made.

However, nothing is gelled and nothing leads into anything else.  its like a good book after your dog got ahold of it and ripped out several of the key pages only, like the ending.Well enough from me.

I didnt take that literally but I should have.  This is for people on drugs.

First of all, watching the previews for this film gives you no idea what you're in for when you see the film, that's for sure.  All you know is that there's going to be some bare-knuckle fighting kind of like tough man competitions.  This film is dark, edgy, and out there.You expect good acting because of Brad Pitt and Ed Norton and they are strong in this film.  If you liked Pitt's Jeffrey Goines from 12 Monkeys (should have won the Oscar that year), then you'll like him in this.  Not quite as whacked but he's walking that path, that's for sure.>The surprise in the film for me was Meatloaf.  His first appearance, in fact every one of his appearances caused me to have a gut clutching belly laugh. I won't spoil it though.  It has to be seen.  Furthermore, he acted well and you didn't find yourself seeing Meatloaf on the screen.  He was Bob.  I'm laughing now because I can see him in my mind.  You will too.Make no mistake, this is no girl-flick.  So the fact that Rosie O'Donnell didn't like it is not surprising. > Anyway, as the story goes along, I found myself asking over and over, what's going on here?  I was not lost, but the story hadn't presented itself yet. Or maybe it was that it hadn't grabbed me yet.  Whichever, just when I thought that it was never going to really make sense, it made perfect sense. It snuck up on me and then I couldn't wait to see if what I suspected was correct.  That made the movie fun.  You keep saying to yourself over and over, 'the average guy would not do these things'.One of the other reviews on this page says ...look deep and you'll see a whole other film trying to reach our society with a sobering point...

Nicole kidman is slightly better and more credible, but that is not enough since her role is indeed secondary to that of her husband.  Furthermore, the couple interaction is very limited and remains fundamentally unexplored.Basically, the movie is about some of kidman's innocent sexual fantasy, which cruise cannot digest.  So he tries in every possible way to vindicate his offended ego, without being able to do so, not even in a huge luxury brothel, filled with naked women beyond imaginable and reasonable.  And so, after the two stars appear to have metabolised their ghosts, they also came up with the stunning conclusion we must have more sex!!My impression is that kubrick had an idea, and was unable to find the ideal actors, so he settled for a second or maybe forth best, since the choices available around where limited. Secondly, I suspect that if the director had had the time to complete his work, this movie would have been substantially different and less clumsy.
