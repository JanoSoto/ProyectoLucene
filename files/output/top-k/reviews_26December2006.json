[{"date":"26 December 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I just happened to check Rushmore out on the TV after just watching the mind numbing Miami Vice and right from the start I knew I was going to enjoy this movie . The film basically follows the life of a very bright under achiever 'nerd' who you could say in a way is lonely and reaching out for attention thusly his long list of extra activities . The strange thing about this movie is that well it takes one back to their own time in high school and how they look peering in from the out-side wanting to be popular and liked and loved by the babes , also lets not forget about the crush everyone has on that one teacher . I guess in a way this film is about being trying to reach out for love as the 3 main characters in this film display , they are each bound by some form on loneliness. All I can say is check it out , it will make a great change and a chance to walk to down memory lane . Schwartzman, Olivia and Bill Murrary were all great but Schwartzman was the man every one routes for when he goes head to head with Murray over the love of a woman , even though he is too young for her ! Priceless! RUSHMORE 8.5 OUT 10 FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD LUCK AND GOOD NIGHT!
