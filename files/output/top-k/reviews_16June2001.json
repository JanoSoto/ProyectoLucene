My wife walked out after 10 minutes. In a fit of generosity I gave it a 6 of 10, only after I viewed the DVD version with the director's commentary turned on.The director and co-writer is Christopher Guess, who also stars as Harlan Pepper, a country bumkin who is showing his bloodhound, and studies ventriloquism on the side.  The other co-writer is Eugene Levy who stars as Jerry Fleck, who meets up with another of his wife's ex-lovers almost everywhere they go. Jerry as two left feet, literally.To say the movie was written is a bit of a stretch because, as Guess and Levy explain, all scenes and dialog were improvised, with no rehearsals. Except for Parker Posey, who plays the out-of-control housewife, all the actors are veterans of improvisation, and most have worked together in other movies.  The whole film has the feel of improvisation, and the look of a hand-held home movie, but with better sound. Instead of using selective focus to isolate the subject, almost everything is in focus in most scenes.Fred Willard was the most entertaining. Many of us have seen him regularly in comic skits on the Jay Leno late night TV show. He was one of the two announcers at the dog show, and his questions and comments never fit, but were funny because of that. How do they get those Scnauzers to become minature? Do they shrink them? Do you know they eat dogs in some cultures? That judge, examining the dog's testicles, I would be uncofortable on a date with her!The dog show brings forth the gay couple, the quarreling couple, the March\/December couple, and so forth. After best in show is picked, and everyone goes their separate ways, the short epilog shows how the show influenced them and what they did afterward. The funniest was the calendar the gay couple were making, showing two dogs posed as various famous movie characters.Why do I think this is a mediocre movie?  It is obviously a vanity project. Guess and Levy apparently said, let's make a comedy with lots of funny people and sight gags, let's use improvisation, and use a dog show in Philadelphia as a reason for following the lives of all these fringe personalities.  I found it entertaining for the most part, but also found Parker Posey's acting to be too much over the top, and found myself cringing instead of laughing. Too many of the gags came across as forced humor.  While I admire the project, having made many home movies myself when my children were growing up, overall the effort misses the entertainment mark of a major film.

But the more teasers and trailers I saw, I had to admit that it still looked a great film. They did a good job with Lion King and Mulan, they could do it again... So I went. Now I have seen Disney's Atlantis and I can say they did two things with this film. First, they made me belive that somewhere inside Disney, there is a person with brain. Second, they made a movie that beat The Lion King as my favorite mainstream Disney cartoon. By mainstream I mean their big cartoon-of-the-year animated film (is, Aladdin, Mulan, Lion King, Little Mermain, not Toy Story, Little Mermain II, or 102 Dalmations). Atlantis is quite possibly the best thing they've ever put out. I mean, I loved this movie. I'm 20 years old, and I'm planning on going out tomorrow and buying the soundtrack (which I'll get to in a minute).First off, this isn't your older brother's Disney. Gone are the cheap animal sidekicks and spontaneous songs. Instead, we are given characters, while are funny, are real people whom we can like or hate, depending on which one. Now, I knew this was going to be something different when I saw a tiny thing at the end of one the trailers.

I didn't realize at the time, but most of the trailer music is in the movie, and it gets a lot better than that too. Beautiful melodies, great action music, and eerie chants as well. I could feel the anime influence on this. And I can't say how great a thing this is. I hope this a sign of a new direction Disney made be heading.

The fact that the Disney company tried to pigeon-hole this film as a family offering disturbs me, for I find very little in the way of family entertainment here. We see Natty alternately being punched, ripped off, verbally abused, wrongfully incarcerated in a juvenile home, and nearly assaulted by a child molestor who gives her a ride(her trusty pet wolf leaps through the rear windshield of the truck to save her), not exactly the kind of things you want your 7-year old to see. There's also a prevalent attitude of hostility and bitterness that permeates the attitudes of nearly all of the people Natty encounters. This can be attributed to the circumstances of the depression economy, to be sure, but the sheer amount of this vitriol makes the film a bitter pill. Lainie Kazan, as the shrewish, middle-aged propriotress of a boarding house who agrees to watch Natty while her father is away is the prime example. John Cusack appears as one of the few sympathetic characters and Natty's ill-conceived love interest. Some may find this film acceptable, but I found it brittle and dark.

Give the Disney people credit not only for attempting an original story rather than yet another adaptation, not only for chosing a story that demanded a more mature manner than most of their stuff, but for rendering that story with enough artistry to make compelling viewing for the duration of a feature.  Nevertheless, there were enough flaws to partially mitigate Atlantis's considerable virtues, and the nature of the flaws suggests that the filmmakers didn't know their own film's strongest points.The first major flaw is common among original fantasy movies--the filmmakers tried to cram too much story into too short a film.  (Other victims of the syndrome include films as diverse as A Close Shave and The Phantom Menace.)  At the very least, they should have allowed the visuals some time to sink in, the better to awe the viewer.  As it is, they barely have time enough to move the story along.  Then too, all that neat Atlantean stuff to look at makes one wonder about the people who created and live among it, yet we never really learn much about the Atlanteans themselves, not even the king and the princess (the two major Atlantean characters).  As few as ten more minutes could have done Atlantis a world of good.The second major flaw grows directly out of the first--the characters are too shallow, and most of their distinctiveness comes out of their comic aspects.  Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with an abundance of funny characters--indeed, most people ARE funny at least some of the time--but given the short time we get to know these people, we never get to see other sides to them, and the few bits of their backgrounds are told rather than shown (with a few minor exceptions for the main character).  Thus, when they finally stand up to the bad guy, it's not because of any strength of character hinted at earlier, but because the story demands it.(To be fair, most of the comedy is carried out well enough.  Special thanks here to Don Novello, whose deadpan portrayal of the explosives expert matched by an animation team led by Russ Edmonds stands as the perfect riposte to the manic comic sidekicks which have plagued so many recent cartoon films.)A few minor flaws involve matters of taste, so you're free to ignore them if you like.  First, this is yet another film revealing the heavy hand of Star Wars among its obvious influences.  At least the dogfights here take place in an atmosphere, so they're not as obviously impossible as the space-based dogfights in Star Wars, but it's hard to believe the technology of 1914 could accomplish some of the things depicted here.  (Maybe the story should have been set immediately after the World War rather than before it, even if it meant throwing out that one line about the Kaiser.)James Newton Howard's music also showed a heavy Star Wars influence, which is too bad because he's capable of better.  For one thing, John Williams's original Star Wars music itself derives heavily from early 20th century sources (notably Holst's The Planets), and it wouldn't have been out of line for Howard to draw upon some of them as well, considering the time of the story.  Secondly, the intimations of gamelan in part of the closing credits music suggest a sense of wonder that would have greatly added to the visuals had similar music been used during the film proper.Finally, I'm not sure I like the emphasis (also present in Disney's Tarzan) on colonialist exploitation as a source of evil.  For one thing, it was perhaps less appropriate in this movie than in Tarzan, which had some ecological hooks on which to hang the message.  Also, I consider it retrograde to suggest that the wielding of oppressive, exploitative power is a special sin of gun-wielding white males, rather than a potential temptation for any human being in the right place at the right time.  (The backstory of Atlantis itself, once the most powerful society on Earth in this movie anyway, suggests a way the latter option could have been rendered.  Unfortunately, this is yet another thing we are told rather than given a chance to see and feel for ourselves.)Nonetheless, the best parts of Atlantis are still wonderful to look at, and to wonder about.

This wide-eyed optimistic childlike view on this very unknown thing I believe shows Spielberg's view on life at this point in his existence on earth(as is revealed in the documentary on the DVD).  In some ways I wonder if I'm making too much of this movie, but there seems to be so much to talk and think about when this movie's over that it deserves all this praise and attention.  Despite the fact that the movie is not really perfect in every scene, the dream is obviously realized in the whole which makes it a perfect dream movie created by a tremendously gifted and dreamlike director in Spielberg.

There are just too many hateful and ignorant people around. There are countless bigotry and attacks on the Asian cultures (comments like &#133;it's just another low class Asian movies&#133;,  .. the ridiculous flying sequence.. or ..the Governess' daughter's (who cares what her name was) &#133;) and personal attacks (such as &#133;shame on Ang Lee&#133; , .. Siskel and Ebert must have been asleep with the rest of the crowd when they rated this one...Shame on you!..). Blame it on Siskel? I believe he past away before this movie came out.It's a foreign film, of course it has sub-titles. No one sticks a big gun at your head to rent it or watch it. So don't whine about the distracting sub-titles or waste our time to read your complaint about it just because you don't know enough Chinese or can't afford a DVD player (DVD came with English).Many people complained about having a hard time to stay awake through the movie?! As if that's a proof of a bad movie. Well, those very same people probably will also fall asleep on Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.  Or do they even know what Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart are? By the way,  Beethoven is not the movie about a big, dumb dog.Finally, those people kept comparing this movie to Bruce Lee or Jackie Chen are simply idiots. Same with those people found the flying sequence ridiculous, it only tells me that you have no appreciation for the Asian (or perhaps any other) cultures. Why did you even bother to watch the movie in the first place then waste our time to read your ignorant comments?

She is possibly the hottest woman I have ever seen.  I don't know why. She just is.Now with that out of the way, Tomb Raider is an amazingly stupid movie.  It really is.  It has some of the biggest logic holes I have ever seen.  It has some of the dumbest characters ever portrayed on screen.  It's filled stupid with British clichés.  For example, someone says, Oh bugger, every five seconds.  And lastly, some of the special effects just downright suck. What is the deal with that?  The Mummy Returns had really crappy effects, and now Tomb Raider.  Are we going through an effects depression?  Well there is Pearl Harbor&#133;Now, is the movie any good?  Actually, yes.  I thought it was entertaining. Honestly, this is one of those movies you see, like, and never see again. Don't get me wrong, it's a bad movie.  Hell, it's downright stupid.  But it's a fun summer movie.  Every summer is filled with stupid but fun movies, and we just need to lie back and relax.  This is not the time of the year for solid gold movies.  The production companies hold onto all the Oscar movies until the fall.To be honest, I really didn't like The Mummy Returns.  I thought it was too stupid for its own.  I liked Pearl Harbor, but it was too long for its own good.  But, for some reason, Tomb Raider had just the right amount of really cool action sequences to back up for its stupidity.  I gave The Mummy Returns a 5, though I would now give it a 4.  I gave Pearl Harbor a 6, and I'm not too sure where to put Tomb Raider.  I hate reviewing these types of movies because they're not obviously good or bad.  They're somewhere in the middle.  While Tomb Raider is not too good, it was fun.  Besides, the Tomb Raider video games where dumb, so what where you expecting?  I think Mortal Kombat still holds the best game-to-movie conversion, (though that's not really saying anything because all game-to-movie conversions suck).6\/10 (I guess)  ","genre":null},{"date":"16 June 2001","score":"","review":"  Let me get this out of the way Angelina Jolie is hot.
