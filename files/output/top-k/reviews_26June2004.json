This is not only an eye-popping cinematic treat, but one of the greatest stories ever put on celluloid. The movie lasts nearly four hours--- it's longer than any other mainstream commercially successful film ever made. But the time goes by so quickly that you'll miss it when it's over.Of course, we all know that this movie is set in the days of the Civil War in the 1860s. It's the story of Scarlett O'Hara, a plantation owner's daughter who is very beautiful and who seemingly MUST have her own way at all times. She's willing to scheme and manipulate everyone in her path until she gets it. When the movie opens, the country is on the verge of civil war--- North against South--- but Scarlett barely notices, and doesn't care in the least. Her biggest obsession is that she's in love with dreamy\/poetic Ashley Wilkes, and she stays in love with him throughout 98 percent of the movie. The only problem is....Ashley doesn't have any particular interest in her at all. In fact, he spends most of the movie being married to gentle Melanie Hamilton--- a fact that frustrates Scarlett to no end. Ashley remains the one object of her desire that she is never to obtain.She would have been better off pining after Rhett Butler, a much more solid, rather dangerous man with a reputation as a no-good scoundrel. He is openly attracted to Scarlett, grows to love her (although he dare not let her know, or she'll use it against him), and it's obvious that he would make a lot better match for her than the drab Ashley. Very late in the movie, he finally does marry Scarlett. But it's probably too late for them to be happy by then, ironically--- and they never really are happy together.The complicated and utterly fascinating relationship between Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley, and Melanie is the fuel that keeps the movie going. But there are dozens, if not hundreds, of little extra twists and turns that fill out the movie. The Civil War backdrop for one, the colorful supporting roles for another. A great many reviewers here have seen Scarlett as purely a selfish, one-dimensional manipulative shrew. But she's far more than that! This is a complex, multi-dimensional young woman with lots of conflicting motives. Yes, she's selfish and manipulative. But she's also selfless the extreme sacrifices that she makes on behalf of her family, and Melanie (keeping in mind that, other than her father, she doesn't even particularly like any of them) are nothing short of heroic. She is overwhelmingly protective of her loved ones. She's a ball of fire when work needs to be done, and she's fiercely courageous. Despite her hardness, she does also grow as a person. To her great credit, she slowly comes to value Melanie's friendship and support. She genuinely loves and is proud of her daughter. And at the very end of the movie, she does finally realize how ill-suited she and Ashley have always been for each other, and how little passion ever actually existed there.Some quick high points, and a few flaws the supporting roles are superb in every way. Even the rather bland Ashley is given as much life as could be expected by actor Leslie Howard, and the other parts are vivid and fill out the movie. Two female parts in particular--- wise, funny, respected Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and wistful, decent-at-heart prostitute Belle Watling (Ona Munson) are standouts.The scenery and photography is possibly the most superb ever done in the history of film. Many scenes are just sumptuously lit and filmed. The gripping nighttime escape from Atlanta (the whole city seemingly in flames) is one of the most spectacular action sequences ever done. The sunsets are jaw-droppingly beautiful.Much has been said about the supposed racism of this film. It's true that it does portray black slaves as being HAPPY to be slaves. But much more important, it's also true that the wisest person in the whole movie is Mammy. This black lady may be a slave--- later an employee--- but she is smart, funny, observant, and she's treated as an equal, if not a superior, throughout the movie. And it's made clear she deserves it. With no irony or rebuke whatever, she scornfully refers to certain low-lifes as poor white trash, and we know (Mammy knows too) that if they get called that, they deserve it. She may be black, but she isn't inferior to them or anybody. And we root for her all the way.A few minor flaws, and I do mean minor 1) Most of the acting looks pretty modern, but there are a very few scenes where it seems a little old-style. Hey enjoy the movie and don't worry 'bout it. People didn't do today's method acting in the 1930s. 2) Some of the raw scenes still have a Hollywood gloss to them. Even when Scarlett is on the brink of starvation and probably hasn't had a good bath in weeks, she looks perfectly made up with only a few hairs out of place. Oh well. It *was* big-time Hollywood after all. 3) The second half of the movie is more talky and less action-oriented than the first. I would not say it's more boring, just less movement. I don't find it draggy, but some people do. Still a heck of a good story, and a great film, so enjoy the ride!

Anaconda was roundly kicked upon release by all and sundry but I decided that perhaps we were being too harsh. After all, the cast didn't sound too bad. Jon Voight has four acting Oscar nominations, even winning one of them. It couldn't be that bad, could it?Yep. This really is a modern-day monster movie with a crudely animated giant snake replacing Robby the (Rubber) Robot. The plot revolves around an inept bunch of documentary film-makers who embark on a journey into the Amazon jungle to find some long-lost tribe, so they have noble intentions then. Things go wrong when they pick up obvious psycho Voight, who hijacks the trip in an attempt to capture the world's largest snake. Sort of like Dead Calm meets David Attenbourgh. Characters are as wooden as their boat - Voight sneers like there's no tomorrow and seems permanently lit from underneath, like a kid with a torch at Halloween. Jennifer Lopez is your typically big-bosomed action hero and Eric Haven't-I-seen-you-in-something-else? Stoltz is... something or other, I can't remember and I literally only just finished watching it.Aside from the rank cheesiness of it all, this film tries to pretend that it's the first of its kind. Therefore, characters will proceed to wade through murky waters despite knowing that there's a very large hungry snake swimming in them. The good guys only catch on to Voight's motives fairly late in the day to do much about it - honestly, he is pantomime-bad in this picture. I haven't seen anyone over-act quite so much since Jeremy Irons in the Dungeons & Dragons movie and that really is pushing it. In addition, the genre's stereotype dictates that women must wear tight shorts, sleeveless vests and get wet as often as possible whilst exposing themselves to danger. Something Lopez and fellow tit-attraction Kari Wuhrer perform frequently but not well. Only Ice Cube seemed to perform well in this picture, though not as good as fellow hip-hop star LL Cool J in Deep Blue Sea. Jeez, these guys get all the luck...I really wanted to remain as objective and open-minded as possible for this film, knowing how notoriously bad it is. But there can be little excuse for this. Some might try to convince you that it is a spoof or that it is a homage to the monster movies of yore. Not only does this film take itself too seriously (except Voight, bless his evil cotton socks) but seems to want to distance itself from the past, using computer-generated images and lots of blue-screen as opposed to those famous rubber suits and puppets. When you take into account some truly comic ideas (for the wrong reasons - the shot of the snake swimming past the camera with his victim's screaming detail visible through its body got me laughing), annoying bit players, unexciting action scenes and a poor central premise (it's just a snake, people - IT HAS NO LIMBS!) then the writing is on the wall for this one.

The fact that James Marsden was playing a really good role as a frustrated outsider (a stretch in itself) was refreshingly surprising. As with any movie about High School rejects, there inevitably comes the point where the leading protagonist(s) must confront the parents; in this particular case there was a disturbingly realistic conflict between Marsden's frustrated character and his parents.

First, it is a great idea that because of it's dependance on character should appeal to a wide audience, not just sci-fi fans. The set design is excellent for such a low budget and the CGI work (apparently donated by CORE design in Canada for nothing) is also good for a film of this budget.

The movie plays out like an anti-drug drama while the book explores California's wealthy socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness. With vicious characters similar to Igby Goes Down, and the unbearable and disgusting apathy of The River's Edge, the novel portrays a dark reality of over-privileged city sleaze with too way much money.The novel is narrated by Clay, an eighteen year old who returns home from his New Hampshire college for the winter holiday. Rightly characterized as a modern Holden Caufield, Clay just seems to watch his surreal existence among the wealthy Califorian socialites with disgust. It is like the Roaring '20s of The Great Gatsby, only much harsher. The characters have no emotional connection to one another, neither to family or friends. When asked where her parents are for the Christmas vacation, one girl, Kim, replies that she read in Vogue that her mother was in London, or perhaps Honolulu. Everyone just seems to be content (or kidding themselves that they are) in their meaningless rituals. Meeting at one club after another, doing endless amounts of coke, engaging in casual sex. These characters are, what Sandra Bullock's character in 'Murder By Numbers' refers to as the 'orphans.' Kids with too much money and no place to go, nothing to do. Their lifestyles have turned them into the most disgusting creatures who don't seem to acknowledge their state of uselessness. They consider it the good life. In fact, Clay does seem to be the only one to realize it. Though Blair may've once been his girlfriend and Julian may've once been his best friend in school, they don't seem to matter anymore as they get carried away with this lifestyle. Everyone has turned into this sort of Il Conformiste (notice that all characters are described as blond and tanned). Any sort of connection Clay might've had with his friends or family is lost. New Hampshire, I suppose, is his only escape from perhaps, fantasies of suicide. (Notice how he states at the end that he half-wished he could take Blair back with him). The movie is a ridiculous adaptation of the book. Important characters like Rip and Trent, the most disgustingly apathetic of the characters in the book (notice how they react when the twelve year old girl is hogtied to the bed at their friend's house or when they discover a dead body behind a club), are made trivial in the movie. And largely because the theme these useless characters made so by their money and by the city life (the same themes of the 20s and 30s) becomes only secondary to the anti-drug story. In fact, another 80s drug-themed movie of the decade, 'Big Lights, Bright City' with Michael J. Fox and Kiefer Sutherland (aside from the drug theme) does a better job at illustrating the type of sickening cycle of useless people Ellis was describing in his own novel. 'Less Than Zero' is one of a few of Ellis's novels that have come to be adapted to the screen. The same cast of characters, those rich useless kids of the city who delude themselves in a world of zero emotion or care, return in 'American Psycho,' 'The Rules of Attraction', and now 'Glitterama.' Although, I suppose 'The Rules of Attraction' is much closer to the novel 'Less Than Zero' in that one character comes to realize how pathetic that cycle is, and desperately seeks to escape it in the end.So, I'd say, the novel is good. The movie was not. I suppose the only saving grace of the movie is that yes, it was an 80s movie with the hot young stars of the decade (particularly Gertz and Spader who are always interesting to see). That, and the anti-drug message can't be totally disregarded, especially considering the decade. Although, then if that were all the filmmakers were looking for, then 1) it was done better the following year ('Bright Lights, Big City'; Clean and Sober), and 2) they didn't need an adaptation of a novel to create that kind of story. The movie is alright just by itself. But as an adaptation, the novel fares much better.Moreover, for those interested in reading the novel, this narrative makes an interesting comparison to the 1979 Terry Davis novel, 'Vision Quest,' which was also poorly adapted into film in the early 80s.

With vicious characters similar to Igby Goes Down, and the unbearable and disgusting apathy of The River's Edge, the novel portrays a dark reality of over-privileged city sleaze with too way much money.The novel is narrated by Clay, an eighteen year old who returns home from his New Hampshire college for the winter holiday. Rightly characterized as a modern Holden Caufield, Clay just seems to watch his surreal existence among the wealthy Califorian socialites with disgust. It is like the Roaring '20s of The Great Gatsby, only much harsher. The characters have no emotional connection to one another, neither to family or friends. When asked where her parents are for the Christmas vacation, one girl, Kim, replies that she read in Vogue that her mother was in London, or perhaps Honolulu. Everyone just seems to be content (or kidding themselves that they are) in their meaningless rituals. Meeting at one club after another, doing endless amounts of coke, engaging in casual sex. These characters are, what Sandra Bullock's character in 'Murder By Numbers' refers to as the 'orphans.' Kids with too much money and no place to go, nothing to do. Their lifestyles have turned them into the most disgusting creatures who don't seem to acknowledge their state of uselessness. They consider it the good life. In fact, Clay does seem to be the only one to realize it. Though Blair may've once been his girlfriend and Julian may've once been his best friend in school, they don't seem to matter anymore as they get carried away with this lifestyle. Everyone has turned into this sort of Il Conformiste (notice that all characters are described as blond and tanned). Any sort of connection Clay might've had with his friends or family is lost. New Hampshire, I suppose, is his only escape from perhaps, fantasies of suicide. (Notice how he states at the end that he half-wished he could take Blair back with him). The movie is a ridiculous adaptation of the book. Important characters like Rip and Trent, the most disgustingly apathetic of the characters in the book (notice how they react when the twelve year old girl is hogtied to the bed at their friend's house or when they discover a dead body behind a club), are made trivial in the movie. And largely because the theme these useless characters made so by their money and by the city life (the same themes of the 20s and 30s) becomes only secondary to the anti-drug story. In fact, another 80s drug-themed movie of the decade, 'Big Lights, Bright City' with Michael J. Fox and Kiefer Sutherland (aside from the drug theme) does a better job at illustrating the type of sickening cycle of useless people Ellis was describing in his own novel. 'Less Than Zero' is one of a few of Ellis's novels that have come to be adapted to the screen. The same cast of characters, those rich useless kids of the city who delude themselves in a world of zero emotion or care, return in 'American Psycho,' 'The Rules of Attraction', and now 'Glitterama.' Although, I suppose 'The Rules of Attraction' is much closer to the novel 'Less Than Zero' in that one character comes to realize how pathetic that cycle is, and desperately seeks to escape it in the end.So, I'd say, the novel is good. The movie was not. I suppose the only saving grace of the movie is that yes, it was an 80s movie with the hot young stars of the decade (particularly Gertz and Spader who are always interesting to see). That, and the anti-drug message can't be totally disregarded, especially considering the decade. Although, then if that were all the filmmakers were looking for, then 1) it was done better the following year ('Bright Lights, Big City'; Clean and Sober), and 2) they didn't need an adaptation of a novel to create that kind of story. The movie is alright just by itself. But as an adaptation, the novel fares much better.Moreover, for those interested in reading the novel, this narrative makes an interesting comparison to the 1979 Terry Davis novel, 'Vision Quest,' which was also poorly adapted into film in the early 80s. Anyways, these are two very different books that would be quite interesting to read consecutively.

But it is folly to believe that the written version of 'The English Patient' can ever conceivably be adapted to film, that its characters can ever be personified, or that its emotional tension can ever be imitated.Anthony Minghella and the film's production crew do a sufficient and even commendable job piecing together the skeletal necessities of the extramarital romance between Almasy and Katharine, and I was almost extremely impressed that all the novel's most poignant emotional moments and scenes defining the most important aspects of each character were included in this film adaptation; however, the literary work is so well written that it would be impossible to have a movie without them.  Even the medicine man in the desert encased in his jacket of glass bottles and ground peacock bone makes his necessary appearance, further proving that this film was produced solely for a bibliophile's wish to share the daydreams in his head.'The English Patient' in book form is a study in the mind's capacity to appreciate the physical world around it; the mind of the film-going audience member can't participate in this study, as subtle emotional intensity and incredible imagery are force-fed to the audience and shackled to an immobile plot line.  Chronological sense and order is created out of a confused amalgamation of anecdotes and memories trapped inside the dying mind of the English patient, and causes some otherwise good acting performances to go to waste.The worst tragedy of the creation of the film is the omission of much of the relationship between the Sikh and Hana, the young Canadian nurse in need of some humanity other than the grim realities of war.  The relationship does not begin with much fanfare, and ends with even less, the Sikh riding off with a neutral smile.  The film glosses over the Sikh's history as a sapper and leaves out any mention of the dropping of the atomic bomb, an event that further separates the Western from the Eastern world and causes Kip, the Sikh, to ride off and leave everything Western, his disarming equipment and his affection for Hana, behind in Italy.Minghella directs his actors with flair and intelligence, but in the end, the film is really a bland, more structural version of Michael Ondaatje's book.

I guess I'll have to write it  myself. I believe there's ample evidence on the screen in Alien Resurrection to suggest that Jeunet  had ulterior motives when he put this film together. While Scott, Cameron and Fincher all had  the intention of making seamless Hollywood films that pull the audience into their world of  horror and sci-fi for a cathartic and engaging experience, I do not believe that was the  intention of this film. I believe Jeunet was using a method well-known to fans of the French  New Wave that is often referred to as laying bare the device. The intention was to make the  moviegoers aware that they were watching a movie by allowing continuity errors or allowing  the cameraman to catch his own reflection in a mirror. It was supposed to pull you out of the  moment and make you aware that you were watching actors performing. What Jeunet does in  this film is actually more subtle. He sets up scenes that parody conventions of Hollywood  blockbusters and he pushes them just far enough so we know as an audience that we're in on  the joke before continuing on. For a moment we're taken out of the film and given time to  reflect on how ridiculous the genre can be, but before casual moviegoers can throw up their  hands the film begins to take itself seriously again and we proceed. It's like Jeunet was taking  potshots at Hollywood on their dime. There are dozens of examples of this technique in the film. An example is when Dan  Hedaya's General Perez is attacked from behind and he reaches around and grabs a piece of  his brain to examine. Another is when Michael Wincott's Elgyn is led down a corridor by a  trail of guns which he picks up one by one as he walks into a trap. Or the whole gag about  the door locks keying on the breath of the people with access. Or when Ron Perlman delivers  his Waste of ammo...must be a chick thing line (which holds the convention of the action- hero one-liner up to the light). You can go on and on with these examples. Some have  suggested it was just bad writing, but I feel like there are too many clear signs that this was  Jeunet's attempt to murder a Hollywood franchise by milking its own conceits until it  drowned in them. The next Alien film will undoubtedly be back on track as far as the intent of the filmmaker  goes. Paul Anderson isn't exactly known for the layers of subtext in his films. I think it's very  interesting that Alien Resurrection was made at all. I also wonder if Fox ever had any idea (or  has any idea to this day) that Jeunet made this film to ridicule and destroy the Alien  franchise.

The vocal performances are generally good, while not quite as good as those on the original 1969 album, Anne Margret's performance stands out as particularly brilliant.
