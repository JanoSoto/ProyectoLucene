The Sandlot gives us a real story about real kids, and while kids will enjoy the movie, so too will anyone who's ever experienced a true love for the game of baseball.  Because that is exactly what these kids have.  Unlike most other movies, (i.e. The Mighty Ducks) these kids actually care about the game they play.  It is, in fact, their life.  And while it is fun to beat the crap out of the big tough guys with the fancy uniforms, they just as soon would have played on their own, simply for the sake of playing.  The Sandlot does a good job of portraying kids as they are essentially selfish people who love to toot thier own horns, but for the sake of their interests, will tolerate others with similar interests.  Only through this initial toleration do the true friendships begin to form.The Sandlot is definitely a must see for anyone who has their old mitt lying somewhere in a closet or attic at home, and count on wanting to find it and take it outside to have a catch once you've seen this movie.

And the relationship between the two main characters in the movie begins as interestingly as it can be.  Next we are given the atmosphere.  An opulent setting, luxurioustoys, refined manners (a classical aspirational background) and just as important an emotional setting (strong family connections and a specially close relationship between the father and his younger daughter).  Plus, the apparent emotional antagonist of Death is also presented (Death can't have a physical antagonist) as the inadequate love interest of Death's future romantic interest.

Now don't misunderstand me, I like Jurassic Park as much as the next person. But The Lost World had more depth than the first film. It expanded Malcolm's character, not to mention his past. It also allowed time for more character development on the part of Sarah Harding and Kelly. The emphasis of the film was on respecting nature. The movie carried a theme, for goodness sake. It had a darker mood, which also added depth. Who could forget Roland's infamous line, I believe I've spend enough time in the company of death. Pete Postlethwaite did a marvelous job as Roland, and Jeff Goldblum performed well also. Although some scenes could have been excised, such as the one where a man is devoured by compys, the rest of the film is good. It has the most depth for an action flick that I have seen, and it asks some interesting questions.....For another film that asks even more thought provokers, see Pleasantville.

One of the few movies that it probably doesn't matter whether on the big screen or at home on the VCR.Canadian Bacon stars John Candy as Sheriff Bud Boomer of Niagara Falls, New York.  The town has recently undergone a recession due to factory closings (a common theme in Michael Moore movies, see Roger and Me)  However, the plants that are closing in this town are military plants being shut down by the President due to the end of the Cold War.  The President is ridiculously unpopular, and he blames it on the the fact that every other President had the Russians to blame for all the nation's problems.  Desperate for an enemy, he finally settles on the Mom and Pop operation up north, Canada.This whole set-up provides for plenty of satire, and belittling humor directed at Canada is both obvious and funny.  A militant intelligence advisor to the President truly thinks the Candians are evil, citing an unfathomable purpose to the Canadian National tower, and all the ways that the Canadians have invented to make the Americans' lives miserable, including the metric system, Celsius, and, of course, Neil Young.Moore is clever in this way because he makes the obvious humor (or, for you Canadians, humour) all directed at Canada, which Joe American is bound to undrestand and find funny.  But there is also a lot of satire directed at the United States which is a little more subtle, yet still thoroughly enjoyable.Particularly funny are the propaganda television ads set up by the president which portray the true evil of Canadians as well.  They cite funny and sometimes actually believable or at least fear-provoking things about Canada.  A grave TV news broadcaster urges Americans to think of your children pledging allegiance to the maple leaf...winter, 11 months a year...Anne Murray, all day, every day.  (Listen closely for an Anne Murray song playing on the radio in the movie as well)By the way, there isn't much to this movie, in terms of story.  The story simply serves as a mechanism to allow Moore to poke fun at both America and Canada.  I rated it about an 8.

Basically this movie is about Death learning about life.  Death takes the form of a human in order to learn about life and what are its qualities if any. In doing so, he falls in love with the daughter of the man he's supposed to bring to death.  He must now decide whether to take the woman he loves into death, or leave her on earth to experience the goodness of life he's learned about.Meet Joe Black is a movie loaded with romance and drama.  The former part including scenes with Brad Pitt and Clair Forlani flirting with each other, or making love.  There is a lot of chemistry between the two, and it just brings a smile to your face when they interact with each other.  Anthony Hopkins brings a lot of drama to this movie, by outstandingly playing the part of a loving father with two daughters who must bear the weight of his company on his back.  This movie is well acted, and shouldn't be missed. You'll leave the theater, knowing how precious life is and that love can even conquer Death.

Queen Latifah is great and lights up the screen whenever she appears. I'm looking forward to more starring roles from this fine actress. Hey, I'm not saying don't see this flick but don't expect it to be anywhere near As Good As It Gets. This movie should have been named, Trying To Be As Good As It Gets.
