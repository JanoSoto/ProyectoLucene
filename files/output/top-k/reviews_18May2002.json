As soon as it came to theaters here in Donetsk, I hastily purchased tickets.  Now that I've seen it, I will say that I'm thoroughly impressed and I'd like to note 3 things from the movie.The sets and locations - New Zealand was a beautiful place for Jackson to film his films.  The mountains, the fields, and the rivers are all wonderful and match nearly how I would have imagined Middle-earth.  The sets were breathtaking, especially Rivendell, on the big-screen.  All the others, such as the Shire, Moria, Isengard and Mordor were pretty cool too.  But Lothlorien was a disappointing, too dark and creepy.  The book describes it as a light place.The special effects - I've seen several movies with highly technological CG scenes (`Star Wars Episode 1', `Titanic', to name a few), but this one beats them all down.  The canyon\/forge zoom-ins in Isengard were amazing.  The makeup they spent on those terrifying goblins was scary and warranted the PG-13 rating.  The other CG images (the cave troll, the tentacled monster, the Black Riders, the Eye of Sauron, the Balrog with whom they did a great job of mixing shadow and flame) were cool too.The acting - all the actors and actresses did a really good job, though I had only heard of three of them.  First of, Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee did the best job of portraying the forces of good and evil in Gandalf and Saruman.  And I'm sure no one left the theater without forgetting those 4 words `You shall not pass!'  I didn't.  Elijah Wood (`Adventures of Huck Finn') did a good job as Frodo and Ian Holm came in close third for me as Bilbo (he was also the voice of Frodo in a BBC dramatization, also did a good job).  The other hobbits, Sean Astin as Sam, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, and Billy Boyd as Pippin, were good too and added comic relief.  Sean Bean did a great job portraying Boromir with his emotional battle between the powers of the Ring.  At first, Viggo Mortensen made a bad impression on me as Aragorn, but he grew on me as the film went on.  John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom did a good job as Gimli and Legolas, though Gimli came across to me as more of a jerk than in the book.  Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett were ok as Arwen and Galadriel, but Hugo Weaving (voice of Rex in `Babe') was my only complaint as Elrond.Having said those things, this film is not for everyone.  I would recommend it to fans of the books, or anyone who appreciates good fantasy.  I would not recommend it to younger children, anyone who gets nightmares easily, or anyone who is offended by brutal violence.  It was not bloody, but there were many deaths and a goblin gets beheaded at the end.  Ugh!  Anyway, go and this if you think you have the time (3 hours if pretty long) and if you like goof fantasy, adventure, or Tolkien.One other thing  the music was cool too.  I purchased the soundtrack soon after and Howard Shore did great with it all.  Somebody told me that the music was close to that of `Gladiator'.  If anybody knows in what way, tell me.  I intend to go and see the next two films when they come out and buy this one when it comes out on video.

Surely, even if they were overly critical, there must be some truth to these appraisals?  I enjoyed The Phantom Menace, but had to concede some of the points made by its detractors.  Would this be just another 'fun, but flawed' piece of sci-fi fluff?  I'd hoped for so much more, especially after Lord Of The Rings had delivered so spectacularly. Well... I'm not sure exactly how to put this... but not only was this film better than Fellowship Of The Ring, it may well be the best Star Wars film of them all.  I left the cinema dizzy with elation, hairs on end as they had been throughout the last 2½ hours.  Take your pick of superlatives - awe-inspiring, epic, captivating, enchanting, riveting, breathtaking, spectacularly beautiful... it is all of these and more.  The characters are solid and often intriguing - in Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi we have a classic action hero who could be the prototype Jedi; Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker is a complex, often brooding figure for whom we can all feel some empathy.  With his innocent beginnings, the descent into the Dark Side and eventual redemption which are to come, this phase of Anakin's life completes the cycle of classic tragic hero.  Natalie Portman makes Amidala into more than just a love interest, truly convincing as the future mother of Princess Leia.  The supporting cast is crammed with memorable performances, from the (very!) animated Yoda and the righteous Mace Windu to Jango Fett and the menacingly powerful Count Dooku.  The many worlds are bustling with all manner of alien life, charming and menacing at turns. The special effects... they need no introduction, except to say they are more convincing than computer generated images have ever been before.  Nothing breaks the spell. Were there any flaws?  I suppose there must have been.  Flaws as seen in the original trilogy, and as seen in Fellowship, and a thousand other films heaped with unconditional critical praise.  The critics must have had their own agenda in slating this film - I feel most sorry for those who claimed they couldn't follow the plot.  Perhaps they need to reconsider their choice of career, because the magic of cinema can rarely have been in such evidence as it is here - if it eludes you, it's your loss.

I suppose there must have been.  Flaws as seen in the original trilogy, and as seen in Fellowship, and a thousand other films heaped with unconditional critical praise.  The critics must have had their own agenda in slating this film - I feel most sorry for those who claimed they couldn't follow the plot.  Perhaps they need to reconsider their choice of career, because the magic of cinema can rarely have been in such evidence as it is here - if it eludes you, it's your loss.

In my opinion, Episode II had it a little easier than Episode I did. Wheras Episode I was having to live up to the untouchable classic 3, Episode II merely had to rise above the fetid steaming pile that was Episode I.  But by no means is this an inferior movie.  EVERY SINGLE ASPECT is bettered by Episode II.  Acting, Special Effects, Plot....the list is long.  But one of the biggest differences in this movie (in my opinion) is that this movie seems a little more...human if you will.  No stiff acting, or impassive emotions- this is a movie ABOUT emotions.  The classic Star Wars humor also makes a much deserved inclusion as well.  George Lucas has been forgiven.
