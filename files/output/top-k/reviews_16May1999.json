Evil Dead came to mind a lot while watching this, what with the hand crawling all over the place. The only other movie I've seen trying to be funny and scary at the same time was Scream, but those films went for the scares more with incidental laughs.  In this one, the comedy was put up front and there are some pretty scary parts to it too, though scary in an '80's horror sort of way.I'm getting to be a fan of Seth Green, who is always good in the roles he's given, kind of like Steve Buscemi.  He plays one of two friends of main character Devon Sawa, whose hand becomes possessed and kills them, so they come back as zombies.  They are both pretty laid back as far as zombies go and try to help their friend with his hand problem.The death scenes were very gory, and I couldn't help but laugh in a sick sort of way when someone is pulled away and gallons of blood pour out of there.  I was relieved when nobody in the theater noticed, but I'm just weird enough to laugh at that sort of thing.  As a horror fan, I never pass up an opportunity to see a good death scene, but I think the guy getting hit by a big rig in Bride of Chucky still holds the gold medal for the close-up gruesomely detailed Faces of Death-esque death scene in a movie. And Drew Barrymore still wins for intense I-don't-want-to-die death chase scene in Scream, but this movie is full of very worthy runner-ups for each category.  If you've seen Scream, you'll notice that all three rules are broken and punished (Don't have sex, don't do drugs, no I'll be right back.)  For anyone who saw any of the '80's horror films, whether or not they liked them, this is a film you need to give a chance, if you can stomach the gore.  If you know someone who can't, watch it with them. Their reactions are priceless.  This movie, perfectly achieving what it tried for, gets a 10 from me.

Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. I cannot put the actual event into an emotional context in my life. Further to that, I am Canadian, and could theoretically distance myself from such an ugly piece of American history. Yet I cannot help but be emotionally affected by this film.The unraveling conspiracy in JFK is told with such conviction, it's hard to believe that it's only a culmination of theories and accounts rather than the truth as is known in history books. The length of the film in its DVD format is 206 minutes, a veritable film marathon. Yet with it's richness in information, theories and background, and absolutely beautiful photography by Robert Richardson, the time never passes slowly. And despite having watched it at least twice, I can safely say that the mind boggling conspiracies and facts they throw at you could keep it fresh for a third viewing in the future.The emotional impact of the 8mm Zapruder film which recorded the assassination, is staggering and awe inspiring. The feeling that the American government plotted the death of their own president, illustrates in many ways time and again, as one of the smaller characters reflects, that if they can kill the president, they can kill anyone. They can kill you or I without batting an eye.I can however, despite the seriousness of the subject matter, share a rather amusing anecdote about my first viewing of this film. I hadn't seen it in theaters, and so I rented it on VHS. My mother wanted to watch it with me, and knowing that it was over three hours long, she was eager to begin, complaining that she didn't want to be up until midnight watching it. Popping the microwave popcorn, she warned me she was starting without me if I didn't hurry. When I came in the room it had already begun. Jeez, Mom! What'd I miss?, Nothing, quiet! We watched the film together, at times my mother would comment on things that she recalled, and I'd have the occasion to ask her to be quiet. Half an hour went by, with not so much as one credit having shown on the screen, I remarked on it, and my mother concurred that it was odd, but confirmed that I truly hadn't missed anything walking into the film late.Soon we came to the speech given by Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison in the court room, charging Tommy Lee Jones as Clay Shaw as a conspirator, which is a scene that is quite emotionally stirring and powerful. I thought it was incredible. I had noticed that we'd barely crossed the half way mark of the three hour adventure, and remarked, Wow, you know, you could end the film right there, that was pretty powerful. Yes, it was, my mother agreed. Shortly following that scene came the epilogue statements and end credits. Finally it dawned on me. Mom! You put the SECOND tape in FIRST! She laughed immediately. We both did, but I was pretty upset knowing now that I'd have to start tape one and follow it up with tape two again. She got her wish, she wasn't up until midnight, not feeling the slightest bit compelled to watch the first tape, proclaiming, I lived it, I don't need to see it again, good night dear. Well Mom, you should watch the first part anyway, whether you lived it or not, because it's pretty darn intriguing. Unfortunately, the DVD isn't Mom-proof either, as it is double-sided.

Little incidents like these that link characters from other movies together amuses me. However, it made me think that perhaps Cage was making me recognize his character in Leaving Las Vegas too much.

I wasn't involved in the story enough and his acting wasn't convincing me to believe the story. It was a bit embarrassing to watch him watching the film in the beginning. He was too awkward, and too obvious. Did his talent take a holiday in this one? The monotonous narrative (the phone calls) over the momentous (too overpowering) music made me cringe.

I've been watching Jet Li do movies since the beginning of his acting career in China and I have to say, this is not one of his better films. Of course, this is not due to his inability to act. His performance was alright but the biggest fault of this movie was the fact that the film studio decided to dub it...which was the biggest mistake they could have made. The audience actually laughed in parts of the movie that were not actually meant to be funny and I can only attribute it to the poor translation of dialogue. I know this because I laughed as well. The movie would have been much better if it was subtitled.Here's a brief synopses of the story. Li is a genetically enhanced soldier created solely for the purpose of fighting. He discovers his humanity and decides that he no longer wants to be a soldier and decides to leave the core. Having successfuly emerged himself into the real world working as a librian he settles into his new life until he discovers that a group of his old comrades have decided to take their superhuman fighting skills and use it for terrorist purposes. Li comes out of hiding and single handedly takes out the terrorist group.The movie has an almost cartoon like feel to it which I assume was done on purpose but some of the props used could have been better. The mask that Li wore looked like something you buy at Home Depot for your garden. Wouldn't a cloth mask have been better and given Li's character a little bit more class? I think so. If you plan to watch this movie for the fight scenes, they were ok but in some places, the camera was too tight and you end up losing the effect of the fight. Li's martial arts abilities are probably one of the best in the world and people come to watch his movies because of that. Segal, Van Damme et al. have nothing on this man in the martial arts department. Jackie Chan comes close but his is more of an entertainment (tongue in cheek) perspective and he plays it beautifully. Li is more of an in-awe type style and directors should show that more. If you want to see some incredibly impressive martial arts from Li, try and find some of his early works from China. Some of them are subtitled, but many are not. In any case, you will see some fight scenes that will leave you an utter fan of Li as well as see some much better acting. Dubbing over his voice, and everyone else's voice makes the movie look silly takes away from Li's performance.I am sure that Li will be back in better movies and as soon as Hollywood figures out that filming fight scenes with Li cannot be done in the traditional, up close, completely coreographed slow manner that they have been doing for years with Segal and others. They will undoubtedly capture a brand new audience as well as convert many of the old.For those readers who I have offended by suggesting that Li is better than Segal and Van Damme, here's a little background info. Li has been taught by at least 10 of the world's best martial arts grand masters (including Bruce Lee's). He has also won the World Martial Arts Championship at least 10 times, if not more. (Rumor has it that he's won it 20 times, don't know).Overall, 5\/10. See it only if you want to see some ok fight scenes or you're a die hard Li fan.

Mark Hamill was good as usual, but I was somewhat disappointed in his sometimes lack of energy that he normally puts into his work.Clearly the first two installments are above this one, but those were tough to beat no matter what.

His portrayal of the teenager who falls into hate and the young man who is hauled out of it by circumstances is superb, and if he had had even one prior nomination, I believe that he would have won the Oscar.

However, I do not think it is a war movie.  The setting is the Vietnam War, but Kubrick is using this to talk about something else that he cannot talk about directly.  The same is true for THE SHINING.  This is not a horror movie.  It has all the attributes of a horror movie, but Kubrick is using this as a vehicle to talk about something that he cannot talk about directly.  So what is it that Kubrick can't talk about? Why was this story and the horror genre the proper vehicles for this subject?  I don't know, and I am glad that I don't know.  I first saw this movie when I was six.  I've seen it a hundred times, and I will watch it hundreds more because there is something going on that I haven't figured out.  I am sorry that I cannot remember who wrote it, but an article I read talked about the way Kubrick played with the viewers' horror-movie expectations.  Throughout the movie, the viewer is wondering where is the horror movie?  Then near the end, when treated to standard horror movie ghosts and gore, the viewer gets to relax - it is a horror movie they are watching after all.  But the camera zooms in for the last shot of the movie, and once again Kubrick shatters the viewer's expectations.The first time I saw Alan Resnais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, I was convinced there was something else going on in THE SHINING. I feel that these two films are closely related (along with HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR and the last half an hour of 2001).There are aspects of our world that we just cannot express with a page of prose or a ten minute speech.  Real art puts us as close to these inexpressible concepts as we can be without actually expressing them. Even if I fully understood what THE SHINING was about, I wouldn't be able to say it.  Kubrick needed to use a horror movie to point towards something he could not talk about; he was too much of a genius to do anything less (to simply decide he felt like making a horror movie).  I think it would be a loss for someone to talk about this movie's scare-factor and leave it at that.  I've struggled with this film for twenty years and will continue to do so.  I strongly recommend to  anyone who is intrigued by THE SHINING that they watch LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD and HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR.

I am sorry that I cannot remember who wrote it, but an article I read talked about the way Kubrick played with the viewers' horror-movie expectations.  Throughout the movie, the viewer is wondering where is the horror movie?  Then near the end, when treated to standard horror movie ghosts and gore, the viewer gets to relax - it is a horror movie they are watching after all.  But the camera zooms in for the last shot of the movie, and once again Kubrick shatters the viewer's expectations.The first time I saw Alan Resnais' LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD, I was convinced there was something else going on in THE SHINING. I feel that these two films are closely related (along with HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR and the last half an hour of 2001).There are aspects of our world that we just cannot express with a page of prose or a ten minute speech.  Real art puts us as close to these inexpressible concepts as we can be without actually expressing them. Even if I fully understood what THE SHINING was about, I wouldn't be able to say it.  Kubrick needed to use a horror movie to point towards something he could not talk about; he was too much of a genius to do anything less (to simply decide he felt like making a horror movie).  I think it would be a loss for someone to talk about this movie's scare-factor and leave it at that.  I've struggled with this film for twenty years and will continue to do so.  I strongly recommend to  anyone who is intrigued by THE SHINING that they watch LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD and HIROSHIMA, MON AMOUR.

However, I do not think it is a war movie.  The setting is the Vietnam War, but Kubrick is using this to talk about something else that he cannot talk about directly.  The same is true for THE SHINING.  This is not a horror movie.  It has all the attributes of a horror movie, but Kubrick is using this as a vehicle to talk about something that he cannot talk about directly.  So what is it that Kubrick can't talk about?

The opening audition scenes have their share of laughs (the woman who re-enacts The Towering Inferno; the guy who recites the female lines in Romeo & Juliet.) As the film progresses, and as we get more into the lives of Montgomery, Ralph, Coco, Doris, and Leroy, we share a fair amount of their joy and pain. The range of emotions here is more believable than the artificial worlds of recent Hollywood teen films.Of course, the movie is remembered more for it's music than anything else (evidenced by it's Oscar recognition.) Hot Lunch, which unfolds as a timid Doris looks for a place to eat, is an uncanny classic. Likewise with I Sing The Body Electric, which closes the film. And while on the subject of music, I must mention the character of Bruno; his world of synthesizers and electronic instrumentation was, as the music teacher put it, musical masturbation at the time, but would be commonplace in this decade.It may not be a classic, it may not be an epic, but it's worth seeing, especially to see Paul McCrane (now Rocket Romano on ER) in his younger days.
