[{"date":"21 November 2005","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" ELECTION, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy that'll have you laughing and rolling on the floor. Every time that music played when Tracy (Reese Witherspoon) got angry, I laughed really hard. If you ask me, she really was an overachieving straight-A student. To me, Tammy (Jessica Campbell) was a pure b****! It's hard for me to explain why. However, I thought that her brother, Paul (Chris Klein) was absolutely charming. When he was persuaded to run again Tracy, I thought, Are you doing that because you don't want her to win, Jim? After Jim (Matthew Broderick) had been stung, I felt really uneasy. Now in conclusion, if you like Matthew Broderick or Reese Witherspoon movies, this is definitely one to see. When you see it, prepare for laughs and a smashing good time. I also guarantee you you'll want to see this movie over and over again.
