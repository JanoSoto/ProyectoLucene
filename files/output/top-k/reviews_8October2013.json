Except it's not. The two main leads may be based on their human counterparts, but they do have their own characters.Basil is this egotistical but still very likable jerk-hero on a quest to match wits once again with his arch-nemesis, Professor Padriac Ratigan II. Basil has the same style as Sherlock Holmes, but the animation medium allows him to be a lot more cooky and funny than Holmes ever could be. He's really the best Disney hero. There have been a fair amount of handsome action heroes or Disney Princesses waiting to find true love. There is only ONE Basil of Baker Street, and his reputation remains untarnished by a lack of forced direct-to-video sequels.But by far the best thing this movie has going for it is Vincent Price as Professor Ratigan. Holy sh*t, this is the best villain that Disney has had. He's this egotistical, conniving, mustache-twirling villain that completely blows James Moriarty out of the water as far as enjoyability goes. He loves how much of a sick, twisted fiend he is so much that it's impossible not to enjoy it along with him.And, to date, he is the only Disney villain who actually gave our competent, highly intelligent hero a run for his money without leading to his own downfall. Yeah, really think about that. Maleficent played opposite to a guy with a sword and was taken down because she was too evil to just finish him off. Ursula's plan was to manipulate her way to the Trident but forgot to account for Prince Eric entering the equation and got stabbed for her efforts. Ratigan lost because even though he calculated every move Basil would make down to the time the Great Mouse Detective would arrive at his secret lair, coupled with the fact that he'd been beating Basil to the punch for years, Basil was able to match him and eventually best him. THAT is what a good villain does he\/she challenges and compliments the hero without compromising themselves as characters.With all that said, this movie isn't flawless. There is one scene that drags a bit where they have a tacked-on music number at a bar, but it doesn't last very long and it's pretty funny to watch after the shock of it wears off. But, despite that, I still call this the best Disney movie to date. It's message of intelligence and wit still holds up, its characters timeless and still very entertaining, its hero great, its villain great, and its villain song one of Disney's best. And THAT is why it's my favorite Disney animated movie.

This sequel is also considered a classic and I like this one even less than the first. At least the first one had a little tension. This one is just a shoot-em-up action thriller. See Aliens, shoot Aliens. Repeat as necessary. This makes for a thriller which is not particularly thrilling. Things get rather repetitive and monotonous. The film can't surprise us, we already know what the Alien is, what it's capable of. This time there are just more of them.The film picks up with our heroine Ellen Ripley awaking from a 57-year nap. While she was dozing a human colony has been established on the planet where she encountered the Alien all those years ago. In an amazingly convenient plot contrivance contact with that colony is lost soon after Ripley wakes up. Gee, what could have happened? A reluctant Ripley is sent back out into space with a team of Colonial Marines to investigate. These Marines are, by and large, idiots. They get to the colony. Surprise, nobody's there! Oh wait, they do find one survivor, a little girl who spends the rest of the movie screeching Ripley! at the top of her lungs in exceedingly annoying fashion. Speaking of annoying the most idiotic of the idiotic Marines is Pvt. Hudson, played in excruciatingly terrible fashion by Bill Paxton. With this character we're talking Jar Jar Binks levels of annoying. Just shut up. Please. Every time this guy opens his mouth you dearly wish an Alien would turn up and devour him.In the first film Ripley was not the only character you cared about. There the rest of the crew, with one notable exception, were sympathetic figures as well. No such luck here. There's one guy, Corporal Hicks, who comes off reasonably well. The rest are a collection of morons, jerks and slimeballs. With an incredibly annoying child thrown in to boot. Sigourney Weaver does the best she can, turning in a solid performance as Ripley. But she gets precious little help. Michael Biehn is pretty good as Hicks and Lance Henriksen has some good moments as an android but everyone else is quite terrible. Paxton goes way beyond terrible, he is truly wretched. The story, such as it is, doesn't thrill you. The movie takes its sweet time getting to the Alien planet and once we get there it's just a shooting gallery. Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. Eventually we come to the big finish. Here the movie does have some surprises for you if you haven't already lost interest. But ultimately this ending, like everything which precedes it, falls flat. The climactic battle is visually impressive but really quite silly. Honestly you can say that about the film as a whole. It looks good but the story is a dud. Genuine frightful moments are very few and far between. Suspense is sorely lacking. Characters say and do some of the stupidest things.

This sequel is also considered a classic and I like this one even less than the first. At least the first one had a little tension. This one is just a shoot-em-up action thriller. See Aliens, shoot Aliens. Repeat as necessary. This makes for a thriller which is not particularly thrilling. Things get rather repetitive and monotonous. The film can't surprise us, we already know what the Alien is, what it's capable of. This time there are just more of them.The film picks up with our heroine Ellen Ripley awaking from a 57-year nap. While she was dozing a human colony has been established on the planet where she encountered the Alien all those years ago. In an amazingly convenient plot contrivance contact with that colony is lost soon after Ripley wakes up. Gee, what could have happened? A reluctant Ripley is sent back out into space with a team of Colonial Marines to investigate. These Marines are, by and large, idiots. They get to the colony. Surprise, nobody's there! Oh wait, they do find one survivor, a little girl who spends the rest of the movie screeching Ripley! at the top of her lungs in exceedingly annoying fashion. Speaking of annoying the most idiotic of the idiotic Marines is Pvt. Hudson, played in excruciatingly terrible fashion by Bill Paxton. With this character we're talking Jar Jar Binks levels of annoying. Just shut up. Please. Every time this guy opens his mouth you dearly wish an Alien would turn up and devour him.In the first film Ripley was not the only character you cared about. There the rest of the crew, with one notable exception, were sympathetic figures as well. No such luck here. There's one guy, Corporal Hicks, who comes off reasonably well. The rest are a collection of morons, jerks and slimeballs. With an incredibly annoying child thrown in to boot. Sigourney Weaver does the best she can, turning in a solid performance as Ripley. But she gets precious little help. Michael Biehn is pretty good as Hicks and Lance Henriksen has some good moments as an android but everyone else is quite terrible. Paxton goes way beyond terrible, he is truly wretched. The story, such as it is, doesn't thrill you. The movie takes its sweet time getting to the Alien planet and once we get there it's just a shooting gallery. Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. Eventually we come to the big finish. Here the movie does have some surprises for you if you haven't already lost interest. But ultimately this ending, like everything which precedes it, falls flat. The climactic battle is visually impressive but really quite silly. Honestly you can say that about the film as a whole. It looks good but the story is a dud. Genuine frightful moments are very few and far between. Suspense is sorely lacking. Characters say and do some of the stupidest things.

However saying JUST this is sacrilege and I am doing no justice to the masterpiece whatsoever.The key is atmosphere.Take the never-ending cold bleak landscape starkly contrasted with constantly dripping bright red blood. This captures the mood of the film in such eloquence, that little else need be said. Killers, victims, accidents, cops and corpses, all converge on this little known town's highway, and what fate is doled out to everyone is juxtaposed against this brilliant backdrop as a silhouette, almost like the senseless bloodbath and atrocious accidents that occur plus all the deft detective work are means to this end, somehow adding up to the white expanse as an answer. To me, this concept is nothing short of fantastic.And then, the cast. Frances McDormand is undoubtedly the crowning glory of the whole piece as far as characters go, a striking picture that can be conjured up in an instant in memory - contained, affected, with a singsong accent and very pregnant. Everything she goes about is so characteristic - her pace, her actions and the way she emotes is all reminiscent of the cold and sleepy bleakness around her, and makes a sharp impression in the whole experience. In a way, one could say she seamlessly blends into the atmosphere and is like one born of it, furthering it in its own slow grinding way. Also deserving an honourable mention is Steve Buscemi, in a perfect portrayal of an agent fruitlessly battling against the natural order and shape of things - a perfect example of how small irregularities in this ingrown world have a way of ironing themselves out. He plans; he plots but ends up in a wood chipper, while the snow engulfs all.But one of the most effective and mind-blowing aspects of the film is the soundtrack. It is pretty much evident how much background score contributes to the totality of a film, and I have always been a believer in soundtracks that have different versions of a predominant motif which serve as the signature for the film, rather than an eclectic mix of contemporary music. A good soundtrack is something that evokes powerful snapshots from the film when it plays in your mind. For me, the distinctive, haunting bleak bagpipe like slow rendition of the Norweigian folk song The Lost Sheep, or natively Den Bortkomne Sauen is the landscape, the mood, the events - everything. The film artistically keeps returning to the piece in a way that leaves an indelible impression. It is like topping, a summary, everything you wanted to say about Fargo. And boy, how it does hit the final nail in the coffin...The picture in my mind when I hear it is that of the lone car driving away into the vastness of snow on the highway.

The story about a boy who had another boy living in his head &#x96; literally, began to make less and less sense as the movie progressed. Worse, the movie was sooo long.Now, I do own this book and, though I hadn't read that yet, it'll probably piece together some of the holes I couldn't follow. But, this movie did not encourage me to pick up Stephen King's novel any time soon.The movie was delayed in my viewing because, well, I am not a Timothy Hutton fan. Knowing he's playing a duel role, didn't add to the excitement I should've had for this. But, since it's October, I figured I'd finally see what this was all about 20 years after its release.From what I can recall, and forgive &#x96; it's been a couple of days, a boy's writing leads to headaches and mystical sounds of birds. Upon further examination, there was a twin lodged in his brain. We are to believe the second child, the dark half twin had been extracted and disposed of. Fast forward many years, and that boy, Thad (Hutton,) has grown up, married, had twins of his own and is a writer. Of course, in King fashion and true life, Thad has an alternative and secret name he writes under, darker stuff. Stuff that sells.But, when the idea to kill off this other penned name to avoid a blackmail subplot, all hell breaks loose. This George Stark\/Dark Half writer doesn't want to die, so he kills people and (inadvertently or not) pins the murders on Thad.Where I had a problem was was this George a split personality? Or a ghost, or made up\/made real being? Or, a grown up version of that twin in the brain that was supposed to be disposed of? That last one is the farthest stretch, and yeah, even more than a ghost. For, the twin in the brain was just an eyeball and cavity-infested teeth. Take that out, and in the 1960s, I doubt they could've reconstructed, somehow, the whole male.As I began this review, I stated this is perhaps this is my fault.

(But I don't know what has been said, as I make it a rule to not read other reviews and not be influenced.) But, as Five Easy Pieces is a 1970s classic film, it was on my short list of movies to see and I loved it. It was a very thoughtful film, with three-dimensional characters. But the main reason for my review is Karen Black. Even from the first scene she was in, I could tell she would be astounding. Her sweet, quirky, and needy disposition makes the viewer feel her pain, and the scenes where she says Do you love me? or Say you love me breaks your heart. She was truly exceptional and I don't know why she didn't win an Oscar. Jack goes home when he hears news that his father has had a heart attack and he tries to make amends with him, but they never saw eye to eye.

Add a waitress who won't cooperate and a crazy woman sermonizing about too much stuff and being wasteful and costarring Sally Struthers from All in the Family in a memorable role, Five Easy Pieces is a crazy, serious look at being one's self, knowing what one wants out of life, and putting in the hard work in life to get ahead.

Although the screenplay isn't explicitly a fantasy or a fable, it seems to be set in an alternate world where walls and gardens and backgrounds scream and vibrate with color and icons and swirling shapes, to the point where it is sometimes difficult to actually pay attention to the actors. Sights and sounds are cranked up to the point of absurdity and I tend to finish his films feeling as if I'd been forced to take peyote and then roll strapped in a wheelchair through a MOMA exhibition with my eyelids propped open by toothpicks.I'm OK with that though.

Despite being made in the mid-90s it felt like an 80s movie in terms of style and setting - reminded me of Children of the Corn or The Lost Boys in terms of where it was set. The cast was pretty decent with the likes of Walken, Mortensen, Stoltz, Koteas, Goldberg and Madsen all doing a good job, but not amazing, and overall it was more enjoyable than I expected. In terms of an overall rating I would say about a 7.5 but as halves aren't available on here I've marked it as 7\/10.
