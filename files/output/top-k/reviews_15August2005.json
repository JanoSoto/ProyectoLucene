They act exquisitely well together, and it shows in the emotion brought forth in each and every scene. I love the way the characters pause between lines, as if they are truly living in the moment. Anthony Hopkins uses his traditional crescendo and decrescendo in the conversations, and it makes every scene he is in wonderful to watch. Claire Forlani is absolutely breathtaking, as usual. She displays her emotions in this movie with such elegance. She appears to be a very strong woman, using her intellect even in the characters she plays. Her relationship with her father, Anthony Hopkins, is something every little girl dreams of. The couple played by Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor display what appears like true affection for each other. They complement each other perfectly. If you love to hate someone in films, then Drew, played by Jake Weber is your man in this one. He is despicable. In all, I have seen this movie a total of 20 times, or more. I lost count. However, I never grow tired of watching it. It is spellbinding and although I am NOT an emotional person by any means, I cry during this movie every time I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to see a truly great movie with a great performance from all actors involved.

I've only seen Sibirskiy tsiryulnik or The Barber of Siberia as it is called in English. That movie wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't great either. I feared that this one would offer the same mix of slapstick-like humor and drama. But this certainly wasn't the case and this movie actually made me look forward to more Russian movies.In the summer of 1936, the revolutionary hero Colonel Kotov is spending an idyllic summer in his dacha with his young wife and six-year-old daughter Nadia, other family members and friends. Everything seems to be perfect, until Dmitri or Mitya as he is called most of the time, returns from Moscow unannounced, shocking the idyllic picture. He is able to charm the women and little Nadia with his games and by playing the piano, but Kotov knows better. Dmitri works for the NKVD and that his visit has nothing to do with seeing some old friends again...I must say that in the beginning I thought my worst fears about this movie were coming true. I had the feeling that this was another movie that tried very hard not to be taken very serious. But that was only in the beginning. Once you get to see how the tension between Mitya and the other members of the family and in particular with Marusia builds up, how Mitya struggles with his inner demons, how he has to make sure that the others don't know what is going on,... this movie started to become a lot more interesting for me. So much even, that I really started to like it a lot.Another reason why I liked it so much was the fact that the acting by all the actors was so nice. Oleg Menshikov was excellent in his role of Dimitri, Nikita Mikhalkov was very good as Colonel Kotov and Ingeborga Dapkunaite very nice as his wife. But if I have to pick one actor that I liked the most, than I choose the young and amazing Nadezhda Mikhalkova. She was so perfectly convincing in her role as the young Nadya that she made me completely forget about the fact that she was acting in this movie. What she did in this movie felt all so natural and real, that from time to time she almost made me forget about the other actors.Overall this is a very nice movie about an interesting chapter in the Russian history. The fact that a movie that deals with Stalin's repression and paranoia and the many murders performed in his name, is capable of doing so without really showing any graphic violence but only gives hints, is just wonderful. It takes the viewer serious by leaving him \/ her the chance to think for him- \/ herself and doesn't have to show every little detail in order to make it become some easy entertainment.

One of the reasons, often neglected today in Hollywood, is that it had a phenomenal script. Such witty, intelligent dialogue. See 100 movies of today, and you won't find its equal. A second reason - a perfect cast. Bette Davis, who filmed her role in a mere 10 days and had to have oil treatments because of a throat problem, is monumental as Margo Channing. It's really a women's picture all the way - Anne Baxter as Eve Harrington, Celeste Holm as Karen - these are all strong roles. Though the arch Addison DeWitt is brilliantly played by George Sanders, this role, too, has the feel of a woman's part in its manipulativeness and bitchiness. That may not be very PC to say, but there it is.Of all the scenes, I think my favorite has to be that one that takes place in the theater when Margo arrives very late for the understudy audition. What fireworks, what staging, Bette on the stage, Max and Lloyd yelling from the audience - Are you threatening me with legal action...(Bette stomps out cigarette with foot)...Mr. Fabian? Fantastic.I take issue with only one point, and it's a small one. Mankiewicz did not want to cast Jeanne Crain as Eve. He didn't think she was a good enough actress. Okay, but I still maintain that in the beginning of the film, Crain's genuine all-American look and real sweetness would have been great and would have given no hint of the Eve to come. I admit that she probably couldn't have pulled off the rest, but for me, Baxter was a fairly obvious conniver. I realized that Mankiewicz has it set up that way, as she interrupts Bill and Margo's kiss, but Crain would have looked innocent as all get-out. Also, Margo's jealousy of Eve and fear that Bill was attracted to her would have been more understandable. Just an opinion.The third reason - A great director. Joseph Mankewicz has written and directed a fantastic film about theater that, 55 years later, not only holds up on its own but has a life of its own. There is today a Sarah Siddons Award, the term Eve Harrington is used commonly in theater to denote an ingénue waiting to pounce on a role; Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night, is one of Davis' most famous lines; and, last but not least, it spawned the musical Applause, which I frankly have never been able to warm up to.

However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this Twelve Monkeys I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too.

Light sabers, UFO's, aliens, time traveling... most of the time it's nothing for me. However, there is one movie in the genre that I'll always give a place in my list of top movies and that's this Twelve Monkeys I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time, but even now, after having it seen several times already, I'm still one of its biggest fans. Every time I see it, this movie seems to get better and better.Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only 1 percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them. He's a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a 'volunteer' to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called 'The Twelve Monkeys' and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not. Is this just an illusion, created in the mind of a mentally ill man or is it real? Does he really come from the future and can he really travel through time? Was the population really wiped out by a virus, released by the army of The Twelve Monkeys? Those are all questions that will leave you wondering from the beginning until the end. If the makers of this movie had chosen to make it all more obvious, I'm sure that I would never have liked it as much as I did now. It's just that mysteriousness that keeps me interested time after time. But that's not the only good thing about this movie of course. The acting is amazing too. Normally I'm not too much a fan of Bruce Willis, but what he did in this movie was just astonishing. Together with Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt he should have won several awards for it, because together with the amazing story, they made this movie work so incredibly well.Even after several viewings, I'm still a huge fan of this movie. Except for this movie, I have only seen one other Terry Gilliam movie and that's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which wasn't bad, but didn't really convince me either.

And you really wonder how Nick has his job, with all of the compromises he makes for relationships (as with Mac and Joanne).But, Mel Gibson's eyes when he tells Michelle Pfeiffer about his interest in her... swoon!

This film gives us more of a 'fly on the wall' perspective of how these characters live.One thing it tells us is that not all drug addicts are sick-looking, pus-oozing, rotten-toothed, incoherent, granny-mugging gutter-dwellers. Some drug addicts actually function in society, and some people actually *like* living the junkie lifestyle. They get off on the adrenaline rush of the robberies, burglaries, the whole thing of planning and executing the caper. Sure, the drugs they score are supposed to be the reward, but the satisfaction of a job well done is nearly right up there with the drugs.To look at any of the main characters would not cause drug addict to leap into your head. And that's not because it's a film and they're actors. People like this actually exist. Look at how many famous people seek treatment for drug addiction to prescription drugs (drugs are drugs, prescription or not). You wouldn't pick them as junkies, would you? Probably not.Bob, the patriarch of this little family of druggies, is very street smart. He is 26. He is highly intelligent, plans meticulously, and is very authoritative in the way he runs things. Bob could've been somebody, if he'd have used his planning and management skills for a 'straight life'. He loves his wife, Diane, whom he's know since childhood, and the fact that they are married, being druggies in the 'free love' days, says to me that they are traditionalists, in some weird way. But despite Bob's intelligence, he is very superstitious and believes in hexes - so much so, that he plans his jobs around superstitious events.Bob and Diane have no children, but have two other young addicts living with them, who function as the children in this family. Through the course of the film, they live in various apartments or houses, much better than you'd expect of a group of junkies. And Diane always looks nice, stylish and clean.In order for us to view Bob as a sympathetic character, he can't go out with a gun or a knife, robbing gas stations and convenience stores. So to keep the group in drugs, lodging, and food, Bob does all the planning for their livelihood - ripping off drug stores, and hospital pharmacies (the Holy Grail, in Bob's way of looking at things). Everyone in the family has a role to play - driver, diversion, thief (Bob's job). While the pharmacist is distracted, Bob grabs anything he can get his hands on. The good stuff gets sorted from the bad stuff (eg laxatives), as soon as they get back to their rented digs. No violence is involved.It's not really shown, only briefly touched upon in one scene with a rat-like neighbor, but they have to be doing a decent trade selling this stuff, to pay the rent and buy food (no supermarket I've ever heard of allows people pay for groceries with Dilaudid or 'ludes).And, although it's referred to once, the film doesn't show the nausea and vomiting, and other side-effects (intestinal problems like severe constipation) that can be associated with IV drug use (Heather Graham's character, a drugs newbie, is told to go take her hit, puke for a while, and enjoy the high). For the majority of the time, we see the characters as clear-eyed and lucid. They appear to be quite healthy.The police know that Bob is involved in the pharmacy thefts, but cannot seem to pin him down (James Remar is very good here as the detective who's got Bob's number).Throughout this film, we watch this group of addicts go about their everyday business. We see them hit the road when the heat is on, with Bob and Diane making meticulous plans to send the drugs ahead so that they have drugs waiting for them in every city (thus eliminating the risk of being caught travelling with a big stash).Despite all of Bob's smarts, he is ultimately undone by a superstition, which seems to set a chain of events in motion. Through these events, the lives of everyone in the household are changed forever.The film may gloss over some of the ugly aspect of the druggie lifestyle, which can make it appear more like an alternative lifestyle, than what most would consider a deviant one (this is why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10). Yet despite that, it is not a film that celebrates the druggie lifestyle. It just portrays it as it is, for the most part.

Through these events, the lives of everyone in the household are changed forever.The film may gloss over some of the ugly aspect of the druggie lifestyle, which can make it appear more like an alternative lifestyle, than what most would consider a deviant one (this is why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10). Yet despite that, it is not a film that celebrates the druggie lifestyle. It just portrays it as it is, for the most part. The moral judgment is not made by the film, but is left to the viewer (as is Bob's fate, I believe).

That's also the reason why I was looking forward to this movie, hoping that it would be at least as good as these other two.Tillsammans or Together in English is the name of the commune in which Göran lives in 1975.

Ferrucio reads a poem, Guido listens, the car brakes fail, but Guido thinks it is part of the story. It is the whole movie in a nutshell and a prelude of things to come. As a result of the brake failure they enter the village where he is hailed as The Great Dictator, in a scene meant as a tribute to that movie. Later we have the two children Adolf and Benito fighting on the bench. And the rather funny scene where Guido explains what it means to be Arian to the children as fake inspector.The first half shows the simple life in an Italian village, with Guido falling in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The rise of fascism is told as a background story first, but soon invades every facet of life. Guido later has married Dora and they have a child Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini). Guido has set up a book store (a reference to the burning of books by the Nazis). The second part starts with the train transport of all, with Guido commenting on the train ride to his son It's the kind of risky humor that Benigni uses by mocking the whole Nazi-regime and its procedures. We see this again when the camp rules are translated by Guido.Of course this is not a real concentration camp, Benigni abstracts the horrors (almost nothing is shown) to make the Nazis look ridiculous in their manners and behavior. Guido remains more or less the same human he was in Italy, only his environment changes and that makes the dehumanizing of the Nazi-victims only more poignant. The movie also keeps the Nazis consistently inhuman as there is not one human aspect in the whole movie to be seen of them. Even the friendly Dr. Lessing is turned in a non-human (He only saves Guido for his own riddles, and shows no interest in saving Dora). And the movie also works by showing only the perspective of one family that almost breathes life. But the movie is too long in the beginning and lingers somewhat (the uncle's house for example). It all feels like watching a movie from the 40s or 50s, even in the acting and direction.When this movie came out, there was some debate about whether it was ethical to make a comedy about concentration camps. Roberto Benigni knew he took an enormous risk with this movie, and in lesser comedy hands this would not have worked out the way it did. But as art is all about taking risks, he was correctly rewarded for a new addition to coping with the history of the holocaust.

Clarke had previously stood as the co-creator of 2001, but this film reveals him as a mere contributor.CD ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"15 August 2005","score":"","review":" I had never heard of Andy Kaufman before seeing this film so i came to it with an open mind and loved it! Jim Carrey is fantastic and i went onto the internet to download clips of Andy straight after watching the film and couldn't believe how right Jim got it! I would recommend this movie to anyone. I've read lots of people complaining about its inaccuracies but regardless of it being completely factual or not, it is an amazing film! It did mess with my head a little but i thought this was the best way it could have been done as it made me want to learn more about Andy and Bob Zmuda and try to get the facts for myself. I think Man On The Moon is a fitting way to pay tribute to Andy and if more people get to hear about this fantastic man through it then so much for the better!

The sets, acting and action were utterly consistent and convincing. Mickey Rourke lived the role, making rumpled, street wise Harry Angel by far his best role. DeNiro and Rampling were their usual good. The only stunt was the hoopla surrounding the sex scene with Lisa Bonet, but that was consistent with the plot too. The atmosphere of the whole movie was unrelenting doom and the imagery, from the fans, elevators and old buildings sets supported that consistently. Not for the weak at heart, it has a few sick scenes and a general air of brutality, it's a film about evil and the Devil.
