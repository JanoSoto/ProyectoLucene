He has also made some wonderfully touching movies like 'A Simple Twist of Fate' where his acting ability really shows through. Unfortunately he does have a knack of making too many films that are merely mediocre or worse; films like 'Mixed Nuts' 'Sgt. Bilko' 'Bringing down the House' and 'Cheaper by the Dozen'I am pleased to say that Bowfinger shows us Steve Martin close to his best; he plays the lead role and he also wrote this totally crazy, unbelievable and madcap comedy; and it is genuinely funny for all the right reasons. It is cleverly written and has a really interesting storyline. I thought it was brilliant fun, and well worth watching.Steve Martin Fans will love this one 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 December 2006","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Steve Martin has made some fine comedy movies - 'The Man with two Brains' 'All of Me' 'Dirty Rotten Scoudrels' and 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles' to name just few.

Grandma starts talking in a total non sequitur about how she likes the roller coaster better than the merry-go-round at the amusement park. Something about how the merry-go-round is so predictable, and the roller coaster isn't. Then, when they're at their kid's play, and the littlest one runs up on stage, Gil\/Steve Martin is reminded of the roller coaster analogy; that parenthood is so unpredictable. It's terrifying, yet fun, cos you don't know what life is going to deal you. This isn't a very good description--I haven't had coffee yet and I'm not very articulate this morning. But if you're a parent--you have GOT to see this. I bawl like a baby.
