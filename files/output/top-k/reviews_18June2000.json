It managed to hold my attention and keep me interested.  I expect it will be very popular with audiences and may be the first film ever by an African American director to reach the one hundred million dollar finish line in North America.  John Singleton and company have put together a good looking, entertaining action film full of solid performances and funny dialogue.  So why am I so reluctant to give this film my full reccomendation?      I know some of you are saying to yourselves well if you enjoyed the movie, what's the problem?  Well, for starters, Christian Bale's role seems like it was added to the plot as an afterthought.  The plot is almost laughably implausible at some points.  The drug lord's henchmen have got to be some of the most inept thugs I have ever seen in this type of film.      The real discovery of this film is Jeffery Wright as the Dominican Drug lord Peoples Hernandez.  He really has fun with this role, overflowing with charisma and sleazy charm.  He comes of like a more benevolent Tony Montana.      So in the end, I give this film a reluctant reccomendation, because it manages to give it's audiences a good time.

It resonates much like the Dance of the Wolves.

The plot is not very complex, but the story is very complicated. There are many symbolisms and messages that you will need to pay attention to; there is a lot more to the movie than what meets the eyes. Every scene has a special message that you will really need to analyze in order to understand why they are showing you what they are showing you. There are also a lot of conflicts on ideology and ethics in this film. I also thought that Dennis Quaid is superb in this film. He succeeds in brining a subtle emotional depth to a person who is supposedly numbed by his experience with deaths. However, if you just sit there passively, this movie will really try your patience. If I want to make a criticism, it will be the budget. This film was probably (surely...?) made on a limited budget and it showed. Other than that, this is a great film!

(skillfully played by Morgan Freeman) and his young upstart sidekick (Brad Pitt) manage to unravel the case, but at huge personal cost to both.Its difficult to know where to start when praising such a brilliant film. But to begin with some of Fincher's old Alien3 directing habits are carried into this film. Most of the story is set in miserable, dank, wet and gloomy places - but this isn't a complaint but only adds to the foreboding that awaits us. You feel as if you're swimming in a pool of slime trying to keep afloat as Fincher moves from one scene to another, never letting the viewer, or indeed the main characters time to take a breath.Fortunately Fincher doesn't go over the top showing us every murder in explicit detail. He knows we are intelligent enough to work out in our own fetid imaginations what the camera doesn't allow us to see. But having said that, the corpses that we do see would make even Dirty Harry choke!Editing & lighting also go hand in hand with the cinematography, so too does the splatter-punk music score that surrounds the start & finish of the film. In fact its like a conspiracy against the audience - all the unit directors of the film crew (art, sound,2nd unit, editing, score etc) have ganged up with Fincher to give the viewer a real hard time - a feeling of truly being out there with Freeman & Pitt.Morgan Freeman is, as always, a pleasure to watch. He seems to have hit all the right moves these last few years, especially in the underrated Shawshank Redemption. His character is very slow, methodical, patient...all those things his partner, Brad Pitt, lacks so glaringly,Pitt is perfect for the young brash detective. The two cops remind me of reading a book - Freeman plays the cop page by page by page never wanting to cut a corner or skip a detail; while Pitt plays his character chapter by chapter, ever moving forward, not having the patience to look at the minute details on each page...and boy does he get the Early Morning Wakeup Call at the end of the film!!!!But to my mind, Kevin Spacey, who plays Jon Doe, is the real king player here. Critically acclaimed in The Usual Suspects, LA Confidential & Glengarry Glen Ross), Spacey pulls off yet another masterclass act here.He is not a madman or psychopath (as Brad Pitt feels he is) even though his crimes would make you think otherwise. Instead he is just a well-educated citizen who has simply had enough of seeing society fall apart outside his front door, and the police & the courts are seen as being impotent to do anything about it.Spacey knows what Fincher wants from his character and plays it with relish; similar to John Malkovich's Mitch Leary character in Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire.This isn't a glamour film that will make you glow & smile when you leave the theatre. This film wants to crush you with the sordid reality of what is actually happening to us all out there - a film that tells it as it is, and not as Hollywood wants us to view the world from their glittering perspective.Se7en is a film where other detective films should be judged.

There's not a hint of recognition.  If A Time to Kill had merely glorified violence, it would have been a much less despicable production; after all, it's possible to glorify something without endorsing it.Although Hailey is a much nicer person than the two men who rape his daughter, he has committed a greater crime than they have.  For one thing he kills the two rapists BEFORE their trial.  They MIGHT, after all, be convicted; indeed, there's no indication that their won't be the most anyone says is that they `might' get off.  Hailey doesn't even wait and see.  He simply strides into the town courtroom - the COURTROOM if THIS isn't a crime against society, I'd like to know what is - and shoots away, incidentally wounding a police officer and causing him to lose his leg.  (If part of the rapists' crime was that they maimed an innocent person, well, Hailey also maims an innocent person.)

This is Woody Allen being funny without any axes to grind, with much less neurosis nor self-deprecation, without too many marital complications; in short, a film much closer to Scenes from a Mall than to Husbands and Wives or Deconstructing Harry. Here is Allen enjoying himself with a remark about the c'mon back profession or the Polish car pool where everyone meets at work at the same time.  He is also harping back to two comedic couples he enjoyed, Ralph and Alice's knucklehead confrontations from 'The Honeymooners' and the seemingly moronic dialogue of Mike Nichols and Elaine May.  There is also a lot of malapropism in this movie, most of it funny, because all his characters are missing at least one screw - 'Treasure Island for Treasure of Sierra Madre', Harry James for Henry James, and 'one of those higher King Louies'.  Ray and Frenchy (aka Ralph and Alice but really Woody Allen and Tracy Ullman) get us going with an incessant trail of barbs and insults as Ray tries to pry away their life's savings for a not-too-well-thought-out bank robbery.  When Ray compliments himself as being Frenchy's smart husband, Frenchy says she must be a bigamist.  When Ray mentions his dumb conspirators to Frenchy, she remarks they must have been drafted right out of kindergarten.

Here is Allen enjoying himself with a remark about the c'mon back profession or the Polish car pool where everyone meets at work at the same time.  He is also harping back to two comedic couples he enjoyed, Ralph and Alice's knucklehead confrontations from 'The Honeymooners' and the seemingly moronic dialogue of Mike Nichols and Elaine May.

Joseph Strick's brave attempt to film Joyce's Ulysses shows just how hard it is to capture the spirit of a serious literary work. In this case the adapters have done quite well in conveying some of the appeal of the book, but the film is a pretty bleak one, with less of the book's lightness of touch, without with it would have been unreadable. Frank McCourt's memoir of growing up in the grinding poverty of  the lanes of Limerick is a pretty grim tale, but it is made bearable by his storytelling style. In the film it rains all the time and everyone is miserable, even the relatively well-off, and there is little light relief.I thought Robert Carlyle was terrific as Dad, the lively, useless drunk it was hard to dislike, and Emily Watson as Angela the put upon mother was equally effective. Both were a bit too clean-cut to be totally realistic, but then the rest of the squalor was laid on pretty thick. Frank is portrayed by three different actors whose performances blend in so well that it is not until the end when we see them together do we realise how different they look. The authority figures - priests, schoolteachers and charity officials are generally pretty grim and uncaring, often displaying an element of sadism,, though one old teacher recognises Frank's abilities and tries to get him into high school. The school was run by the notorious Christian Brothers so perhaps Frank had a lucky escape.The general lack of charity displayed by almost everybody is quite remarkable; the help the McCourts did get from their family, neighbours and the church was grudging and  minimal. Dad was a drunk, so they were consigned to the ranks of the undeserving poor. A much warmer and perhaps more authentic view of poor Irish life is given in My Left Foot where the whole street helps Christy to overcome his disabilities.Despite the grim background the surviving members of the family did far better that one might have expected, with Frank going on to a career as a teacher in the US and becoming the author of a couple of best-sellers. Malachi, one of his younger brothers, who became a bar-owner has also done well with his own memoir, and the other brothers did all right too. At the end of this film, Frank is back in America, like millions before him, to make a new life in a new land but probably would have succeeded in Ireland, if he had stayed.

For this lame brained comedy, beyond being incredibly juvenile and silly in its comedic temperament, also manages to be as politically incorrect as possible, using as its targets the obese, the handicapped and an assortment of social outcasts and misfits.  And, although the ribbing is generally quite good-natured and even affectionate at times, one can't help but feel a little guilty about laughing.The formula for the film adheres very closely to the one employed by virtually all Saturday Night Live or Second City alumni in their initial forays into big screen comedies.  Once again we have the usual bumbling nerd trying to win acceptance as a `cool dude,' making a shambles of everything he touches, yet ultimately managing to garner the respect of his peers and the love of a beautiful woman.  Rob Schneider plays the title role, a professional fish tank cleaner who, through a complicated series of circumstances, finds himself delving into the realm of `man whore' in order to earn some much needed money.  The stupidity of the premise and the situations cannot be underestimated as Schneider is put through a series of pratfalls, misunderstandings and verbal slugfests that are often quite amusing almost in spite of themselves.  It takes either a certain amount of daring or a shocking degree of insensitivity (or perhaps a little of both) to line up a series of jokes and sight gags aimed at people who suffer from obesity, Tourettes Syndrome, Narcolepsy, blindness and limb amputation  - but this film does it.  Somehow, though, the film manages to treat its characters with such a genial fondness that it never seems particularly harsh or mean spirited.  Whether or not that mitigates the feeling of guilt resulting from one's laughter must, finally, be a matter of personal conscience I suppose.Schneider plays the lead in a nicely relaxed fashion, not succumbing to the hyperbolic mugging that so many comics are prone to indulge in when faced with similar roles.  And what a pleasant surprise to encounter Marlo Thomas of all people in an uncredited cameo appearance &#150; and still looking like a knockout in her sexy lingerie.  `Deuce Bigalow' may not sit well with the easily offended or with those who prefer their comedy to be of a bit more - um, shall we say - cerebral nature.

It takes either a certain amount of daring or a shocking degree of insensitivity (or perhaps a little of both) to line up a series of jokes and sight gags aimed at people who suffer from obesity, Tourettes Syndrome, Narcolepsy, blindness and limb amputation  - but this film does it.  Somehow, though, the film manages to treat its characters with such a genial fondness that it never seems particularly harsh or mean spirited.  Whether or not that mitigates the feeling of guilt resulting from one's laughter must, finally, be a matter of personal conscience I suppose.Schneider plays the lead in a nicely relaxed fashion, not succumbing to the hyperbolic mugging that so many comics are prone to indulge in when faced with similar roles.  And what a pleasant surprise to encounter Marlo Thomas of all people in an uncredited cameo appearance &#150; and still looking like a knockout in her sexy lingerie.  `Deuce Bigalow' may not sit well with the easily offended or with those who prefer their comedy to be of a bit more - um, shall we say - cerebral nature.  Still, unabashed silliness makes for a fun time every now and then and, in that spirit, this film deserves to be seen.

It may be because I am a bit of Star Trek fan and have been to one (just one) convention that this film uses as a starting point.  The film-makers have managed to capture the spirit of the Trek religion, combining elements of parody and homage, all packaged into a story that would satisfy most fans of the multiple incarnations of the TV show.  If you're not a fan of Star Trek, don't let this put you off for a minute.  You will still get a brilliantly entertaining film, just without the multiple in-jokes scattered throughout. If you are at all familiar with Star Trek I don't need to recommend this film because you have probably already seen it.Galaxy Quest is one of those films that provides so many wonderful talk-about-after-the-movie scenes that you keep interrupting one recount because you are in danger of forgetting another.  Like all good Star Trek episodes, the greatest force in the film is derived not from special effects and blasting lasers (although these are top-notch), but from the characters. All of the actors make excellent contributions, especially Sam Rockwell as the hapless extra.  He manages to steal a large number of the movie's comic scenes.  (He reminds me a lot of Bill Paxton's nervous and jumpy character in Aliens)  Alan Rickman, as always, combines pompous humour with dramatic depth.  His scene with a diehard alien fan near the end of the movie was surprisingly moving.Overlook the major plotholes (such as, why did the aliens think that they had to make a spaceship when they believed everything in the show was real! The actors would already have a ship!)  Getting caught up with the details of this movie is to become the butt of the movie's major joke.  It is just a movie, but much more.I rarely see a movie twice and enjoy it equally both times.  Galaxy Quest is such a movie.  Never give up!  Never surrender!

That's nevertheless what he did by way of Richard Lester's Superman III. Before other stars like Eddie Murphy, Will Smith and even Bill Cosby.After the epic original and the more dashing and dark sequel, Superman III turned out to be a true delight that nurtured its roots but also subtlety re-invented the formula. Once again offering neat visuals, there's also loads of laughs and an inventive plot. As Superman seemed to have run out of villains after the first two movies, finding him a worthy adversary would be the main concern. Enter the computer age. Superman III not only boldly paired the Man of Steel with an African-American sidekick, it had him battle a piece of machinery. Real sign of the times however the super computer.  A computer capable of everything from changing the weather conditions in South America to switching the traffic lights in Metropolis. This makes for an interesting sequence in which Superman battles his own evil twin &#150; created by computer genius Gus Gorman (Pryor) from a defunct recipe of Kryptonite (with a little help from a pack of Camels, naturally).  Superman III was bold; casting Pryor was one thing, but also notably missing is the omnipresent crime lord Lex Luthor as portrayed by Gene Hackman. To take his place are some new villainous characters; Robert Vaughn as the slick and sharp corporate mogul Ross Webster with Annie Ross as the bitchy sister-in-crime Vera Webster. Annette O'Toole is endearing as Superman's new love interest Lana Lang (staying true to the origins), and Gavin O'Herlihy makes for a great alcoholic small-town loser in Brad &#150; a man who cherishes his high school football achievements but hasn't taken another step since then. Jackie Cooper, Margot Kidder and Marc McClure all return &#150; only for small scenes &#150; but they lend the movie a nice continuity.  However, it's Lester's comic take on everything (and Pryor in top form) together with a strong performance by Reeve that saves the day. Richard Pryor has great mannerisms and Superman III ranks among this great comedian's best films. Reeve seems grittier than before and his transition  into his &#145;evil' alter ego makes for some intriguing scenes as Superman becomes frighteningly subversive. Well done.  Side-note The opening slapstick sequence &#150; meticulously crafted by Lester &#150; is straight out camp but makes for a charming set-piece in the tradition of Blake Edward's Pink Panther series.
