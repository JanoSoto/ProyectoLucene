The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?SPOILERS FOLLOWFirst of all, people get their hopes up so high when they see this film that, it's to the point, if it doesn't change their life it's considered to be boring and dated. But, also, people also down vote it when it threatens the popularity of their trendy LOTR flicks and other movies that make you 'cool' if you like them.Acting - Brando was so subtle and yet had such a dramatic impact on the way acting was done. I have images from this film that I remember, and mostly I remember Brando holding the cat in the opening scene. His voice has influenced modern film and television - as almost every show on television has paid homage to the father of all film. Score - The score is haunting, and somber in all aspects of the word. It builds emotional tension and it has a pay off. The main theme is amazing and is beautifully put together and is always in the right context when it shows up in the film. It's beautiful, and I strongly urge you to get the original soundtrack.Direction - Francis Ford Coppola took a very subtle and consistent approach in bringing this film to life. Think of Michael in the diner with Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo, as the train is perfectly timed in going by, before Michael (in Al Pacino's career making performance) explodes with rage. It is so apparent in his face, and we feel as he does -- nervous yet we still anticipate. Story - The script is very well written, adapted from the brutal book by the brilliant Mario Puzo. The story of the film was ahead of it's time - and it still is. While being played on television today there are still people who refuse to like this simply because it's hyped. They try to go against anything that's popular in an attempt to look cool. It doesn't work - so give me The Godfather over Pulp Fiction (and all of the hip crime film copy cats that it spawned. i.e. The Usual Suspects which is ranked higher than ON THE WATERFRONT -- what is wrong with our society?)Everything is perfect as we become immersed in the world of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and we're along for the ride as well follow him through a few years of his life. This film changed the way I saw art within movies.Yes, I hated it the first time I watched it. But, for some reason, felt I should watch it again. On the second viewing it was confirmed; I hated it. I trashed it everywhere, including on this site, and made it sound like the worst movie ever made. Boy, how much I've grown. I trashed it because I didn't want to be caught up in the frenzy this movie has produced. It created a whole spawn of copy-cats and followers trying to capture the art as The Godfather did, and sadly, it will never happen. This will never be duplicated or surpassed in any sense. From start to finish I am completely captivated at the imagery, the music, the brilliant acting, and the underlying script that holds so much warmth, and brutality.For any true fan of film - do not hate this simply because you want to be 'different' from others and look like some sort of outsider since you went against society by not liking a great movie just to prove how original you are. Face it, you're not original - you're doing the same thing others have done when it comes to this film for years, and as I once done as well.

I was reading Maxim magazine a while ago and they had a list of the 50 Greatest B-Movies of all time, and knowing me, I of course have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them. This is why you see reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy on my list. So I noticed H.O.T.S. at the video store the other day and recognized it from Maxim's list of the 50 greatest B-movies, and I decided to rent it and check it out. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from a list of B-movies, so I already knew it was going to suck. Given the type of movie that it is, I can't say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure, since it is nothing more than a late 70s T&A film, and it never pretends to by anything else. The only place where it strays widely from its objective is in a ragged subplot involving a couple of ex-cons who have stashed a lot of stolen money in the house that the self-named H.O.T.S. move in to, because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. Despite the fact that the rest of the movie is as well, this subplot is completely superfluous and unnecessary. The story is based on a couple of rival sororities at the beloved F.U., which exists as one of those Universities that contains a grand total of one sorority until the rejects form their own in order to get back at the snobs in the other one. This new sorority, Help Out The Seals (H.O.T.S.), is a sorority supposedly based on helping seals (the seal subplot is another one that doesn't really belong in the movie, and little attention is paid to the meaning of that name beyond having a seal running around here and there throughout the movie).  This is going to sound weird, but there was actually one scene that I was pretty impressed with in this movie. One SHOT that I was impressed with, I should say. About midway through the movie, one of the girls in Pi, the rival sorority, is pouring alcohol into the punch, and she pours some for herself in a glass and drinks it. Oddly enough, what she does as she drinks that alcohol reminds me of something that Charlie Chaplin would do, which really brightened up the movie. Obviously, nothing in this movie comes close to anything that Chaplin ever did, but that shot alone raised my score for the movie from a 2 to a 4.As a whole, however, the movie is exactly what you would expect it to be, a lot of people running around looking for excuses to take off their clothes (I liked how the remove-one-piece-of-clothing-for-every-score in the football game at the end was one of the GIRLS' ideas. Riiiiiiiiight&#133;), and not much thought is put into much of anything else. There is, for example, a scene early in the film when a couple of the Pi girls pour hot sauce into the refreshments at a H.O.T.S. party, accidentally getting caught in an incriminating photograph (the girl taking the picture didn't realize that she photographed them at the time), although the photograph never comes up for any reason later in the film. I've seen movies like this before, it's kind of like Gator Bait but without the violence and the rednecks and Coffy wasn't far off. Even Barb Wire is much the same, just with a bigger budget and more silicon.

This after forging a solid carrier on gothic, post-modern and often anti-climactic movies where Burton rejected all Hollywood conventions of pleasing an audience. Of the two, 'Sleepy Hollow' is more fun and more exciting. 'Planet of the Apes', taken on it's own right, is not a bad movie - if you accept that it's content to being just another mindless summer popcorn flick. It's a fun diversion for someone wanting to just sit back and stare at the screen (that is a compliment even though it doesn't sound like one).The movie looks great. It's probably his best looking movie. The makeup, costumes, stunts, cinematography, everything looks good. Which really helped pump up the entertainment (and the final score) when the script is giving us silly puns and 1-liners obviously designed be used in the trailer. The highlight one of Danny Elfman's best scores since 'Men in Black'. He and Burton give this one a more techno look and sound then the other films. The movie is worth seeing just for Danny Elfman fans (which I am). The low-point Mark Walburg's wooden acting. It's mostly because of this movie and actors like him that I divided up my 'Acting' category to score in two different sections one for the Lead and one for the Supporting Players. Because while Walburg drags down the action, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are really giving their all behind those Ape costumes. Roth's rants and raves make for a great villain. Lastly, I loved the ending. It's the best part of the movie. I like the epic imagery of the final shot. I like the fact that it's open-ended enough to send the viewer scratching their head as to it's meaning. And I like how Burton has thrown in hints and lines of logic here and there (Lincoln freed the slaves) to send us on that journey for a meaning- even if there isn't one. Try to follow me on this (my explination is not the best) This is the type of enigmatic ending people want when they see what they think is an otherwise brilliant movie fall apart or get conventional in the end by resolving itself (Signs, 28 Days Later, ect.). When a movie is mysterious people aren't happy with any ending. This is an ending that doesn't really end anything. Truly open to interpretation. But this is coming from someone who doesn't think there is anything cinematically sacrilegious about remaking 'Planet of the Apes'. It was a movie for it's time and place and I get it's campy cult following, but a cinema classic to high and mighty to be remade? Hardly. It could be done and it could be done much better. The problem is that this movie will be remembered more for what it isn't then what it is. Burton and his writers had a chance to take this creatively fertile premise and really do something different with it - show us something edgy, that we've never seen before. It would seem like Burton would be a perfect fit for a PofA remake- well, the old Tim Burton. Yet, he does nothing different here. Instead of telling his own story he just remakes the original film sticking pretty close to it's existing framework but coloring in the lines with a glossier hue. As a result the movie isn't much better or worse then the original film - and it isn't helped by it's built-in lack of originality and clear reliance on the original film.

Something drew me to this title even though I had never heard of it, and I was not disappointed which is more than can be said of some blockbusters that make it to the big screen.  Val is an underrated actor that is too often passed off as female eye-candy, and there were no duff performances from his peers either. Beautifully shot, carefully paced, and cleverly put together, you will be rivetted from start to finish. Yes, I have read all the comments and comparisons with Trainspotting and Memento, but this stands up well by itself, and is one of the very, very few films I have ever said to friends you must see this and shoved a copy under their nose (I can only think of Donny Darko and Best Laid Plans recently). The part where his drug-addled mates plot to steal Bob Hopes stool sample to sell on Ebay made me laugh till it hurt, which is a rare thing these days!

The acting was good in the movie; Shane West did a fine job and Mandy Moore was all right (although she should stick to singing, in my personal opinion).  The messages and ideas that paralleled the plot were sweet, although could have been presented better.  However, its many flaws shadow its good parts to no extent.Firstly, and most importantly, the characters weren't loveable.  In order to connect with a movie and enjoy it to the fullest, you must first love the characters and empathize with them.  I had no empathy whatsoever when I watched this movie.  I like the idea of a quirky but wise girl teaching a boy who doesn't know how to live (although Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli really sold the idea), but Moore's character was a little too quirky and unlovable; the same goes for West's character.  Not only were they unlovable, but West's character remained inconsistent throughout the entire movie- he goes from badass punk teenager to wise, educated, and kind man with no flaws whatsoever.  The only flaws I would have preferred to see in this movie were simple personality flaws in West's character, Brandon, that remained consistent through the movie.Secondly, the plot had serious flaws that were not acceptable.  Brandon is banished to do the school play, auditions and is terrible at it, and yet lands the lead?  Too unbelievable.  He turns to Moore's character, Jamie, a girl he absolutely despises for assistance in rehearsing for the play. Given time that would have allowed Jamie and Brandon to get to know and respect each other, this would have been acceptable.  However, this happens so quickly it's simply not believable at all.  Which brings me to my third point.Things move too quickly in the movie to make sense.  I like the concept of falling in love so fast and so suddenly, you don't know what to do with yourself (Love in the Time of Cholera, anyone?).  The way it's presented, however, is in a manner that leaves the audience stranded and confused, even yet more unable to love the characters.I could go on and on, but let me just sum it up  it had a nice concept and the potential to be an amazing film, but it completely missed the target. It makes an attempt at having depth and insight, but does the two concepts no justice.  If you're into sappy teenage stories that happen to be CRAP, then watch it.

Fortunately, 'Tomb Raider' (a frustrating and dull video game series) has escaped him. Now we can see what can happen when put in the hands of some talent. With it, it also seems that director Simon West (previously of the atrociously trash 'Con Air' and 'The General's Daughter') has found his niche. He and star Angelina Jolie are what make this - a potential disaster - work so smashing. Jolie is the perfect physical embodiment of Lara Croft. Typically, I don't find Angelina Jolie sexy in the slightest bit, but Angelina Jolie as the strong, confident, slick Lara Croft...well, that's entirely different. I waste time mentioning this because it's part of the movie's giddy prepubescent tone. This is a guilty pleasure first and foremost. And a good one at that. TR manages to be sexy despite being completely sexless - after all if someone where to end up in bed with Lara she would loose that unatainable goddess quality.Naturally, everybody would like to compare this movie to Indiana Jones. This is a simple-minded knee-jerk reaction. Everything has to be compared to something. They both explore caves, right? So they must be exactly the same. Strangely enough, what surprised me about 'Tomb Raider' was how original it was and how completely different it is from the Indiana Jones series. It's more playful and exists in a world of pure fantasy. It also exists independent of the game which is nice. The plot - involving a device that controls time - is completely absurd, the script is silly, the acting (from anyone who isn't Jolie) is campy. All of this I enjoyed.  This is a B-movie all the way around. But it's a B-movie with A-talent behind the camera and a sense of itself where not much is taken to seriously. West's crisp visual style does wonders for the flick when it kicks into a few eye-popping and fun action set pieces. (I love the stone warrior statues). He avoids the ADD editing style of other directors and the movie has a strange beauty to it's action scenes (but not in the slow motion\/white dove John Woo sense). The special effects are creative and deliver something strange and new around every corner. The soundtrack is top-notch. The score is effective and the techno music from Galaxy Bounce to the ending credit's Where's Your Head At and U2's Elevation remix all helps pump up the fun.Now, I did say that not much is taken to seriously.

There is also long moments without action - this is one of the talkiest summer movies I've seen. Had it dropped all the presupposition of character development and gone all out in it's pure mindless entertainment it would  have been better. It also has another one of those scenes where a character is in the shower, hears a noise and gets out, wandering around naked looking for the disturbance. Who does that? However, in the end despite it's dragging pace, and because of it's fanciful absurdity I went along for the ride and can't wait to see more.

Typically, I don't find Angelina Jolie sexy in the slightest bit, but Angelina Jolie as the strong, confident, slick Lara Croft...well, that's entirely different. I waste time mentioning this because it's part of the movie's giddy prepubescent tone. This is a guilty pleasure first and foremost. And a good one at that. TR manages to be sexy despite being completely sexless - after all if someone where to end up in bed with Lara she would loose that unatainable goddess quality.Naturally, everybody would like to compare this movie to Indiana Jones. This is a simple-minded knee-jerk reaction. Everything has to be compared to something. They both explore caves, right? So they must be exactly the same. Strangely enough, what surprised me about 'Tomb Raider' was how original it was and how completely different it is from the Indiana Jones series. It's more playful and exists in a world of pure fantasy. It also exists independent of the game which is nice. The plot - involving a device that controls time - is completely absurd, the script is silly, the acting (from anyone who isn't Jolie) is campy. All of this I enjoyed.  This is a B-movie all the way around. But it's a B-movie with A-talent behind the camera and a sense of itself where not much is taken to seriously. West's crisp visual style does wonders for the flick when it kicks into a few eye-popping and fun action set pieces. (I love the stone warrior statues). He avoids the ADD editing style of other directors and the movie has a strange beauty to it's action scenes (but not in the slow motion\/white dove John Woo sense). The special effects are creative and deliver something strange and new around every corner. The soundtrack is top-notch. The score is effective and the techno music from Galaxy Bounce to the ending credit's Where's Your Head At and U2's Elevation remix all helps pump up the fun.Now, I did say that not much is taken to seriously. It's those moments where the movie does try to give us some depth that it falls flat. There is a cumbersome and unnecessary subplot about Lara's father. There is also long moments without action - this is one of the talkiest summer movies I've seen. Had it dropped all the presupposition of character development and gone all out in it's pure mindless entertainment it would  have been better. It also has another one of those scenes where a character is in the shower, hears a noise and gets out, wandering around naked looking for the disturbance. Who does that? However, in the end despite it's dragging pace, and because of it's fanciful absurdity I went along for the ride and can't wait to see more.  Would make a good double feature with 2001's other absurd guilty pleasure 'Swordfish'.

To be honest, the film doesn't deserve even that kind of commitment.  Made by Miss Castle, daughter of William Castle, as a remake of his original 13 Ghosts, Thirteen Ghosts is in no way a remake.  Now, I wasn't expecting too much.  I had seen her remake of House on Haunted Hill.  It was fun, a bit too gory, yet entertaining.  This film has entertaining moments but really is just ridiculous.  I liked the glass house.  I liked the glasses. Even the story about all the different types of ghosts needed was innovative and interesting.  But how about all those pitiful CGI special effects, particularly at the end.  The ghosts themselves were, with a couple exceptions, very unconvincing.  And the dialogue in the movie ranks right up there with any Rambo film with an endless stream of one-liners.  Most of which were not amusing.  The acting didn't fare much better.  Tony Shaloub did an okay job with THIS material.  F. Murray Abraham adds class to whatever dreck he appears in.  But everyone else?  C'mmm - acting school ended too quickly for most of the other cast members.  There were a few shocks here and there, but I just question the need to glorify all the blood and guts aspects of these films, which by the way were not in the original sources at all.  I know making money rather than art is the primary factor at work, but sometimes you can try and do both.  If Miss Castle is looking in - try and move back toward House on Haunted Hill and then tone that down a bit.  That will make for a nice formula.  This film I think just went to far in the wrong direction.

The movie is riveting becauseof these two great actors together and I didn't not drift off once, as is usually the case with Hollywood flicks.Kim Basinger is beautiful but she's also boring and has never developed intothe kind of actress that many thought she would.

In all of his films there is a sweat sadness that pervades the atmosphere which is mostsuccessful when you least expect such a soft tone to what seems to be a hard- edged or violent storyline.

Burton entertains like no one else working in Hollywood now. And he never uses soft pornography, lewd language or excessive gut-churningviolence to hold one's attention.

Night Shyamalan has quickly made a name for himself as one of the premier directors of the budding 21st century. Not since the relatively recent works of David Fincher have I been so taken and impressed with a director's vision, his output. And Signs, a relatively small, claustrophobic flick, even more so than Shyamalan's previous two, is somehow all the more powerful, and explosive, and ultimately rewarding for this sense of isolation. It is a brilliantly structured film. Fincher and Shyamalan are called the Hitchcocks of a brave new day, and I consider that praise well deserved for both directors.But Shyamalan's works are too uniquely his own, too uniquely genre and classification defying, to be summed up with the word hitchcockian. Shyamalan tells movies, that walk the dark hinterlands of the human heart and imagination. His works are neither thrillers, nor sci-fi, nor drama, nor horror,  nor strictly fantasy but are some new and strange stew of elements. His works refuse to be pigeon-holed.And that, as you can tell has made him fans, but that has also in a world that lives and dies by labels has made him detractors. People have the right to like and dislike, what they want. But in some of the negative posts here, the venom and attacks seem almost personal. Less attacks on the work, than attacks on the idea of the work. A film is fantasy people, the best film requires your willingness to be fooled, to help suspend disbelief. It just seems a lot of you go into a Shyamalan film looking for flaws, as if you're offended personaly because his movies are so well received, and are looking to tear it down, lookin to fight the movie, and I'm going to tell you right now, a movie that you want to hate, you'll hate. A movie is like a date, its better when both parties try to make it work.You go into Signs wanting to read the signposts, and you will find a delicate, beautiful, haunting and brilliantly directed film, and yes it has a message. And yes there is a wide doe-eyed, capraesque quality to the films of Shyamalan. A vein of hope and humanity, a belief in them that runs through his works. And for me that's what makes his work masterpieces. I tend to think everything, everything has a message, from the most innane slasher flick, to the stupidest comedy, everything has a message, most messages translate into follow the crowd, or be as dumb as you want to be, or shoot the other guy, but Shyamalan presents us, in the case of Signs, a much more layered message. The ending if you let it, will hit you like a truck stop, will build on you, will grow on you, and will stay with you long, long after you leave the theater. It's the work of a master craftsman, no moment wasted.And great kudos must be given to the brilliant soundtrack by James Newton Howard, track 5 Brazil ranks up there with Goblin's Mad Puppet as one of the great horror compositions.Ranks perfectly between Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. 9\/10. One of my favorite films of 2002. And looking forward to his next film. M. Night keep up the great work.

Even though all his films are different, his type of humor and dialog remain constant from film to film. To me it gets old quickly. THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION is no different, but the variety of actors, including Helen Hunt, Charlize Theron, and Dan Aykroyd make it interesting enough that it kept me entertained for much of its 100 minutes. Good, light entertainment, nothing more. It helps that I got the DVD on loan from my local library so there was no out-of-pocket cost to me. And, it still irks me that Allen insists on a mono soundtrack for all his films, basically turning his back on modern sound technology and snubbing his audience. many SPOILERS follow, you may choose to read no further.Set in 1940, Allen plays an insurance investigator, Hunt is the new girl in the office hired to make the operation more efficient, Aykroyd is their boss, married, but having an affair with Hunt's character. The title of the film comes from an evening out to celebrate the birthday of a coworker, and a magician uses a jade scorpion to hypnotize Allen and Hunt, for him the word that puts him in a trance was Constantinople, for her Madagascar. All thought it was just light entertainment but the magician had grander plans. After a suitable lapse of time he phoned Allen, and later Hunt, said the magic word, and had them perform heists of expensive jewels at properties that Allen had been the security expert for. Quickly under suspicion because of clues at the scene, footprint, hair strands, fingerprint, they obviously recalled none of it. Through street contacts, Allen traces the crimes to the magician and clears himself and Hunt.Allen plays his usual deadpan womanizer, in a strange twist Theron's character actually is in his apartment, about to go to bed with him, when he gets a call, goes into the trance, tells her to go home!  In the end, even though Aykroyd has gotten a divorce and is planning to fly to Paris with Hunt and get married, when Allen says, I love you. What's the hurry?  Where are you going, Madagascar? As if back in the trance, Hunt turns to him, expresses her affection, she and Allen walk away arm-in-arm. A bit confusing, because all thought that both spells had been broken, so we the audience aren't sure if Hunt was going willingly or not.The DVD picture is fine, the mono sound is boring, the extras are small and relatively unimportant.  Huge Woody Allen fans will want this DVD in their collection, while most others like me will only want to see it once.
