There's an intricacy totheir structure (both Rushmore and Tennenbaums are very verystructured films) and a sprightliness to their mood that remindsme of those delicate classical compositions. Regardless, let's discuss Anderson's first major breakthrough...Rushmore bored the pants off of me when I first saw it (or perhapsit was that my girlfriend tore the pants off me while I was watchingit...). I thought it was just a bit too precious - precious in the waythat Belle and Sebastian are precious (they also remind me ofChamber Music on their first few albums interestingly enough).Yes, Max Fischer was interesting and the cinematographic tonewas beautiful and Bill Murray was as amazing as he was inGhostbusters and on and on. The pieces were all in place, but thefilm failed for me. I couldn't pick any particular reason, there wassimply an overall disconnect between the film and me. However, subsequent viewings revealed a very subtle andbeautiful film. It was certainly not the comedy I had anticipated(perhaps the reason for the disconnect was thwarted expectations) but rather a splendid dramatic meditation on youth,age, friendship, and love. Quirks abound, but they simply give thedrama character. They don't make it funny, nor should they beexpected to. The second time I saw this film, I watched it on the big screen and,during the final dance, I actually cried. It was one of the mostmoving scenes in recent memory and holds up equally well today.Rushmore, then, is not the comedy some purport it to be (though ithas funny moments) but rather a deft drama on, really, humanity.It's Anderson's most mature work and his best for the time beingand I highly recommend it to anyone.

Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything, including action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper's source material, which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story (and what a story) is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters - Cora and Alice Munro (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann's best film yet (it ranks #15 on my all-time favorite movies list) and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2004","score":"208 out of 248 people found the following review useful","review":" The Last of the Mohicans was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992.
