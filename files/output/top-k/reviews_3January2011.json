The viewer understands the palpable emotional plight of the overweight through her disheartened facial expressions and reactions to Jack Black's character's facetious compliments. In the same vein, I get that we are supposed to feel like everything is evened out by the inclusion of disabled (a man with spina bifida who is 'handi-capable' and walks on all fours) and disfigured (Jason Alexander and his tail) characters. I just didn't feel like it was enough.The onus is not completely on Paltrow to be a believable fat woman. Unfortunately, the Farrelly brothers' script leaves a lot to be desired. In spite of Paltrow's emotional ploys, the movie plays out with her munching on gobs of food 24\/7, breaking (sturdy; it's well established that her 300 pound frame is what busts it) furniture in two different restaurants (the stunt so nice, they did it twice!); and wearing skimpy beach clothing that is obviously meant to ick out the casual viewer as s\/he is confronted by Paltrow's faux-corpulent frame. Likewise, the implication that the two leads have sex is carefully relegated to a scene where Black grins at Paltrow's giant panties, because fat people actually having sex is just gross. In addition, the movie carefully builds up Paltrow in a full-on fat suit for an hour, until there's no more cake for her to shovel into her face and she's left looking miserable and vulnerable. Good thing we got a belly laugh out of her demolishing a booth at a four-star restaurant beforehand.While Paltrow is sympathetic to her character, the script is not; instead of being a feel-good, fat-friendly flick, then, Shallow Hal persists only in justifying mean-spirited stereotypes about the overweight; in this, it's on par with pretty much anything where Eddie Murphy has donned a fat suit (Hollywood, let's just not go there anymore; Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts was three times too many for the trope to receive any kind of legitimate consideration). That the moral of the ill-told story is espoused by Jack Black, whose lusting after hotties in the film seems hypocritical, at best, hardly helps; nor does the corollary that, while fat people have a heart of gold underneath all those layers of cake rolls, skinny people's souls are shriveled and mean. Nobody wins in this movie. The only good thing about Black's character smugly deciding to do Paltrow's a solid by taking her off the market (and presumably, to the Olive Garden, since, get it, she's fat!) is that it effectively ended the movie, in true Hollywood schmaltz that changes nothing.

It's an incredible achievement, it reaches a level of greatness so high, you feel like your eyes will never witness such cinematic perfection, such documentary-like authenticity, such beauty in ugliness. This film captures the end of the Old Western Myth through the fate of one of the most fascinating movie characters John McCabe, brilliantly portrayed by Warren Beatty.John McCabe embodies the Old West myth through his complex but charismatic personality. Here is a good-hearted man, a man who claims to be a businessman, but who seems to carry something deeply hidden in his conscience, in his soul. Whether it's a strength or a weakness, we can't tell in the beginning of the film. Some said he killed a guy? Is is true? McCabe doesn't care. He's here for business and means it. He builds a saloon, and supplies the distraction to the future inhabitants of the modest Presbyterian Church, a little but promising town, in the middle of nowhere. McCabe is respected because he's got charisma, humor, and the money to make him the richest, therefore the most powerful man in town. He's a strong character, a true leader with a beard like the mane of a lion whom he also seems to have the heart.

The guy was good-hearted, like McCabe, and he was killed because as soon as he crossed the bridge facing that little punk (one of the few characters I couldn't wait to see die), he couldn't go back, even by acting friendly. Just like McCabe sealed his fate and wasn't even given the choice to reconsider the offer. Miller knew he was doomed, Miller, also too proud to admit her love, making her partner a customer even in love.

The guy is chased by the colossal villainous Butler and his two side-kicks including the previously mentioned punk. What does McCabe do? He chickens out, and tries to escape, at least this is his first reaction. Another element that makes us feel so much sympathy for McCabe, forget Eastwood's speech in Unforgiven  'Hell of a thing killing a man'. It doesn't need words in Altman's masterpiece, just show McCabe running from death and we get the idea. This climactic sequence is so thrilling we feel like being chased with McCabe. And when he kills the villains one by one, this concludes his fascinating story arc by denying Butler's statement McCabe never killed a guy before. After all, the guy might be human, fragile, dead, but he's the Old West.As McCabe is slowly buried in snow, Mrs. Miller is in an opium den, looking at the light with melancholy, feeling like a precious part of herself is progressively fading to death ... melancholy, snow, death, we're absorbed in an ocean of emotions we wouldn't expect from a western, a feeling of profound sadness, why such awful things happen to good people, why? because no matter why, when something comes to an end, it must end. It's called tragedy, it's tragically sad ... this is the saddest movie I've seen, the end of an era, of a myth, of a genre.

The use of Black & White prevented the film from an overdose of red but the pay-off, was its classic look. When De Niro was reciting Brando's lines you could almost feel you were watching On the Waterfront.But I must admit I had mixed feelings with Raging Bull at first. On one side, I was literally mesmerized by De Niro's brutally powerful performance as a man devoured by jealousy. In fact, this jealousy, driven by a probably very low self-esteem works almost like a gangrene. Following the development of his character, you know that sooner or later, the guy's gonna reach a breaking point and the effects will be devastating. On the other side, this jealousy created a bit of redundancy in the movie, let's face it (like Terry Malloy would say), the scenes, although beautifully directed, making Vickie La Motta floating from man to man (great job by Marty, jealousy had never been so perfectly captured in film), those scenes were kind of repetitive, and upsetting. Upsetting in a good way because we're not necessarily supposed to root for La Motta but at least react to his shocking behavior and aggressive attitude. And upsetting in a bad way, because I was wondering all through the movie, Okay, we got it, the guy is jealous until the movie reminded of A Women Under the Influence, another masterpiece where a character's behavior, makes you feel so uncomfortable, you don't want to watch. And thats how Raging Bull is a very particular movie. I hope every fan of this film can at least concede that it takes more than one or two viewings to let the film grow on you. And it's not that easy to consider it one of 'the best ever' after one viewing. Raging Bull is interesting because it's one of the few character studies that make you question the main roots of the character's behavior, the motives. Travis Bickle was alienated and frustrated, Charlie was torn between friendship and quest for redemption. In La Motta's case, it's hard to come to a conclusion. We know how he is, but why? why such a paranoid behavior that ultimately lead him to lose his family. Paranoia can be explained, take a character like Michael Corleone for instead, but for La Motta, it seemed irrational.Then I realized the answer was in one, often overlooked, key scene, the Janiro fight. I will blaspheme by comparing the movie to a more recent one, but it reminded me of the scene in Fight Club when the narrator destroyed Angel Face -'something beautiful'. The violence La Motta injected in that fight made it look like a personal vengeance, massacring, 'executing' Janiro's face as a message to his wife, you thought he was pretty, now he ain't pretty no more. Ruthless, but powerful, because it shows how low is his self-esteem. Destruction is the weapon of the envious, he doesn't try to improve himself but to destroy the challenger and stay the one and only one. Low self-esteem doesn't mean lack of an ego, but La Motta's one is so twisted, so hard to grab, to understand, we try at least to find it sympathetic, and it only works because the character is pathetic, victim of himself. And this characteristic finally redeems him in the iconic jail scene, where the pathos reaches its paroxysm, when he can finally shout, break down, hit the wall with his bare fists and his head, and cry, realizing how hard he failed. This is the highlight of the film, the scene that makes him profoundly human, and as a viewer, I could at least make peace with him and appreciate the character, and the film. This is the pay-off of all the frustration, anger, discomfort I felt.Jake thought his wife was a whore, blinded by an extreme machismo tainted with paranoid jealousy. He even accused his brother, his only real friend of being a member of this conspiracy. At the end, he lost everything. How pathetic he was outside the ring contrasts with his strength and ferocity inside, he hits and takes the hits, exorcising his own demons in this arena where he's the king. Raging Bull is often compared with Rocky, well, despite the difference of mood, one thing they have in common, is how the ring appears to be an allegory for desire of revenge. In Raging Bull, some shots are so aesthetically exaggerated that it's like it was intended to be kept proportional to all the griefs, all the feelings of low self-esteem that were burning in Jake's mind. In the ring, these feelings explode like a geyser of blood. Even when the Bull finds his toreador, he's ugly and destroyed, but he's still standing, he's still the boss.I used to be very critical towards Raging Bull, I never understood why this film was praised as one of the best ever, or #4 in AFI's Top 100. Now, I know it's a raw portrayal of a man we don't feel sympathy for him because we don't want to, the character is not to blame. We are, we're no better than La Motta because at least he took the hits until the right one hit him in the face. It took me time to realize that Raging Bull was indeed a masterpiece. Don't blame me.

I thought, this old coot doesn't know the word classic if it hit him in the face. Then I saw the movie. While I think half a star is over-exaggerating, I pretty much respect Ebert's review. The fact that so many horror-fans praise this film, as well as critics, just boggles my mind. Tell me what is so great about it? I have seen a plethora of horror classics and I love them all except this one, but come on. Wooden performances, cringe-worthy dialogue, cheesy special effects, an uninteresting plot. This movie is just not great. It's not even good. I think had Clive Barker's name not been attached or had Hellraiser not been a staple in horror, this movie would have been trashed. First up, the plot is so uninteresting that I almost turned off this movie mid-way. Okay so this wife has been unfaithful to her husband in the past. There's a shock! But wait... the guy she committed infidelity with died and now is coming back alive! Sound interesting? Guess how he comes back alive? After the teen girl's dad in this movie gets his hand screwed up and he bleeds. That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Not only that but this movie is called Hellraiser yet you don't see the damn thing until the final five minutes. No lie. The movie should have been called Emo General Hospital but the last five minutes are actually cool. And, if you think him resurrecting with blood is cool, it's not. It's just about some slutty woman and her boring relationship. That would make a decent subplot but not when it takes up most of the running time. You'd think with such an uninteresting plot that the performances would at least be tolerable? Oh have you came to the wrong place.

First up, the plot is so uninteresting that I almost turned off this movie mid-way. Okay so this wife has been unfaithful to her husband in the past. There's a shock!

One can obviously tell by the title of this 1980 release that it's the second installment in the franchise. Richard Donner, who directed its predecessor, was originally the director of this sequel, but was replaced by Richard Lester (I previously knew him as the director of A Hard Day's Night and Help!) before he finished, so some changes were made. Unsurprisingly, it seems that the original 1978 release is the most popular of the bunch, so I wasn't expecting Superman II to be as good, but I was expecting it to be a worthy second installment, since it was still at least reasonably popular, and it basically turned out to be what I was expecting.Superman still lives in Metropolis, and his alter ego, Clark Kent, still works for the city's Daily Planet newspaper. When he hears that the Eiffel Tower has been seized by terrorists and Lois Lane has been sent to Paris, France to report on this, he flies to the scene, rescues Lois from death, and forces an elevator containing a nuclear bomb into space before it detonates! So, Superman has stopped the terrorist attack, but he doesn't see that General Zod, Ursa, and Non, three criminals from Krypton who were sent away just before the planet's destruction, happen to be floating by in the Phantom Zone when the bomb goes off in space, and the explosion sets them free! The three of them go to the Earth's moon, where they meet astronauts and kill them, and then make their way to Earth with plans to enslave the planet! To make matters worse, Superman's old foe, Lex Luthor, manages to escape from prison! The caped wonder is the only one on Earth who can take on these extraterrestrial criminals, but before he is aware of this invasion, he decides to give up his superpowers and become mortal so he can settle down with Lois, who has recently found out that he is Clark Kent!Christopher Reeve's performance as Superman\/Clark Kent here is just like it is in the first installment in the franchise, not stunning, but decent. Some of the other performances here are fairly weak, however, and I think that includes Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas, and Jack O'Halloran as the three invaders respectively. I certainly wasn't blown away by Margot Kidder's performance as Lois Lane in the first film, but somehow found her to be slightly worse in this second one. The flawed performances may have something to do with the flawed script. Some of the scenes here showing the romance between Superman\/Clark Kent and Lois Lane certainly could have been done much better, and there are more of those here than in the 1978 blockbuster. However, like its predecessor, Superman II has lots of excitement, starting with the Eiffel Tower segment and then focusing on General Zod, Ursa, and Non's invasion on Earth. It's a well written story, and the excitement level increases after the first hour of the movie or so. Another thing this first sequel has in common with the original is that it can be very pleasing to the eye as well, with the special effects and scenery.Since this is another franchise movie, it's not surprising that it's inferior to the film that started the series. 26 years after the release of this second installment in the famous franchise starring Christopher Reeve came into theatres, Superman II The Richard Donner Cut, a re-edit of this film featuring lots of never-before-seen footage directed by Donner before he was replaced by Richard Lester for the project, was released. I haven't seen that version yet, having just seen this one, and it seems many consider it to be better than the final theatrical cut, but now that I've seen this version, the one which was seen in theatres in 1980, I think it is a pretty good comic book adaptation, even if it would have been better had Donner not been replaced before finishing the direction.

The film tells the story of two young lads who live on a council estate in London. Jamie lives with his ballsy and brash Mum Sandra and next door is Stu, who is beat upon by his father and older brother. Giving him refuge Sandra lets Stu stay with Jamie, a decision that leads the two lads to discovering feelings for each other. Throw into the picture their loud mouthed Mama Cass obsessed neighbour Leah and Sandra's wanna be hippie lover and you have a remarkably funny, yet tender and positive film.Coming of age films tend to be pretty dire and one that focus of gay coming of age stories are often even worse. Beautiful Thing manages to escape this trap by presenting realistic characters without pushing the sentiment side of things. The bonding that Stu and Jamie find is rather beautiful and at times touching, the performances from the young actors brings a natural element to their on screen relationship. In fact across the film performances are excellent. There is much to laugh at in the film, much provided by Leah and her drunken Mama Cass playing antics with Tameka Empson giving a fine performance. Sandra too is played well by Linda Henry, portraying Sandra as gusty and ballsy yet tender and full of love and protection for her son. Her discovery about his sexuality is perfect and even becomes more of a mother figure to Stu.The film touches on a serious element with the physical abuse Stu suffers, but it is never graphic or overly highlighted; it make the film too dark if it were. Instead it forms the catalyst for the story to move on and gives hope for the character. The discovery of sexuality is a tough one regardless of who you are attracted to and the boys go through the motions of exploration, confusion and acceptance with relatively less pain or anguish than most, which is a good thing, it sends a clear message that it is okay. The film is very much about acceptance, but also about new beginnings all of which is done with great positivity, but also restraint. The film doesn't portray stereotypes, nor does it present being gay negatively.The final scene is a stunning ending with Stu and Jamie dancing arm in arm in the square of the council estate though I did struggle with the idea of it happening on council estate! But perhaps that is the very point; a 'Fuck You, Here We Are' attitude that again goes against what in other ways may be portrayed as impossible.

I have seen many a movie over the years, I must say among my all time favorites have always been the 1954 original uncut Gojira, BladeRunner, Schindler's List, Platoon, Pan's Labyrinth, The Dark Knight, among others, but when I saw this particular film it was one of the rare that a strange profound reaction occurred. For a few minutes after seeing it, I was simply stunned, having no real idea of what to make of what I just saw. I had to view the DVD again, and then it all sunk in. And now, after many a views later, it ranks among my personal top 20.Stanley Kubrick really achieved something here, something visionary and honestly hard to look at if you're really conservative or squeamish. Upon first viewing I watched it with my brother. The second time I watched it alone, but was nonetheless exhilarated. He creates what is supposed to be the future and a very unique and unparalleled vision of it. Yet it hauntingly doesn't look to different from our own, even today over 40 years since the film was released. Viewers are thrown in the midst of this world to meet the intriguing character of Alex DeLarge, played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell. In a very graphic but all too real sense, Alex is ourselves, or friends, our enemies, the inner part of us that may be deemed wicked or unholy but undeniably human. There is a however a choice to be made, whether good or bad is entirely up to you alone. I suppose that very idea, admitting such a thing about one's self or humanity in general for that matter could turn someone off from this film. But it's really undeniable, A Clockwork Orange is not a metaphor of our world; it's as if Kubrick merely put up a mirror to reflect our own decadent society.The pivotal point of this film is how pointless and rather how further degenerative it can really be to try and change human nature. And, as it is explored in this film, even if someone could manage to change it, is this man really even a man at all anymore? And before leaving you readers, I must write about one of the most mind-boggling parts of the whole the film to me, where Alex's view on the oh so precious Bible is shown, further insight to put an end to people diluting themselves. Not even a sacred book can change human nature, as Kubrick ingeniously shows.

For a few minutes after seeing it, I was simply stunned, having no real idea of what to make of what I just saw. I had to view the DVD again, and then it all sunk in. And now, after many a views later, it ranks among my personal top 20.Stanley Kubrick really achieved something here, something visionary and honestly hard to look at if you're really conservative or squeamish. Upon first viewing I watched it with my brother. The second time I watched it alone, but was nonetheless exhilarated. He creates what is supposed to be the future and a very unique and unparalleled vision of it. Yet it hauntingly doesn't look to different from our own, even today over 40 years since the film was released. Viewers are thrown in the midst of this world to meet the intriguing character of Alex DeLarge, played brilliantly by Malcolm McDowell. In a very graphic but all too real sense, Alex is ourselves, or friends, our enemies, the inner part of us that may be deemed wicked or unholy but undeniably human. There is a however a choice to be made, whether good or bad is entirely up to you alone. I suppose that very idea, admitting such a thing about one's self or humanity in general for that matter could turn someone off from this film. But it's really undeniable, A Clockwork Orange is not a metaphor of our world; it's as if Kubrick merely put up a mirror to reflect our own decadent society.The pivotal point of this film is how pointless and rather how further degenerative it can really be to try and change human nature. And, as it is explored in this film, even if someone could manage to change it, is this man really even a man at all anymore? And before leaving you readers, I must write about one of the most mind-boggling parts of the whole the film to me, where Alex's view on the oh so precious Bible is shown, further insight to put an end to people diluting themselves.

Set apparently near the end of Czarist rule in Russia, it's the story of one Jewish family living in a small Russian village, and of their relationships with those around them. The story is basically told through the eyes of Tevye, the patriarch of the family, who was brilliantly portrayed by an actor named Topol.Opening with a wonderful song about tradition, that becomes the overwhelming theme of the movie - the role of tradition in the community - and perhaps, as the ending of the movie seems to make clear - the most uncompromising tradition is that nothing stays the same. We see this battle over tradition largely through the eyes of Tevye's three eldest daughters. The oldest of them was arranged without her knowledge to be married to the local butcher - a much older man - but was already in love with someone else. Faced with his daughter's refusal, Tevye gives in and allows her to marry the man she loves. The second daughter then falls in love with a revolutionary who has been staying with the family in exchange for teaching the daughters - a match her father disapproves of (partly because the groom is on his way to St. Petersburg to be part of the coming revolution) but then again gives in on. Then tradition is challenges once more, as the third daughter falls in love with a local Russian official - and a Christian. Tevye refuses to give in on this point, but the two marry anyway and are cut off from the rest of the family. Arranged marriages and the role of the matchmaker are thus dealt with, and the role of the faith in the lives of the Jewish people of the community is humorously reflected upon throughout. The localized idiosyncratic traditions of such a small community are also delightfully brought out. The story also doesn't shy away from anti-semitism, shown in scattered scenes throughout, and then the cause of the major disruption in the end as the community scatters widely (from Jerusalem to Chicago to New York, etc.) because of an anti-Jewish pogrom that drives them away. In the history of Judaism, though - a people often scattered; driven from one place to another - such an occurrence also seems to have the feel of tradition, and it results in a bit of a reconciliation between the family and their third daughter.It's an exceptionally well constructed story. While the song and dance routines are all excellent, I might suggest that some of them went on just a bit too long, but that's one of the few criticisms I would make of a generally excellent story.

And yet the most popular picture of the entire decade was a bright, joyous and epic musical, a product of old-fashioned studio professionalism, crafted for pure entertainment. And there is no shame in this fact, because The Sound of Music is a truly wonderful classic of the screen.Let's start at the beginning (a very good place to start) with the musical from which the movie was adapted. This was certainly the best of all the Rodgers and Hammerstein scores, the culmination of all their works prior to this. It demonstrates, in many instances, what was really exceptional about Richard Rodgers's tunes. His melodies have a subtle beauty which comes at you in ways you wouldn't anticipate. There are those sour blue notes in the title song, the haunting chord progression of Edelweiss through major and minor or, in My Favourite Things, the shift from a minor key verse to a major key chorus while barely seeming to change melody at all. Filled with Oscar Hammerstein's deceptively simple yet rhythmically sensitive lyrics, this is music as gorgeous as the hills and mountains that provide the motion picture with its backdrop.The director is the highly versatile and under-appreciated Robert Wise. Wise began his career as a sound editor and he really understood the musical genre. He doesn't give The Sound of Music that very precise, choreographed look of say, a Vincente Minnelli musical or his own earlier picture West Side Story. Instead he has the performers doing very simple dances of realistic movement, for example Julie Andrews speeding up her walk as the song gathers pace for I Have Confidence. He also gently and unobtrusively makes the image match the scope and style of the music, a great example of this being in the opening number. For the slow, broad opening of the song, we have Andrews against the backdrop of the mountains. Then for the busier but quieter section he has her walking among trees, skipping between their trunks like the notes of the song, before having her running out onto the hillside as the music swells up again.Star Julie Andrews, like Irene Dunne and Judy Garland before her, was one of those rare talents who could both sing and act. Of course her role here as an actress is mainly one of childlike earnestness, but the thing is she pulls it off with complete sincerity, never becoming too grating or too pathetic. And of course she is able to carry her acting performance through into the musical numbers, putting her character into every note and dance step. Male lead Christopher Plummer was reportedly not comfortable in his role, but he does an adequate job all the same. Apparently Richard Burton was also considered for the role, and he undoubtedly would have given an excellent performance, but he might have been a little too good, making the captain perhaps a bit too stern and menacing in those early scenes, so I'm glad the role went to the softer and more fatherly Plummer.One criticism that is often raised about The Sound of Music is that its story is rather weak and short on substance. It is true that it lacks the compelling drama of say, My Fair Lady, that it never really builds up any true sense of danger over the Nazi anschluss, and that perhaps it is at times a little overwhelmingly cheerful. And yet the fact is that the weight of this picture is not in its story, but in its music. This is something that is significant about Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals. Think about those lyrics. Most of these songs don't say anything very specific about the story or characters; most of them just play around with a little idea like saying goodbye or going through the notes in a scale. With the exception of How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria? these are songs about feelings, not expositions. The songs do not exist to tie the story together, the story exists to present the songs. And these musical moments are powerful enough to send shivers down spines and send hearts soaring.

And even if you don't fit in in either categories, the comedy in this movie will be sure to keep you entertained.

The act of love is, for her, simply an expression of a healthy natural appetite, but for each of her men it's a distracting obsession they'd rather not share. Nothing is quite so foolish as an ardent male in heat, and writer-director-editor Spike Lee exploits that vulnerability with a shrewd eye for the idiosyncrasies of human behavior. Everyone is a target but no one is hurt; Lee even lampoons himself while playing the least conventional corner of the besotted trio. The film was reportedly made in less than a fortnight on a budget under $200,000, but with enough energy and originality to more than compensate for the lack of a professional budget (and a professional cast). In retrospect the shoestring production would have another, unexpected benefit, restricting the stylistic overkill that would mark Lee's subsequent high-profile features.

When His Excellency Groucho learns Ms. Dumont is a rich widow, he decides to woo her, but rival Ambassador of Sylvania Louis Calhern (as Trentino) wants Dumont and her money for his own country. He employs peanut salesman Chico Marx (as Chicolini) and mute pal Harpo Marx (as Pinky) as spies. Taking advice from handler Zeppo Marx (as Bob Roland), Firefly leads the four Marx Brothers to an all-out war.When Duck Soup failed to stir up the box office to the levels expected, Paramount and the Marx Brothers parted company. But, there were other reasons for this relative failure. Today, Duck Soup is unmistakably Marxist, but at the time, it then bent the structure from what audiences expected. This was neither the staged antics of Animal Crackers nor its cinematic relative Horse Feathers (1932). The scaffolding of Marx Brothers, which could be seen coming, was now fairly obvious Groucho was most important, Harpo and Chico were next, with the underrated and underutilized Zeppo downgraded to insignificant.Why not a duck? Perhaps, the biggest reason Duck Soup lost viewers may have been its satirical stance on war. At the time of release, its particular anti-war satire was a touch subversive, and not well-received. Over the years, however, this film became most critics' favorite. See it, but don't think you've seen all there is to see of The Marx Brothers herein. Duck Soup was brilliantly conceived with help from director Leo McCarey with writers Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. It was (arguably) their third film peak, and the end of an era.

Then there is the scene where Christie tries to seduce husband Nolte. She is attempting to repair their marriage. It is not clear why he rejects her, he seems to love her and it was she who had called off their sex life, not he. There is no discussion of this event afterward to clarify things.Characters throughout behave in ways that seem very unlikely and you can't figure them out.

Released in 1992, this film still hits incredibly hard on several aspects, including cinematography, comedic elements, and an imaginative and original story as well as adventurous action. Sam Raimi even delivers a good many scares and a few grisly shots, but maybe not enough gore for some fans' taste. Still, Bruce Campbell returns so all is forgiven in my book. I'll say right now that I wholeheartedly prefer the Director's cut, and especially the alternate (original) ending. More material, more fun to put in short.The cast is pretty decent, as is the story which moves briskly and never drags. Not only that, it was incredibly funny through I must say; Ash delivers his dialogue crisply, and as a plus, Raimi relies on mostly raw effects, including good old stop motion. This fits the film perfectly as I've quickly grown tired of CGI with each film now-a-days, especially in the horror genre where I've always felt CGI did not belong. The end battle is priceless, with the wise-cracking army of the undead led by Evil Ash himself, awesome! The sets are great, the shots are intense and always a pleasure. And the icing on the cake, Joseph Do Luca returns a final time for the marvelous score and this is classic amongst garbage.
