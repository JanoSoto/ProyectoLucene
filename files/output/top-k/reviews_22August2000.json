I never read the books. That's why I watch the movie!! Since Irving wrote both the book and the screenplay, they both have to be great!!  rate this about 8.5 of 10, a really enjoyable and thoughtful movie.Until I saw the film I had no idea of the meaning of the title. As we learn, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire)was adopted then returned several times. He finally leaves the orphanage to experience life and ends up bunking in the cider house with the apple-picking crew, and there are rules posted on the wall. However, since no one else can read, what's the meaning? The title becomes a metaphor for the need for each of us to break rules at times when the situation demands it.Charlize Theron is beautiful and great as his love interest. Michael Caine won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as the orphanage doctor.SPOILERS FOLLOW The doctor has become the father figure for Homer, and groomed him to replace him, teaching all he knows about being a doctor. However, without even a high school education, much less an M.D., Homer leaves and earns his keep as both an apple picker and as a lobster fisherman. He encounters a situation where the father, the crew chief, has impregnated his daughter. Homer does not believe in abortion, but he recognizes the devastation to the daughter so he performs the procedure. He falls for the girl, whose boyfriend is a military pilot in 1943 and 1944 during the war. He becomes infected and paralyzed below the waist. The girl must choose, and she stays with her old boyfriend.Meanwhile the doctor, who puts himself to sleep using ether, accidently overdoses and dies. So Homer is summoned back to the orphanage where, through some creative copying, ends up with a medical diploma, and he becomes the new orphanage doctor. Thus coming full circle, he has found his role in life.Irving also wrote The World According to Garp and The Hotel New Hampshire. I didn't read those either but found both movies offbeat and enjoyable. Cider House Rules in a similar sense mixes drama, comedy, and heartbreak to give a balanced perspective of what life really is like.I saw the film on DVD. The picture is just about perfect, one of the best I've seen. Of special note is the French language track that is available as an option.

Their dreams of going into space died. But they never forgot. When a seemingly harmless Russian communications satellite needs retrieval (with a design constructed by Eastwood years before), their former boss Gerson (played by James That'll do, pig Cromwell) calls them back. The whole Eastwood\/Cromwell relationship (Gerson pretty much skunked Eastwood's chance to go into space) could have been played up more but what we do get isn't half bad.Watching this foursome try to pass the physical is hilarious.

Either way, the audience is necessarily at a distance. And that's the problem dance is human, to watch it (I'm talking about a performance here) you intimately participate in the space built and folded by the dancers. So by definition, most film\/dance mixtures turn flat.The solution here is to create an openly recursive storyline, mixing the dance as sometimes a filmed performance or rehearsal, sometimes real life, sometimes dreams or visions or imaginings. This combined with a never-rooted camera -- which sometimes plays the role of a character itself -- makes the audience part of the dance, and adds depth. The sets are designed to confuse sloped floors, mirrors (used liberally) distortion, translucent screens and so on, further breaking the performance mold. On these terms alone, this is an intelligently conceived film.I cannot say the same for the dancing proper. I think the film suffers from sticking too close to an Argentine palette, so the music and dance lacked breadth, and ultimately became repetitive. Whether the dancers were authentic, I cannot say. There certainly were exciting moments for me, but the dancing wasn't sufficiently vibrant to carry all of the scenes.The Latin flavor was intriguing in the large that the director would attempt such a self-referential conflation national horror; angst of aging; layering of creation.

On these terms alone, this is an intelligently conceived film.I cannot say the same for the dancing proper. I think the film suffers from sticking too close to an Argentine palette, so the music and dance lacked breadth, and ultimately became repetitive. Whether the dancers were authentic, I cannot say. There certainly were exciting moments for me, but the dancing wasn't sufficiently vibrant to carry all of the scenes.The Latin flavor was intriguing in the large that the director would attempt such a self-referential conflation national horror; angst of aging; layering of creation. Such a project would be considered outrageous in the US long before it is explored. And the Latin character was also interesting in the small bigbottomed dancers and dumb, dependent women talking about how intelligent and independent they are.Check this out. Not for the dance, but for a solution to filming dance.

Hollow Man starts off in the right direction with a team of scientists doing invisibility experiments on animals. They test a serum on one of the animals that brings that animal back to normal. Then one of the scientists (Kevin Bacon) decides to try the invisibility experiment on himself. The stuff that makes him invisible works, but the stuff that makes him normal doesn't. As time keeps passing by and the longer he stays invisible, he proceeds to turn into a raving madman. The first half of Hollow Man is dynamite. The special effects scenes when the animal reappears and when Bacon turns invisible are impressive. But it turns real nasty in the second half when the movie turns into a slasher film. Verhoeven once again has to display graphic violence like in his other films. The last 30 minutes of Hollow Man was especially hard to endure. I think this film would have had a better second half if they had stuck with the idea of finding a serum that would have brought Bacon back from being invisible. Another thing in Hollow Man that was kind of ridiculous was all the sexuality and nudity (another Verhoeven specialty). One scene that was really annoying was the one where the invisible scientist enters a neighbor's apartment without her knowing it (how can she know if he's invisible) and proceeds to do you know what. Isn't it about time Verhoeven made a movie without graphic violence, sex, and nudity? I doubt that will ever happen. Nevertheless, there are things to like in Hollow Man. The special effects are an asset, and Elisabeth Shue, one of my favorite actresses, is very good as a fellow scientist who happens to be a former girlfriend of Bacon.

It's true that he came to think that Gilbert's style of operetta was beneath him (and he was wrong to think this).  It's also true that he was a snob.  But it's wrong to infer that he thought Gilbert's style of operetta beneath him BECAUSE he was a snob.  He wanted to be the next Mendelssohn or Handel, not for social reasons, but because the Italian symphony and Messiah really are greater achievements than The Mikado - and obviously, this says very little against The Mikado.  Perhaps Sullivan DIDN'T have it in him to soar any higher, but it's a little harsh to expect the most lauded composer in England to KNOW this.  And anyway, why ARE Sullivan's operetta scores so good?  Precisely because he was ambitious.  If he hadn't been the kind of person who longed to write symphonies and grand opera, if he had been the kind of person who COULD have been content to churn out operetta after operetta and nothing else, his operettas wouldn't have been as good.  In George Orwell's words The kind of man who would write the same book twice couldn't have written it even once.(Another thing often forgotten today is that Gilbert was no different.  HIS ambition was nothing less than the revival of English theatre; he longed for recognition as a serious playwright; and in some moods he, too, thought the Savoy operettas were trifles that distracted him from what he ought to have been doing.)The thing I like about Mike Leigh's film is that it doesn't present us with the standard view of Sullivan the snobbish rainbow-chaser - Leigh may very well hold this view, but he doesn't force it on us.  He presents the history honestly.I love the way Leigh is willing to accept the feeblest of excuses to cut away to the Savoy Theatre and show us some number from The Mikado, Princess Ida or The Sorcerer.  Leigh clearly thinks that no excuse is too weak, and he's right.

More than a delight - it makes the Victorian age seem fantastic, but also modern.  When D'Oyly Carte presents Sullivan with a spanking-new reservoir pen, and Sullivan says, What a clever invention, whatever will they think of next, I found myself thinking, By jove - it IS a clever invention.

Yes, he snaps and snarls at everyone around him (that opening song of King Gama's in Princess Ida - the first staged number we see - is, most people think, Gilbert's self-portrait) but he justifies it by being truly funny; and, it slowly dawns on us, he's not a bad man.It helps if you're familiar with Gilbert and Sullivan's work.

They had such cool visual appeal, and looked truly cinematographicaly (that's a mouthful) brilliant.  However, I was skeptical about seeing Lopez as an actress, and the other actors as far as I could see were nobodys.  Yet I really REALLY wanted to see this film, and was finaly getting around to some reviews just recently now that the film had been out. The impression I got from the reviews was evenly split..  So what's the final word in a nutshell...Simply put as this..  Lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE.  This movie is nothing more than a typical televised cop TV show, with visual imagery that seems not to add to the story, but to cover up how ordinary and boring this film really is.  Lopez CAN NOT ACT!  I have read people saying that this film was truly terrifying and that D'Onofrino was the most amazing creppy serial killer on film.  WHAT??  what friggin movie did these people see??  D'Onofrino is HARDLY EVEN IN THIS FILM!! and comparisons to Perkins Hanibal... you have to be kidding me.  Instead D'Onofrino obsession doesn't even come out as twisted or frightning, it's just down right stupid and laughable.There is NO suspense, NO drama, NO thrilling-ness in this film. It isn't even scary!  Yes director Tarsem's imagery is fantastic, but it does nothing for the story.  You can have the greatest shots in a film and imagery, but a film needs to have A good story, and good actors too (which this film is SERIOUSLY lacking).  Instead I just kept waiting for the dream sequences so I could only admire the artistic value of it as if I was viewing a painting or a performance piece.

They had such cool visual appeal, and looked truly cinematographicaly (that's a mouthful) brilliant.  However, I was skeptical about seeing Lopez as an actress, and the other actors as far as I could see were nobodys.  Yet I really REALLY wanted to see this film, and was finaly getting around to some reviews just recently now that the film had been out. The impression I got from the reviews was evenly split..  So what's the final word in a nutshell...Simply put as this..  Lots of style, NO SUBSTANCE.  This movie is nothing more than a typical televised cop TV show, with visual imagery that seems not to add to the story, but to cover up how ordinary and boring this film really is.  Lopez CAN NOT ACT!  I have read people saying that this film was truly terrifying and that D'Onofrino was the most amazing creppy serial killer on film.  WHAT??  what friggin movie did these people see??  D'Onofrino is HARDLY EVEN IN THIS FILM!! and comparisons to Perkins Hanibal... you have to be kidding me.  Instead D'Onofrino obsession doesn't even come out as twisted or frightning, it's just down right stupid and laughable.There is NO suspense, NO drama, NO thrilling-ness in this film. It isn't even scary!  Yes director Tarsem's imagery is fantastic, but it does nothing for the story.  You can have the greatest shots in a film and imagery, but a film needs to have A good story, and good actors too (which this film is SERIOUSLY lacking).

No pre-credit sequence, the music during the gun-barrel opening is just bizarre, and who's this chappie playing Major Boothroyd?!!!  But it is recognizably a Bond film.  Its strengths will be played up to create some of the greatest Bond adventures, and its weaknesses will dog the very worst.Sean Connery plays an uncomfortable blend of suave and savage.  There's an underlying thuggish quality to the role that is very appealing that no other actor had (except maybe Timothy Dalton... he was a scrapper).  But, unfortunately, Bond is a very simple hero.  When viewing the very first of 19 Bond films, one shouldn't take for granted the things that one does when watching the 19th.  Bond was a new character being created for the screen for the first time.  Based on Ian Fleming's novels, director Terence Young nevertheless took it upon himself to develop the Bond character from the ground up.  He was informed by, but never limited to, Fleming's creation.However, all of the thought that went into the character was style, none substance.  We never, ever, in nearly 40 years, get a sense of who Bond is. We know how he behaves, and that's all. Films like On Her Majesty's Secret Service and License to Kill endeavor to show a more human Bond (and are derided for it), but Bond just isn't human.  Dr. No takes the blame for that.Dr. No also takes the blame for the franchise's disturbing tendency to eschew storyline and plot in favor of gadgets, stunts, and girls.  True, there are no gadgets in this film, and the stunts are kept relatively low key, but the plot doesn't quite add up.  Despite this, the film was a wonderful success.  This allowed the producers to de-emphasize plot concerns in nearly every subsequent film, because clearly you don't need a good plot to have a good Bond film.The fact that the audience knows who the villain is from the get-go is interesting.  There's no mystery as to who is diverting US satellite launches.  The mystery is why, and that is never sufficiently explained. Not revealing Dr. No until so very near the end of the film is a strength, in that it gives him far more menace.  But it just doesn't give him time to have any kind of goal.  The denouement, then, is the weakest part of the film.  We can see that Bond is winning, but we just don't care.  Why should we want him to win?Neither one of the best nor the worst in Bond films.
