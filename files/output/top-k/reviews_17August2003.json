I was very young then and probably didn't completely understand it, but I knew immediately that it was a very special movie, unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Twenty five years, and literally thousands of movies later, I think even more highly of it, especially now that I'm able to see the cut available on the 30th Anniversary DVD, which is over fifteen minutes longer than the version I already own on video. And, yes, 'The Wicker Man' is still unlike any other movie I've ever seen. I think this is mainly down to the brilliant script by Anthony Shaffer, who also wrote 'Sleuth' and Hitchcock's 'Frenzy'. There hasn't been anything made remotely like it since.  I think it's the greatest British horror movie ever made, but the description horror only gives you half the story. It's also a thriller, a mystery, a Christian morality tale, and in a weird way, a musical. Christopher Lee regards it as the best movie he's ever been involved with, and describes it as one of the three or four greatest movies ever made in Britain, and I agree with him. Lee is very good in the movie as the enigmatic Lord Summerisle, but Edward Woodward is the real star. Woodward is best know for his TV work, as either 'Callan' or 'The Equalizer', depending what generation you're from, but he's superb as the deeply religious Sgt. Howie. Apparently Peter Cushing was initially suggested for the role, as was Michael York, but I really can't imagine either of then being half as good as Woodward is. The supporting cast are all superb - Diane Cilento as the school teacher, famous mime Lindsay Kemp as the publican, and especially Britt Ekland as the publican's daughter Willow. Ekland's seduction dance scene is the second most famous scene in the movie. She claims her speaking voice was dubbed throughout , director Robin Hardy disputes this, though her singing voice certainly was, and she used a (ahem) butt double. I also get a kick out of Aubrey Morris' graveyard scene. Morris is a great Brit character actor and was also in 'A Clockwork Orange', Hammer's 'Blood From The Mummy's Tomb' and sci fi trash classic 'Lifeforce'. Another Hammer alumni Ingrid Pitt ('The Vampire Lovers', 'Countess Dracula', etc.) is also in the cast as a librarian, but sadly in underused. Still, I'm glad she was involved. Inexplicably some people seem to hate this movie. I can't for the life of me understand why. It's utterly brilliant, utterly unique, and I never tire of watching it. If you've never seen it before I envy you! It's a cliche, but believe me, you have never seen anything like it before!

Christopher Walken doesn't need to be walking and moving for his character to be dynamic. Tied to a chair is just fine! Someone criticized the romance scenes in this film, all 3 minutes worth! Why do you NEED to know details about what Walken's character has done in the past? You know he's a gangster, you have all seen plenty of gangster films. We don't need backstory on this. All the backstory on the characters that is actually necessary for the story is given in the dialogue that is exchanged throughout the film. This film is not predictable in any way. Each time you think you have fingered the bad guy, you're proven wrong (This was actually very successful in Scream as well, but that is niether here nor there.). This doesn't borrow from Tarantino, as another person commented, a disjointed timeline is not exclusive to Tarantino, although he is the undisputed master of it. This movie is driven purely by dialogue, exchanges of words between people. Walken comes across as the cold-as-ice gangster, never worrying that he won't somehow get out of the mess he is in. He works on each character in his own style, and at his own pace. He plays people against each other, and gets them to admit their darkest sins. There aren't any fancy explosions, perfectly timed jokes, hilarious pratfalls, or any of the other typical tricks that Hollywood dishes out, just an intriguing storyline and some excellent casting. This movie even has a nice trick ending that is not over-explained. I would have to say that this is one of the better films I have seen, and I have no regrets owning it. P.S.

The first half is quite entertaining as we get to see how NASA trains its astronauts with Eastwood, Jones, Garner, and Southerland cheerfully dishing out the fried ham. There are two big drawbacks in the first half James Cromwell and Marcia Gay Hardin. Cromwell's problem is pandemic in Hollywood the utter inability of any actor born north of the Mason Dixon Line to deliver a credible southern accent. Sure I live in Minnesota, but I spent 6 years in Arkansas and I can spot a fake twang a mile away. They're even more annoying than the real twangs.Hardin's problem is a bit more complex She's a lousy actress. I know she won an Oscar (obviously not for this piece of cine-manure), but based on this movie I can't imagine how. (Casting couch?) Watch her reaction to discovering that the secret mission is now on the front page of the USA Today Oh, sh*t! Well she got that right.I was willing to overlook those two horrendous performances because I knew that their roles would be greatly reduced by the time they got off the ground.

Add and one of the most memorable to that statement. Almost any list you happen to come across of great movies will contain Casablanca, as it has almost nestled itself firmly into our world's foundation. It is what one would call a memorable film. It may not be memorable for the audiences of today who find it boring, long, weary and tiresome, but it will always be remembered. That isn't something you can say for most movies. In one hundred years, do you think The Lord of the Rings trilogy will really - really - be remembered?Casablanca is a love story, just as so many other films released to this day, but upon a viewing two nights ago, I asked myself what sets it apart from the rest. Just what has made it what it is today? Is it the direction by Michael Cortiz, the chemistry between the actors, or the actors themselves? Is it the sly side of dark comedy, or just the nostalgia of the film that drives so many viewers? Or perhaps it is the cliffhanger finale (those filming the movie didn't even know what would happen at the end of the film due to constantly changing scripts and the 1940s Production Code permitting a married woman from leaving her husband for another man). Even if it isn't, the ending is superb, depressing and uplifting, one of the strangest, saddest, and happiest endings I have ever seen, in which Bogart mutters the famous last lines, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a chain smoker and heavy drinker living in Casablanca, French Morocco, during WWII. During WWII, European immigrants fled from their homeland down to Africa, in hopes of sailing off the coast to Portugal, and then to America, land of freedom. Because of this, Casablanca is inhabited by petty thieves, vicious murderers, and ruthless citizens. Every day a plane leaves from the local airport, carrying the precious few with Visa Passes to freedom. Those applying for a Visa Pass on the black market might come in contact with the crook Ugarte (Peter Torre).One night the thief Ugarte visits Rick's bar in Casablanca and asks him to hide two Visa Passes he has acquired by unrespectable means. Rick reluctantly agrees, only to watch Ugarte be taken away by French officials the same night, in his very bar. Rick, you have to help me! he screams as he is dragged away. Rick takes a puff on his cigarette and remains solid. A bystander says, Gee, Rick, I hope when they come to take me away you help me out a little bit more than that! Rick remains a statue and says, I stick my neck out for nobody.We can sense Rick was a good guy at one time, but as Marilyn Monroe once said, he probably got the fuzzy end of the lollipop. He is tired of fighting for the good cause. So he maintains his bar and tries not to care about anyone. His piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) knows the real Sam, and tries to evoke it, but Sam just sits in silence and drinks and smokes and lets himself stay drenched in misty smoke.That all remains until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks through his doors. It turns out that Ilsa left Sam and Rick waiting at a train station in the rain some time ago in Paris, France, during the German occupation. Rick never saw her since. That night she walks into his bar, he sits at a table in his joint, and in a mopy tone says, Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine. This is a very effective line.Do delve into the plot any further is pointless. Not only will it spoil interesting tidbits, but it is just plain pointless to explain anymore. But I will say that every frame is handled with care and the extreme close-ups in this film are amazingly effective. Sergio Leone was known for his extreme close-ups, but those in Casablanca seem to capture an innocence of the characters that I have rarely seen equaled in other films.Bogart is at the top of his game in this film, only equaled in The Maltese Falcon. Ingrid Bergman is superb, as well, but the supporting cast is equally impressive. Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Peter Henreid and Dooley Wilson all steal the show - well, maybe not Henreid, but that's because he's not really supposed to. This is the perfect example of a well-rounded cast. Too often nowadays attention is paid to the lead actors and not the supporters - this has both great leads and great supporters.People often ask me what my favorite film is. And to be frankly honest, it certainly isn't Casablanca. To me, lists of favorites in ranking order are pointless and silly - who am I to declare my favorite film, when I have not even seen some of the greatest unknown films out there? If someone asks me to tell them my favorite film I have seen, I usually say I don't have one. I still think lists of favorite-ever films are silly. I have various favorites in various genres, but not an all-time-favorite. Despite this, Casablanca is one of those films that has permeated our culture. It will never go away.

So, now I'll do my best to recommend it to as many other people as possible. El dia de la Bestia was made in Spain, or the new great home of horror these days. Spanish directors proved themselves a lot lately and I think this guy, Alex De La Iglesia , deserves some extra credit. This guy obviously is a big lover of horror and the whole cult atmosphere around it. In a genius kind of way, he mixes a lot of appropriate elements in his movie like heavy metal music and fortune-telling. Angél is a priest who just translated a disturbing writing. He found out that the Antichrist himself will be born on Christmas day of 1995. In Madrid, because all the signs of apocalypse looks like it. To avoid this horrible event that would mean the end of the world, he has to face Satan himself. So, he travels to Madrid and commits a lot of sins, which is pretty funny to watch. He meets a heavy-metal freak (sorry  Death Metal!) and a fortune-teller who fooled many people by faking an exorcism. But when all preparations are set, Satan doesn't show up !

It wouldn't do much if I named all the actors of this movie because their names don't ring a bell. But, I can say they're all very good actors and they clearly did their best work in this film. Like I said before, this film contains a lot of humor but it never spoofs the genre. There's always a lot of respect present and I think that's a great achievement. Also, I would have thought there was a lot more gore in this film. To my surprise, the gory scenes are very limited and overall short. Gorehounds be advised because the cover and the title may make you think it's one big blood fest.

This guy obviously is a big lover of horror and the whole cult atmosphere around it.

To avoid this horrible event that would mean the end of the world, he has to face Satan himself. So, he travels to Madrid and commits a lot of sins, which is pretty funny to watch. He meets a heavy-metal freak (sorry  Death Metal!) and a fortune-teller who fooled many people by faking an exorcism. But when all preparations are set, Satan doesn't show up !

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"17 August 2003","score":"","review":"  I liked Friday, but can't stand his role in this Rush Hour series.  Who's he supposed to be, an Eddie Murphy, a Chris Rock, maybe a hybrid...Eddie Rock, or Chris Murphy?  Maybe he's supposed to be a watered down Jerry Lewis meets Martin Lawrence.  The only way Hollywood seems to be able to write an African American role in a black-white buddy-buddy cop comedy is to use very tired, worn out cliched stereotypes of a jive-talking black guy who immitates a white guy immitating a black guy.  And Hollywood knows the only way to exploit all of that and simultaneously poke fun at Chan's ethnicity is to use two minorities.  The two of them sort of cancel out any claims of racial insensitivity that would most certainly result if it was a white guy putting on a jive-talking accent and poking fun at Chan's foreign accent and inscrutable mind.  Tucker hasn't found a new nitch in this genre, he hasn't tapped into an original approach and method like Murphy did in the 80s or Lawrence did in the 90s.  He's just the jive-talking J.J from Good Times and that, sadly, passes for funny and original (at least enough so that Rush Hour can be spun out into a trilogy).Chan, as always, is great, bringing his original brand of comedy-martial arts combo to this otherwise very annoying Tucker vehicle.

Not great but certainly good, carries a nice message and it's a good premise.However, a lot of people did get offended by this. The movie kind of does that to itself-though the theme here is everybodys' beautiful etc etc and meant to look at how much women are judged by their looks, the movie wasn't as bold as it could have been. If it REALLY wanted to take hold of this issue there would have been more of the heavy paltrow not just a few quick shots. Shows the thin paltrow a lot more and it shouldn't. Does anyone get the feeling the movie was almost afraid of it's own subject matter? That's what takes the oomph out of the movie and makes it a sweet little picture rather then an outstanding film. Still, it's OK-I know many people, both heavy and thin who saw this, most were not offended by the picture but had the movie aimed for serious movie making instead of predictable Hollywood fare(the former would have been more appropriate for the subject matter at hand) the movie would have been a lot better.

Such prominent names as Apocalypse Now, Patton, and Blackhawk Down passed through my mind, but I couldn't decide.  Many directors have tried war films, Wolfgang Petersen was phenomenal with Das Boot, but has fallen into a Hollywood money pit.  Ridley Scott barely avoided the claws of Jerry Bruckheimer.  Oliver Stone hasn't changed in 20 years, but he served before making his attempt, I will give him credit for that.  Stanley Kubrick wants to understand, but his war films never excelled as to the purpose, Paths of Glory came closest compared to his narrative failure of Full Metal Jacket.  Then I remembered Lewis Milestone...my first experience with Milestone's work came when I was 11 with Pork Chop Hill.  That movie changed every way I look at war along with A Bridge Too Far.  Before Kubrick, Kurosawa, and even Hitchcock got off the ground, Milestone holds my honor as being the original cinematic genius.  All Quiet on the Western Front is everything that Terrence Malick wanted to do in The Thin Red Line.  Malick must not have seen this because he just tries elaborating on it.  He failed because he doesn't understand the audience anymore than the topic.  AQWF presents an image of the novel that defines everything in a war movie.  Many films like Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and Windtalkers have tried to repeat the same message, none as successful.Rejoice o young man in thy youth.  That phrase from the beginning of Platoon sums up the movie as the German boys leave school for enlistment.  I find it interesting in the first few minutes how Milestone enters the thoughts of each student in all their delusions.  That is genius.Even stronger is how Milestone manipulates the camera during the war.  The synchronizing of the machine guns to waves of Frenchmen getting riddled resembles the bunker shots of 'Private Ryan.  Spielberg and Kaminiski obviously studied this many times before filming their epic.  The camera is all about movement at war, perhaps to emphasize the fact that the soldiers can't go anywhere but die.The subtle signs of power and intelligence on Milestone's part are sprinkled throughout, from the slowly dying Frenchman in the shell crater to the butterfly ending.  This is a hallmark of filmmaking that will never be equaled.  The camera, the ear, the cast, the editing...everything is perfect.Overall, the greatest war movie ever made.  Period.  5 out of 5 stars.
