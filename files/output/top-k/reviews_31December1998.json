Let me say first that DVD ROCKS!! Lot's of extras and tons of fun on this DVD. I had no reservations about buying a movie that I'd never seen because I know I can trust Richard Donner (Superman, Ladyhawke, Radio Flyer, The Goonies and the other Lethal films) for a good time with the exception of Assassins. Look at it this way, Lethal Weapon films are their own genre and the best of the buddy cop films.One thing that happens too often in sequels (Godfather and Star Wars Trilogy excluded) is that there seems to be a loss of certain key elements that made the original great. I missed the seriousness of the original when watching this latest installment. It's as though the characters have forgotten that they are in a mortal realm where death is something to avoid. Gibson's character had a death wish from the beginning but he never faced a dire situation without reacting emotionally. In this film, no-one seems to be real. Especially when facing life altering challenges.But, who cares? We expect sequels to be bigger and badder. The biggest opener of all the films was the blowing up of the building at the beginning of LW3. So, the flame thrower wielding madman was a step back in my opinion but fun nonetheless. Jet Li was fantastic and the dentist office scene with Uncle Benny is priceless. I loved this film and appreciate it for what it is, an all out action thriller. I wish that it had more of the flavor of 1 & 2 and less of the cornball humor that was introduced with #3. I must admit that Joe Pesci's Leo is better in this one than the other two. I found him fitting into this story better.Chris Rock was an added plus. He's much better on film than on SNL and this role fit him perfectly.The best part of Lethal 4 is the chemistry. You can tell that everyone is having fun and that makes the whole thing gel.

Gotta admit that I was a bit upset about that last. Not the fact that it was carnage, mind you, but the fact that my FAVORITE characters got the longest, most graphic, most agonizing deaths. Like Ratchet (Smoke out the eyeballs, geez!). Like Ironhide (My heart was breaking! I was bawling!). Like Optimus Prime, of course, although his death wasn't totally unexpected. And then the carnage was over for a while and I thought I was safe. But then, the ultimate heartbreak. They went and did in my favorite character, twisted old Starscream. AAARRRRGH! Again, it wasn't totally unexpected, but did they HAVE to disintegrate him before my eyes? Sheesh!Enough bawling. Here's the gistCheers--As a HUGE Star Trek fan, I gotta admit that I got a big kick out of hearing Leonard Nimoy being a naughty character...--The animation was truly spectacular! Bravo!--As a HUGE Monty Python fan, I loved hearing Eric Idle's voice speaking some witty, unique dialogue.--Some great character development in the movie, more than I expected especially given the blow-'em-up quotient.So many people wrote off the show as a 30-minute commercial for the toys, and in many ways it was, but it also addressed some classic psychological issues, and so does the movie, even throwing in a coming of age story for good measure.Jeers--The music. Sorry, I'm not into metal or Weird Al. But I did like one or two songs...--The confusing side stories and little unexplained bits! What's with the Quintessa thing? Where the heck did Unicron come from? And WHY?--Wheelie. Enough said.--Some niggling, nitpicky questions.

It is a rare animated movie that appeals both to kids and adults, but The Prince of Egypt, by sticking relatively faithfully to the biblical story on which it is based, doesn't even try. It's a movie for adults. No singing camels, no cute furry creatures, no Robin Williams. And Pharaoh thought the plagues were rough.I like and recommend this movie; four scenes in particular stick out in my mind. The opening 8-minute song sequence, a brilliant hieroglyphic montage detailing the Egyptian genocide of Israelite children, the 10 plague sequence, and of course the parting of the Red Sea are all superb. But the movie suffers from the conundrum all biblically based movies do. The Bible is first and foremost a spiritual document; moralizing is its whole point. Film is essentially a visual\/ sensual medium. Nary the twain shall meet, Ingmar Bergman movies excepted. So to make The Prince of Egypt entertaining, its makers have emphasized the Moses\/Pharoah conflict, turning it into a brotherly and familial battle. No matter its attention to details, this is essentially to miss the point.The movie also drags in the middle because it spends a lot of time with Moses in Midian, where he spent 40 yrs. after killing the Egyptian. The movie spends more time there than the Bible does, so it's unnecessary. Personally, I think the movie should have emphasized the repression and then freedom of the Israelite nation as a whole more, the central conflict revolving around culture and not family.

But does it make it a good film ??  It was an enjoyable few hours but it is definitely not a classic, it was amusing but I thought the effects were very plastiky.  It had too many plot holes.  A cloaked federation ship ?? I think not.  No explanation why worf was there. Don't get me wrong though, there was some great moments data talking about his breasts being firmer.  I gave the voyage home 7.5 out of 10 so Insurrection would get a 6.5.  I think this film would be better if you were not a trekkie, but I am. Make your own mind up.In summary, a good film, the curse is broken, but there are better trek films.

Say what you will about Moore's first two Bond movies  at least he had some enthusiasm and decent villains to work against (Katanga, Scaramanga).  Here Moore has matured, but ends up looking rather nonchalant about the whole thing.  Stromberg is the least interesting of the Bond villains (ooh, lots of money and webbed fingers).  That leaves Jaws to take up the slack, who seems to have wandered in from a Batman film.The set-work is impressive, and the romantic pairing between Bond and Amasova is interesting (why haven't they ever brought her back? - she would have been an improvement on Tanya Roberts in A View To A Kill and we would have been spared the upteenth repeat of the line Grab my hand, Stacy!). Amasova is definitely the first modern\/80's Bond girl.Basically, however, Spy is a lesser remake of You Only Live Twice.  In both, the villains are stealing special-environment vehicles from opposing foreign powers, and have a really big base where they keep it in, and the final confrontation boils down to a last-minute countdown.  And Bond has a really great vehicle to engage in a special-environment chase sequence or two.  The similarities here aren't surprising, since the producers were considering using SPECTRE until they realized they couldn't get around McClory's ownership of the rights.Overall, Spy really signalled the dip in 70's Bond that resulted in Moonraker.

It is terrifying to watch, and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see.  Amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras.  You could see that every person aboard was scared.  It was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the Titanic sank, from the computerised sinking shown to old Rose, so you knew it would break in half, and how it would go down, etc.  I felt that added another sense of tension.The love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me.  This kind of terrible scripting and love-you-till-the-end-of-time encounters is now seeping into other movies, eg Armageddon.  Does anybody honestly think a 'proper' girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons?  Or pull the finger at Hockley's 'henchman' whilst going down the elevator?  Or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard the Titanic?The sketching scene is the only love scene needed.  It is showing us that Rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel, although it is a private moment.  There is an unspoken intimacy between Rose and Jack that is beautiful, and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window.  I'm sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriend\/fiancee\/wife.On the whole, parts of the film make me twinge, that bloody song, f'rinstance.  As well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting (notice it didn't get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay? - it has been years since a film that won Best Film was nominated for that award). The effects are brilliant, along with the editing and the action sequences.
