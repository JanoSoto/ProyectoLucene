I wouldn't expect a film starring Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, David Alan Grier, Halle Berry and Robin Givens to be an amusing, quirky, and well-acted film. Each of them have talent in their own right, but are normally type-cast actors who are predictable in terms of what to expect. Well Grier, Givens and Berry gave no surprises. And Martin Lawrence, though he played his role to a tee, was pretty much Martin Lawrence. The real surprise was Murphy. This is the true Eddie Murphy charisma. A character that is beyond what I would normally expect from him, this film proves that he has talent, and was pretty much the peak of his career. If for no other reason than because it's not simply another goofy comedy a la Golden Child or Coming to America. Those films are really funny, but here, Murphy proves that he can act, too...and I don't think he's ever done it again. The problems with this film were few. The supporting cast were fairly strong...even though some were quite predictable in terms of character, they still worked out well. Robin Givens was a bit one-dimensional, but she served her purpose well. David Alan Grier was a weakness; he went overboard in this role; he played the same role in a much stronger manner (also opposite Halle Berry) in Strictly Business. And the smaller roles were all amusing Grace Jones was hilarious, especially the restaurant scene! Leonard Jackson's facial expressions were priceless, John Witherspoon was great (as was the whole Thanksgiving dinner!!) and Geoffrey Holder was funny and charismatic as the quirky commercial designer, Nelson. So what were the problems? Well the length was an issue. This film could've been 20-30 minutes shorter; two hours is just too much. Start by cutting out the sex scenes, they were yawnable and pretty much useless. Look It's Robin Givens in her panties. Look it's Robin Givens in her panties again. And guess what? Yup, three time's the charm, Robin Givens in her panties once again...granted, Robin Givens is quite the looker, but not on top of Eddie Murphy. And this film really didn't need it. While we're at it, you can take out the whole Eartha Kitt-Eddie Murphy seduction scene. Could have been done in a quarter of the time, and frankly the whole scene still makes me shudder;) As well, the cinematography was poor, with generic shots an choppy cuts (and worse fades). Now, I don't expect art-school experimentation, nor do I expect Coen Brothers quality, but they could've at least made it look pretty. The scenes are nice, but they do nothing with them.

I know I'm being totally trivial here, but a better movie wouldn't have me questioning this.I was really waiting for this one - the killer reviews and film festival buzz had me running to the theaters on opening day.  Firstly, let me say that I'm now a Guy Pierce fan - the guy simply rocks.  Carrie Ann Moss also surprised me with her very strong performance, and I've always liked Joe Pantolione (sp?) since I saw him in Bound years ago.  Aside from the great acting and occasional surprises (I loved the am I chasing him? Oh wait, he's chasing me! thing), this movie suffered from being a bit too full of itself. Don't get me wrong, the backwards narrative was an entertaining device- but without this device this movie would simply be your average thriller (a well shot one, but still average). SPOILERS I left the theater with a very, very empty feeling in my stomach.  I almost felt sick.  I love movies, and when a movie presents itself so compellingly as this one did, I literally give the film makers 2 hours of my life I separate myself from the world and try to get caught up in the world of these characters.  My problem is that the ending didn't justify my attention.  When I go to a suspense thriller, I love to mentally jot down the clues and try to put the puzzle together - there was no puzzle here. Think about it, what in the movie points to the Sammy story being fabricated (other than a near-subliminal shot of Sammy turning into Lenny in the home for the mentally disabled- that's the sort of retarded trick that has people saying `holy cow, it was all there and I missed the frames before! It's ALL there..' Nope.. It's all a trick). NOTHING showed that.  Yes, there were hints that Lenny was being manipulated and yes there were hints that there was a larger conspiracy - great stuff that had me on the edge of my seat till the ending.  But what did we get??  Pseudo-psychological bull about him creating the Sammy story to give him a point of reference that's detached from his own self to hide his guilt and confusion while he goes on to seek revenge for a murder that didn't exist???? Come on people, we're smarter than that! STOP BELIEVING THAT THE INCONSISTENCIES CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY THE `HUMAN CONDITION' AND HOW MEMORIES ARE SO ABSTRACT SO WE SHOULDN'T BE CRITICAL OF THE PLOT HOLES IN THIS MOVIE. That's cheating!  At the point we could have been told that he was abducted by alien life-forms and fed false memories so that he would go out and do their evil deeds! It would have made just as much sense (well, ok that's a little far fetched, but you see my point - or I hope you do).Lastly, think about Pulp Fiction (one of my fav. American movies of the past 10 years) take away the non-linear story line and what do you have? Great characters, an intriguing movie, incredible dialogue and a rich, memorable experience- the movie was enriched by the timeline but it did not MAKE the movie.  Memento, on the other hand, would not exist were it not for the film-school experiment with a backwards narrative.  It was a gimmick that made a hollow movie `work,' much like the big special-fx in ID4 that we art-house fools love to shake our fingers at.  Best movie of the year? Maybe.. The year has sucked so far (come on `Gladiator' or `Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger' up for Oscars? Must be the year of sappy manipulation and hollow characters!). Go rent Bound if you want a nice and juicy noir (or rent the classics).PLEASE email me if you agree! My film school buds are all teasing me for not liking such a brilliant movie..

It's ALL there..' Nope.. It's all a trick). NOTHING showed that.  Yes, there were hints that Lenny was being manipulated and yes there were hints that there was a larger conspiracy - great stuff that had me on the edge of my seat till the ending.  But what did we get??  Pseudo-psychological bull about him creating the Sammy story to give him a point of reference that's detached from his own self to hide his guilt and confusion while he goes on to seek revenge for a murder that didn't exist???? Come on people, we're smarter than that! STOP BELIEVING THAT THE INCONSISTENCIES CAN BE EXPLAINED AWAY BY THE `HUMAN CONDITION' AND HOW MEMORIES ARE SO ABSTRACT SO WE SHOULDN'T BE CRITICAL OF THE PLOT HOLES IN THIS MOVIE. That's cheating!  At the point we could have been told that he was abducted by alien life-forms and fed false memories so that he would go out and do their evil deeds! It would have made just as much sense (well, ok that's a little far fetched, but you see my point - or I hope you do).Lastly, think about Pulp Fiction (one of my fav. American movies of the past 10 years) take away the non-linear story line and what do you have? Great characters, an intriguing movie, incredible dialogue and a rich, memorable experience- the movie was enriched by the timeline but it did not MAKE the movie.

I mean, the last time I checked, tattoos cost a significant amount of $$ and, well, a PDA would have been much more convenient as well (heck, we know he had the money - why not get a nice digital camera instead of the Polaroid as well). I know I'm being totally trivial here, but a better movie wouldn't have me questioning this.I was really waiting for this one - the killer reviews and film festival buzz had me running to the theaters on opening day.  Firstly, let me say that I'm now a Guy Pierce fan - the guy simply rocks.  Carrie Ann Moss also surprised me with her very strong performance, and I've always liked Joe Pantolione (sp?) since I saw him in Bound years ago.

Howard Hawks, whose simple storytelling approach has left him, IMHO, the most underrated director in history, here gives us a third classic Western to follow Red River (1948) and Rio Bravo (1959).  Much has been made of this movie's similarities to Rio Bravo, and it is usually overlooked as a result. However, James Caan makes a better green kid type; Robert Mitchum is easily a match for Dean Martin (supercool Dino may have been, but this is Mitchum we're talking about here!); John Wayne is as good here as he was in Rio Bravo; which only leaves Arthur Hunnicutt as the weak link when compared to that greatest of all supporting actors, Mr. Walter Brennan.Saying one of the two movies is better than the other is like comparing Schindler's List to Jaws - both are brilliant and don't deserve to be dismissed as second-best.  This movie is very funny, action-packed, superbly acted, has a great opening song and features the classic Hawks themes of male bonding with the token feisty girl threatening the men.  You even get a moment or two of slapstick.One quick word about Hawks - he made my three favourite US Westerns of all time, the best film noir (The Big Sleep (1946)), great melodramas (Only Angels Have Wings (1939), To Have And Have Not (1944)), and the funniest movie I've ever seen (Bringing Up Baby (1938)).  The Thing From Another World (1951) produced by Hawks and directed by his editor Christian Nyby, has Hawks' fingerprints all over it, and is a terrific sci-fi movie.  Air Force (1943) is a great flag-waving war movie, and he even managed to crack the crime genre with Scarface (1932).

Mutilated,crippled and unbelievably rich, he hunts Lecter down, relishing the day when he will have his revenge.This rundown is undoubtedly promising and make no mistake it could have been a great film, certainly on par with 'lambs', but the way the director literalises Thomas Harris' fourth novel is dreadfully unimaginative and utterly repellent.Gone is the distinctive black humour of Harris' characters, Hopkins' as Hannibal blurts out the cannibal puns with such a wearisome monotony that it wears out its welcome soon after he first appears.  Verger was a complex and serpentine character with an implicit attraction to his lesbian sister (she is cut out of the film) in the book, in the film he is a one dimensional villain, devoid of any flesh - both literally and metaphorically.  Gary Oldman does well with what he is handed.  Moore stepping into the shoes immortalised by Jodie Foster is dealt the worst blow.  She is an incredible performer and the character of Clarice needed to go through a catharsis of sorts, im not opposed to a new actress in the role - she is just given nothing to do but run around and look erotic but hardened at the same time.The main quibble that I had with Hannibal was nothing to do with the performers or the fact that the first film was going to be difficult to live up to it is the sledgehammer mentality with which director Ridley Scott enacts the story.  This is the man sci-fi buffs hail as the master after 'Alien'.  In this film he relied on darkness, spiralling corridors and the infinity of space to act as a method of scaring the audience.  Maybe he doesnt have the same items to work with, but surely he could assert some subtlety.I have no problem with violence but he seemed to go on and on with it, the more garrish and horrifying the more he wallowed in it.

Comedy, of course, is the most subjective of genres, and individual tastes and sensibilities will weigh in heavily in regards to how this movie will be received.  But to anyone with half a brain and any self-respect whatsoever, being subjected to ninety minutes or so of this would have to be considered nothing less than cruel and unusual punishment. \tSuffice to say that after this debacle, director Franklin will not be making the Hollywood `A' list anytime soon.  Nor the `B,' `C,' `D' or `F' lists.  The good news for him is that whatever project he takes on next couldn't possibly turn out any worse than this,  and that means he's only got one way to go from here, and that's up.  As far as the performances go, French Stewart-- who obviously went into this with his eyes wide open-- had better hope that `Third Rock From the Sun' lasts, well...forever.

It makes you wonder if she even read the script before signing on to this project.  I'd like to think she either owed someone a BIG favor, or better yet, was the victim of a plot by a bitter and disgruntled manager or agent to malign her for personal, as yet undisclosed, reasons.  The bottom line is, Stewart and Wilson both have a lot to offer; it just seems so sad to see them wasted in something as unworthy as this ridiculous, offensive movie that isn't worth the film that retains it's untoward images. \tThe supporting cast includes Bill Bellamy as Larry, Tyra Banks as Holly (proving here that beauty does not necessarily equate with acting ability), Steve Hytner as Marty, Jason Bateman (in a horrendous performance) as Jesse, and Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as Rebecca.

Movies are work of fiction; there is no law saying they have to be 100% accurate.  But then, can even professional historians claim to be 100% accurate (and presumably they are paid to be exactly that)?  Still, I cannot resist the temptation to join in the argument whether THE Duel really took place.Some say it never took place, dismiss the story as propaganda, or question the identity of the German ace sharpshooter.  I wasn't there (Duh!), but, contrary to some comments on this site, I know for certain Zaitsev was NOT silent on the matter.  In memoirs published in Russian in 1971, Zaitsev DID leave a fairly detailed account of A Duel with a very skilled and experienced adversary.  Note that, for both sides, enemy snipers were top-priority targets together with officers and machine-gunners.  So, sniper duels were fairly common. By Zaitsev's own words, him and other fellow snipers had participated in (and survived) many such engagements.  This particular German sniper he calls Major Konings and identifies him as the head of the German sniper school flown in from Berlin.  This is, of course, to the best of his knowledge - based on intelligence (which could potentially be faulty) and the documents he picked off the body.  So if the names don't match, might be people are talking different engagements, or different aliases of the same person.Assuming this duel is THE ONE, the win for Zaitsev was a result of patience, persistence, the German's unwillingness to change an excellent position under a sheet of metal (authentic detail in the movie!), and most importantly, help from Zaitsev's team.  Danilov did get shot (not mortally) the day before the actual duel, though not intentionally - just a little too eager to point the position of the German Major to Zaitsev.  It was Zaitsev's teammate that baited Konings into shooting the day after, and, pretending to be hit, lured him enough to poke his head out of his hiding place.Other notes (mainly based on Zaitsev's memoirs mentioned above) 1. Zaitsev's family name derives from the Russian word for hare; another famous Stalingrad sniper was Medvedev, derived from the Russian word for bear. Not surprisingly, snipers trained by Zaitsev were called bunnies, by Medvedev - cubs.2. Zaitsev was short, stocky, blond and blue-eyed.  He had no commanding physical presence and indeed started his military career as a clerk in the navy.3. Before the war, Zaitsev's civilian occupation had been a hunter, not a shepherd.  His father and mother were very much alive; however, he was his Grandpa's favorite and felt closet to him.4. According to Zaitsev, their division crossed Volga at night, without being attacked and without casualties.  Hi mentions being armed with a submachine gun (but then, this reality wouldn't look as dramatic in place of the corresponding movie scenes).5. Zaitsev did use a teammate of his at least once to blind his opponent with reflected sunlight to escape from a tight spot.6. It was actually Zaitsev himself who was wounded by a mortar round and met victory at Stalingrad in a hospital.  Since his vision was impaired, he finished the war as a commander of an anti-aircraft battery - part of the army that participated in the taking of Berlin.

Most of all you enjoy not the words from Weaver and Hewitt but the view they provide. Now Jennifer Love Hewitt once again proves her young sexy self but you see how cunning her character is here she learned well from mother(Sigourney Weaver) and Hewitt is stunning as ever check out the short skirts and colored bras she wears. Now on to the pro and experienced con veteran and scam queen yes that is the Sigourney Weaver character and a comment on Sigourney I must say she is getting more beautiful with age wonder what her secrets are? She's looked good in the past but she attracted me most in this film I guess I'm like Ray and Gene that beauty and body attracted me so much that I would fall victim to her con. Boy us guys never learn it just goes to show how we think with our libido many times and not our mind. I suggest that you watch Heartbreakers it also has a story to it besides the con and seduction you will enjoy the beginning when Weaver and Hewitt scam Liotta and his New Jersey business that made the 13Th husband the two tricked now talk about women being in the money! Then it is down to Palm Beach, Florida requested by Hewitt where she finds unexpected love in the process while she helps mother(Weaver) do her best to con wealthy tobacco tycoon(Gene Hackman). Only to have plans go for a change. You will see Liotta go down to Palm Beach to break up the plans but never fear the pro the attractive Sigourney Weaver has a good plan B you will see in the end how she profits just pay close attention in this movie and Hewitt is happy to be to that point that is nothing is better that this sweet but cunning daughter Love Hewitt getting to leave the con nest and get that life of her own she wanted. Heartbreakers is a great film it has many things humor, con, and an intelligent story that was made great by two sexy and talented women Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt they were both ravishing and stunning.

It goes on and on through a series of sexual activities that are accomplished with such naivete and awkwardness, it can't help but raise a few chuckles.

Producers of these films always seem to approach the subject from a liberal, perspective (the villains are all on the Right but never in the right). This one is a fairly straight example of the genre though the producers are prepared to nail issues to parties and the generally lively script keeps us interested. It's rather like an extended episode of `West Wing' on a good night.The plot is routine &#150; a liberal Democrat President (James Bridges), getting towards the end of his second and final term names a liberal Democrat female senator (Joan Allen) to succeed his lately deceased Vice President. His choice must, under the 25th Amendment, be ratified by Congress, and of course a conservative Republican (Gary Oldman) chairs the relevant committee. The lady is happily married (how happy we see in her first scene) but she was involved in some high jinks at college many years ago and those ghastly super-efficient investigators who, due to the American habit of recording everything, can find out everything about anyone given enough time and money, dig this up for the delectation of Oldman's committee and the great American public. There is also another contender lurking in the sidelines with a suitable track record as a hero to sweep in if she stumbles. Naturally, with right and the President on her side everything turns out OK for Joan and the great American Republic. Most of the American public however were probably watching baseball while all this was happening, it being the height of summer.Here, the acting from some good, though not first rank performers, is generally very satisfying. James Bridges as the President exudes sleek confidence in an office he still clearly enjoys after six and a half years (he delights in ordering from the ever-attentive White House kitchens at any time of day or night) and he forcefully delivers the scriptwriter's paean of praise to the system at the end. Joan Allen as the nominee plays it pretty cool, and is all the more effective, though I wouldn't put her performance in the Academy award class. She once played a very brittle Pat Nixon, so I guess is familiar with the territory. (The first lady here is kept largely out of sight, no doubt to add frission to the scenes between the nominee and the president). The versatile Gary Oldman as her nemesis has the most difficult part, not so much a villain as the representative of the opposing forces, yet driven by his own demons. He is a little too twitchy at times but gives us a well-rounded picture. Christian Slater as his young eager beaver supporter is unimpressive - too nice in fact. William Petersen as the other contender played his character beautifully &#150; the sunny idiot who is not what he seems.A story like this provides lots of opportunities for scene stealing cameos, and there are nice ones from Irene Ziegler as Oldman's disaffected wife, Sam Elliott as the urbanely ruthless Chief of Staff, Kristen Shaw as the FBI ingenue who cracks the case, and Philip Baker Hall, that maestro of the cameo, as Joan's republican ex-governor Dad.`The Contender' is a straightforward piece. It is crisper than `The American President' and more uplifting than `Primary Colors,' but not as funny as `Wag the Dog' nor as ridiculous as `Independence Day' or `Air Force One,' and certainly not subversive like `Bulworth'. The US presidential style government was devised in another age when government sat but lightly on the governed. It has now acquired many of the characteristics of an elected dictatorship, mostly because the power of the executive branch which the president heads, through money and technology, now totally outweighs the other branches &#150; hence the `imperial presidency'.

Those are the thoughts that jump to mind as I reflect on this picture. American Beauty deals with the tragic consequences that flow from the intersecting of the disfunctional lives of a group of very strange people.The movie opens with a shot of a video in which Jane Burnham (played by Thora Birch in a forgettable performance) wishes for her father Lester's death. Lester then becomes the narrator, for lack of a better word, of the rest of the story. We know from the start how this is going to end. Jane wants Dad dead, and Lester tells us that this is the story of how he ends up dead. No mystery there. As the story progresses we discover that there are various reasons why virtually all the characters in this movie might want him dead, and we get involved in a decent enough who-dun-it.The movie has its problems, however. I found it difficult to make much sense of the story for most of the 2 hours. Particularly troublesome was watching a movie about a bunch of people who are completely unlikable; you will feel no empathy for any of these characters and you really won't care much what happens to any of them. Having said that, there is, even at those points where the movie doesn't seem to be making much sense, something vaguely compelling about it. You keep watching, even though you don't much care about these people. The story moves along at a good pace and doesn't seem to bog down at all. Annette Benning gives a good performance as Lester's less than lovable wife Carolyn, and Chris Cooper is over the top as Colonel Frank Fitts, the hard as nails, apparently homophobic father of Jane's love interest.So, there are a lot of good things about this movie. The publicity around it, which focussed largely on the relationship between Lester and his daughter's friend Angela (Mena Suvari), is a bit misleading. That relationship is actually no more important than any of the others to the story, and receives no more screen time than the others. The older man-young girl emphasis seems to me to have been bait to catch people's attention. It worked obviously. American Beauty won an undeserved - in my opinion - Academy Award as Best Picture, when it was up against far superior competition.

Harrelson, Quaid and even the seductress Vanessa Angel (you might remember her from TV's Weird Science) deliver good laughs, but it is two people who steal the show and make this film utterly hilarious- Bill Murray who gives a new meaning to the word comb-over, and Chris Elliot who gives one of the funniest moments in 90's comedy in a cameo.

The movie stars Woody Harrelson as a once great bowling champ who's career is ended by an injury to his hand for which he must spend the rest of his life with a hook.

Insulted by my friend who said it was a complete waste of money, I thought exactly the opposite. I thought it was the scariest freakin movie I'd ever seen in my life. I know I'm not gonna sleep tonight and I hate myself for reminding myself about the film. As the movie developed I recalled certain scenes, but still wasn't prepared by the full impact of it. The infamous Spiderwalk scene almost left me running from the cinema screaming like a little girl. Even though it is a brilliant movie; great to see that style of horror is still aprecciated today - I still hated it. For the mark it left on my psyche, which is totally shredded by the way. I must admit the beggining was a bit long, but as an avid movie goer I kinda expected that from an old movie. The use of lighting and music was exceptional, the music tone being unexpected and sudden to freak the **** out of you, like the Help Me stomach scene. I hated that too. Anyway, I'm gonna try to go to bed now (unlikely) but before I do I recommend The Exorcist. If you have any shred of sanity afterwards I commend you. A fine example of cinema horror history.
