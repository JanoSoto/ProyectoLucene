The movie tells about a man named Guido Orefice, who with his original personality falls in love with a schoolteacher Dora. Although Dora being currently with another man, Guido still fights for her and after 5 years he and Dora are married together and have a son, Giosué. While Guido is living his fairy tale life, not caring about the bad things in life, Italy is suddenly occupied by the German forces during the World War II. Guido and his son are taken to a concentration camp where Dora voluntarily follows them. In the camp men and women are naturally separated from each other, but Guido somehow finds a way to communicate with his wife and protect his son. Although the movie also tells about war and its sad consequences, it tells about it in a so beautiful and a happy way I've never seen before.The one thing above everything else which makes this movie so astonishing is Roberto Benigni, who plays Guido and who is also the director and the second writer of the movie. The movie got 7 Academy Award nominations and won 3 of them, you don't hear a foreign movie doing that every day, so it's a pretty huge achievement I'd say. Roberto Benigni won the Oscar of the Best Actor in a Leading Role, an Oscar more than deserved indeed. I remember Benigni saying somewhere something like it's a pretty funny thing to win an Oscar from playing yourself. If Benigni is really like Guido, then we need more people like that in the world. The character of Benigni has this unique, vivid personality which can not be described. It's like he wants everyone else to feel better than himself and he cares about his wife and son more than himself. Although the character being slightly surreal Benigni does the impossible by making the character reality, making it so believable. He is so likable, sympathetic and simply happy in a way that just makes you smile throughout the movie. An amazing role performance indeed, if I'd have three thumbs I'd put them all up.OK, if we forget about the main character in the movie the story isn't so original after all. A family driven apart during the war, forced into a concentration camp, doesn't sound so original anymore now does it? The movie pretty much hangs in the hands of the character Guido Orefice, which just makes the whole movie so brilliant, not forgetting the fantastic dialogue between the main character and other characters. This makes the screenplay very good, telling an already heard story which is always a treat for you if done well, but adding this overwhelmingly superior character to it, raising the whole movie from good to brilliant. This is complimented by the excellent music composed by Nicola Piovani, who won an Oscar from it as well. Adding so much more beauty to the story, making the funny and hilarious scenes also so dramatic and beautiful.La Vita é Bella is all in all a brilliant film. It translates the sadness to happiness and beauty in an already mentioned way, a way that can not be described. The movie isn't just playing a fool on screen and getting some recognition from it, it's about true love and real courage evolving as we understand it. This is without a doubt all in all one of the happiest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. There is sort of mixed comedy and drama, but the real focus being on the drama after all, although the comedy side being absolutely hilarious and making you laugh. If someone succeeds in making you laugh and making you emotional at the same time that is always an achievement worth mentioning. This is a movie recommendation to everyone and for god sakes please watch the original Italian version, as I like to think that dubbed versions are more like a sin. Especially when the movie includes a role performance this amazing. Roberto Benigni is a genius.

I feel so glad for recording the film on ITV1 just last Christmas or else I'd have missed out. Believe me now, if YOU haven't ever watched it you'd be missing out too. I have not seen the 1998-remake and my mum keeps telling me and telling me and telling me that she recommends that I see that film too and after an extent this irritates me and how can I if I can't find the video it was recorded on? I know she's only trying to help though and I am moved by her efforts.She does tell me that unlike most tatty, tired remakes that one is just as good if not BETTER than this original presentation of a novel which appears to be French. Neither of us could wait to watch the movie this afternoon and, after my stressful morning at college and mum's own stress from keeping everything in order with her poor bad back, it certainly lightened our hearts.To think that the technology even existed back then in the early 1960s to use such special camera effects that give the illusion of not only one but a pair of Hayley Mills for the purpose of bringing the twins and their plan that was simply fate to life.Some minutes after the overture, at the dance party at Camp Inch, that huge - and I mean HUGE - fight between the twin sisters at the dance, I think, was destined to show its audience just how rebellious, secretive and malicious those girls can be; after all, it's not everyday on such a special occasion as a dance party at a Summer Camp is ruined by merely two girls who are so angry with one another that they start up an enormous catfight, knocking stalls over, breaking record players, getting food absolutely everywhere and causing one heck of a mob and even getting the headmistress involved! My god, most kids I know wouldn't dare, they'd feel much too threatened! But I still think that all of that just adds to the comedy of it all; that shocking kind of behaviour, the malice of those two young girls triumphing over the discipline of any adult - strict or slushy alike - just adds to all the unstopping entertainment! But I completely agree with my amazing mum when she says it's sad for Vicky, Mitch's wife-to-be, being treated with such disrespect! It is not in the least bit fair for her and, answer this, is it HER fault that Margaret Evers changed back to Margaret McKendrick because Mitch divorced her? The answer is obvious.I imagine Disney wanted to make Vicky mean, bullying and selfish and she is all those - though to an extent - because for the most part, the reason she had such a bad temper was simply due to the fact that she'd reached the end of her tether with those kids and so from the point of the camping holiday, both I and my mother sympathize the long-suffering future bride completely and it's kinda sad how she forced herself to leave the man she loved because of the behaviour of his two girls. Even when she threw a tantrum just like the twin sisters in throwing pots and pans all over the place and hit the pair of them on her way out, we sympathize her and can't really blame her either.Still, we also kinda thought, they're thinking, 'it was certainly worth that slap to get her out' and, to tell the truth, I couldn't think of a much better ending; Vicky to a degree got exactly what she deserved because she was not the nicest person in the world but they still felt bad about tormenting her, made that known to their parents & life turned out to be just as they originally planned. I, myself, have experienced the trauma of my parents divorcing one another at the minor age of 6 and I couldn't believe my dad was going to spend a most of every year yet to come abroad, away from his family and I know MY biological parents will not remarry ever again but I couldn't think of a better husband for my wonderful mother than the one she has now and the message to this comparison is that all families are different.At the end, one of the girls wakes up early in the morning and tells the other of a dream she just had... the second wedding of Mitch Evers and Margaret McKendrick in the garden of their house, all their friends and relatives attended and the twin sisters who are bridesmaids grin at each other as if to say, we've done it! Our plans finally worked! I highly recommend this outrageous, fun-filled, spirited two hours for those who feel they need a nice vacation from the contemporary action thrillers and horrors e.t.c and I think you may well find that the somewhat sad moments are not really sad at all - just endearing and sentimental that's all.

Our plans finally worked! I highly recommend this outrageous, fun-filled, spirited two hours for those who feel they need a nice vacation from the contemporary action thrillers and horrors e.t.c and I think you may well find that the somewhat sad moments are not really sad at all - just endearing and sentimental that's all. The fun here is unfailing, take it from me!

Things like this seem at once to throw the film out of balance a little bit, like the film is making a straight line and suddenly makes a sharp and brief stab upward, and then back down to continue the line in the straight way it was before. One has to think about The Fisher King and realize just how largely, outlandishly, scorchingly different it is. Think about this plot when you're watching the film. You'll realize how well it modestly unravels instead of contriving itself to mystify us. The filmmakers show no ego and are not interested in impressing themselves. They are telling their vivid, dynamic story the way good films are made. The story is just completely fresh and new. And with that in mind, thinking outside the box along with Terry Gilliam and Richard LaGravanese, one shouldn't even think of the brief sporadic fantasies the film splashes at us here and there as anything so jolting.Jeff Bridges turns in a fantastic, despicably likable performance. I say this not so much because I believe he has a universal effect on anyone who understands or enjoys the movie. I say this more because I related to him greatly. I felt like his character was very familiar with his self-centered angst, bitterness lathered on top, an emotional and sexual nature quite like mine, and frankly the performance in a serious relationship quite like mine. Bridges, who I have always thought of as a very good actor, has my kudos for understanding to the point of successful portrayal a type of person who is rarely completely understood.Robin Williams, constantly underrated at this point for his self-indulgent bombast and personally difficult, nonstop communication of his sense of humor, is proved in this, as well as several other films I could mention, that he has true talent and feels his characters to the very core and projects as such. It is not and never has been right to reduce judgment upon him to surprisingly shameless look-at-me-fests like Mrs. Doubtfire, Patch Adams, and Good Morning, Vietnam, because he has always been tremendously capable. Above all, I think he is an actor whose work is founded upon intuition. He communicates his physical and psychological portrayal by emotional understanding and deep feeling. When you watch this film, do you not have that clutching grip upon his character's pain? Are you not taking that journey face to face with him?Mercedes Ruehl is not a token here. She is not just the voluptuous Brooklyn Jew girlfriend who nags, criticizes men, and makes dinner the whole time. That is the way her character lays out, because that is the path the emotional position of her presence in the story leads. She is perhaps the strongest, most decisive, and understanding person of all four main characters, and believably so. She is also very sexy and very natural. Take the scene with her and Bridges stumbling with laughter down the street after the dinner scene. She is quite real in a scene that with many other players would've been annoyingly not so.Amanda Plummer is a sad portrait of a very realistic person, ironically enough in a film that is greatly surreal. She is the lone wolf that drifts through life, crippled by a complete lack of self-assurance and with age has become extremely used to it. Plummer's rich, seldom screen time is great, very wise acting. When she is suddenly accosted by the attention and adoration of these other three people, she reacts, and I feel like I know many people who would react the same way.The Fisher King is in my opinion the first great film Terry Gilliam ever made. He had never made a bad film before this one, but this is the film that really made me connect. It's filled with emotional understanding of the human condition and a parallel story and cinematic style that are so acutely unique and naturally offbeat. It is among the definitive Gilliam films. Perhaps the click that sounded off for a truly effective film came with the connection of very similar, very compatible perspectives between the writer and the director.

I'm still not sure that the film really is much more than this. Anyway, the idea binding all these clips (primarily philosophically minded monologues) together - i actually loved, i think is a stunning idea beautifully executed. The core of the film, the unifying idea, is absolutely great, what is in question here is the bulk of the film, the content of it, that would not really damage the film in any significant way if it were to be cut out.This is not to say that Linklater is entirely unjustified in cramming his film with this loosely related, very mixed bag of intellectual mumblings. The plot of the film is basically a kid dreaming about lots of philosophical conversations, so having a film full of conversations seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do considering this. It's just that a line needs to be drawn somewhere. Theoretically you could have a film that was a week long and consisted of nothing but conversations. This is an extreme example but what's important in a film like this, is that you don't outstay your welcome with this not entirely necessary material and that you ensure that the audience knows why they're sitting through this stuff as opposed to feeling like they've wandered into the wrong cinema screen, having expected to see a real film and not a loosely cobbled together documentary. The film in fact, i think, would have a very hard time indeed, proving that it wasn't merely a poorly executed documentary, were it not for the animation technique used that keeps everything faintly within the realm of fantasy.In summary, my 1st problem with the bulk of this film is that there is perhaps too much of it, considering that it is really, non-essential material and that its not always clear exactly what you're watching and why you're expected to watch it.Another problem with this collected material is that a lot of it is crap. A lot of it is incredibly shallow, long-worded philosophy that teeters on the outermost brink of comprehensibility.

The film in fact, i think, would have a very hard time indeed, proving that it wasn't merely a poorly executed documentary, were it not for the animation technique used that keeps everything faintly within the realm of fantasy.In summary, my 1st problem with the bulk of this film is that there is perhaps too much of it, considering that it is really, non-essential material and that its not always clear exactly what you're watching and why you're expected to watch it.Another problem with this collected material is that a lot of it is crap. A lot of it is incredibly shallow, long-worded philosophy that teeters on the outermost brink of comprehensibility. Speaking frankly, if I'm going to watch a documentary about Determinism and Epistemology (which really is what this film is as much as it is a story about a kid dreaming) i want to hear from well-read philosophers who have something to say in plain English (which is something this film does have a certain amount of) as opposed to idiots with a taste for long-words who're out on a mission to do my head in.Anyway, thats all i have to say about this film really. The overall idea is absolutely beautiful, poignantly and chillingly executed, but the material that makes up the majority of the film is not entirely justifiable and largely quite irritating.

The scene that stands out for me as the worst in the movie was, unfortunately, the first meeting between Clarice and Hannibal. This is most unfortunate because that particular scene is one of my favorites in the book. I wonder if the director actually read the book this movie is based on. To the director with all due respect, Hannibal is a gentleman. He would not shout for Clarice because gentlemen do not shout for women as if they were dogs. According to the book, he called her name repeatedly as she was walking away, and only her desire for advancement brought her back.

The film is an extremely emotional film about the great spirituality Buddhism is. But it remains rather folkloric about Buddha's life and the middle way is an English translation that does not mean what the original words meant. Today in English it means the refusal to choose either one way or another and the fact that we are lacking the courage we need to face and assume both life and death because life is great and death is just as great, and life is bad and death is just as bad. Life leads to death through decay and pain. But life is also the promise of rebirth through karma and death. Death is bad because it is the result of decay and pain. But death is good too because it is the door to rebirth through karma and death itself. That's what the middle way means, not neither nor, but both one and the other. There is some attachment, tanha in Pali, that has to be severed, to the middle way seen as an in-between and a non-commitment. You have to accept both sides of nature, the universe, existence, the beginning birth, the growing and decaying life, the ending death, and then if you believe in it the beyond of a new beginning in rebirth. The film is also by far too Tibetan. I am for the little chariot, the southern Asian Buddhism, not for the northern Asian Buddhism, and particularly not for Tibetan Buddhism. This last variety has replaced the non-commitment of Buddha to the existence of God, to the existence of a soul in man, a divine presence in that soul, and his commitment to the absolute absence of any permanence with a fetishized eternal not life but survival from one life to another. In other words nirvana does not exist anymore since for Buddha nirvana is the possibility to step out of the cycle birth-life-death-rebirth and the possibility to merge with the vast principle of universal existence. Nirvana has been emptied of its meaning and replaced by some kind of sainthood that peregrinates from one being to another. What's more the film insists too much on the rites and not on the social dimension of Buddhism. And this shows a social dimension that I had not found in the Buddhist temple I have visited and worked for. They do not teach to monks only but they have a teaching mission for everyone. They do not take care of the health of monks only but they heal and cure everyone. They do not help the members of the monastic community only, closed onto themselves as they appeared to be, but they help everyone in the community at large of which they are full members. In other words this film does not really give an image of the deep spirituality of Buddhism, the search not for one self because the self cannot exist since it is impermanent like anything else, but for the light that is hidden in the very middle of things. That's the best part of Buddhism, the meditation that enables you, through a slow and long learning process in which you have to be both guided and free, to dominate your feelings, your passions, your sentiments, your cravings too, without rejecting anything but by finding the just equilibrium that will enable you to enjoy beauty as much as not to be the slave of that beauty, for one example. Yes a Buddhist can enjoy music or flowers but a Buddhist will not become attached to these and forget that he has many responsibilities to himself, to his direct community, family or other, to the social community beyond and even to the world and the universe. The Buddhists I know are able to love other people and to feel and express deep feelings and yet to remain detached enough to be able to help the friend they love with the distantiation they and he or she need to find pleasure and control pain. That is the middle way too enjoy the pleasure that will not bring pain and control the pain that may destroy the pleasure. To control does not mean to get rid of because it is impossible, to be indifferent because it is uncompassionate, inhuman, but to keep within some limits that will enable you to remain the main agent of your own life in symbiosis with those of your living companions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne ","genre":null},{"date":"7 June 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The film is a monument to the respect we owe both to life and death, compassion for both the living who are also the dying but respect to both death and life.

What's more the film insists too much on the rites and not on the social dimension of Buddhism. And this shows a social dimension that I had not found in the Buddhist temple I have visited and worked for. They do not teach to monks only but they have a teaching mission for everyone. They do not take care of the health of monks only but they heal and cure everyone. They do not help the members of the monastic community only, closed onto themselves as they appeared to be, but they help everyone in the community at large of which they are full members. In other words this film does not really give an image of the deep spirituality of Buddhism, the search not for one self because the self cannot exist since it is impermanent like anything else, but for the light that is hidden in the very middle of things. That's the best part of Buddhism, the meditation that enables you, through a slow and long learning process in which you have to be both guided and free, to dominate your feelings, your passions, your sentiments, your cravings too, without rejecting anything but by finding the just equilibrium that will enable you to enjoy beauty as much as not to be the slave of that beauty, for one example. Yes a Buddhist can enjoy music or flowers but a Buddhist will not become attached to these and forget that he has many responsibilities to himself, to his direct community, family or other, to the social community beyond and even to the world and the universe. The Buddhists I know are able to love other people and to feel and express deep feelings and yet to remain detached enough to be able to help the friend they love with the distantiation they and he or she need to find pleasure and control pain. That is the middle way too enjoy the pleasure that will not bring pain and control the pain that may destroy the pleasure. To control does not mean to get rid of because it is impossible, to be indifferent because it is uncompassionate, inhuman, but to keep within some limits that will enable you to remain the main agent of your own life in symbiosis with those of your living companions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"7 June 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The film is a monument to the respect we owe both to life and death, compassion for both the living who are also the dying but respect to both death and life. The film is an extremely emotional film about the great spirituality Buddhism is. But it remains rather folkloric about Buddha's life and the middle way is an English translation that does not mean what the original words meant. Today in English it means the refusal to choose either one way or another and the fact that we are lacking the courage we need to face and assume both life and death because life is great and death is just as great, and life is bad and death is just as bad. Life leads to death through decay and pain. But life is also the promise of rebirth through karma and death. Death is bad because it is the result of decay and pain. But death is good too because it is the door to rebirth through karma and death itself. That's what the middle way means, not neither nor, but both one and the other. There is some attachment, tanha in Pali, that has to be severed, to the middle way seen as an in-between and a non-commitment. You have to accept both sides of nature, the universe, existence, the beginning birth, the growing and decaying life, the ending death, and then if you believe in it the beyond of a new beginning in rebirth. The film is also by far too Tibetan. I am for the little chariot, the southern Asian Buddhism, not for the northern Asian Buddhism, and particularly not for Tibetan Buddhism. This last variety has replaced the non-commitment of Buddha to the existence of God, to the existence of a soul in man, a divine presence in that soul, and his commitment to the absolute absence of any permanence with a fetishized eternal not life but survival from one life to another. In other words nirvana does not exist anymore since for Buddha nirvana is the possibility to step out of the cycle birth-life-death-rebirth and the possibility to merge with the vast principle of universal existence. Nirvana has been emptied of its meaning and replaced by some kind of sainthood that peregrinates from one being to another.

He has made many films over the years and has hit some memorable home runs. Think of Close Encounters, Jaws and you've got between the two films some very big hits which delivered terrific entertainment fun. I've enjoyed his work over the years and even his lesser known works such as Tin Men are quite enjoyable and have worn well over the years.In Mr. Holland's Opus, Dreyfuss is given lots of depth to his character and he wasted no time filling in the form. The subject and script must have excited him because his performance is strong, centered, not overblown or over sentimentalized, touching, emotional when necessary and reserved when called for. There is an especially magical moment when he is in a close up with the student who excelled at singing (can't recall her name). They have an obvious sexual undercurrent going and we are led to believe, breath by breath that they will embrace and yet Dreyfuss takes his body language just to the furthest edge and then holds. The tension collapses when someone walks in the room and we are amazed that they did not kiss. It's a really great scene that aspiring actors should study; here is a pro who shows how to act with finesse.The story is terrific and the plot carefully includes many characters and although some verge on stereotypes, they all appear quite believable and human and much of this has to do with the quality of the actors and the lines they emote. There is a strong impulse to drive this film into a 'heart on your sleeves' climax and it does stray briefly into this mode. However, by the time the film is over the build up of love for this man is so immense and overpowering that the surprise he gets at the very end just makes us all weep with joy.I especially enjoyed how his character finally learned about his own failures as a father and rather than sink into depression and recrimination, he rose to that challenge in the same insightful way his entire teaching career was handled.The film is a complete joy from beginning to end; the cast as I say was superb. Given a terrific story and sensitive direction from Stephen Herek, this is as good as film entertainment ever gets. Keep the tissue box close at hand; it's a tearful joy and not easily forgotten.

The middle class was very small and the upper class was tiny. The vast majority belonged to the under-classes.Good guys didn't wear white hats and not every sheriff was a good guy.

At the same time he treats the whore with kindness and is loyal to his friend. And somehow he managed to get a good woman to love him.
