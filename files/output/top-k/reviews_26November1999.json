I'm a practicing Christian and I saw this movie with my mom who's been a practicing Catholic all her life. Neither off us was the least bit offended by this movie. In fact, we both found this movie not only funny, but intelligent and faith-affirming in its own twisted little way.Kevin Smith has taken his trademark brand of humor and incorporates it into a film that tackles the issue of what God and faith are really about. The entire cast gives good performances, particularly Alan Rickman and Linda Fiorentino (not to mention Salma Hayek in her first decent role). There are even a few moving scenes in the film as well. It's a movie I don't hesitate to recommend to anyone, Catholic or otherwise. I find it really sad that the Catholic League has been protesting this movie without seeing it first and understanding what it's really about. Especially how Kevin Smith's own faith shines through in this movie. As my mom said as we left the theater, a non-believer couldn't have possibly made this film.

It tries to cover a lot of ground, and even though it is long, it seems to rush through many events in a way that makes it seem strangely disjointed. The two strenghts of the movie are the fine acting by Ben Kingsley, and the fact that it introduces Gandhi to a wider audience than would be otherwise likely. However, if you are hoping to gain any insight into the real Gandhi then you will be disappointed. The movie also has some historical inaccuracies. The first (South Africa) section of the movie is more interesting than the latter portions. If you have the slightest interest in learning more about the Mahatma I urge you to read his autobiography The story of my experiments with truth. There will then be little doubt that this movie is not, and can never be, a whitewash to make Gandhi appear in a better light than he really deserved. I give this an 8\/10, mainly for it's entertainment value - as a biography it does not work.

Tilda Swinton is awesome in the role of Orlando, playing it with such assured dignity that she anchors what is otherwise a surreal and ethereal plotline.  One is never too sure of what is being meant in anything to do with Virginia Woolf, at least her good works, and the film takes on the challenge of engaging the viewer in a very complex allegory of the sexes with great success.The music, which was apparently done by Sally Porter herself, really works seamlessly with the movie.  And the cinematography is just so lush and sensuous and crisp that it almost approaches Kubrick's trademark dream-aura.The movie can seem a bit tedious and long though and really demands a lot from the viewer.  I would recommend it on a softly rainy day at home with a hot pot of tea in place of a book.  Yes, it's THAT kind of movie.
