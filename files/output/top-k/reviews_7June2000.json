I'm an American and I did like it, although it does not measure up to the Godfather, which was made just a few years later. I love Michael Caine and many of the scenes were very effective in conveying the mood and grittiness of the characters and settings of Newcastle.The main problems I had with the film are its pacing and editing. The movie is slow; a lot of panning and a lot of re-tread over the same areas. I don't mind a slow movie, but there has to be more going on then just walking, panning the countryside, panning the bar, panning the train - all in excess. The movie does eventually pick up , but you've got to be patient and I think this is asking too much from many American audience members (this is just a generalization, I know that there are plenty of people who won't mind it).The movie can be very choppy at times - so much so that you lose the flow and congruency of the action on the screen. Also, Some of the fights and shoot-outs will cause you to laugh because they're so fake. At the same time, there are some really good edge of your seat moments that more than make up for those short comings.Another thing I find interesting about this movie is Michael Caine's character. I thought he was going to be the brooding, dark, lone badass ala Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson, but there was, surprisingly, a lot of humor and James Bond-style randiness injected into his character. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this stuff and thought it was funny, but it snapped me out of the underworld mood and realistic feel of the movie.I gave this movie an 8\/10 and I only recommend movies to my friends that I rate an 8 and higher. I almost gave it a 7, because I do have some friends who would not like it due to the issues that I mentioned above. Ultimately, for the time period, this movie had some cutting edge stuff that even I as an American can appreciate.

Bullit time as been used countless times before in commercials, music videos, etc. The F\/X is NOT new, its NOT groundbreaking, it is simply okay.Now, on to the morals of the filmWhy is it that the good guys all wear black and kill the people that they are attempting to save. Why would they kill them? Why could they not explain to the Prisoners what is going on with the Matrix? Oh, yes, I forgot that this is an unintelligent action film. There is very little substance in the film.I dont see how anyone can find Neo and Trinity good guys. They kill people without thinking twice. The bad guy (Hugo Weaving) has more qualites than Neo and Trinity. He wants something, he wants to be free, to live a life beyond the Matrix. He has more development than the central characters. Also, the bad guys do not kill people without thinking twice. They simply are misunderstood. They are more like police officers, not bad guys. They just want things to run smoothly. Or perhaps, this is what the film makers want. It seems that I am putting more thought into the film than they did.Now, onto the action and directionThe Wachowski brothers are attempting something that has already been done in countless comics and Anime films. It seems as if they are trying to be like John Woo. They make the shoot-out in slow-mo, just like Woo.

Don't go!IF someone offers to pay your way to go see this movie! Don't do it!IF someone offers you cash money, up front, just to go see this movie! Please! PLEASE !! Stay home with Regis Philbin, or re-watch the summer re-runs!!I would not inflict this movie on my worst enemy! Why would you do this to us, Tom Cruise!I liked The Firm! I liked A Few Good Men. I've even met people who say they liked Interview With A Vampire! Though they asked me not to use their real names! ************************* I confess it!!! I looked forward to this movie.I have watched the original Mission Impossible (1996) nearly 50 times, and I could not wait for this sequel.I figured Oh, let's see more special effects, neat gadgets, great music, great sound effects, beautiful people doing very bad things in exotic locations! Round it off with an intelligent plot with a nice moral at the end. Voila!I hoped for the best!But, I confess that I also hedged my bet! I waited till this movie made $80 Million dollars, before I gave them another $8.00 for my ticket!Well, let me tell you, at $8 bucks a ticket, I figure that means that me and about 8 million others out there were robbed!You hear me Tom Cruise! I was robbed! I demand a refund!Tom Cruise, I want a refund.! E-mail me directly and let me know where I can pick it up. Folks, this is absolutely the worst movie, one could have possibly imagined Cruise coming up with. Tom, the universe is very unhappy with you, boy! +++++++++++++++++Mission Impossible 2, as a movie is Tom Cruise's narcissism exposed at its worst! We see Tom Cruise, long-haired, making meaningless tortuous (shirtless) climbs up the side of nowhere in the desert mountains, to pick up what ? --- Why, its the video of his next highly secret mission, of course! Which is conveniently dropped to him in a canister from a mysterious black helicopter passing overhead. Why? Because Tom Cruise forgot to take his cell phone ! (I am NOT making this up folks! I actually paid money to see this!).Real tense, huh?This movie is also a Matrix wannabe rip-off. Realizing this alone, can make it embarrassing for us to sit there and watch all the stolen material. Stolen are the flying kicks, the slow-motion feet-over-head shooting sequences, even the costume Tom Cruise wears looks like it was lifted right from the Matrix wardrobe property room!The only apparently original footage in this movie, the impossibly silly motorcycle chase. Which as it turns out, actually was stolen from another empty Australian waste-land flick from about 20 years ago! -- Mel Gibson's, Mad Max Road Warrior.Yet, even that brief chase in the Aussie Outback was only good for 15 minutes of wake-you-up! -- and even IT, occurred WAY TOO LATE in a hopelessly boring film.This movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seats --- and ready at any moment to lunge for the emergency Exit.Why?Okay! So what, if there's NO plot, NO drama, NO comedy!. Nothing much of anything, really, for us to care about.But, that's okay! Right?Of course it is! Why? Because you just shelled out $8.00 to see The Tom Cruise-A-Thon.In this movie we get to watch endlessly, as Tom Cruise plays himself -- 'Tom Cruise' -- as he stares down beautiful women, hoping they will go to bed with him, Tom Cruise! And why shouldn't they? Why?? Because it's Tom Cruise ! That's why!!And what's the secret? How DOES Tom Cruise stare at beautiful women and make them magically WANT to go to bed with him?' (Sh-h-h-h ! It's a secret.... But here it is!!! As demonstrated in this movie! Tom Cruise simply makes sexy Tom Cruise style stares, through the dancing legs of very fast flamenco dancers -- and he does it without blinking!That's it ! We know this method works, and, apparently it works every time! Because is a scene or two later we next get to see Tom Cruise in bed with another young woman who simply could not resist the stare of Tom Cruise!But wait, there's more!In this movie we get to see Tom Cruise in several different roles.First, we have Tom Cruise playing who else? Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise rides around in a new black sportscar, speeding along on lonely mountain roads. Why? Because Tom Cruise has finally FOUND his cell phone, and now Tom Cruise wants to make prank phone calls to the girl in the next car! They spin out of control, of course. But, the near-death experience of it all is just too much for them. So, this leads naturally to ... uh, well to the bedroom, of course! After all, he IS Tom Cruise! And this IS The Tom Cruise Show isn't it?Next, we see Tom Cruise, mournfully gooning into the camera, just as Tom Cruise learns part of Tom Cruise's REALLY impossible mission is. Tom Cruise is to tell the girl -- the same girl Tom Cruise just finished having casual anonymous sex with the night before -- that if SHE should decide to accept it , that Tom Cruise needs her to go to bed with one of her former boyfriends!(Deep Huh?) She does it of course! Why Because she has seen Tom Cruise's stare, and has even been in bed with, well, Tom Cruise! Need we say more?Heavy, Huh?But, wait!! It all works out okay! Why?Because it just so happens that THIS ex-boyfriend of hers just ALSO happens to like to dress up like Tom Cruise, to wear Tom Cruise masks, and even likes to go out-of-doors, fooling people into believing that he's the REAL Tom Cruise !  Hey! Just like the REAL Tom Cruise ! Meanwhile, back at the ranch ....We learn that the 'REAL? Tom Cruise (oxymoron?) is pacing back and forth in the midst of Australian Outback, waiting for the director, or writers, or the mysterious black helicopter to please come back and to tell him (and the audience!!) what the rest of the movie is about, because we doesn't have a CLUE!!!!!! And what's more, Tom Cruise has just told the audience that they may have to stay in the theater until Tom Cruise finds out what's really going on!!!! (He REALLY says that folks!!!!!!)Then some people in the audience started wondering out loud, But, why doesn't somebody just knock off Tom Cruise??? That way, they don't have to finish writing the script for this move! We don't have to stay in the theater anymore, and the remainder of its hostages can all go home! This mindless drool goes on and on, with the rest of the ENTIRE movie.The camera drags us (some of us are kicking and screaming by now!) from dumb scene to dumb scene, always into situations invented just so the bad guys can provide Tom Cruise (the producer!) opportunities to cameo Tom Cruise (the star!) !!!!!But, who cares? That's okay! Afterall, it's The Tom Cruise Show isn't it?We see Tom Cruise playing the Good Guy! We see Tom Cruise, pretending to be a bad guy, pretending to be the good guy.

(Fooled ya, huh! ) Well, the audience wasn't.The high-tech stunts were obviously added AFTER someone had already seen the Matrix 30-times. The Cruise even embarrassingly wears the same long leather coat, with the same dark shades, strolls around in the same big bad building, to have the same shoot-em-up scene, with the same bunch of all-bad rent-a-cops, using the very same 50 guns Keanu Reeves left in the long-coat.!!!!!!)And STILL there is NO plot anywhere on the screen !

Don't go!IF someone offers to pay your way to go see this movie! Don't do it!IF someone offers you cash money, up front, just to go see this movie! Please! PLEASE !! Stay home with Regis Philbin, or re-watch the summer re-runs!!I would not inflict this movie on my worst enemy! Why would you do this to us, Tom Cruise!I liked The Firm! I liked A Few Good Men. I've even met people who say they liked Interview With A Vampire! Though they asked me not to use their real names! ************************* I confess it!!! I looked forward to this movie.I have watched the original Mission Impossible (1996) nearly 50 times, and I could not wait for this sequel.I figured Oh, let's see more special effects, neat gadgets, great music, great sound effects, beautiful people doing very bad things in exotic locations! Round it off with an intelligent plot with a nice moral at the end. Voila!I hoped for the best!But, I confess that I also hedged my bet! I waited till this movie made $80 Million dollars, before I gave them another $8.00 for my ticket!Well, let me tell you, at $8 bucks a ticket, I figure that means that me and about 8 million others out there were robbed!You hear me Tom Cruise! I was robbed! I demand a refund!Tom Cruise, I want a refund.! E-mail me directly and let me know where I can pick it up. Folks, this is absolutely the worst movie, one could have possibly imagined Cruise coming up with. Tom, the universe is very unhappy with you, boy! +++++++++++++++++Mission Impossible 2, as a movie is Tom Cruise's narcissism exposed at its worst! We see Tom Cruise, long-haired, making meaningless tortuous (shirtless) climbs up the side of nowhere in the desert mountains, to pick up what ? --- Why, its the video of his next highly secret mission, of course! Which is conveniently dropped to him in a canister from a mysterious black helicopter passing overhead. Why? Because Tom Cruise forgot to take his cell phone ! (I am NOT making this up folks! I actually paid money to see this!).Real tense, huh?This movie is also a Matrix wannabe rip-off. Realizing this alone, can make it embarrassing for us to sit there and watch all the stolen material. Stolen are the flying kicks, the slow-motion feet-over-head shooting sequences, even the costume Tom Cruise wears looks like it was lifted right from the Matrix wardrobe property room!The only apparently original footage in this movie, the impossibly silly motorcycle chase. Which as it turns out, actually was stolen from another empty Australian waste-land flick from about 20 years ago! -- Mel Gibson's, Mad Max Road Warrior.Yet, even that brief chase in the Aussie Outback was only good for 15 minutes of wake-you-up! -- and even IT, occurred WAY TOO LATE in a hopelessly boring film.This movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seats --- and ready at any moment to lunge for the emergency Exit.Why?Okay! So what, if there's NO plot, NO drama, NO comedy!. Nothing much of anything, really, for us to care about.But, that's okay! Right?Of course it is! Why? Because you just shelled out $8.00 to see The Tom Cruise-A-Thon.In this movie we get to watch endlessly, as Tom Cruise plays himself -- 'Tom Cruise' -- as he stares down beautiful women, hoping they will go to bed with him, Tom Cruise! And why shouldn't they? Why?? Because it's Tom Cruise ! That's why!!And what's the secret? How DOES Tom Cruise stare at beautiful women and make them magically WANT to go to bed with him?' (Sh-h-h-h ! It's a secret.... But here it is!!! As demonstrated in this movie! Tom Cruise simply makes sexy Tom Cruise style stares, through the dancing legs of very fast flamenco dancers -- and he does it without blinking!That's it ! We know this method works, and, apparently it works every time! Because is a scene or two later we next get to see Tom Cruise in bed with another young woman who simply could not resist the stare of Tom Cruise!But wait, there's more!In this movie we get to see Tom Cruise in several different roles.First, we have Tom Cruise playing who else? Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise rides around in a new black sportscar, speeding along on lonely mountain roads. Why? Because Tom Cruise has finally FOUND his cell phone, and now Tom Cruise wants to make prank phone calls to the girl in the next car! They spin out of control, of course. But, the near-death experience of it all is just too much for them. So, this leads naturally to ... uh, well to the bedroom, of course! After all, he IS Tom Cruise! And this IS The Tom Cruise Show isn't it?Next, we see Tom Cruise, mournfully gooning into the camera, just as Tom Cruise learns part of Tom Cruise's REALLY impossible mission is. Tom Cruise is to tell the girl -- the same girl Tom Cruise just finished having casual anonymous sex with the night before -- that if SHE should decide to accept it , that Tom Cruise needs her to go to bed with one of her former boyfriends!(Deep Huh?)

Its not just black and white like other war movies, it actually shows that even the bad guys have feelings, and that they are actual beings. the movie also contains a certain surrealism, like when they plant C4 on a football and shoots after in a moving vehicle, or when they practice their assault on a cow, and it blows up. i have almost nothing but praise for this movie, it is so real, and the amazing directing by  David O. Russel is just an eye-opener.

Steven Spielberg's Jaws of the 90s has action, adventure, thrills, excitement, everything you would expect from a special effects picture. Jurassic Park is about a theme park on an island in the Pacific Ocean that features much different attractions than your usual amusement park. Genetically created dinosaurs are the main attraction here, and a group of scientists, a lawyer, and two kids are invited to view the park. The park is owned by Dr. John Hammond, portrayed by Oscar-winning Gandhi director Sir Richard Attenborough. He invites paleontologists Sam Neill and Laura Dern; mathematician Jeff Goldblum; lawyer Martin Ferrero; and grandchildren Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards to Jurassic Park and they go on the ride of their lives! If only they can survive after things start breaking down over the park and the dinosaurs begin to run amok. This movie features probably the best special effects ever created for a feature film. The dinosaurs look incredibly real, and they're awesome to watch. The sound effects are scary, especially if you saw this in a theater. The visual effects, sound, and sound effects editing won well-deserved Oscars. Some people said that the performances here come off flat. Well there's no doubt the dinosaurs upstage the humans in the film, but I think the performances are terrific too. Neill, Dern, Attenborough, Mazzello, Richards, and especially Goldblum are very good in this movie. And there are two other familiar faces in the cast in smaller parts Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight as computer technicians who work on the island. Jurassic Park is one of Steven Spielberg's best movies. It's great fun from start to finish. Followed by the excellent second movie The Lost World Jurassic Park.**** (out of four)  ","genre":null},{"date":"7 June 2000","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  WOW!!!

There is barely no one who sits on the fence and claims indifference. It's impossible to be neutral to a film like this because it plays itself out to the very extreme. Some will savor the experience; others will find it unbearable.At over 3 hours, Magnolia comes with a lot of baggage. It is a mighty test of the audiences endurance and sheer stamina. Few films can put you through this type of journey. I found Magnolia to be a well-crafted expose of the lives of various people in and around the San Fernando Valley over the course of 48 hours. During that time, these people have to confront their inner demons and attain some sort of enlightenment amidst this bleak, harrowing life that they lead.This idea is not original, in fact it smells particularly like an Altman dish. Altman's 'Short Cuts' followed a similar plot formula and also lasted 3 hours. The difference with this film is that, unlike Short Cuts, the film's various stories do have a neat and interesting conclusion.  Magnolia doesn't end inconclusively; these people's lives will make sense and they will all come together by the end of it.Director Anderson, who brought Boogie Nights to us, uses many of the same actors. Even though these characters are different from those in Boogie Nights, we still feel a certain affinity to them. Scorsese often uses this concept; he casts many of the same actors in his films, thus as the movie opens we already feel like we know them. Like in Boogie Nights, the subject matter dealt with, is not pretty. We have drugs, sex, death, homosexuality...you name it. From that description, many would say American Beauty springs to mind. It's true the issues confronted are often the same, but Magnolia is less subtle, and less sleek. Still, we should not write it off as a fine piece of cinema.The structure of the film is also very similar to Anderson's previous effort. The first half is like the build up to an operatic chorus; the tempo gets more and more dramatic until it reaches fever pitch. There is bang that is designed to really move us and bring out our deepest emotions.The second half starts with the tempo rescinding, but we slowly start to feel the momentum picking up again. And we know the final climax is gonna be even more explosive.  This idea is always in fear of being ridiculed if it's not done right. The idea must be to have each climax genuinely meaningful and dramatic. Audiences today are rarely shocked because they've seen it all before, so to succeed in getting their attention, is a very tall order. I, for one liked the way the cookie crumbled; the bizarre denouement was especially memorable.The acting here cannot be faulted. I am not exaggerating when I say that I can't recall a finer ensemble piece ever. The performances all round are dynamic in scope and the range and potential each actor shows is truly remarkable. Cruise, oscar-nominated, as he was, is astonishing. He has never before demonstrated this sort of on-screen captivity; his effort goes unnoticed, and he must now have finally cemented himself as a good actor by everyone's standards. If you are is still not convinced after this performance; you'll never be!!!The stories here are often inter-connected as you may guess but they are far from predictable. This is good because the audience's attention does not wither. You ought to feel curious as to how it will all come together. If not, then the experience is likely to be dire, to say the least. As I said, Magnolia is like a roll of the dice; you don't know what you are going to get. Some will savor the experience, others will feel hard done-by. It is difficult to predict who will and who will not like it. It is certainly not a safe bet.  It is a massive gamble that will not always pay off. From the entertainment standpoint, the odds of success are minimal. I say this because your average cinema go-er will be tired and bored and will have finished his popcorn box with 2 hours till to spare.I, for one, managed to get through the experience with some energy to spare. Not a lot, mind you!! I did at times feel exhausted, but ultimately I profited from the experience. The roll of dice had my number on it.

I've just returned from the cinema, and for the past 2 hours I felt like I was actually in a U-boat.  Thats how realistic this film is.As you probably know, the story is about an American Naval team attempting to capture the Enigma device from a battered German submarine, but on capture things go wrong, seamen die, and the Americans are stranded on the battered German boat.  Imagine the feeling.  Not only have these guys lost many of there men, there stuck on a German submarine, with just two German-speaking men, and the submarine has already taken a battering from another American submarine.  As well as that, there expecting another German boat any minute.  Uh-oh.So, with this set-up, we have another Hollywood masterpiece in the making.  Jonathan Mostow clearly researched heavily for this project, wrote a very effective screenplay and directed with a certain style that made you feel you were there.Some of the scenes were breathtaking, such as a view of the sea, with about 10 depth chargers gradually exploding.  The view of the sailors on board as they explode is incredible.  You find yourself thinking 'God, I hope they make it!'I only found three queries with this film.  Bill Paxton, David Keith and Jon Bon Jovi.  I thought these guys desereved bigger roles.  In the brief half-hour we see them, they were all outstanding, with Jon Bon Jovi (to my surprise) leading the way.  But, soon they were gone, and I felt a big part of the film went to.  Still, Matthew McConaughey was outstanding as the rookie, make-shift captain.  Good old Harvey Keitel supported him with respect whilst being stern, and Jack Noseworthy, whom I recognised from 'Event Horizon' was really impressive as radio-man and half-German Wentz.  He is definately one for the future.Overall, I felt the effects were excellent.  The direction was outstanding.  The cast was mouth-watering and the music made hardly any difference.If you enjoyed any war film from the past 40 years, enjoy water films like Jaws, or submarine films, such as Das Boot and The Hunt for Red October, then this film is for you.  If your looking for a good night out, then I recommend this film for you.It's worth the entrance fee, and gives you the closest feeling to being in a World War II U-boat, ever!10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 June 2000","score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Well, what can I say.

Jonathan Mostow clearly researched heavily for this project, wrote a very effective screenplay and directed with a certain style that made you feel you were there.Some of the scenes were breathtaking, such as a view of the sea, with about 10 depth chargers gradually exploding.

Bill Paxton, David Keith and Jon Bon Jovi.  I thought these guys desereved bigger roles.  In the brief half-hour we see them, they were all outstanding, with Jon Bon Jovi (to my surprise) leading the way.  But, soon they were gone, and I felt a big part of the film went to.  Still, Matthew McConaughey was outstanding as the rookie, make-shift captain.  Good old Harvey Keitel supported him with respect whilst being stern, and Jack Noseworthy, whom I recognised from 'Event Horizon' was really impressive as radio-man and half-German Wentz.  He is definately one for the future.Overall, I felt the effects were excellent.  The direction was outstanding.  The cast was mouth-watering and the music made hardly any difference.If you enjoyed any war film from the past 40 years, enjoy water films like Jaws, or submarine films, such as Das Boot and The Hunt for Red October, then this film is for you.

If you're watching death play chess with a knight errant for the latter's remaining hours, you're watching a Bergman.  When you see a terminal piece of crap oozing with delightful romantic misunderstandings, you know that Nora Ephron has made another film.  And when you see a white dove fly in slow motion through a wall of flame and gunfire, what can you be watching but a John Woo film.In a very short period of time, Woo has become the most imitated director in the world.  Films as varied in quality from the Matrix to Killing Zoe employ scenes, characters, and stunts that have long been a staple of the growing Woo archetype.  Those in the know - that legion of geeky, parents' basement-dwelling, Dungeons & Dragons-playing, philospher-kings that own bootleg copies of The Killer in Cantonese - know that when some cracker hack with a steady cam makes an action film in the United States, it will inevitably contain a scene that they aped from a Woo classic.With that in mind, it is an increasingly jarring experience when a new Woo film is released that is actually directed by John Woo.  One enters the theater with an air, rare anymore, of the penitent entering one of those stone cathedrals in which Woo loves so much to film.  It can only help, although only marginally, that in this, his fourth Hollywood production, there is nary a whiff of Travolta, Slater, or Van Damme.Mission Impossible 2 is the quintessential John Woo film.  It occupies a space beside Hardboiled, The Killer, A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2, Face\/Off and Bullet in the Head as one of a continuing string of genre-defining action films. The story concerns Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt, top agent of the Impossible Mission Force, tracking down an international terrorist (Dougray Scott) who has stolen a priceless vaccine for an artificially created super-virus.  Along the way, Cruise falls for a stunning Thandie Newton playing a super-thief sporting a romantic history with Scott's baddie. The plot centers around the efforts of retrieving the vaccine while containing the virus.If you don't get Woo - you probably won't get the film.  Without a healthy background in Woo-isms, a few things may strike the casual viewer as a bit odd.  With that in mind, I've included a small glossary.the seemingly unmotivated slow-motion exposition - when an American director films something in slow motion, he does so to show an important prop that will be pivotal, no doubt, in future action.  When Woo does it, he's talking about that first glance that stretches, the moment when a villain and a cop discover that they are soul-brothers, that eternal instance in macho-lore where the gun and the hand speak the poetry of life and death. Huzzah!the flying dove\/pigeon - when a Western director films a pigeon or dove in flight, they're filming something in Venice or Paris.  When Woo films a dove in flight it is always in the seemingly unmotivated slow-motion exposition highlighting a pause in a ferocious firefight during which the duelists take stock of themselves, the positions that they are in in relation to life and to nature - the absurdity of the dance that they have not choreographed, but are helpless to complete.the death of innocents - when a Western director films an innocent bystander getting shot during a firefight that does not involve them, they are filming a belligerent ethnic cabbie that deserved the bullet for getting off the boat in the first place.  When Woo films an innocent bystander flitting off to his final reward, he is asking the audience is this not our fate?  To laugh or be the laughed at?  To shoot or be the shot?  In its essence, Woo posits Niezche's Ubermensch among the weak and the venal.  Asses are kicked.the bizarre and stilted dialogue - When a Western director films bizarre and stilted dialogue, they have made the terrible and lamentable error of hiring Joe Esztherhaus - when Woo films bizarre and stilted dialogue he is saying I am filming Opera.  Spoken Opera sounds odd, does it not?the two-handed pistol-packing - When a Western director films his hero brandishing a gun in each hand, sliding across a floor, rolling and tumbling, and blasting away, he is stealing from John Woo.  Woo is the first director in modern cinema to understand that a gun is not only an extension of a man's penis, it must do things that a man wishes his penis could do. And there must be two of them.the Bergman Persona shift - When a Western film has a hero that identifies with the villain, that hero is a brilliant FBI agent\/investigative reporter\/grizzled detective\/behavioral psychiatrist that gets in the mind of the bad guy to track him down.  When John Woo has a hero that identifies with the bad guy - sometimes he actually becomes the bad guy (Face\/Off). More importantly, the good guy always has a moment when they realize that they are actually behaving just like the bad guy but something, fate perhaps, has made them the good guy.  Also, in Woo, you not infrequently see the bad guy and the good guy cooperating in some capacity to foil, or at least delay, the eventual victory of one over the other.There are hundreds of Wooisms - these are just the most consistent and prominent.  Know these Woo-isms and your understanding of the poetry of MI 2 improves immeasurably.I believe that it's important to take a moment here to comment on Tom Cruise's alarming lack of sexual chemistry with any of his romantic leads post Risky Business.  He has a vaguely weasel-reptile quality that makes his midgety good-looks more distracting than sexual.  Imagine a car-salesman faking an orgasm and you're halfway to imagining the extent of Cruise's lack of sexual charm (he can not be held responsible in Top Gun, however.  In Top Gun Kelly McGillis' noggin is so much larger than Cruise's dimunitive coconut that one is in eternal and mortal fear that she will actually consume him praying-mantis style - it is a problem that continues in the execrable Titanic in which the gigantic Kate Winslet looks as though, at any moment, she's going to wolf Leo down with a crumpet and a spot of tea). It doesn't hurt the film however, as any student of Woo knows that women are just the scarves that bind the hero and the villain in that eternal West Side Story scarf and knife fight.Just as last fall's Galaxy Quest is the best new Star Trek film in decades, Mission Impossible 2 is the best new James Bond film in decades.

Even leaving questions of quality aside, the film is so SHORT.  The original `Fantasia' was over two hours; the sequel is just 75 minutes, over ten of which have been borrowed from the original in any case.  Segments which are too short individually combine to form a concert that's too short overall.  The film huffs and puffs as it's strangled by its own brevity.  For instance*  Beethoven's 5th symphony, 1st movement.  The original `Fantasia' gave us ALL of the sixth (well, minus some exposition repeats); this time we get just a single narrow slice of the fifth (again, minus exposition repeats - and we need them more this time).  There's SOME congruence between the images on screen and the music they illustrate.  Or at least, there WOULD be congruence if these images were illustrating the symphony as a whole.  The triumphant blaze of colour which the animators fling at us after a couple of minutes is absent in Beethoven's fifth until the start of the fourth movement.  We don't even get so far as the second movement.*  Respighi's `The Pines of Rome' has been shorn of its lovely `pines of the catacombs' sequence.  This is a minor point, because the segment fails for many other reasons - I'll get to them later.*  `Carnival of the Animals' (by Saint-Saëns) consists of I don't know how many tiny, delicious musical tidbits.  The animators have only bothered to use ONE of them.  The result is some vibrant, fresh, funny animation that's over in less than two minutes.  Why bother?*  The constant tin soldier story has been set to a tiny, one-movement Shostakovich piece that, whatever they tell us, doesn't suit it at all.  I can understand why they chose Shostakovich, but this particular piece never settles down to give the images time to breathe.  Why not, say, the ninth symphony - complete, of course ...?  At least that has one or two slow bits.Oh dear.  But it gets worse.  Remember that the original `Fantasia' was a masterpiece.  Look at Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite.  Not only do the images express whatever of value lay in the ballet; they soar with the music in a way that no ballet ever could.  But it's not just Tchaikovsky.  Every movement is like this.  -Well, there is one exception the second movement of Beethoven's sixth.  But apart from that, the images, however surprising they may initially appear, flow DIRECTLY from the music.  The animators working on the sequel have tried hard; I'm sure they have; but to no avail.  It's as if animators of today can no longer listen to music at all.For proof, consider `The Pines of Rome'.  Were they TRYING for a mismatch?  Respighi's tone-poem suite illustrates what it claims to illustrate the mood of four pine-laden parts of the city of Rome.  It's bright, sharp, sunlit, Mediterranean music.  If this had been part of the original Fantasia program the animators would have STARTED with Rome, although they may have gone on to something else (a Rome of the past, or of the future, or a fantasy city, or the insects inhabiting the pines of Rome, or something).  What do we get instead?  Plastic computer-rendered whales, swimming around lugubriously in an Arctic winter.  They just don't fit, and there's no way to disguise this.  The final movement of the Pines suite is a march.  WHALES CAN'T MARCH.  There's no way to disguise this, either.This is just the most extreme instance.  The film as a whole is a flop.  (Anyone who has read my reviews of other Disney efforts will know how much it hurts me to say this.)  It falls even further beneath `Allegro non Troppo' than that film, for completely different reasons, fell beneath `Fantasia'.

Segments which are too short individually combine to form a concert that's too short overall.  The film huffs and puffs as it's strangled by its own brevity.  For instance*  Beethoven's 5th symphony, 1st movement.  The original `Fantasia' gave us ALL of the sixth (well, minus some exposition repeats); this time we get just a single narrow slice of the fifth (again, minus exposition repeats - and we need them more this time).  There's SOME congruence between the images on screen and the music they illustrate.  Or at least, there WOULD be congruence if these images were illustrating the symphony as a whole.  The triumphant blaze of colour which the animators fling at us after a couple of minutes is absent in Beethoven's fifth until the start of the fourth movement.  We don't even get so far as the second movement.*  Respighi's `The Pines of Rome' has been shorn of its lovely `pines of the catacombs' sequence.  This is a minor point, because the segment fails for many other reasons - I'll get to them later.*  `Carnival of the Animals' (by Saint-Saëns) consists of I don't know how many tiny, delicious musical tidbits.  The animators have only bothered to use ONE of them.  The result is some vibrant, fresh, funny animation that's over in less than two minutes.  Why bother?*  The constant tin soldier story has been set to a tiny, one-movement Shostakovich piece that, whatever they tell us, doesn't suit it at all.  I can understand why they chose Shostakovich, but this particular piece never settles down to give the images time to breathe.  Why not, say, the ninth symphony - complete, of course ...?  At least that has one or two slow bits.Oh dear.  But it gets worse.  Remember that the original `Fantasia' was a masterpiece.  Look at Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite.  Not only do the images express whatever of value lay in the ballet; they soar with the music in a way that no ballet ever could.  But it's not just Tchaikovsky.  Every movement is like this.  -Well, there is one exception the second movement of Beethoven's sixth.  But apart from that, the images, however surprising they may initially appear, flow DIRECTLY from the music.  The animators working on the sequel have tried hard; I'm sure they have; but to no avail.  It's as if animators of today can no longer listen to music at all.For proof, consider `The Pines of Rome'.  Were they TRYING for a mismatch?  Respighi's tone-poem suite illustrates what it claims to illustrate the mood of four pine-laden parts of the city of Rome.  It's bright, sharp, sunlit, Mediterranean music.  If this had been part of the original Fantasia program the animators would have STARTED with Rome, although they may have gone on to something else (a Rome of the past, or of the future, or a fantasy city, or the insects inhabiting the pines of Rome, or something).  What do we get instead?  Plastic computer-rendered whales, swimming around lugubriously in an Arctic winter.  They just don't fit, and there's no way to disguise this.  The final movement of the Pines suite is a march.  WHALES CAN'T MARCH.  There's no way to disguise this, either.This is just the most extreme instance.  The film as a whole is a flop.  (Anyone who has read my reviews of other Disney efforts will know how much it hurts me to say this.)  It falls even further beneath `Allegro non Troppo' than that film, for completely different reasons, fell beneath `Fantasia'.  I must mention one thing, though the `Rhapsody in Blue' segment, created hastily at the last minute, is superb; not QUITE worthy of `Fantasia', but close.

If you go to see this movie expecting anything different, you'll be sorely disappointed.However, if you're a Chan fan, prepare to be amazed once again.  It's not the same spectacle one would find in previous works such as Rumble in the Bronx, but impressive nevertheless.  Furthermore, the plot that ties these action sequences together is better than can be found in most films of the same genre.  The clash between far east and wild west cultures and cinematographic stereotypes is amusing enough to keep the film entertaining throughout, and Chan's own tongue-in-cheek sense of humor makes the piece that much more delightful to watch.Don't look for this one at the next Academy Awards, but then that's not what Jackie Chan is all about, is it.
