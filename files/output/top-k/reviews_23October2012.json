[{"date":"23 October 2012","score":"","review":" October Sky is an inspirational movie of a young boy and his friends who are passionate about their dream of making rockets at a time when the Russians had just launched Sputnik. It is about perseverance of a boy in the midst of all adversities, misunderstandings, hardships and challenges. His desire to pursue what his real calling is and realise it. It is about inspiration and courage.Initially not a very bright student, his new born passion of building rockets sees him take on subjects that weren't his cup of tea (maths and calculations). When faced with lack of financial resources, he along with his friends take up to stealing old unused railway tracks. (That scene where they have just unlinked a rail from an unused track - or so they thought - and then they hear the train coming, is quite hilarious!)The most poignant part of the movie is his strained relationship with his father who wants to see him take over his job as supervisor in a coal mine and thinks his running after rockets is a waste of time. In spite of the animosity and difference of opinion, Homer acknowledges to his father that he is his real hero. At the end, his father understands him and appreciates his talent.The friendship among the four of them, each one of a different kind, is quite warming. All driven by the passion to build rockets together. Thus they earn the name 'Rocket Boys'. The role and inspiration of their teacher Miss Riley too is aptly portrayed... her desire to see them go to college and become someone in life!Worth watching it every now and then! http\/\/vcastilino.blogspot.in\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2012","score":"","review":" October Sky is an inspirational movie of a young boy and his friends who are passionate about their dream of making rockets at a time when the Russians had just launched Sputnik.
