If you have yet to see it, let me preface this by saying--leave your house this instant and see it at once. If you consider yourself at all a fan of the art of film-making, you must watch it. It is a refreshingly original concept done so beautifully and so painstakingly, it is a movie that everyone should at least see once. I found it brilliant, thought provoking, entertaining, and moving; not everyone will. It is a deeper, different type of movie than your typical Hollywood blockbuster--yet for this very reason I recommend it to everyone. See it once and then judge it. But do see it. Truly challenging, exceptional movies of this caliber come along once in a blue moon. I cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but at the very least I can guarantee that everyone will have something to say about it after they have seen it. I advise people to see Donnie Darko so certainly precisely because it is the kind of movie that took me years to actually see myself. I would hear people talk about it, little by little--mentioning the convoluted plot, the arguments they had with their other friends about what the movie actually meant, or simply the 6 foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank who visits a possibly schizophrenic high school kid to prophesize the end of the world--And it never really occurred to me that this would be the one movie above all others that I should rush out and see. And it was, of course; I wish I had gotten to it back when it was first released. But people can make it out to be so dark and bizarre, not to mention the fact that the original advertising campaign was god awful (the back of the original DVD box likens it to the same sort of movie as Final Destination, and frankly, no two movies could be more disparate at heart. It's like saying Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is in the tradition of Rumble in the Bronx). But I was wrong. For one thing, it is NOT that dark at heart. Darkness plays an important role in the context of the movie, of course. Yet once you understand it, you realize that it really doesn't have much to do with horror at all. There are elements that seem a little scary before you understand them, and there is an inescapable element of tragedy by the end, yet this is ultimately intermingled with so much hope. And that is what makes Donnie Darko so exemplary a movie. I dismissed it originally as just another failed attempt at being strange and different--come on, I thought to myself! Who are you trying to kid? A movie about a six foot tall demonic prophesizing bunny named Frank??!!??--but I made a tremendous mistake. Donnie Darko is in fact one of the best movies ever made. It IS strange and different, sure--yet in an engaging way that achieves film-making greatness. What is so superb about it, exactly? To be honest, everything. Perhaps what I like best about the film is its depth, a feature appallingly absent from the vast majority of modern films. Donnie Darko is a movie that pulls you in, not only because the world it creates is so rich and interesting and teeming with so many wonderful characters, but because the plot itself is not spoon fed to you. It encompasses a great deal more than first meets the eye, and the viewer can't help but find himself increasingly drawn into Donnie's world, trying to figure out with him precisely what is going on and what it all means. To be honest, I wasn't quite positive of what it all meant even by the end the first time I watched it; seeing it again, coupled with the added information provided by the director's cut, helped it all to make sense. (As a note, I personally felt that the original movie, brilliant though it was, left too may loose ends open to the viewer's interpretation. In my opinion, the Director's Cut provides information that makes the movie far more coherent as a whole. However, both versions are superb, and not everyone agrees with my preference for the DC. If, however, you have seen the original and walked away thinking it all nonsensical and incomprehensible, do try the DC. It renders things much clearer, as does a trip to the website www.donniedarko.com.) But the movie DOES make sense; those who don't think so simply haven't wasted the effort to figure it out, whether by rewatching the movie, visiting the web site, or trying the Director's Cut. Donnie Darko, despite often being pegged as otherwise, operates in a rational universe where everything adds up to a complete and very intelligible whole. It is simply a matter of piecing it all together, which is, of course, a great deal of the fun. Even beyond its depth and the fascinating world it affords us a glimpse of, Donnie Darko is amazing for so many other reasons. The satirical look it provides at life in the 80's and the often misguided self-righteous authoritarians found in charge of private high schools--not to mention the way they tend to react against those who stand out from the herd and refuse to conform--is quite telling, and not a little humorous as well. The music is fabulous. It sets the mood for the 80's perfectly, and nearly all the songs were chosen not only because they suit the period, but because the lyrics make sense within the context of the film as well. Very well done. And the film has been put together as all good art should be (but usually is not)--every thread was chosen for a purpose that contributes to the cohesiveness of the whole. This is made clear when you listen to the director, Richard Kelly, in the commentary on the Director's Cut; the numerous subtleties and nuances placed into the movie which all were employed for specific reasons in order to contribute to the plot, its themes, its symbolism, and the overall tone of the movie really are quite remarkable. It is a painstakingly attentive alertness to every detail as a way of creating art which has characterized nearly all the truly great films (as well the truly great novels, paintings, and just about any other medium conceivable), and it shines through in Donnie Darko. The sheer degree of thought that went into pretty much every scene is quite incredible, and while this will not ensure that everyone likes the movie, it is something which just about everyone can appreciate. The cast, as well, was pretty much flawless. Jake Gyllenhaal was utterly perfect in the role of Donnie; Drew Barrymore was brilliant as Donnie's individualistic English teacher; Patrick Swayze was every bit as brilliant in his role as the other two, and was easily one of the very best elements of the movie; and everyone else, quite frankly, was just as magnificent. The brilliance of the cast is yet another reason to see this film as soon as you can. Finally, I have to say that the overall theme and message of Donnie Darko is superlative. It comes off at first as being interchangeably perplexing, dark or sadistic, but it ultimately amounts to a reaffirmation of the strength of love--love both for that one person who touches our life, as well as love for one's family--and the subtle strand of hope and optimism that permeates even our darkest hour. Donnie Darko is about finding one's place in the world, realizing it is possible to escape alienation and loneliness and find all the brightness that is there if only you are willing to reach for it. It's about taking control of your own fate, searching for some meaning in your life, and doing what is right. It is also about time travel, tangent universes, and a six foot tall bunny named Frank. Honestly, what more could one ask for in a movie?? That said, I think I have made it fairly clear what I think of Donnie Darko.I absolutely loved it; it stands out to me as the perfect example of what can happen when the craft of film-making is done right. It is at once challenging, fascinating, complex, humorous, confusing, engaging, glorious, tragic, and triumphant. It is at the very least a movie quite unlike any other, and whilst I cannot promise that everyone will like it, be able to relate to it, and ultimately find it as supremely poignant as I did, I can recommend it in good conscious to the highest degree. Suspend your disbelief, turn out the lights, and take a metaphysical journey to the potential end of the world with a misunderstood kid named Donnie and a bunny named Frank. You won't soon forget it.

I have heard some people say that The Empire Strikes Back is the weakest of the trilogy, and that it suffers for being in the middle. I would dispute this utterly. For one thing, the plot has a slightly different format to the other two instead of the old destroy-a-death-star scenario, we have the chance to learn more about the galaxy in general and to explore the characters in more depth. This is the film in which a lot of key character relationships are forged in earnest.

If you go back and watch Richard Pryor's live in Concert or Here and Now you see that Eddie used some of Pryor's stuff, but gave it its own shot of himself (In delirious, Murphy does the bARBQ scene\/story and he describes his aunt falling down the steps. It is the exact same description Pryor does in Live in Concert when he describes black women at funerals.) RAW used all the things that made Eddie Murphy famous; his deadon imitations, and his gift for telling stories. I can't even watch Martin Lawrence, DL Hughely, Cedric the Entertainer and a few others without noticing Eddie Murphy's influences right away. People forget how big he was, and how good- wayyy before he started doing bad talking animal movies. There are some debates over which was better Raw or Delirious....they are both hilarious, but you can tell the mindset was much different only 4 years later. In RAW, Murphy compares himself to Johnny Carson, while in Delirious he was just the most popular guy on Saturday Night Live. RAW is one of the best and funniest concert comedies ever, and I dare someone not to laugh out loud when watching it......NOTE This movie was reviewed in 1987 when it came out by Siskel and Ebert AT The Movies, which was when they were getting really popular in syndication, and it spurred one of the best on-air disagreements between the two EVER. Siskel likened RAW, and Eddie Murphy overall, as being as funny (or funnier)and outrageous as Pryor, Carlin or Lenny Bruce. He loved the movie. Ebert despised it, and chastised Siskel for being immature and he also felt that Murphy's attitudes toward women were patronizing, damaging and even went so far as to call RAW a pale imitation of a good comedienne. I thought Ebert was nuts at the time, and now that Siskel is dead, I can't find any review of RAW on Ebert's website. I've emailed him numerous times about it, trying to figure out why a movie that was so popular, and not even that long ago, would not be in his database. Does anyone else thinks that sounds fishy?

Oliver Stone, who wrote the script for this and went on to controversy in bringing the true story of Jim Garrison's trial of Clayshaw, Morrison's life with the Doors, and the late president Nixon, knew at 31 that taking what was in the source and bringing it to a life that any audience could understand emotionally was what was important. And he, along with director Alan Parker, deliver this with conviction, if not greatness. The story of William Hayes is ugly, as depicted in the film, and despite the fact that the real Hayes has said the depiction of some of the characters in the film is not as it was, it does not deter it for myself in the pure emotional intake.The story at first does not sound like it will have a happy outcome- Hayes (Davis, a shattering, torn performance) tries to smuggle Hash for friends back on long island, gets caught, and is thrown in jail 'as an example' among others in a Turkish prison. He's abused, and witnesses multiples abuses of prisoners young and old, and once he realizes he won't get out nearly as soon as he thought, he and a couple of other prisoners (Randy Quaid and John Hurt, both superb in supporting roles), plan to escape, or rather 'take the midnight express'.

In the end it is about the same theme ... a bunch of men fighting for their lives in the middle of the sea. Knowing this I was convinced that The Perfect Storm would be an excellent movie. But I was wrong ... If the director had cut out the first hour and focused on the struggle with the elements, this would have been a great movie, even an instant classic.

The cast is OK and they probably did everything they could to make the best out of it, but it just isn't good enough to save the movie. Especially the first hour, before the boat gets in the middle of the storm, is unbelievably boring, far too emotional and oh so predictable. It seemed like everybody already knew what was going to happen, like they already knew the boat isn't going to return.What I did like about the movie was the special effects.

The school scenes were so unrealistic -- c'mon, on her very first day at school a black girl completely befriends her out of nowhere and treats her like she's her best friend, even sticking up for her to every other girl in school. Couldn't they at least have set it up better, where Sarah does something to gain her trust, or her friend has a white parent, or anything interesting? Something besides no reason or charity work.The scenes where they practiced dancing in the empty school room, they were so stupid it was embarrassing to watch. And practicing how to sit? She's white, not a guy. The club dancing scenes, also ridiculous and hard to watch. Show me someone in the room making a comment or something. Wasn't the point of this movie to make a statement about racial tension and acceptance? She hardly had any real problems that weren't easily avoided.

On the other hand, after reading this you may want to see it again.I recommend this movie and give it an 8.25 - most people will find it very watchable, some won't care for it.This movie was a puzzle to me for years. I really liked it but didn't get it - the ending never seemed to work. Somewhere along the road the light went on.On the entertaining level, the character studies are good. There really were people like Hart at school, as well as the rest of the student characters in the movie. Houseman was especially entertaining as the Professor. His character still holds up, which is what makes his acting performance so good. Lindsey Wagner has a role similar in style to that as well. Both Houseman's and Wagner's roles are more caricatures than character. Bottoms and the rest of the actors are filling roles that are more realistic, which is one reason why they may or may not stand up to time, be misunderstood and loose some freshness 30 years later. Hippy society is gone - you just cannot capture the emotions, feelings, and personal experiences of a time and have someone who was not there get the full experience of it. I related to Bottoms role when I first saw the movie but now it is a little dated, times have changed. One of the small, underlying themes of the movie is the culture clash of young vs. establishment. All the characters are rich, entertaining, well acted, directed, and filmed. The lighting and sets give a romanticism to the feel of the movie - ivy walls, beach scenes, comfortable houses. Overall, this is a solid piece on movie making.One interesting scene was the hotel for the big study. I remember how radical that scene was at the time - threatening the manager with doper stuff. That looses allot over time and seems out of place today, even a little awkward. It is surprising how well that scene worked when the movie was new - it was the perfect comic relief then. It, also, was a microcosm of one of the movies themes young vs. establishment.Here comes the part you may not want to read if you haven't seen the movie.But the underlying meaning behind the movie is about a guy taking the next step toward adulthood. It is so well hidden behind all the other stuff going on in the movie the enormity of it gets missed - you might not realize it is the main theme. The movie isn't just entertaining - it is almost a documentary of the 19 to 20 year in a person's life. Bottoms character is no longer a high school teen, but is now at the beginning of the road to maturity. Each character that interplays with him represents the different paths he could take. Lindsey Wagner's character represents the soothing inner self, urging him on, helping him take those steps that most young people are reluctant to take, nurturing him. It is the childhood safety he is leaving. Houseman is his doubts, his challenges, the hard stuff we need to learn, a taste of the side of life where we take responsibility for ourselves - adulthood. The toughest thing about growth is it means change, something many people fear. Near the end, Lindsey asks the all-important question &#150; can you stand on your own? - watch for that scene at the beach house, turns out it is the key to understanding the movie. He does the work, he prepares, he steps up to the challenge and in that he finds the toughest part is done. The last thing to do is take the test, which turns out to be easy. It is almost anti climatic, that scene is one of the shortest in the entire movie. On the surface, the entertaining part, that is what most of us thought the movie was all about - will he pass this course or not? But it turns out the movie was all about his growth. In the end he knows who he is and where he's going, that's the symbolism behind not looking at the grades - he already knows. The grade Houseman puts on his test is the confirmation that he knew he passed &#150; you don't score that well on a test and not know it before you actually see it. I think the last scene, where the grades are all but ignored, was for the benefit of ending the 'entertaining' side of film and as a final gesture of the real theme. The real end of the movie is the scene in the elevator. At this point he realizes what all the stuff that came before was about - it was the path to growing up. He knows inside that he passed. Houseman turned out to be a guide - tough but true - and has brought him through. He recognizes that and thanks him. He understands what role Houseman played in his life and now is ready to go on. For such a short scene it is really climatic - yet most of us didn't get it either. We thought it was about the callowness of Houseman's role.

The container lands on earth in 1957 near a college in Connecticut. It escapes into the night and inhabits one of the students. In 1986, two college nerds, J.C. (Steve Marshall) and his buddy Chris (Jason Lively) are awestruck over a woman, Cynthia (Jill Whitlow) on campus. They meet her at a party for one of the sorority parties, only to be stopped by their cowardliness. They decide the best way to get her to notice them is to pledge her fraternity, and are asked to perform a special task. The two sneak into the school's morgue to steal a body, but find the body frozen in a solid steel coffin and decide to unfreeze him. He comes back to life, and they run. Police Detective Cameron (Tom Atkins) is assigned the case of the missing corpse and realizes it's gone. The corpse finds it's way to a sorority house, where it releases thousands of miniature snails from inside its body. The next day, as the corpse is found, Cameron thinks the body is part of a pledge prank and brings in J.C. and Chris for questioning. Infected bodies with the slugs begin killing people, including the woman at Cynthia's sorority. J.C., Chris and Cynthia have to find out the truth about the slugs before more people are killed and how to stop them.The Good News The sarcastic-ness of many people in this film was a very nice touch. It was good to see situations where people were moronic and someone insults them to put them in their place. I feel that is a quality that is missing a lot, not only in today's world but also in movies and TV shows. The best example was Tom Atkins' character. He was such a sarcastic person that many of his lines to other police officers or to students made me crack up a lot. His first appearance in the cryonics lab to the other officers is an absolute classic that includes several different rants. The gore in this movie should also be commended. There are the usual bodily mutilations, but we also see different stages of after-effects to the gore. We see what happens when the creatures have finished with their kill and the mess that it has made. In addition, we also get to see some very well done human heads exploding and several bodies that have been decayed and rotting moving around. The suspense is also much higher than I thought there would be for a movie like this. Once all the creatures come out of the woodwork, there are jumps piled up on top of jumps in tons of great scenes. Three come right in a row after they are trapped inside the tool-shed. That whole scene was really creepy and it has become one of my favorite scenes in the film. The ending is also a very entertaining part of the film. With an ending that includes zombies, gore, surprises, and tons of suspense and shocks, it has become my favorite part. This film may surprise you because you it is better than what the reviews about this film say about it. It is very entertaining and it has a couple of interesting turns you wouldn't expect the movie to go.The Bad News The opening of the film, which was filmed in black & white, was a total irritation. It never really made the film scarier, except for one scene with the high suspense. It was nice and fresh approach to film the scene like that, but I felt it never served the film much importance. The slugs were a little too obviously fake, as they really did look like they were small puppets being pulled around on strings, but at least the strings were hard to see on film. I never did see them.The Final Verdict A very overlooked and entertaining movie that has become one of my personal favorite movies.

This is only for those who've seen Frailty! You've been warned! I either see Frailty as a genius movie, or a badly botched effort. I know what Hanley, the screenwriter, wanted. If the movie had been made according to his wishes, I would agree with the commentaries on the DVD and agree with the general premise as seen on the surface of the movie. However, as it stands, I do not see it that way at all. And there are subtle and not so subtle clues that Frailty was meant to be something altogether even more subversive than what is seen. Other reviewers have spotted the anomalies, while others have gotten upset at the thought that Adam and Dad Meiks really were getting orders from God. I admit it... as a Christian, the thought does upset me, but not nearly enough to attack the producers and actors in writing or otherwise. And, I must admit, that Dad and Adam were receiving orders from a god... but which one? The God of the Bible? Or the God of the Earth? Either one could perform miracles... such as hiding Daddy Meiks' kidnappings, fuzzing up the video monitor, lousing up anyone's memory- and leading Daddy and Adam Meiks to think they are seeing demonic acts in the minds of innocent people. The first three quarters of the movie works perfectly, with nothing out of place, except Dad's supposed visions. We at first see Dad Meiks as a madman, a ruthless killer, and maniacal child abuser. When I first watched, I had the gut feeling that this was no tale of human insanity, but this was the Real McCoy- a supernatural thriller with vastly disturbing psychological undertones... and I was right. The clues given in the FBI building let any viewer know that some other power besides human capabilities is at work here. The fuzzing up of Adam's face in the video monitor might have been coincidence, but it's reinforced by the fact that a trained observer also could not remember Adam's face.... plus, there are Adam's visions, revealed in a chilling line up of scenes from the times Daddy Meiks laid his bare hands on the captured 'demons'. Taken at face value, we are clearly shown that Adam has taken over Dad Meiks' holy mission, and is pursuing it with a flair Daddy Meiks never displayed. We see, on the surface, that Fenton Meiks was a demon, planted by dark powers to bring an end to Dad's righteous mission. And yes, Hanley did want Fenton to be the demon right from the beginning, well before Frailty was made. Colombine reared its tragic head above the horizon of public awareness while Frailty was in production, thus forcing some changes in the way the plot was presented. Adam was shown to be following God's orders, and he was a righteous human being, doing everything any good American should do fighting evil with all of his cunning and might- and winning! The panning shot, as the camera pulled away from Adam and his lovely wife pounded that fact home, thus arousing the ire of many a Christian across this great land of ours....But Bill Paxton's commentary opens up a whole new boiling kettle of worms, as does Brian Tyler's great score for the movie. I do think Bill Paxton has put together a different movie than the one that appears on the surface... and he gives clues in his commentary, and there's a great big clue in the story itself. I will get to it soon...First, how many people did a double-take when Fenton asked Adam to bury him in the rose garden when Adam destroyed him? How many viewers felt as though the plot of a different movie had been pasted on? Matt O'Leary seemed to me to be as disbelieving in that twist as I was... way out of character for the character he had portrayed so excellently all through the movie. Did the kid forget how to act in just that one scene? Did Paxton forget how to direct? Was Fenton really the demon? Please remember that Fenton was the only character in the entire movie to display feelings of kindness and the actions of a thinking, rational, caring human being. Let's go over them, to the best of my memory.... Daddy Meiks, whatever his previous actions towards his kids might have been, became a cold-blooded killing machine. While protesting love for Fenton, he tortured his elder son without remorse or the slightest hint of mercy. Adam as an adult is cold and calculating, the very picture of smug self-righteousness and hatred woven into a finely honed killing machine. Adam, the child, as acted so superbly by Jeremy Sumpter, had all the human feelings of a radish as he bought Daddy Meiks' story without hesitation. Little Adam was ready to kill right from the start, even willing to slaughter his fellow students, with a made up list. Daddy Meiks showed his sanity by stopping little Adam in his tracks... or did he? Adam had the psychological makeup, right from the start, of a fanatic. Was Daddy's mild rebuke going to stop him? I have my doubts... The old sheriff was shown to be a very disagreeable man, at least from Fenton's point of view. Let's see.... Powers Booth's character, Agent Doyle. He was just as surly as the old sheriff. Maybe he really was a demon, maybe he was just sick of the killings he had to investigate. Whatever the reason, Doyle was not a pleasant man. We only get to see his mother in the photo on Doyle's desk and in the vision of her getting killed by her own son, the very Agent Doyle in charge of investigating the God's Hand murders. The other agent, whose name escapes me, is a butt-kissing toady, showing not an ounce of brains whenever he is on screen. The 'demons' Daddy Meiks captures... whether or not they are truly demons, they are hardly shown in their best light. Who does that leave, in Frailty, who might show humane feelings? Sheriff Adam Meiks' pretty wife, in his office? To tell you the truth, she creeped me out. As pretty as she was, she made me glad I was not in the same state as she was. Happy never to have met her... So.... we are left with Fenton to see humanity of thought and action.... and he is the demon. Nice little message for those who see this movie. I saw that particular twist coming, but wished it wouldn't. It was the easy way out and Frailty, up until that point, was too well done to deserve being trashed by that garbage pail of a twist. Or was it?We are shown that Doyle was a demon, who mercilessly slaughtered his beloved mother. He even asks Adam how he knew. Case closed, right?Wrong. The 'vision' Adam has shows a young Doyle knifing his mother to death.The photo on Doyle's desk, which the camera pans so lovingly, shows a much older Agent Doyle posing in the photograph. Huh? Was that a production mistake? Could be... but it was shown for so long. It would have been easy to show a young Doyle in that photo, but they did not do so. Was that a clue as to the truth? As another reviewer points out, Adam could be delusional. I have this question How could an older Doyle be posing with his mom if he was much younger when he killed her? If Fenton was a true demon, why did he not kill his Dad before his Dad killed him? Daddy was trusting enough to sleep with Fenton in the house, Otis was available, or a sharp knife. Fenton was shown to be physically resilient and, despite the power which protected Dad, Fenton was able to kill the man quite handily... Demons were declared to be completely merciless, but Fenton did not kill Adam in his sleep, nor with the axe, as he could have done. He need not have left the axe in Dad's chest, please remember. Dad killed the old sheriff. Why? Because the angel had said someone would have to die if someone snitched about Dad's holy mission... But who would seek that vengeance? God claims the right of vengeance. Daddy Meiks took it upon himself to wreak vengeance for Fenton revealing the plan. I doubt if God would take kindly to that. It looked far away, but the entrance to the cellar was very close by when Fenton and the old sheriff had their little conversation... which revealed the old man was exasperated beyond endurance with Fenton's 'lies'. Daddy Meiks had to have heard them. He knew God covered his tracks under worse circumstances than this (Kidnapping an old man in broad daylight in a crowded parking lot comes to mind for starters.), but he slaughtered the sheriff anyway. Supposedly, the old man was a friend of his. Is this the actions of a man doing God's work? Like many so-called Christians, Daddy is quite willing to blame Fenton for murdering the sheriff. The DEVIL made me do it! In other words, Daddy Meiks would not take the blame for his own sins. There's a little more to think about. Daddy Meiks was told Fenton was a demon... and Dad touches Fenton's bare skin with his bare hands for what seems like a long time. Daddy proclaims his love for his son; saying he loves Fenton and values him more than his own life. He then proceeds to torture Fenton to within an inch of the child's life, in order to prove to the angel Fenton is NOT a demon. Finally, Fenton admits to being wrong and Dad receives him back into the family with full honors... if Fenton will kill the next demon Daddy captures. Since Hanley himself claims demons are remorseless killers, and very cunning, why would Fenton put himself through this? Seems to me he would have agreed from the get-go and slaughtered Daddy, as he did, when Dad's guard was down. Why put himself through such an ordeal?Maybe Fenton really was the truly moral one? Adam gave Fenton water during the torture... on Daddy's orders. I strongly feel that Adam would have given Fenton nothing if his father said not to. Adam saves Fenton from Daddy's axe, after the old sheriff is murdered. Was this not noble? Think about it... Why kill the fall-guy? Paxton's commentary, at the end of Frailty, was very interesting... We are shown Adam's wife, and she is pregnant. Paxton says, See? There's another demon... and waits what seems to me to be a rather long time to correct himself, saying demon hunter instead. Huh? And that long panning shot.... as the camera pulls away. Why, if Adam and his wife are working for God, does the DEMONIC opening music start in? It does not start after the credits begin rolling, but well before it. And Paxton insisted that the opening themes be used. It is NOT godly music, by any stretch of the imagination. Talk about subversive... Is Adam really a demon? Is he following Satan's orders, thinking that the devil is GOD? Paxton says he sees the movie as Dad's tragedy... he was killed because of Fenton's cunning. With this in mind, the movie plays really differently on a second viewing. However, what if I am right? That Daddy Meiks was sincere cannot be doubted he really did think he was working for God, and he truly loved Fenton, as misguided as his actions were. And Fenton really was the kindly, humane older brother... this would make it a double tragedy... Dad's and Fenton's. What about Adam? His is the heart and mind and soul of the born psychopath. Watch him as an adult... watch him as a child.Yes, Daddy Meiks, there really was a demon in your family. Guess who! And wouldn't the right-wing Christian community have LOVED such a message? My rating? If Fenton was the demon- 5 out of 10... If Adam was... 9 out of 10. Take your pick!

We only get to see his mother in the photo on Doyle's desk and in the vision of her getting killed by her own son, the very Agent Doyle in charge of investigating the God's Hand murders. The other agent, whose name escapes me, is a butt-kissing toady, showing not an ounce of brains whenever he is on screen. The 'demons' Daddy Meiks captures... whether or not they are truly demons, they are hardly shown in their best light. Who does that leave, in Frailty, who might show humane feelings? Sheriff Adam Meiks' pretty wife, in his office? To tell you the truth, she creeped me out. As pretty as she was, she made me glad I was not in the same state as she was. Happy never to have met her... So.... we are left with Fenton to see humanity of thought and action.... and he is the demon. Nice little message for those who see this movie. I saw that particular twist coming, but wished it wouldn't. It was the easy way out and Frailty, up until that point, was too well done to deserve being trashed by that garbage pail of a twist. Or was it?We are shown that Doyle was a demon, who mercilessly slaughtered his beloved mother. He even asks Adam how he knew. Case closed, right?Wrong. The 'vision' Adam has shows a young Doyle knifing his mother to death.The photo on Doyle's desk, which the camera pans so lovingly, shows a much older Agent Doyle posing in the photograph. Huh? Was that a production mistake? Could be... but it was shown for so long. It would have been easy to show a young Doyle in that photo, but they did not do so. Was that a clue as to the truth? As another reviewer points out, Adam could be delusional. I have this question How could an older Doyle be posing with his mom if he was much younger when he killed her? If Fenton was a true demon, why did he not kill his Dad before his Dad killed him? Daddy was trusting enough to sleep with Fenton in the house, Otis was available, or a sharp knife. Fenton was shown to be physically resilient and, despite the power which protected Dad, Fenton was able to kill the man quite handily... Demons were declared to be completely merciless, but Fenton did not kill Adam in his sleep, nor with the axe, as he could have done. He need not have left the axe in Dad's chest, please remember. Dad killed the old sheriff. Why? Because the angel had said someone would have to die if someone snitched about Dad's holy mission... But who would seek that vengeance? God claims the right of vengeance. Daddy Meiks took it upon himself to wreak vengeance for Fenton revealing the plan. I doubt if God would take kindly to that. It looked far away, but the entrance to the cellar was very close by when Fenton and the old sheriff had their little conversation... which revealed the old man was exasperated beyond endurance with Fenton's 'lies'. Daddy Meiks had to have heard them. He knew God covered his tracks under worse circumstances than this (Kidnapping an old man in broad daylight in a crowded parking lot comes to mind for starters.), but he slaughtered the sheriff anyway. Supposedly, the old man was a friend of his. Is this the actions of a man doing God's work? Like many so-called Christians, Daddy is quite willing to blame Fenton for murdering the sheriff. The DEVIL made me do it! In other words, Daddy Meiks would not take the blame for his own sins. There's a little more to think about. Daddy Meiks was told Fenton was a demon... and Dad touches Fenton's bare skin with his bare hands for what seems like a long time. Daddy proclaims his love for his son; saying he loves Fenton and values him more than his own life. He then proceeds to torture Fenton to within an inch of the child's life, in order to prove to the angel Fenton is NOT a demon. Finally, Fenton admits to being wrong and Dad receives him back into the family with full honors... if Fenton will kill the next demon Daddy captures. Since Hanley himself claims demons are remorseless killers, and very cunning, why would Fenton put himself through this? Seems to me he would have agreed from the get-go and slaughtered Daddy, as he did, when Dad's guard was down. Why put himself through such an ordeal?Maybe Fenton really was the truly moral one? Adam gave Fenton water during the torture... on Daddy's orders. I strongly feel that Adam would have given Fenton nothing if his father said not to. Adam saves Fenton from Daddy's axe, after the old sheriff is murdered. Was this not noble? Think about it... Why kill the fall-guy? Paxton's commentary, at the end of Frailty, was very interesting... We are shown Adam's wife, and she is pregnant. Paxton says, See? There's another demon... and waits what seems to me to be a rather long time to correct himself, saying demon hunter instead. Huh? And that long panning shot.... as the camera pulls away. Why, if Adam and his wife are working for God, does the DEMONIC opening music start in? It does not start after the credits begin rolling, but well before it. And Paxton insisted that the opening themes be used. It is NOT godly music, by any stretch of the imagination. Talk about subversive... Is Adam really a demon? Is he following Satan's orders, thinking that the devil is GOD? Paxton says he sees the movie as Dad's tragedy... he was killed because of Fenton's cunning. With this in mind, the movie plays really differently on a second viewing. However, what if I am right? That Daddy Meiks was sincere cannot be doubted he really did think he was working for God, and he truly loved Fenton, as misguided as his actions were. And Fenton really was the kindly, humane older brother... this would make it a double tragedy... Dad's and Fenton's. What about Adam? His is the heart and mind and soul of the born psychopath. Watch him as an adult... watch him as a child.Yes, Daddy Meiks, there really was a demon in your family. Guess who! And wouldn't the right-wing Christian community have LOVED such a message? My rating? If Fenton was the demon- 5 out of 10... If Adam was... 9 out of 10. Take your pick!

You've been warned! I either see Frailty as a genius movie, or a badly botched effort. I know what Hanley, the screenwriter, wanted. If the movie had been made according to his wishes, I would agree with the commentaries on the DVD and agree with the general premise as seen on the surface of the movie. However, as it stands, I do not see it that way at all. And there are subtle and not so subtle clues that Frailty was meant to be something altogether even more subversive than what is seen. Other reviewers have spotted the anomalies, while others have gotten upset at the thought that Adam and Dad Meiks really were getting orders from God. I admit it... as a Christian, the thought does upset me, but not nearly enough to attack the producers and actors in writing or otherwise. And, I must admit, that Dad and Adam were receiving orders from a god... but which one? The God of the Bible? Or the God of the Earth? Either one could perform miracles... such as hiding Daddy Meiks' kidnappings, fuzzing up the video monitor, lousing up anyone's memory- and leading Daddy and Adam Meiks to think they are seeing demonic acts in the minds of innocent people. The first three quarters of the movie works perfectly, with nothing out of place, except Dad's supposed visions. We at first see Dad Meiks as a madman, a ruthless killer, and maniacal child abuser. When I first watched, I had the gut feeling that this was no tale of human insanity, but this was the Real McCoy- a supernatural thriller with vastly disturbing psychological undertones... and I was right. The clues given in the FBI building let any viewer know that some other power besides human capabilities is at work here. The fuzzing up of Adam's face in the video monitor might have been coincidence, but it's reinforced by the fact that a trained observer also could not remember Adam's face.... plus, there are Adam's visions, revealed in a chilling line up of scenes from the times Daddy Meiks laid his bare hands on the captured 'demons'. Taken at face value, we are clearly shown that Adam has taken over Dad Meiks' holy mission, and is pursuing it with a flair Daddy Meiks never displayed. We see, on the surface, that Fenton Meiks was a demon, planted by dark powers to bring an end to Dad's righteous mission. And yes, Hanley did want Fenton to be the demon right from the beginning, well before Frailty was made. Colombine reared its tragic head above the horizon of public awareness while Frailty was in production, thus forcing some changes in the way the plot was presented. Adam was shown to be following God's orders, and he was a righteous human being, doing everything any good American should do fighting evil with all of his cunning and might- and winning! The panning shot, as the camera pulled away from Adam and his lovely wife pounded that fact home, thus arousing the ire of many a Christian across this great land of ours....But Bill Paxton's commentary opens up a whole new boiling kettle of worms, as does Brian Tyler's great score for the movie. I do think Bill Paxton has put together a different movie than the one that appears on the surface... and he gives clues in his commentary, and there's a great big clue in the story itself. I will get to it soon...First, how many people did a double-take when Fenton asked Adam to bury him in the rose garden when Adam destroyed him? How many viewers felt as though the plot of a different movie had been pasted on? Matt O'Leary seemed to me to be as disbelieving in that twist as I was... way out of character for the character he had portrayed so excellently all through the movie. Did the kid forget how to act in just that one scene? Did Paxton forget how to direct? Was Fenton really the demon? Please remember that Fenton was the only character in the entire movie to display feelings of kindness and the actions of a thinking, rational, caring human being. Let's go over them, to the best of my memory.... Daddy Meiks, whatever his previous actions towards his kids might have been, became a cold-blooded killing machine. While protesting love for Fenton, he tortured his elder son without remorse or the slightest hint of mercy. Adam as an adult is cold and calculating, the very picture of smug self-righteousness and hatred woven into a finely honed killing machine. Adam, the child, as acted so superbly by Jeremy Sumpter, had all the human feelings of a radish as he bought Daddy Meiks' story without hesitation. Little Adam was ready to kill right from the start, even willing to slaughter his fellow students, with a made up list. Daddy Meiks showed his sanity by stopping little Adam in his tracks... or did he? Adam had the psychological makeup, right from the start, of a fanatic. Was Daddy's mild rebuke going to stop him? I have my doubts... The old sheriff was shown to be a very disagreeable man, at least from Fenton's point of view. Let's see.... Powers Booth's character, Agent Doyle. He was just as surly as the old sheriff. Maybe he really was a demon, maybe he was just sick of the killings he had to investigate. Whatever the reason, Doyle was not a pleasant man.
