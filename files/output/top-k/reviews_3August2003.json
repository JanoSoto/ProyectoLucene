However, I'm even more shocked by the fact that I   hadn't heard of it. I went to Box Office Mojo and found out that it   only made 35 million dollars. I don't understand why this film was   poorly received.    The performances from all four lead actors were absolutely great.   Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. had great chemistry with each   other and I love to see another movie with them together in lead roles.   Maura Tierney consistently proves what a versatile actress she is and   I'm convinced that she will become an even better actress. Donald   Sutherland was his usual charming self and although is screen time was   limited, he made up for it with his wonderful performance.    The story of the movie is about a man, Ethan Powell (Hopkins), who is   brought from Africa with charges of murder after living in the   rainforest with gorillas for two years and hasn't spoken a word since   his capture. Gooding Jr. plays a psychiatrist, Theo Caulder, who is   assigned to him, who is determined to reach out to him and figure out   what happened to him. Sutherland plays Gooding Jr.'s superior while   Tierney plays Hopkins daughter.    There were a lot of nicest touches in this movie such as Powell   realizing that the camera, not his presence, bothered the gorillas, and   Powell observing that the gorillas in the zoo were different from those   in the rainforest. The scene where Powell demonstrates to Caulder that   he needs to break down his illusions of freedom and control was really   done well. I was impressed by the fact the reason for why Powell   cracked was not only because gorilla hunters viciously killed Powell's   gorilla family but also because of the items he left in the forest lead   the hunters to the gorillas and, therefore, felt responsible.    Overall, I thought this was a terrific movie and that everyone should   go see it!

Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are great together.  Whether or not a film goer appreciates romantic comedy, this one is appealing across the board.We follow Harry and Sally from their college years into their early thirties.  They are good friends, and of course, as one would guess, the question is whether or not a man and woman can be friends. Harry goes through life getting one conquest after another, while Sally is much more conservative and cautious in her relationships.  And as the two go on, they see others fall in love and the two are often left in the dust looking at each other.  Meg is her usual adorable, perky self, and Crystal plays his character very witty and fast.   The characters and story are heartwarming and believable.  It is a happy story that is actually plausible and not a sappy destiny type film. Rob Reiner began a tradition here, using 'standards' for the film's  music. Tracks such as 'It Had To Be You' and 'Let's Call The Whole Thing Off' were brought out for a new generation. Harry Connick Jr. was thrust into the mainstream because of this film, having sung several of the tracks. Director commentary on the DVD version is great and informative.This film is very enjoyable and well made. In the genre of Romantic Comedy, I would safely say this is the best I have seen.

The story went no where even though they could have done some interesting stuff with it.  As it is the film degenerated, as Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, into a series of gimmicks.  It was supposed to be funny but I laughed maybe once or twice.  Actually it was more like a chuckle.  Most of the time I was in agony and bored out of my mind.The characters were all uninteresting and I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There was no character development. The couple that moved into the house were annoying yuppies, and the bubbly giddiness at the start of the film followed by their stupidity later on made the Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin couple almost insufferable.  Only Winona Ryder's character was tolerable.  Beetlejuice inexplicably seemed like an afterthought, which is probably a good thing since he was more annoying than anything else. Pretty much every character was stupid, especially the married couple who couldn't find a way to scare anyone despite the fact that they were ghosts - their attempts were just pathetic, but I guess they had to be in order to keep the story going.  What?  Scare them right and the movie ends?  Oh, how I wish! If the movie went one hour instead of two I would double my rating. Furthermore, the way characters reacted to the situations they were in was illogical to say the least.**Possible Spoiler**Late in the movie when the married couple speaks to the case worker at her desk, they show her what they plan to do to once and for all scare the new family away.  They mutilate their faces, but why should we believe that will work, and better yet why did the case worker say not bad?  At that point the new family was already not taking the ghosts seriously, despite the fact that they had tried something even more radical already (the dinner scene with the dancing and hands coming out of the table).**End of Spoiler**So this is all supposed to signify Tim Burton's genius?  Umm, yeah, okay. I guess if you do something unique it will automatically be labeled as genius by a lot of people.  Unique?  Yes.  Interesting?  No.  Genius?  Definitely not.The only redeeming quality of the film was Winona Ryder.

Director Robert Zemeckis marked his place in Hollywood with the hugely popular Back to the Future trilogy. Tom Hanks climbed the ladder of success starring in comedy movies like Splash and Turner and Hooch in the 1980's, but hadn't had critical success until 1993 when he starred in Philadelphia with Denzel Washington, which won him his first Oscar for Best Actor. The movie also features outstanding performances from little known actors Gary Sinise (Apollo 13, Ransom, Deception), Mykelti Williamson (Heat, Con Air, Three Kings, Ali) and Robin Wright-Penn, credited as Robin Wright, (Unbeakable).FORREST GUMP starts off with the title character (Hanks) sitting on a bench waiting for a bus when a young woman comes and sits next to him. Here he starts his story by remembering his first pair of shoes, which in the film are leg braces. Forrest tells us how he met his life-long friend Jenny (Wright-Penn), how he served in the Vietnam war and how he spent years running for absolutely no reason.Hanks plays Forrest Gump in a way that makes us feel what the character is feeling so most that we develop a sort of relationship with him. Gary Sinise has an excellent performance as Lt. Dan Taylor who hates Gump because he saved him in Vietnam because he believes that he should of died on the battle field but late becomes his friend, and who says that Sinise can only play bad guys?

This idea is not totally unfounded as the film is pretty enjoyable although falling far from being brilliant.  What makes it stand out for me is the amusing mix of romance and baseball &#150; both parts being done pretty well.  Working best is the sports movie which is affectionate and nostalgic towards America's minor leagues and the men who play all their lives in them.  The romantic side doesn't work quite as well and only is given free reign in the final 15 minutes.  Annie's babbling of Whitman and astro-physics is a little of a turn off for me and I found it harder to care about the romance as a result.The relationship between the two men is stronger though and makes for an more enjoyable dynamic around the baseball diamond.  Although the romantic side is a little weaker, it is hard to imagine the film with one or other of the strands missing and the two give the film an unique spin.The cast is good all round.  Costner (for he was once great) has an easy charm as Crash which belies the fact that several lines of his dialogue are awfully cheesy.  Robbins looks so very different viewed with an eye for his present incarnation, but he is pretty good.  However it is harder to buy his dumb-kid routine when we know him to be a much smarter man &#150; and his supposed `unequal' relationship with Sarandon seems more likely now that he's with her in real life.  Sarandon is OK but I didn't like her character.  She is sexy but I never understood totally what a woman with such intelligence would be sleeping with baseball players for &#150; even if she is a big fan.  Some of her lines are poor too, and she sounds like she's just been given big words to say.Overall this is an enjoyable movie but certainly not a great film as either a romance or a sports movie.  Costner is on good form and the baseball banter is good fun even for those who think it's just a fancy version of rounders.

As a film, it is weak with only a few snippets of real effort; the actors, as good as some of them are, were given so little to work with that their efforts are fruitless.  As an adaptation, it is sloppy and self-serving, unfaithful and derivative of the earlier, much better Interview with the Vampire.The movie has mere moments of potential. It updates the story a little, of course, from the early-mid eighties to present-day, which works in terms of music. Lestat would fit in well with the goth-rock scene. Townsend isn't abominable as Lestat, though he's certainly not got the grip on the character that Tom Cruise had. There's no evidence that he read the novels beyond the way he holds his violin.The Jesse character is badly, horribly done in the movie. She comes off as much less philosophical and obsessed, and more like she's simply attracted to Lestat. On the contrary, she was fascinated by his world, because it echoed something more important to her. Her relationship with her aunt Maharet is done an injustice because the movie can't decide if it is about Lestat or about Jesse.Or about Akasha.Aaliyah had potential as an actress, but this was miscasting if it ever happens.  First, Akasha and Maharet would have been about the same age when turned, so having Aaliyah and Lena Olin (who does a good job with what little, very little, she's given) is just sloppy. Second, Akasha isn't a power-drunk whore, she's a demented vampire goddess. She was a crafty and wicked queen of Egypt.  Aaliyah seems to be lost, acting more as if she's in a music video than in a film, and her most convincing moments in character are when she does not speak or move.Don't get me started on Marius.  Vincent Perez isn't a terrible choice, but he can't quite decide if his character is cruel or fatherly.  In reality he was neither, but again, there is no evidence that he read the novels, and less evidence that the writers did.Like I said, the film had moments. Jesse's first encounter with Lestat is well-done. And this movie got the blood tears right. The music and the frenzy that Lestat causes was also well-done. His love-hate relationship with Marius was there, though it was weak, and it was bastardized (Marius did not make Lestat, for instance).Overall, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, not only for the book-to-movie reasons, but also because there were sloppy filmmaking elements as well. Choppy plot, chiefly. Introduction of important characters too late in the film, and some bad directing to boot. Bad acting? Eh, not really, but it was sometimes hard to tell.I can't say I'd recommend this to anyone, ever.

Goodfellas is the story of real-time mobster Henry Hill and his mafia career, which in the end, doesn't turn out as he suspected it would. As a young teenager, Henry begins working for Paul Cicero who is the head man in charge of the operations. As you watch this film, you will notice that Paulie has one of those serious, funny sides to him. It is almost like a serious paranoia case, similar to Tony Soprano, which I find somewhat humourous.This film is also based on real-time mobster Jimmy Burke, who is portrayed in the film as Jimmy Conway.(But whole plot mainly focuses on Hill) Working alongside Henry and Jimmy, there is also Tommy Devito, who Joe Pesci played brilliantly, and was well deserving of the Oscar that he won for best supporting role. I found Pesci to be hilarious in the movie, especially with the two restaurant scenes. and his character simply stole the show, and is portrayed as a classic hot-headed badguy.(loved him impersonating the oklahoma kid)And then you have Deniro who is his usual self, as one of the greatest actors of our time. Deniro shows great emotion in the dramatic telephone scene outside of the restaurant, which is Oscar worthy. I found Conway to be the most responsible out of the three, due to more experience in the business, and a great natural instinct of responsibility, which is clearly shown and told, as he was doing hits for mob bosses at the age of 16.I found that Liotta was excellent as well, playing a crazy and violent Henry Hill, with those cold and icy eyes that can look right through you. The immediate thing that I picked up on, and found funny about Liotta's part, was his psychotic laugh. My favourite Liotta laugh moments are in the restaurant scene with Tommy, and when Jimmy is choking Morrie with the telephone cord, and Morrie's wig falls off. A great supporting actress in the film, who I found rather charasmatic, was Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry's wife Karen. I found that Lorraine's character took a huge transformation in the film when she first married Henry, due to the mob that is portrayed as destroying marriages.Overall, this was a great all-star cast with excellent appeal to the audience, and to the genre of gangster films. The film was great, but the ending leaves somewhat of an empty feeling, with no exciting conclusion. But after all it was realistic, and it was based on a true story, which leaves me satisfied. Also loved the choice of music for the scenes, and the Eric Clapton theme. 8.5\/10. Best mob movie since the Godfather II.

I found that Lorraine's character took a huge transformation in the film when she first married Henry, due to the mob that is portrayed as destroying marriages.Overall, this was a great all-star cast with excellent appeal to the audience, and to the genre of gangster films. The film was great, but the ending leaves somewhat of an empty feeling, with no exciting conclusion. But after all it was realistic, and it was based on a true story, which leaves me satisfied. Also loved the choice of music for the scenes, and the Eric Clapton theme. 8.5\/10. Best mob movie since the Godfather II.

Goodfellas is the story of real-time mobster Henry Hill and his mafia career, which in the end, doesn't turn out as he suspected it would. As a young teenager, Henry begins working for Paul Cicero who is the head man in charge of the operations. As you watch this film, you will notice that Paulie has one of those serious, funny sides to him. It is almost like a serious paranoia case, similar to Tony Soprano, which I find somewhat humourous.This film is also based on real-time mobster Jimmy Burke, who is portrayed in the film as Jimmy Conway.(But whole plot mainly focuses on Hill) Working alongside Henry and Jimmy, there is also Tommy Devito, who Joe Pesci played brilliantly, and was well deserving of the Oscar that he won for best supporting role. I found Pesci to be hilarious in the movie, especially with the two restaurant scenes. and his character simply stole the show, and is portrayed as a classic hot-headed badguy.(loved him impersonating the oklahoma kid)And then you have Deniro who is his usual self, as one of the greatest actors of our time. Deniro shows great emotion in the dramatic telephone scene outside of the restaurant, which is Oscar worthy. I found Conway to be the most responsible out of the three, due to more experience in the business, and a great natural instinct of responsibility, which is clearly shown and told, as he was doing hits for mob bosses at the age of 16.I found that Liotta was excellent as well, playing a crazy and violent Henry Hill, with those cold and icy eyes that can look right through you. The immediate thing that I picked up on, and found funny about Liotta's part, was his psychotic laugh.

The movie starts with a 50-minute introduction before the plot, well, plot, really begins. In this first 50 minutes we see what kind of workaholic Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves) is. We also see how he makes Sara Deever (Charlize Theron) fail a drivers license-test because of his cheating. He has to pay her back by driving her somewhere and after that he has to drink coffee with her. She discovers he is a not very happy workaholic and that he never does anything fun. She offers him to make his life fun, no work, for one month (November of course) but he has to live with her. Sure he declines but fortunately he is fired and he loses his girlfriend Angelica (played by the lovely Lauren Graham) on the same day. So he becomes Sara's November.Here we are almost halfway the movie and we feel that things are not as they seem. I will not reveal too much about the things that follow but it is all pretty predictable so you can guess it right anyway. There is also a silly little subplot involving a boy without a father (it must be very easy to guess this right) and a subplot involving two transvestite neighbors. You understand that the story is not that great, may be even a little stupid. So what about other things you might enjoy in a movie? The chemistry between Reeves and Theron is alright but I liked them better in 'The Devil's Advocate' and that movie didn't even require them to have much chemistry. There is a funny supporting role by Greg Germann, who is known from Ally McBeal, but he is pretty much the character he portrays there.I didn't like the ending as well but when you really think about it no ending would be satisfying in a movie like this. May be this was the best thing to do although you have to notice the setting for the closing scene. It is one of those quite beautiful places this kind of things never happen. Why not just any corner of any street? After reading all this you must think I really hated the movie but that is not true. I have a strange thing with romantic comedies, or just romantic movies, and for some reason I enjoy watching almost all of them. I can see how bad they sometimes are but I like them anyway.

Later on we sat down and watched it, and it was surprisingly a very sweet, realistic telling of the classic Cinderella fairy tale. The thing about the Grimm version that always bugged me was the fact that the prince couldn't just go out and LOOK for this girl. Why did he need the glass slipper when all he had to do was recognize her? Was the prince unable to remember her face at all? Thankfully Ever After ditches that plot hole and the fantasy elements and tells the tale realistically. There is no fairy godmother, and instead we get Leonardo Da Vinci. Also, the evil stepmother and stepsisters are actually given some depth. Instead of just being traditionally Eeeevil, we learn that the stepmother acts the way she does because she was treated harshly by her father. And it was really neat how one stepsister was basically a spoiled brat while the other just submitted to her relative's actions without objection. By the end of the movie (spoilers!), that character revealed herself to be understanding and very sensitive to Danielle's feelings. Danielle, by the way, is Cinderella in this version, and is played wonderfully by Drew Barrymore. I liked how she wasn't portrayed as some perfect saint, but was actually able to vent her anger and make mistakes. The love story is also handled expertly, making it clear for viewers how the prince and Danielle grow to care for one another. In the fairy tale it's simply, Oh, we're in love! and that's that. Here we actually get some context that makes the story all the better. The one character I did not like was the Eeeevil bald fellow, because the actor who played him always used this cornball, drippingly slow way of delivering his lines that struck me as being overly villainous.

I especially enjoyed the servants who took care of Danielle and fought for her against the stepmother's wishes.

Unfortunately, that brilliance rarely comes out in his movies as he either indulges in his own dark desires to make the movies as twisted as possible or has his good name trampled on by giving a highly profiled producer credit to schlock horror flicks that he had little creative hand in. When Craven directs he can show his stuff as he did with the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street' and it's glorious finale 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare'. Then came the 'Scream' trilogy and Craven roared back. It seemed that Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson were like a match made in self-referential horror movie Heaven. When working together they bring out the best in each other and Scream and Scream 2 rank as some of their biggest achievements yet. So I was jazzed about the final installment. Even when I heard that this one was not going to be written by Williamson I didn't bat an eye. Williamson had since bought into his own hype and was at the time working on his own 'Dawson's Creek' and making his directorial debut with the disastrous 'Teaching Mrs. Tingle' (my pick for the worst movie of 1999). I had high hopes for new writer Ehren Kruger who had knocked me out with his first script - the decidedly anti-Hollywood terrorist horror thriller 'Arlington Road' (one of the best movies of 1999). I thought `this guy is going to give the series a real shot in the arm' and `who knows what twists he has in store for us'. It was his turn to take this series toward the goal line.and he dropped the ball.Maybe the pressure was too high. Maybe my own expectations were too high and I hyped myself up to much, but either way 'Scream 3' is a huge disappointment. However, I can compartmentalize the failings as being at the script and story level, because Craven works like gangbusters with the few great moments he is given. Much of the show stopping moments come from cameos. None better then an appearance by Jay and Silent Bob themselves. The movie has also constructed an ingenious way to bring back series favorite Jamie Kennedy as Randy. It is all to brief and if they had known what was good for them they would have made his appearance as a running gag in the movie. One thing that is retained from the first two is the excellent casting job. While it doesn't find up-and-coming stars the way the first 2 did, it does cast some familiar faces - like the otherwise washed-up Jenny McCarthy and Patrick Dempsey - that are a pleasure to see. The jewel in the crown is Parker Posey. She runs off with it - as she always does. Since 'Scream 3', Posey has become probably my favorite comedic actress working today (next to Paget Brewster) with show-stopping turns in Clockwatchers, Josie and the Pussycats and Best in Show to name a few.The opening scene is the most intense of the movie and Craven stages it with such exuberance. But it doesn't take much reminder of what a massive evolutionary leap backwards this little thing is from the spectacular openings that the first two films are known for. The closing scene also has a cheeky little idea that ends the film perfectly. I wouldn't have changed a thing about the final scene. But beyond those two bookends, 'Scream 3' is a retread of ideas from the first film as opposed to a genuine elevation in the series' story (like the completely different Scream 2 was). Kruger's story doesn't even quite connect at times. The movie is set in Hollywood with the characters on the production of 'Stab 3'. That makes no sense because in the second film they were watching 'Stab' which was based on the events of the first film. Kruger apparently skipped 'Stab 2' and shows them making a movie about events that have yet to happen. It could have made for a great joke about how horror movie sequels take their license and run with it, but Kruger never shows signs that he thinks there is a joke in that. The movie is a plethora of missed opportunities like this. The gore, the laughs, the wit, the suspense have all ratcheted been down enormously. It's unclear if Kruger doesn't understand the Scream series or if this was his vision all along and some higher level of irony is intended that doesn't get through. But even that gives him to much credit. This was undoubtably just a writer-for-hire job that he brushed over and collected his paycheck. The movie is reduced to run-of-the-mill slasher flick exercises. Then when the big moment of truth comes and the masked killer is finally revealed we get a befuddling head-scratcher that - instead of the gasps the first films provoked - will have the audience going `Ok, who's that'.- Warning Ending Spoiler -I'm going to do something different now and give what would have been my `alternate ending' to 'Scream 3'. If I was Kruger, wanting to jumpstart the movie in the 3rd act and make it stand out I would have killed off Sydney and then had her come back to life (much like Neo does in 'The Matrix') realizing that she is the main character in a movie and thus invincible - citing the ultimate horror movie trilogy reference that the main character can't die. This would blow out the film's credibility for a novelty stunt, but it's the end of a trilogy so why not go out with a memorable and wholly absurd shot in the foot. It would take the series full circle from what started as a movie about life imitating art to a movie about art imitating life imitating art. At least it's an idea, which is one more then the movie has already. Oh, yes, and I would have killed off Gail Wheathers.

It is all to brief and if they had known what was good for them they would have made his appearance as a running gag in the movie. One thing that is retained from the first two is the excellent casting job. While it doesn't find up-and-coming stars the way the first 2 did, it does cast some familiar faces - like the otherwise washed-up Jenny McCarthy and Patrick Dempsey - that are a pleasure to see. The jewel in the crown is Parker Posey. She runs off with it - as she always does. Since 'Scream 3', Posey has become probably my favorite comedic actress working today (next to Paget Brewster) with show-stopping turns in Clockwatchers, Josie and the Pussycats and Best in Show to name a few.The opening scene is the most intense of the movie and Craven stages it with such exuberance. But it doesn't take much reminder of what a massive evolutionary leap backwards this little thing is from the spectacular openings that the first two films are known for. The closing scene also has a cheeky little idea that ends the film perfectly. I wouldn't have changed a thing about the final scene. But beyond those two bookends, 'Scream 3' is a retread of ideas from the first film as opposed to a genuine elevation in the series' story (like the completely different Scream 2 was). Kruger's story doesn't even quite connect at times. The movie is set in Hollywood with the characters on the production of 'Stab 3'. That makes no sense because in the second film they were watching 'Stab' which was based on the events of the first film. Kruger apparently skipped 'Stab 2' and shows them making a movie about events that have yet to happen. It could have made for a great joke about how horror movie sequels take their license and run with it, but Kruger never shows signs that he thinks there is a joke in that. The movie is a plethora of missed opportunities like this. The gore, the laughs, the wit, the suspense have all ratcheted been down enormously. It's unclear if Kruger doesn't understand the Scream series or if this was his vision all along and some higher level of irony is intended that doesn't get through. But even that gives him to much credit. This was undoubtably just a writer-for-hire job that he brushed over and collected his paycheck. The movie is reduced to run-of-the-mill slasher flick exercises. Then when the big moment of truth comes and the masked killer is finally revealed we get a befuddling head-scratcher that - instead of the gasps the first films provoked - will have the audience going `Ok, who's that'.- Warning Ending Spoiler -I'm going to do something different now and give what would have been my `alternate ending' to 'Scream 3'. If I was Kruger, wanting to jumpstart the movie in the 3rd act and make it stand out I would have killed off Sydney and then had her come back to life (much like Neo does in 'The Matrix') realizing that she is the main character in a movie and thus invincible - citing the ultimate horror movie trilogy reference that the main character can't die. This would blow out the film's credibility for a novelty stunt, but it's the end of a trilogy so why not go out with a memorable and wholly absurd shot in the foot. It would take the series full circle from what started as a movie about life imitating art to a movie about art imitating life imitating art. At least it's an idea, which is one more then the movie has already. Oh, yes, and I would have killed off Gail Wheathers.

Unfortunately, that brilliance rarely comes out in his movies as he either indulges in his own dark desires to make the movies as twisted as possible or has his good name trampled on by giving a highly profiled producer credit to schlock horror flicks that he had little creative hand in. When Craven directs he can show his stuff as he did with the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street' and it's glorious finale 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare'. Then came the 'Scream' trilogy and Craven roared back. It seemed that Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson were like a match made in self-referential horror movie Heaven. When working together they bring out the best in each other and Scream and Scream 2 rank as some of their biggest achievements yet. So I was jazzed about the final installment. Even when I heard that this one was not going to be written by Williamson I didn't bat an eye. Williamson had since bought into his own hype and was at the time working on his own 'Dawson's Creek' and making his directorial debut with the disastrous 'Teaching Mrs. Tingle' (my pick for the worst movie of 1999). I had high hopes for new writer Ehren Kruger who had knocked me out with his first script - the decidedly anti-Hollywood terrorist horror thriller 'Arlington Road' (one of the best movies of 1999). I thought `this guy is going to give the series a real shot in the arm' and `who knows what twists he has in store for us'. It was his turn to take this series toward the goal line.and he dropped the ball.Maybe the pressure was too high. Maybe my own expectations were too high and I hyped myself up to much, but either way 'Scream 3' is a huge disappointment. However, I can compartmentalize the failings as being at the script and story level, because Craven works like gangbusters with the few great moments he is given. Much of the show stopping moments come from cameos. None better then an appearance by Jay and Silent Bob themselves.

Am I the one to blame? Perhaps but certainly not in the case of this vehicle. Problems enough here... Sandra Bullock looks pretty but she can't act, how else would you explain that she only will be remembered for Speed. Bill Pullman has the same appeal as the role he plays....exactly a carpenter! And then the scenes... First of all do they miss all sense of reality...girl who works in the metro sees a rich advocate who's beaten, he fells on the rails (no signs of any danger to be electrocuted!) and Sandra Bullock pushes him in pure Indiana Jonesstyle on the other side. Well, we saw scenes who were more stupid but at the hospital, some nurse introduces madame Bullock as his financee because otherwise she has no right to visit her prince charming. Don't ask me why but I still decided to watch further, perhaps I was in for torturing myself as the story goes on and on and gets more ridiculous...at the time the poor man is in coma (which is a good thing as Peter Gallagher is one of the most horrifying actors to look at) the family believes it all and poor Sandra becomes part of the family. But not her so called brother in law as he starts investigating if she's the real financee or not and look what happens...Sandra Bullock falls in love with mister Pullman. Okay no further revealing from plots (well if they can be called like that anyway) but the movie gets sillier and boring (and knowing the start was already terrible). This can be perhaps the ultimate movie for desperate women who wanna have their dose of romantic but for chrissakes  get a life....
