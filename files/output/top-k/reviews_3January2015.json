[{"date":"3 January 2015","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Darren Aronofsky, who would go on to direct masterpieces like Black Swan directed this sophomore effort which is ultimately better than his debut film Pi but considerably less attractive than more of his recent efforts.The plot of the film is quite simple, Jared Leto has a girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and a mother played by Ellyn Burstyn. He also has a friend played by the surprisingly good Marlon Wayans. Basically, each of the characters (including the mother) spiral into some sort of drug addiction, whether it be addiction to diet pills or heroine. This addiction causes them to end up in some very disturbing circumstances.Let's start with the good.1.The acting. Every actor gives it their all and the performances can be powerfully moving in the correct circumstances.Like I said, Marlon Wayans is probably the most surprising of the bunch, and this movie only gave me another reason to love Jared Leto. Burstyn is also quite good, although I'm not quite sure her performance was Oscar worthy. Not to discredit her, it's hard to act when most of your lines consist of my red dress. 2.The direction. It's a Aronofosky movie, it's going to look good. Every shot looks so well composed and some of the bleak images in the film have stuck with me for weeks.3.The score. Despite only consisting of pretty much one song, this song literally fits every situation in the film and is just plain epic. This is the kind of song I would listen to YouTube on loop for hours on end.4.The message. Anti-drug films are definitely hard to come by, since most movies that feature drugs are usually about partying. This film shows the darker side to drug use and how it can ruin somebodies life, or multiple peoples lives. It was a much needed message that films usually do not convey or do not convey properly. Ultimately however, I think the anti-drug message was much more well done and less preachy in Trainspotting but that's just me.And now, the bad.1.The plot. Why is this film so over the top? Somethings were just so melodramatic and insane that it was hard to get the full effect of the scene. Take for example the scene where Burstyn ends up in the hospital for taking to many diet pills. They stuff food into her mouth and force feed her. This took me out of the film because this would never happen in an actual situation like this, they would put an IV in her and give her the needed nutrients. Also, why did they use electric shock therapy on her? It didn't make any sense and he was trying to convey a message isn't an excuse. You can convey a message without making a film over the top.2.The ending. Every character ends up in some negative situation that shows the effect of their drug abuse. This is supposed to be emotionally draining and leave the audience trembling in fear of the consequences of doing drugs. However, it was really hard to care about these characters as everything that led them to their positions was extremely over the top. It doesn't help that the characters aren't very memorable either, besides maybe Burstyn.3.The message. I know I said this was a positive, but the message is a bit of a double edge sword. The film gets a bit to preachy with it's anti drug message, especially towards the end, and I think the message gets lost in all the melodrama that happens along the way.4.The dialog. I can't remember a single line from this film. Usually I'm able to quote whole scenes from a movie after I finish it, but I just can't remember anything. The dialog isn't terrible but I don't think I would really call it realistic or pretentious. It's somewhere in that gray area. Requiem is a good film. But it isn't spectacular and it didn't change my life or make me depressed for several weeks like some people may have you believe, and it's certainly not the best film of 2000 (that would go to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.) Overall, if you're just looking for a movie with some powerful performances, a great score and some exquisite direction, you'll find it here. Just don't expect too much from the films plot.
