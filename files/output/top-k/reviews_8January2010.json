Say you're faced with the task of writing this script. What do you think would be the great difficulty that you'd have to overcome? Clearly these writers are trying to hit all the myth elements. But getting all the elements in isn't as difficult as making those elements meaningful for a modern audience. Especially an audience that has been inundated with myth-based films. It's one thing to know the structure of the myth story. It's another thing to make it unique and subtle.To see if the writers are able to meet this challenge, let's begin at the structural end point. Is there a self-revelation in this script? The main character, Willow, learns to be a sorcerer. He learns that he has power and he has to follow his instincts. These are big words. Power. Instincts. Sorcerer.A big question when you're looking at a self-revelation is, what does it mean? What am I going to take from this? How will it have an impact on me? And having a character say, I believe in myself now. I am a sorcerer and am at one with the world of power, sounds good, but may not mean anything.This is one of the key problems of the myth story. Because you're dealing in the big concepts, the concepts often have the form of meaning, but not necessarily any content.Another problem with this self-revelation is that it doesn't seem to be moral. When the hero says he is now a sorcerer and understands the ways of power, what does that have to do with how he acts toward other people? That isn't to say that the hero doesn't have a moral need. We don't know yet. But in and of itself, his self-revelation is not moral.Let's go back to the beginning and see how this story works.Ghost We start off with a kind of ghost. There is an evil queen and a newborn baby who is supposed to cause the end of the queen's reign. That immediately raises a question. How is this baby going to cause the overthrow of the queen? And the second question why do we care? This refers to the stakes of the story, and you better be very clear about the stakes. Why should the audience care about the consequences? What will be the effect if this happens or if it doesn't happen? You have to provide details.Problem\/Need First , Willow's got a baby at his doorstep he doesn't want to deal with. That is a problem. The community is a bit oppressive. Willow seems to owe a debt to the mayor. So he's got to get his crop in.What about his need? What is missing inside of this man? Possibly courage, but that's not established up front. He really wants some position, and it's clear that he hasn't been all that confident in the past. He needs to prove himself. That's a psychological need. It's not all that well-defined, unfortunately. Because, again, what does it mean not to be able to be a sorcerer, or not to believe in whatever it takes to be a sorcerer? Is there a moral need established at the beginning of this story? There is a suggestion of a moral need when he is reluctant to take care of the baby that has been placed on his doorstep. But that doesn't really work as a deep moral flaw. Willow seems to be a pretty good guy. It's the town that has the moral problem because it's oppressive, especially the mayor.By the way, when I first saw the woman put the baby in the basket, I laughed out loud. This being Lucas we're going to steal from every popular story in history. But the Moses trick is too obvious, and it's the first sign that this story is going to suffer from Myth 101-paint-by-numbers disease. Myth works best as a story structure when it is under the surface. This film hits you over the top of the head with it.Desire First and foremost, Willow wants to be the sorcerer's apprentice. But that desire doesn't carry all the way through the story. In fact, it ends pretty quickly. He fails. That's how they establish that he doesn't have faith in himself.So what's his next desire line? He wants to get rid of the baby, but in a proper way. He wants to take this child to the crossroads to protect his village. Now we've got a a problem there. This is not a personal desire. Here is a strange baby. I must take him to the crossroads because the village says I must. Whenever you don't have a personal desire, your story is going to be considerably weaker. I'm sure the writer knew this problem. So after Willow gets rid of the baby the first time, the writer heightens the stakes. First, Willow finds out the baby was kidnapped. And the woman in white comes down. The kind helper from fairy tales. The woman in white gives him a choice. You can leave this baby, but if you do, the queen will take over, your village will be in danger and your children will suffer. So there's an attempt to make it a more personal desire by couching it in terms of his children. But it's still an abstraction because the consequences have been stated but not shown.Another problem with myth-based stories is that the desire line is not based on the hero's choice. By saying that it is your destiny to do this, even though it's presented as a choice, it really isn't one.To finish reading this review and to find others, please visit http\/\/www.truby.com\/im_willow.html ","genre":null},{"date":"8 January 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Author's Predicament Let's begin to look at this film by focusing on the author's predicament.

It's also the quest style of fantasy story. It has more than a few similarities to the Lord of the Rings, not to mention some parallels with the story of Moses from Bible, but it does it in it's own way. All around, aside from some startling badass decay, which we'll explore in the acting section, the only real complaint I have with the story is that the ending is not terribly self explanatory. Whenever I make someone watch this movie for the first time, they always turn to me and ask, What just happened there? and I do consider this a failure on the part of the movie. They could have explained it after the fact. B Acting Val Kilmer is my favorite actor, largely because of this movie, Tombstone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Spartan, and At First Sight, and while he's really, really good in this movie, I don't understand why he and Joanne Whalley got higher billing that Warwick Davis. Warwick is in nearly every shot of this movie, he's the titular character, and he really was the meat the holds the movie together. I guess it was a marketing decision. Anyhow, Warwick is awesome in this movie and really needs to be given more to do than be a side character in every Star Wars, Harry Potter, or odd ball fantasy movie\/miniseries that comes down the pipes. Don't believe me? Watch Ray. He's in it, he's a little man, and it doesn't matter. It doesn't impact the story practically at all. He gives a strong performance and it works.Anyhow, back to Val. Madmartigan is probably the loudest, most animated character that Val has ever played, which is cool when you consider that he usually plays very thoughtful, understated characters (like his Ice Man character in Top Gun). He sort of plays this movie's version of Han Solo, the skeptic, smart mouthed fighter. His character does experience a certain level of badass decay as the movie approaches its climax, as he loses his smart mouth in favor of being the generic, noble warrior character. To a certain extent, this understandable, but I would like to have seen him retain more of his personality. That said, his sword fight with Pat Roach more than makes up for this.Madmartigan may experience badass decay, but not nearly as badly as Sorsha, the character played by Joanne Whalley. She starts out tough as nails with a strong personality. She's got a sword that looks like pain harnessed in steel form, and she's here to kick your ass... until she falls in love with Val Kilmer. After this, she barely gets two lines in for the rest of the movie and also devolves into an idealized sort of warrior woman.However, I think the real star of this movie is Jean Marsh. Queen Bavmorda is evil and powerful. She's knows magic spells to kill you in many painful ways and a enough of a lacking conscience to use it. When the Nostalgia Chick listed her top lady villains, I was quite disappointed to see that Bavmorda didn't make the list when the wicked witch of the west from the Wizard of Oz did (I realize that I'm about to utter blasphemy, but the witch didn't do anything in that movie except laugh in an over the top manner. Oh, and she used flowers to put people to sleep and employed an hour glass of doom, oh the horror!) Her acting is almost over the top, but not quite. She hits her note perfectly.Lastly, they got the cutest, most expressive baby in the world to play Elora Danan. She smiles and laughs at all the right times. B Visuals This movie was really revolutionary at the time for raising the bar on visual effects with the whole process of morphing. The special effects hold up to this day and look better than a lot of digital effects you'll see on a Sci-Fi (or is it Sy Fy?) channel original. Also, may I say that Nockmaar castle is the most evil looking castle ever (sorry Orthanc and Barad-dur). I realize that sixty percent of it is a painting, but seriously I love the look of that castle. A Sound The music in this movie is beyond epic, although I know I heard the same music in an ad for Disney's the Three Musketeers, so I don't know who borrowed it from whom. Whatever, it works in this movie. The sound effects are awesome, they completely compliment what we're seeing on screen. A Overall This is one of my favorite movies from my childhood, not to mention my favorite NES game. I probably drove my parents crazy between the two of them. However, this is one of the few childhood memories that held up over the years. I definitely can't say the same for the Thundercats.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"8 January 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Story This is the archetypal David and Goliath style story of a little man (literally) vs. the big bad. It's also the quest style of fantasy story. It has more than a few similarities to the Lord of the Rings, not to mention some parallels with the story of Moses from Bible, but it does it in it's own way. All around, aside from some startling badass decay, which we'll explore in the acting section, the only real complaint I have with the story is that the ending is not terribly self explanatory. Whenever I make someone watch this movie for the first time, they always turn to me and ask, What just happened there? and I do consider this a failure on the part of the movie. They could have explained it after the fact. B Acting Val Kilmer is my favorite actor, largely because of this movie, Tombstone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Spartan, and At First Sight, and while he's really, really good in this movie, I don't understand why he and Joanne Whalley got higher billing that Warwick Davis. Warwick is in nearly every shot of this movie, he's the titular character, and he really was the meat the holds the movie together. I guess it was a marketing decision. Anyhow, Warwick is awesome in this movie and really needs to be given more to do than be a side character in every Star Wars, Harry Potter, or odd ball fantasy movie\/miniseries that comes down the pipes. Don't believe me? Watch Ray. He's in it, he's a little man, and it doesn't matter. It doesn't impact the story practically at all. He gives a strong performance and it works.Anyhow, back to Val. Madmartigan is probably the loudest, most animated character that Val has ever played, which is cool when you consider that he usually plays very thoughtful, understated characters (like his Ice Man character in Top Gun). He sort of plays this movie's version of Han Solo, the skeptic, smart mouthed fighter. His character does experience a certain level of badass decay as the movie approaches its climax, as he loses his smart mouth in favor of being the generic, noble warrior character. To a certain extent, this understandable, but I would like to have seen him retain more of his personality. That said, his sword fight with Pat Roach more than makes up for this.Madmartigan may experience badass decay, but not nearly as badly as Sorsha, the character played by Joanne Whalley. She starts out tough as nails with a strong personality. She's got a sword that looks like pain harnessed in steel form, and she's here to kick your ass... until she falls in love with Val Kilmer. After this, she barely gets two lines in for the rest of the movie and also devolves into an idealized sort of warrior woman.However, I think the real star of this movie is Jean Marsh. Queen Bavmorda is evil and powerful. She's knows magic spells to kill you in many painful ways and a enough of a lacking conscience to use it. When the Nostalgia Chick listed her top lady villains, I was quite disappointed to see that Bavmorda didn't make the list when the wicked witch of the west from the Wizard of Oz did (I realize that I'm about to utter blasphemy, but the witch didn't do anything in that movie except laugh in an over the top manner. Oh, and she used flowers to put people to sleep and employed an hour glass of doom, oh the horror!) Her acting is almost over the top, but not quite. She hits her note perfectly.Lastly, they got the cutest, most expressive baby in the world to play Elora Danan. She smiles and laughs at all the right times. B Visuals This movie was really revolutionary at the time for raising the bar on visual effects with the whole process of morphing. The special effects hold up to this day and look better than a lot of digital effects you'll see on a Sci-Fi (or is it Sy Fy?) channel original. Also, may I say that Nockmaar castle is the most evil looking castle ever (sorry Orthanc and Barad-dur). I realize that sixty percent of it is a painting, but seriously I love the look of that castle.

Creating Dark worlds, with great characters and stories, he has brought people one of the darkest characters in fiction...Spawn. I haven't read too many of the Spawn comics, but they really are works of art. I was only a kid when the movie adaptation came out, and I didn't know who or what the Character was (I wasn't even supposed to since Spawn is clearly aimed and intended for Adults only). Apparently this film was quite hyped, mainly because of the way the visions of Hell were represented here, and because McFarlane was a big name in the Comic book industry back then. As a kid, I liked this movie. As an adult, I think its absolute crap. Why? You take the original concept of Spawn and reduce the great writing that the comic books gave you, to a watered down script serving the purpose of cashing in on the Armageddon theory? This film seemed to be one of many films that came out towards the late 90s, which dealt with the idea that earth was doomed in the year 2000, through more than one theory. This one deals with Satan, who gives Al Simmons (A government assassin who was killed by his own employer, after discovering a genocidal plot) the chance to go back to earth with new Hell-like powers, if he would join Hell's army. Communicating via The Violator, a wisecracking flatulent Clown who has the ability to shape-shift into a large monster from Hell, the Devil examines spawn and sees how Worthy Spawn is as a soldier. On the side, Simmons's employer has been able to get his hands on a virus that could destroy most of Earth's population were it to detonate. This allows the devil more of an opportunity to take control of earth.The comic books and the HBO TV Series (Which is an excellent, intelligent, well written television series, which surpasses this film in every single way) combined the film noir, horror and drama elements with a story that dealt with biblical, devilish and supernatural themes. Better written stories existed there, and something like that should have been used for the film rather than the studio approved script for the film.I will give the movie some credit, Michael Jai White did a good job of playing Al Simmons\/Spawn, and you really could see a lot of emotion brought to the role.At the same time, John Leguizamo stole the show with his portrayal as the fat Clown, really bringing some life to the character. Some of the action scenes in the film was well directed but others just seemed to careless. The movie definitely has the Gothic feel and tone that the animated series offers but it hampers down as the more action oriented plot comes into play. Also, the movie certainly is good looking, with some great visuals (Especially the way Hell is portrayed, and the way the Violator looks), great art and set decorations; The story is the main issue with this film. It was sloppily written, destroying the potentially mind-blowing concept that the film starts out with, and ends up being a standard B-movie to cash in on a popular character of a popular medium. This certainly is one of the worst comic book films of all time.

I have to say that he seriously expanded it quite a bit with a lot more characters than the eight that are in the play. But it's not quite original, good though it is.Warren Beatty is the serious All American big man on campus who's not quite the achiever that father Pat Hingle is. He'd like just to go to a small agricultural college and be a rancher like his father was before oil was found on the property. Now Hingle is obsessed with money and what it can buy, especially a Yale education for Beatty something undreamed of in his family. His hopes are with Beatty because his daughter Barbara Loden is a wild child of the flapper era.

Her performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her career year which also included her being in West Side Story the Best Picture Of 1961.

Pierre Lhomme gives us some breathtaking shots of period architecture, sets and costumes for a time when a fledgling United States is trying to keep good on its promise to France.As Variety's review alluded to in their comments, Jefferson is an elusive persona. A private man where like many who have a great deal of varied interests, particularly in matters scientific (including social studies), Jefferson kept to himself. How do you tap into the inner thoughts and emotions of a man who is wrapped up in the progress of science and civilization? Where does one start for such an individual in terms of a visual portrayal.Were I to shoot such a picture, I would start with his writings. I'm sure that's what screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala did, but the male perspective on the advancement of mankind is not weighted with emotional turbulence that the female of the species often concerns themselves with. So it is that a woman trying to write for a man is only offset by the visual portrayal courtesy the film's visual trappings. The lady trying to write for the man gives us an emotionally charged, yet strangely reserved, Jefferson. As if he's a conglomerate of two personas; one trying to fit and\/or exist with another.The obvious point of interest regarding the film is the Sally Hemming's factor. Did Jefferson sire children with her? There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that would suggest that Jefferson interacted with Hemmings in more than just a common master-slave relationship, but does this connote a sexual relationship? I'm not sure it does. But then again I don't really know like the rest of the world. My personal opinion is that Jefferson might have favored her as a bridge between African slaves and their Anglo owners as perhaps a woman to be studied. To this end, again my personal opinion, it may be that whatever relationship existed, was probably not sexual, but most certainly personal. Perhaps more father-daughter than man-woman. I say that because Jefferson, to me, doesn't seem the type to experiment haphazardly. I don't think there's anything wrong with men and women of different backgrounds coupling. Quite the contrary, I think it's a good thing. But Jefferson seems to be a man of reserve. Not one prone to bursts of passion. And perhaps this is why the film is as held back as it is. We simply are in the dark when it comes to Jefferson's alleged romantic forays--if any.Nick Nolte was an interesting pick to play the role. I usually envision him in rough and ready roles. I don't often think of his thespian type when playing thoughtful contemplatives. But he is a professional actor, and being highly intelligent and capable, gives us an aged Jefferson who is somewhat haggard, but still wondrous and optimistic in regards to the world and social change. There is an almost boyish fascination coming through Nolte's performance as we see him on screen.Jefferson in Paris as a visual piece, is a real feast for the eyes. We are taken back to late 18th century Paris. The age of wooden ships and iron men plying the Atlantic and Mediterranean is in full swing. Muskets and fiery political rhetoric are reshaping western thinking, as the former British Colonies reach out to the world to feel their way. Their emissary; Thomas Jefferson. The man who wrote not only our famous document the Declaration of Independence, but also the incendiary paper media that fired the colonies into full rebellion in the first place. Words like we are resolved to die free men, rather than to live as slaves had real power back then in not only a provincial eastern seaboard society, that was the united colonies, but also a resounding effect in Europe, as the lower classes heard rumors about an upstart group of king's subjects rising against the most powerful naval force and army on the face of the Earth. France and Spain helped with the effort, and so it was that after Cornwallis surrendered the British flag, that Jefferson was sent to France to continue American-Franco relations.This film tells a slice of that intriguing period, and does so with perhaps some mixed results, but visually satisfying all the same. In truth, we just don't know the hearts of the two parties involved as the focus of this piece. We truly don't, and so Merchant-Ivory films does it's best to embellish what is theorized about Jefferson and Hemmings. Again, my opinion is that things were probably a bit more prosaic between the two.It's an interesting watch, but probably not for everyone. Period film buffs will want to give it whirl, but the casual film viewer probably won't find too much interest. Either way it's worth seeing at least once.

How do you tap into the inner thoughts and emotions of a man who is wrapped up in the progress of science and civilization? Where does one start for such an individual in terms of a visual portrayal.Were I to shoot such a picture, I would start with his writings. I'm sure that's what screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala did, but the male perspective on the advancement of mankind is not weighted with emotional turbulence that the female of the species often concerns themselves with. So it is that a woman trying to write for a man is only offset by the visual portrayal courtesy the film's visual trappings. The lady trying to write for the man gives us an emotionally charged, yet strangely reserved, Jefferson. As if he's a conglomerate of two personas; one trying to fit and\/or exist with another.The obvious point of interest regarding the film is the Sally Hemming's factor. Did Jefferson sire children with her? There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that would suggest that Jefferson interacted with Hemmings in more than just a common master-slave relationship, but does this connote a sexual relationship? I'm not sure it does. But then again I don't really know like the rest of the world. My personal opinion is that Jefferson might have favored her as a bridge between African slaves and their Anglo owners as perhaps a woman to be studied. To this end, again my personal opinion, it may be that whatever relationship existed, was probably not sexual, but most certainly personal. Perhaps more father-daughter than man-woman. I say that because Jefferson, to me, doesn't seem the type to experiment haphazardly. I don't think there's anything wrong with men and women of different backgrounds coupling. Quite the contrary, I think it's a good thing. But Jefferson seems to be a man of reserve. Not one prone to bursts of passion. And perhaps this is why the film is as held back as it is. We simply are in the dark when it comes to Jefferson's alleged romantic forays--if any.Nick Nolte was an interesting pick to play the role. I usually envision him in rough and ready roles. I don't often think of his thespian type when playing thoughtful contemplatives. But he is a professional actor, and being highly intelligent and capable, gives us an aged Jefferson who is somewhat haggard, but still wondrous and optimistic in regards to the world and social change. There is an almost boyish fascination coming through Nolte's performance as we see him on screen.Jefferson in Paris as a visual piece, is a real feast for the eyes. We are taken back to late 18th century Paris. The age of wooden ships and iron men plying the Atlantic and Mediterranean is in full swing. Muskets and fiery political rhetoric are reshaping western thinking, as the former British Colonies reach out to the world to feel their way. Their emissary; Thomas Jefferson. The man who wrote not only our famous document the Declaration of Independence, but also the incendiary paper media that fired the colonies into full rebellion in the first place. Words like we are resolved to die free men, rather than to live as slaves had real power back then in not only a provincial eastern seaboard society, that was the united colonies, but also a resounding effect in Europe, as the lower classes heard rumors about an upstart group of king's subjects rising against the most powerful naval force and army on the face of the Earth. France and Spain helped with the effort, and so it was that after Cornwallis surrendered the British flag, that Jefferson was sent to France to continue American-Franco relations.This film tells a slice of that intriguing period, and does so with perhaps some mixed results, but visually satisfying all the same. In truth, we just don't know the hearts of the two parties involved as the focus of this piece. We truly don't, and so Merchant-Ivory films does it's best to embellish what is theorized about Jefferson and Hemmings. Again, my opinion is that things were probably a bit more prosaic between the two.It's an interesting watch, but probably not for everyone.

I remembered back when I was very little when I saw the trailer for this movie and I was a little wierded out by it. After seeing this movie, at sixteen years old, it became one of my favorites. It's truly incredible and doesn't get enough praise.When the movie started, I was wowed by the animation. It was so detailed and beautiful! Then I was introduced to Quasimoto, the lone deformed bellringer in the tower of Notre Dame. Yes, he isn't the most handsome character ever, but he is intelligent and has a good heart. As the movie goes on, his character increases in depth and it is very impressive. He's mostly a quite, humble kind of guy, he's tortured by loneliness with only three hilarious gargoyles to keep him company, and he longs to be able to go out and see the world. He also has a dangerous side, too and is very powerful physically and mentally. I've never felt so sorry for a character in my life! He's treated horribly in several scenes by his master, Frollo and the townspeople. Another character I enjoyed was Esmerelda. She's the young gypsy woman that stands up for Quasimoto and becomes friends with him. She is very fun to watch. She's spunky, tough, and not afraid to get her hands dirty. As for Frollo, Quasimoto's master, he has to be by far the creepiest Disney villain in history. I don't know the original story, but I really liked the plot of this movie. One thing I have to say about the plot, though, it really isn't for little kids. The movie includes the whole gypsy thing, which kids won't understand, as well as many situations that could frighten them. For example, when Quasimoto is in the town during the Fesival of Fools, he is tied down and people begin to throw fruit at him. This particular scene can be quite intense. There are various other situations of this kind. A couple character almost get hanged, but are rescued last minute, and one characters almost gets burned at the stake. This movie has possibly the most chilling, dark, suggestive scenes in Disney history. The villain, Frollo, sings his terrifying song, Hellfire, which, if you listen closely, talks about his burning lust for Esmerelda. During the course of this song, the background is filled with fire and rows of menacing, red-hooded figures. Definitely not kid-friendly. I was pretty scared, and I'm sixteen. The great thing about this movie is that it takes a lot of risks. Most Disney movies sugar- coat stories to make it kiddie friendly. Not this one, though. It incorporates all the adult themes mentioned earlier, but it works out to be a great film, maybe for those over the age of ten. All in all, great dark story, great plot, great characters, chilling music, and spectacular animation. If you get the chance, rent this movie and watch it. You won't regret it.

In the early 1980's director John Landis was most known for his comedies like Animal House and The Blues Brothers when he decided to make a horror movie, or is it? One of the major criticisms about the movie is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be a comedy or a horror movie. While it deals with werewolves and is quite gory, there are also many scenes of pure comedy. This movie has inspired several young filmmakers since its release. Many horror comedies like 2004's Shaun of the Dead have homage's within them.This is the story of two American college students backpacking through Europe. Jack played by Griffin Dunne and David played by David Naughton. While walking through the English countryside they seek refuge from the rain at a pub called The Slaughtered Lamb The locals go silent upon their arrival, and the two are looked upon as if from another planet. This seems so typical of Americans who travel abroad, we do tend to stick out. Jack and David are a great match and totally believable as best friends in their dialogue and actions, another credit to John Landis who also wrote the script. Upon leaving the pub they are warned to stay on the road and beware the moon. In the full moon lit night sky, they start to hear noises, as if being stalked by a wild animal. They've wandered off the road. Jack is then attacked and mauled to death by a werewolf, while David is merely wounded. The towns people come too their rescue and shoot the wolf, who then turns back into a human. David wakes up in a hospital to see Dr. Hirsch and Nurse Price. They tell him that the police report says they were attacked by an escaped lunatic, while David tries to convince them otherwise. David also keeps having nightmares, one in which he hunts and kills a deer with his bare hands. Believe me this scene is incredibly funny. He also dreams of a group of Nazi like creatures with Uzi's invading his house and killing his family. It gets weirder; while fully awake he is visited by the mauled body of Jack. He asks him if he can have his toast. Jack has appeared to warn him that on the next full moon he will turn into a werewolf. The only way to sever the bloodline is for David to commit suicide. Jack utters the best line in the movie when he says to David Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring It's all about how he delivers the line that makes it so funny. The film is packed with one-liners like these. Each time Jack appears, he is in a further state of decomposition. Jack visits him in the bathroom and once again urges David to kill himself. David replies I will not be threatened by a walking meatloaf. Even though Jack is dead they still argue and carry on as they always have. The most famous and memorable scene is David's transformation into the werewolf. Rick Baker's effects have yet to be topped, even in the age of CGI. Baker won the Academy Award for Best Make-Up effects. The scene still holds up as one of the best ever filmed. After David's transformation we seem him go on a killing spree that he has no recollection of when he wakes up the next morning in the zoo. Since being released from the hospital he has been staying with Nurse Price. They have started quite the relationship; little does she know the dark secret that he holds.After a final conversation with Jack and his victims from the night before in a darkened porno theater, David can't be convinced to end his life and eventually turns back into the wolf. In the final scenes the wolf causes all kinds of mischief and mayhem in London's Piccadilly Circus. Several corpses and wrecked cars later, he is cornered.

Throughout this journey, she is constantly helped (from a moral point of view as well) by her friend Harry Dawes(Humphrey Bogart), movie director and writer.I kind of have mixed feelings about this movie, because I did not particularly enjoy the fact that, at times, it seemed a bit too fairytale-like. I understood Maria's rather bohemian attitude towards life, and I empathize with it, but I felt that it was becoming too much of a laitmotif (for instance, the numerous times Cenicienta-Cinderella is mentioned). I believe there were many flaws in the plot, so from that point of view, I was let down. The thing that bewildered me most is that I genuinely did not understand the end- not that I did not agree with it, but I just simply did not understand it. And this never happened to me before. From the wedding night up to the very end, I was confused. After the internet enlightened me, I was still intrigued by this weird ending...and maybe not so much by it, but by the way in which it was conceived and presented to the audience. Anyhow, it could have been way better.The technique used throughout the movie was not my cup of tea either. I mean, I do not particularly like when a movie has one narrator, let alone 2 or more! And the way the movie begins basically lets you know how it is going to end, which makes the whole movie somewhat predictable, because you know hot it will end.The performance given by the actors is satisfying, especially the one of Humphrey Bogart, who has started to grow on me since I saw this movie. Ava Gardner's beauty is superbly emphasized, from the very first moment we lay eyes on the Latin Maria, up to the point where she is Contessa Torlato-Favrini. By the way, I wonder if that was really Ava Gardner speaking Spanish. Anyway, in my opinion, she is not only exquisite, but also very talented, and this part made her justice from both points of view.8\/10, because it kept me entertained more or less...more thanks to Ava & Humphrey and less due to the other aspects.

Throughout this journey, she is constantly helped (from a moral point of view as well) by her friend Harry Dawes(Humphrey Bogart), movie director and writer.I kind of have mixed feelings about this movie, because I did not particularly enjoy the fact that, at times, it seemed a bit too fairytale-like.

Bryan Singer's X-MEN was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century. It raised the bar so high, the audiences were astounded and it seemed like no other movie, superhero or otherwise, could surpass it. That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular THE DARK KNIGHT and, to a lesser extent, IRON MAN. However, SPIDER-MAN is nothing to sneeze at either. High school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His next door neighbor happens to be the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom Peter has loved since before he even liked girls. Peter is also best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose dad is Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Norman is overly ambitious with his company, Oscorp (which supplies weapons and special equipment to the military), and wants to give Harry everything that he never had in his younger days. One life-changing day, Peter's class goes on a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. During the tour, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically enhanced super-spider that escaped from an exhibit. That night, Norman is testing one of his company's performance enhancers on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and Norman becomes the incredibly strong yet viciously insane Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has undergone a night of dizziness and a stomach ache due to the spider bite. In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain spider-sense to warn him of danger. Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry. She also thinks she loves Spider-Man after he saves her life twice. Goblin is suspicious of Spider-Man's true identity. He also feels threatened by Parker, but has not yet made the connection between the two. They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie. But, at the end of the day, SPIDER-MAN still has its faults. For example, what is Goblin's plan? We understand his revenge against the Quest Aerospace officials and the Oscorp board members, but what else is there? He has a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, but why? Just to write it off as him being insane is not sufficient. Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider-Man swinging through the city. They play and look like a video game, with the camera seeming to be too distant and too close at the same time. The feeling of all the tension, fear, and confusion of his new powers is actually not felt at all; he acts more like a kid in a candy shop. Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time. Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good. The only scene of this kind that works in this film is the ending, which was filmed with the Spyder-Cam. It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in SPIDER-MAN 2, and I would assume it was used in #3 as well, but I haven't seen that one yet.

It was a midnight screening in Westwood in Cinemascope on a giant screen. I had seldom been so effected by a film. It was so overwhelming, I went back the very next midnight for another look. The sheer amount of detail and striking bizarre symbolic compositions continued to overwhelm me. It became my favorite film for a number of years and I must have seen it with various friends about 30 times in theaters. How can I summarize such a work of art? It's a subconscious spectacle, a view of humanity through a fun house mirror in an alternate universe. Though later I became a fan of Fellini's previous and subsequent films, Satyricon remained my favorite and I regard it as THE high-point in Fellini's career. Never has his fertile imagination delved as deeply as here. Unlike so much of Fellini's output, this is not a personal autobiographical film but instead an archetypal film. Fellini even had a Jungian analyst on the set while shooting.For those who haven't experienced it, Satyricon is a loose adaptation of the oldest surviving novel of the same name by Petronius Arbiter, a Roman from the time of Nero, who wrote a sprawling series of satirical and bawdy stories . The novel only survived in fragments and Fellini decided when adapting the tales to not try and patch up the narrative but instead present a series of highly detailed episodes.

Though the three lead characters reappear throughout the film, the other characters, situations and locales around them change unexpectedly. Now, while these picaresque episodes are indeed exotic, weird and funny, it is Fellini's vision that makes this film unique viewing. In particular is his roaming camera that is intricately choreographed and put to great use in large group scenes. Though we take moving camera as standard practice today, it really wasn't used nearly as much in the 1960s and Fellini had a distinctive way of shooting action and character gesture that still stands out as his own. Certain sequences (particularly the red light district near the beginning) feel as though we are on some kind of dark ride, gliding past a series of rooms containing all manner of curiosities.

Though Nino Rota composed a substantial amount of the score (particularly the oddly phrased melody heard at the end and the new emperors parade), a great deal of the music is either world folk music (such as the Balinese Monkey Chant) or avant garde electronic compositions (Ilhan Mimaroglu, Andrew Rudin, and Todd Dockstader among others). This gives the film a dual feeling of being very primal and yet otherworldly.On one level Satryicon comments on the youth of the late 1960s, the unanchored hippies wondering from place to place without a moral compass -- one hedonistic adventure after another in a satiated and decadent world.

This yet another great Disney which hasn't received as much recognition as it should have.I'm not a mythology fan; reading Greek mythology in school makes me gag. Disney's representation of the myths and gods was, while cartoony, highly entertaining. I liked the characters a lot. Hercules and Meg made an adorable couple and their chemistry was definitely there. Phil was funny and a really nice guy. Zeus was portrayed as a kind, fatherly character, though in mythology they make him sound like a bad-tempered jerk. Hades was entertaining, and one of my favorite Disney villains along with Maleficent and Shan-Yu. I loved the effect of him bursting into flames when he was angry. I also laughed at his two brainless minions, Pain and Panic. The animation was slightly cartoony, but at the same time it was incredible and it in a way individualized the movie. The landscapes, Mount Olympus, and the Underworld were truly breath-taking. What particularly wowed me was the Underworld. I looked a lot like what I imagine the Underworld to look like, with it's towering, spiky stalactites and stalagmites, greenish smoke, and terrifying pit of dead souls swirling around endlessly. A chilling yet detailed masterpiece. In addition, I noticed in the scene when Hercules fights the Hydra, it was animated in an almost 3D style. It looked really cool!This movie has a whole lot of action in it, possibly more than any other Disney movie. I loved to watching Hercules battle the Hydra, or the Titans try to take over Mount Olympus, or Hades send out horrible monsters to defeat Hercules. Every moment is a thrill!The music is very interesting. The five or six girls who sing all throughout the movie sing in a weird gospel style, which is an interesting choice of theme for this particular movie. I don't have a problem with it though, I thought it was creative. I also enjoyed Hercules' song about going the distance and finding where he really belongs in the world. I found it quite inspiring.

Now, I could shut my computer off and end the review there, but I will explain why this movie is so hideous as it is. Maybe then will people avoid this horrible abomination.First of all, the movie has a different plot and overall different feeling to it than the cutting edge video game. There are no power up mushrooms, no fireflowers, no bloopers, no cheap cheaps, I could go on forever. And the Goombas and Koopa Troopas in this film are enough to make a kid throw up in his mom's purse. And why is Bowser a bad dialogued aristocratic Donald Trump like figure. He is a HUGE DRAGON THAT BREATHES FIRE AND THROWS HAMMERS! And do you think it's bad enough having Dennis Hopper play him.They didn't even get the princesses right. In this film, it's Daisy from Super Mario Land instead of Princess Toadstool, the princess from the original game. And who got away with making Mario and Luigi's last names Mario. It's like if my name was Derrick Derrick. See how stupid it is. Also, Mario and Luigi are not American. They are ITALIANS! Avoid this movie at all costs. It will make you want to scream bloody murder! ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"}]
