[{"date":"18 June 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Office Space is a comedy made in 1999 and is commonly known as a spoof of the typical 1990s software company office life. The film is written and directed by Mike Judge, who has made films such as Idiocracy and Extract. He's also very well known for creating the Beavis and Butthead series. It was distributed by the 20th Century Fox Company, which helped market and give it credibility. Since the movie has come out, it has gained somewhat of a cult following from many movie geeks and regular office workers because of the mockery the film makes of modern world jobs. The fun frenzy film is a stamp on today's cinema and work life. The main character in the film is Peter Gibbons (Played by Ron Livingston), who is a depressed office worker who hates his job. The leading female role is Joanna (Played by Jennifer Aniston), who works at a family restaurant, and later becomes Peter's girlfriend. Gary Cole plays Bill Lunbergh, Peter's annoying boss. Peter's friend Samir and Michael also play big roles in the movie. There is no confirmed setting mentioned at any part of the film, but it looks to be set in a warm western state (California, Arizona, Texas, etc.).In the Initech office, the insecure Peter Gibbons hates his job and the boss Bill Lunbergh that has just hired two consultants to downsize the company. His best friends are the software engineers Michael Bolton and Samir Nagheenanajar that also hate Initech, and his next door neighbor Lawrence. On top of that, his girlfriend Anne is cheating on him but she convinces Peter to visit the hypnotherapist, Dr. Swanson. Peter tells how miserable his life is and Dr. Swanson hypnotizes him and he goes into a state of ecstasy. Confident Peter then decides to date the waitress Joanna and changes his attitude in the company, being promoted by the consultants. When he discovers that Michael and Samir will be fired, they decide to plant a virus in the account system to embezzle fraction of cents in each financial operation into Peter's account. However Michael commits a mistake in the software and instead of decimals, they steal a large amount. Shocked and terrified by the mistake, the desperate and unlucky trio tries to resolve the problem or they will go to prison.There is no true theme to the film that can obviously be recognized, but the film just seems to be a goofy comedy about a few office workers doing some stuff that many office workers would love to do to their jobs. Office Space has gained a large following because of the actions of the characters in the movie, and the desire that real people have to follow in their footsteps. Even the most boring office worker is envious of the characters in the film because of their fearless acts that you can't help but respect and laugh at, at the same time. As stated in the last paragraph, this movie does apply to life in a way. It's based in the real world and stars real people. But the actions that the characters take are almost out of question for the average office worker. In the movie, Michael releases a virus into the company's system, and ends up completely ruining the way the company handles money. If one were to really think about it, this movie is extremely fictional. If what these characters did happened in real life, they would be in some very very big trouble. I thought the film was an amazing movie. In a few years I'm sure it can be remembered as a classic. It has become a must-see film for anyone working in an office today. Easily one of the most iconic movies of this age, it's the movie that characterizes what every office worker just wishes they could do. Pulling off a huge corruption scheme, making money off of it, never having to work again; sounds like the life. I'd recommend people of all ages to see the movie at some point in their lives, especially since it's based in and office and many people often work in offices eventually. It is a must watch.

Then, he joins the British army and then the Prussian Army, where he saves his captain, Chevalier de Ballibari (Patrick Magee). After saving his life, Barry becomes his associate until he decides to marry Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) for her fortune. After that, things start making its turn for the worst.MY THOUGHTS I've heard a lot of great things about this movie. Years after the box office failure of Barry Lyndon back in 1975, people hailed Barry Lyndon as being one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, and also his most underrated. This movie also won a couple of awards including best cinematography, best costume design, best art direction, and best music score. After hearing praise about it, I decided to get this for Christmas to add it in my DVD collection, and then pop it in the DVD player whenever I get the time (which I did today). I sat back, relaxed, and ended up loving it. I couldn't agree more with people who said that this is one of Kubrick's best.One of the main highlights of Barry Lyndon is the cinematography, the lighting surrounding the scenery, and the sets that are in the scenery. The lighting and the sets that are used to surround the scenery gives a very natural tone to it. It makes the scene look like a painting. Almost every single scene can make you feel teary-eyed because of how well the scene is shot. I got to admit that this movie has some of the most beautiful cinematography that I'd ever seen.The direction by Stanley Kubrick is flawless, and the costumes and wigs are perfect. The movie has a great theme dealing with the society destroying the main character's individuality.THE ACTING This movie has fantastic acting. Ryan O'Neal delivers an excellent performance as Redmond Barry &#x96; or Barry Lyndon. His emotions and expressions are both very believable, and he makes the character of Barry very intriguing. As for everyone else, they were excellent. This movie also has some of the best acting from a child that I'd ever seen.IN CONCLUSION Barry Lyndon is a fantastic movie featuring some of the most beautiful cinematography that I'd ever seen in a movie. I agree with a lot of people that this is the most underrated Stanley Kubrick movie of all-time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 June 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" STORY Taken place in the eighteenth century in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) leaves his home to seek fortune after killing an officer in a duel.
