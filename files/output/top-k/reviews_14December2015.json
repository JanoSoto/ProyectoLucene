This film of course that now is a staple of some peoples Christmas viewing is a favourite for some and it is not hard to see why, a sweet story but with an emotional and pretty thought provoking in hindsight back-story. The movie is legend in senses and to be fair probably doesn't need another review praising it but I will give it a go anyway, although as I said before the start for me is not flawless. I did feel the first maybe full half of it was although great, not at a level I expect from masterpieces but this movie showed me oh it did. The film suddenly jumps up in the second half and becomes a classic through that it's hard to find anything wrong with the finish to this film, high class stuff.The man behind this all is of course Frank Capra who directs but also co-writes this and I feel because he got to the writing of this too he creates a world that then fly's to life in his direction. Of course it's not hard to see the Judeo-Christian influences from Capra, after all he had a Roman Catholic upbringing and all the story people are praying to god and asking for help, there's even going's on that have the evident hand of god in the story but it is not a movie I would say is not for atheists. I actually think that this movie is fairly humanistic in its elements of just living on, don't think about death until it greets you, it also promotes ideas of bettering one's self and helping others in your community, not just asking god constantly, but in any case film should be able to be enjoyed by anyone of any belief.I'll try to move away now from that religious background of the movie because to say this is only for believers or even those who only celebrate Christmas is not right; this is just an excellent story all round. Its fantasy element is what truly makes this a classic and Capra and his co-writers get a story that is as sweet as it can even be dark too. James Stewart is one of the best in classic Hollywood and here he is no different, in fact I even think his performance is much like the film as it gets better as it goes on. Donna Reed as Mary is also good like Stewart and does do a fine job of not letting Stewart steal the scenes he is in, then cast like Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers are finely cast and really the movie creates beautiful characters.I nearly didn't label this a masterpiece, oh so close I was to saying this was although fantastic, not quite as astounding as many claim, but the more I thought back on this the better it became. Its enduring popularity I feel comes mostly from the fact that the story is simple, its very end is extremely simple and yet the movie is easily re-watchable, the kind I think you can find more things with every watch. Capra knew exactly how to get us the audience to feel for those involved and from the moment George Bailey (Stewart) gets home from a certain little chat with his Uncle Billy to his home, the whole emotional drag of the film starts to kick in and come into full throttle all the way until the final scenes.Overall It's a Wonderful Life is one of the finest Christmas movies and is not just a top top Christmas movie, but is a top top movie period. The way in which Capra, the cast, the sets and even just the music is so well done, well it makes this movie special among many out there and it is incredibly easy to see why so many revisit this every Christmas to curse the name of Uncle Billy (or just to feel some joy) ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There is a certain way in which some movies can have a very good but not perfect first half but then they are brought up a level by its masterful ending, It's a Wonderful Life is for me exactly that.

All of these segments are dealing with the influence of the Bosnian War in Macedonia, and the unintended consequences war, especially racially motivated war, can have on people's lives. The first segment called Words takes place at a picturesque Macedonian monastery located atop a mountain.The cinematography is beautiful. There are lush green gardens, mountain ranges, and a vibrant sky with oversized and exaggerated features. Within the monastery itself there are lingering shots on pre- Renaissance paintings and the architecture of the compound. Words is undoubtedly the most visually stimulating of the episodes. The second segment, Faces, is odd when compared to the first and third. It doesn't take place in Macedonia, instead it is set in London and is entirely in English whereas the other segments are in Macedonian or Albanian with subtitles. It is also the weakest episode in the movie. The story is less interesting and maybe even a little boring, as it deals with a woman coping with an inconvenient pregnancy and her love for the man she has been cheating on her husband with, which is much less compelling than the creeping threat of bigotry and war that the rest of the movie focuses on. The cinematography is not very good is this section either; instead of the vibrant Macedonian countryside, Faces just takes place in a dirty city and lacks any of the interesting or stylized visuals that can be found in Words or Pictures. It also has the weakest links to the other segments. The only connection to the first segment are some photos of Kiril and Zamira that were taken after Zamira's death. These are only briefly seen and have no impact on the story. Because the link is so flimsy it would be easy to forget about these photographs or just discount them. If a person did that they might think that the first segment actually happened last and the rest of the film was just a flashback. The filmmakers clearly wanted a more complicated explanation to the films continuity, so by making it so easy to ignore certain details, they've undermined their own ideas. The only interesting detail is that Katrin Cartildge, who plays the protagonist in this episode would play a nearly identical journalist character who is also caught up in the Bosnian conflict when she appeared in No Man's Land seven years later. The third and final segment, Pictures, is the strongest of the three. It is the only segment that successfully contains story elements from the other two episodes, bringing in Aleksandar who was introduced in the Faces as the protagonist and giving the backstory of Zamira before the events of Words. It is the section of the film that creates the most tension and has the most emotional resonance. This segment also features several apparent homages to classic American Westerns. The scene where Aleksandar is riding a bicycle while whistling is reminiscent of the bicycle scene with Paul Newman from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and when Aleksander is going to his cousin's barn to help birth the lambs he is framed in the darkened doorway almost identically to the way John Wayne is framed in The Searchers. When Aleksandar first walks up to his old house the camera is at a low angle focusing on his destroyed house and roughly constructed fence as Aleksandar walks into frame from the left with the sun setting in the background. There are similar shots in Clementine and the Grapes of Wrath, both John Ford movies as well. There is even a moment where Aleksander gives a Zippo lighter to the father of former girlfriend, noting that they are often used in American movies. This reveals that the director has seen enough American films to know the minute detail of what kind of lighters are often used, so it is reasonable to assume that he would intentionally include the other references because he is a fan of the movies they came from. Aside from the individual stories the movie's big selling point is the way it plays with the ideas of time and continuity. In the second segment there is graffiti on a London wall that that says, Time Never Dies, The Circle is not Round. This is also the tagline of the movie, and sums up the nonlinear approach the movie takes. Before the Rain came out in 1994 the same year as what is likely the most famous example of nonlinear storytelling, Pulp Fiction, but Pulp Fiction's approach is much different than this movie. While the scenes and story segments are out of order in Pulp Fiction they could be edited into a linear movie without any real contradictions. Before the Rain wants to emphasize these contradictions and make a story that could never be told in a strictly linear manner. The point of doing this seems to be to make a statement about the vicious cycle of war. How things mindlessly repeat over and over for no reason, accomplishing nothing. Particularly it deals with the way these ideas pertains to the Bosnian War. The film characterizes the war as being meaningless and motivated by prejudice. It's interesting to note that of the three major deaths in the movie, none of the three killed were soldiers, none were actually involved in the conflict, and in the case of Zamira and Aleksandar they are killed by their own family members. At no point in the movie does anyone successfully kill their enemies. They only succeed in killing bystanders or the people they would claim to be fighting to protect. This seems to be the core idea of the movie.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"14 December 2015","score":"","review":" Based on the 1932 novel of the same name by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, this is a suitably thrilling and rousing film. As it drew only indirect inspiration from the (in)famous 1789 mutiny, it takes numerous historical liberties such as Captain Bligh being more villainous and Fletcher Christian being more heroic than in reality but it is a very well made film on its own terms. The script by Talbot Jennings, Jules Furthman and Carey Wilson is very strong and Frank Lloyd's direction is excellent. The production values are phenomenal for the time - which is not surprising since it cost almost $2 million - and the scenes set on Tahiti were actually shot there. It is a beautiful looking film from beginning to end and it deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar.The film's best performance comes from the great Charles Laughton as William Bligh. The captain of HMS Bounty is depicted as a brutal, amoral tyrant and sadist who, as is observed in the film, punishes the men under his command not because they deserve it but because he aims to break them. He starves the crew by not giving them sufficient rations and delights in punishing them with lashes, typically two dozen but sometimes as many as four dozen, for only minor mistakes and perceived acts of insubordination. At one point, he keelhauls a sailor who left his post as he wanted water to bathe his injured knees and the sailor in question dies. While Royal Navy discipline was certainly brutal, I understand that nothing as severe as this ever happened under Bligh's command or on any other late 18th Century British ship in real life. However, it works very well in the context of the film as it leaves no doubt in the audience's mind that Bligh is a dangerous lunatic who must be stopped. When the mutiny comes, he is set adrift on a small boat with his loyal officers, most of whom are about as pleasant as him, and it takes them at least 45 days to reach land. The experience does not humble him much as he becomes less of a Captain Bligh and more of a Captain Ahab as he obsessively hunts for Christian. To the end, he lies about his own conduct and that of his former crew to justify his actions. He is a great film villain and Laughton plays the thoroughly detestable captain to perfection.An uncharacteristically clean-shaven Clark Gable is very good in the role of the first mate Lt. Fletcher Christian, who is depicted as a good and decent man who places morality over the chain of command. He has sailed with Bligh on two previous occasions and, while he respects his exemplary skills as a sailor, he hates him on a personal level for many of the reasons that I have already stated. He is apoplectic when Bligh forces the ship's extremely ill surgeon Bacchus, played wonderfully by Dudley Diggs, to report on deck, which directly leads to his death. Bacchus was a foolish old drunkard whose story about how he lost his leg changed considerably with every telling but he was loved by the crew. Christian openly accuses Bligh of murder but he does not decide to mutiny until shortly afterwards when he witnesses the inhuman treatment of prisoners below deck. He believes that his actions are completely justified and, while he regrets that his name will be forever synonymous with mutiny, he would do the same thing all over again if he had to. He and the mutineers settle down to an idyllic life on Tahiti among the natives before they eventually flee to Pitcairn after sighting a British ship, where they presumably live happily ever after. In the film, not so much in real life. The island is still entirely populated by the descendants of the mutineers and their Tahitian conquests and has a grand total of 56 people living on it.The third major performance (and the second best) comes from Franchot Tone as Midshipman Roger Byam, a fictional character based on Peter Heywood (whose name is used for another character whom he despises!) Byam is an idealistic young man from a privileged, sheltered background on his first sea voyage who becomes close friends with Christian as the film progresses. He is increasingly appalled by Bligh's brutality but he nevertheless does not approve of the mutiny as he is loyal to King and Country. He is imprisoned below deck when Bligh and his party depart but he agrees not to attempt to retake the ship. After the better part of a year on Tahiti, he is able to repair his severely damaged friendship with Christian but he is captured by Bligh soon afterwards and imprisoned in spite of its protestations of his innocence. He takes the opportunity provided by his court martial back in England to denounce Bligh's cruelty in a beautifully written speech that is brilliantly delivered by Tone. He is sentenced to death but he is later pardoned and resumes his naval career. Incidentally, Laughton, Gable and Tone were all nominated for Best Actor, the only time that three actors were ever so nominated for the same film, but none of them won. The Best Supporting Actor category was created for the express purpose of preventing it from ever happening again and was first awarded in 1937. The film also features strong performances from Donald Crisp (in particular), Henry Stephenson, Movita (the film's last surviving cast member at the time of her death in February 2015, her second husband Marlon Brando played Christian in the 1962 version), Ian Wolfe, Spring Byington and Herbert Mundin, who provides all of the comic relief. The only real weak link is Eddie Quillan.Overall, this is an excellent film which delivers a stirring and very entertaining adventure in the way that only Old Hollywood could.

It is a beautiful looking film from beginning to end and it deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar.The film's best performance comes from the great Charles Laughton as William Bligh. The captain of HMS Bounty is depicted as a brutal, amoral tyrant and sadist who, as is observed in the film, punishes the men under his command not because they deserve it but because he aims to break them. He starves the crew by not giving them sufficient rations and delights in punishing them with lashes, typically two dozen but sometimes as many as four dozen, for only minor mistakes and perceived acts of insubordination. At one point, he keelhauls a sailor who left his post as he wanted water to bathe his injured knees and the sailor in question dies. While Royal Navy discipline was certainly brutal, I understand that nothing as severe as this ever happened under Bligh's command or on any other late 18th Century British ship in real life. However, it works very well in the context of the film as it leaves no doubt in the audience's mind that Bligh is a dangerous lunatic who must be stopped. When the mutiny comes, he is set adrift on a small boat with his loyal officers, most of whom are about as pleasant as him, and it takes them at least 45 days to reach land. The experience does not humble him much as he becomes less of a Captain Bligh and more of a Captain Ahab as he obsessively hunts for Christian. To the end, he lies about his own conduct and that of his former crew to justify his actions. He is a great film villain and Laughton plays the thoroughly detestable captain to perfection.An uncharacteristically clean-shaven Clark Gable is very good in the role of the first mate Lt. Fletcher Christian, who is depicted as a good and decent man who places morality over the chain of command. He has sailed with Bligh on two previous occasions and, while he respects his exemplary skills as a sailor, he hates him on a personal level for many of the reasons that I have already stated. He is apoplectic when Bligh forces the ship's extremely ill surgeon Bacchus, played wonderfully by Dudley Diggs, to report on deck, which directly leads to his death. Bacchus was a foolish old drunkard whose story about how he lost his leg changed considerably with every telling but he was loved by the crew. Christian openly accuses Bligh of murder but he does not decide to mutiny until shortly afterwards when he witnesses the inhuman treatment of prisoners below deck. He believes that his actions are completely justified and, while he regrets that his name will be forever synonymous with mutiny, he would do the same thing all over again if he had to. He and the mutineers settle down to an idyllic life on Tahiti among the natives before they eventually flee to Pitcairn after sighting a British ship, where they presumably live happily ever after. In the film, not so much in real life. The island is still entirely populated by the descendants of the mutineers and their Tahitian conquests and has a grand total of 56 people living on it.The third major performance (and the second best) comes from Franchot Tone as Midshipman Roger Byam, a fictional character based on Peter Heywood (whose name is used for another character whom he despises!) Byam is an idealistic young man from a privileged, sheltered background on his first sea voyage who becomes close friends with Christian as the film progresses. He is increasingly appalled by Bligh's brutality but he nevertheless does not approve of the mutiny as he is loyal to King and Country. He is imprisoned below deck when Bligh and his party depart but he agrees not to attempt to retake the ship. After the better part of a year on Tahiti, he is able to repair his severely damaged friendship with Christian but he is captured by Bligh soon afterwards and imprisoned in spite of its protestations of his innocence. He takes the opportunity provided by his court martial back in England to denounce Bligh's cruelty in a beautifully written speech that is brilliantly delivered by Tone. He is sentenced to death but he is later pardoned and resumes his naval career. Incidentally, Laughton, Gable and Tone were all nominated for Best Actor, the only time that three actors were ever so nominated for the same film, but none of them won. The Best Supporting Actor category was created for the express purpose of preventing it from ever happening again and was first awarded in 1937. The film also features strong performances from Donald Crisp (in particular), Henry Stephenson, Movita (the film's last surviving cast member at the time of her death in February 2015, her second husband Marlon Brando played Christian in the 1962 version), Ian Wolfe, Spring Byington and Herbert Mundin, who provides all of the comic relief. The only real weak link is Eddie Quillan.Overall, this is an excellent film which delivers a stirring and very entertaining adventure in the way that only Old Hollywood could.

As it drew only indirect inspiration from the (in)famous 1789 mutiny, it takes numerous historical liberties such as Captain Bligh being more villainous and Fletcher Christian being more heroic than in reality but it is a very well made film on its own terms.

I love this movie to death every time I see it, it takes my breath away and I wish there would be a sequel and explained what happened to characters. It is definitely one of the most underrated action horror flicks. It is one of my favorite best film from the Director Stephen Sommers before he made The Mummy. This film and The Mummy and The Mummy Returns are the only movies from Stephen Sommers that I love, the rest of his movies I don't watch! quality keeps you on the edge of your chair good scene for a film. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is -- your standard creature action film. This is a really fun no brainer of a movie. It doesn't have a great story line, but the action and creature are great! So if you just want to watch a fun gory movie where there are good guys, bad guys, the pretty woman thrown in and a monster. This is perfect! This is the movie for people that just wanna watch a movie. Deep Rising is what you classify as great monster movie, with a story that's all too clear and characters that'll make you wonder what'd happen if they were in Aliens.

Something terrifying is lurking just out of sight a deadly force from the unexplored depths of the ocean that begins to snatch the horrified intruders one by one! Treat Willliams (The Devil's Own) and sexy Famke Janssen (Goldeneye, Rounders) lead a group of survivors who must overcome incredible odds in their breathtaking battle to escape the doomed ship alive! That is the basic plot about a cruise ship who gets hijacked by a sea monster who eats and drinks people and spits out the bones. A team of mercenaries are the only survivors on this ship and they have to fight for their own survival.It's Die Hard meets Alien meets Titanic!!!! I love this film to death it has my favorite actress in it Famke Janssen from GoldenEye (1995) my favorite James Bond 007 movie! Why would anyone thought that this movie suck? I don't get it! I didn't saw this movie about 10.years ago until just 2.days back and honestly this movie took my breath away. I never saw any monster movie eating people like that ever. Deep Rising was Stephen Sommers movie which he directed. And I thought the movie was one of the best action paced horror movie. I was surprised to see Famke Janssen in this movie she stared in James Bond 007 GoldenEye one of my best Bond movies as the main villain opposite of Sean Bean.

I seriously miss this actor and it is a terrible and sad, that this awesome actor is no longer with us anymore. May he rest in peace (1962 - 2003). This movie failed in the Box office but it was still a fun ride. I think this is Treat Williams's favorite film he ever made! I love it to death! For me this movie is a 10 not a 6 or 7 a perfect 10. This movie does not deserve to be bashed or hated I always love it. great film! as far as the action-scify-horror genre this one's up there with the best, and there's only 5 or 6 proper ones out there, so that says a lot!. the more I watch it the more I like it.

Amistad puts slaves as well as whites in their own perspective; how difficult it was for slaves to live during this time, and the degree of racism presented by whites. Even though this movie has agitated images, they were realistic and credible. The pain and suffering slaves went through is tremendous, and this movie depicted every aspect of slavery, from getting captured to the last stand, and even death. These slaves fought, literally, for their lives. Some people think that slavery was light, and over-dramatized, but in reality, slavery is overlooked and understated. Not everyone can really see how much agony slaves went through, and this movie snaps people into the realization that whites had treated African Americans as a minority, as Hitler did with the Jews. People like to sugarcoat the issue of slavery, but this movie clearly depicts how they were treated. Amistad also showed the whites side of the argument. Some whites were abolitionists, but some were all for slavery. The movie contrasts these two political parties to add more drama, as well as accuracy to each plot. It is true, that one person can make a difference, and show the rest of the world that slavery is wrong, and should be destroyed. However there are always two sides to a story, and the protagonist stands strong with will-power to hold up his side of the argument. The stubbornness and ignorance of some of the characters added the realistic factor in the movie, and added fire to the flame on the issue of slavery by doing everything in their will to slip around the issue to prevent civil war, even though it was already on its way. This movie is not only brilliant, but is sculpted in a way that combines the idea of our 30 basic human rights. From equality,discrimination, all the way to the right of having a trial, all these rights are carefully contributed into the movie. This is one of the only historical movies I have seen that actually kept my interest, while still retaining historic facts and events. It made me cringe and have emotions, even though it was just actors on a screen. Slaves are people too, not property.Give me free, give me free.Would highly recommend this movie to everyone.

F*cking flawless. Most sequels are NOTORIOUS for being poorly written and only made just to make large amounts of money. While Empire did make a lot of money, it had one of the best screenplays ever written, and it's all thanks to Lawrence Kasdan, who would thankfully stick around for Empire's sequel, Return of the Jedi and also came back to write Jedi's sequel, The Force Awakens.The writing is much darker and adds a lot more drama in the mix. Plus I'm sure Lawrence must not of had a difficult time writing this since all these characters were already established in the first movie. The story progresses in all the right ways. We see these characters continue to grow and they're not just thrown into this movie because, Hey look! It's those characters from the first film, isn't that cool? They all have a reason to be there and you're also just so glad to see them again.Han Solo and Princess Leia start a romance. Luke is told by the ghost of Obi-Wan to go to some random planet to learn the ways of the force from this Yoda character. Darth Vader, who had little screen time in the first movie (though he did make a good first impression), has this new obsession where he's hunting down Luke for some strange reason. Sadly, seeing how iconic this movie is, we all know why he is hunting for Luke. We all know what he wants from Luke. It's one of the biggest plot twists of all time, but if you're one of the few people on this planet who aren't aware of the big reveal, I'll let you watch the movie for yourself. I won't spoil it for you.Aside from previous characters returning, we also have new characters. We finally get a glimpse of The Emperor who was partially mentioned in the first movie. We meet Lando Calrissian and he's just as smooth and cool as Han Solo. Not to mention, Master Yoda is one of the greatest supporting characters ever brought on screen and he's a freaking muppet. You can tell he's a muppet, but somehow he's puppeteer-ed and voiced so perfectly that you believe he's a real living creature, and it's all thanks to the talents of Frank Oz with the help of Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Yoda's wisdom and his training scenes with Luke on Dagobah are so brilliant and entertaining. If I needed to just say one reason why Empire is better than Star Wars, my answer would be Yoda, he's such a pimp.John Williams returned to compose this movie and like always, he has done a terrific job. I think his score here is better than the first movie, it's so beautiful and adds an extra layer of perfection for this movie. The effects are improved and they're just as spectacular as ever. In fact, they were so groundbreaking that the movie ended up winning a Special Achievement Oscar for its visuals effects, along with winning an Oscar for Best Sound. (and it also should of won Best Picture...)Again (like I said in my Star Wars review), I recommend viewing the original unaltered version of The Empire Strikes Back. Surprisingly, this movie's Special Edition received the least amount of changes of the trilogy, but I still think the changes Lucas made weren't very good. They changed the original Emperor to match the prequels and while that wouldn't be too bad, Lucas changed the freaking dialogue so that it could connect better with the prequels. Ugh... He also heavily CGI-ified Cloud City, which I found useless, and changed Boba Fett's voice from Jason Wingreen to Temuera Morrison (who played Jango Fett in the prequels) and I find that to be so stupid. I don't think Boba is as awesome as every other fan thinks he is (I don't really bother with much of the Expanded Universe), but I think Winsgreen's voice made him sound more ominous, Temuera sounded so bored. It's obvious he didn't want to replace Wingreen's role and probably found it very awkward.I'd really like that original cut on Blu-ray any time soon, Disney. Seeing how you're going to have full ownership of this movie in 2020...If you couldn't tell at this point, I absolutely love The Empire Strikes Back. I do admire the original Star Wars for starting all of this, but Empire helped cement this series for me. This is the heart of Star Wars. THIS is Star Wars. It does have a downer ending that confused audiences and critics on how they thought of the movie back in 1980, but now it's widely considered to be the best in the series and I absolutely agree. I don't just think it's the sequel ever made, I think it's the best MOVIE ever made. It's absolutely perfect, there's nothing in this movie that bugs me (well, aside from Luke and Leia kissing, but that's not really a plot hole or anything it's just kinda something you go back to after watching ROTJ and you just go eww...).It brings me so much joy every time I watch it. It's my favorite movie of all time.

(and it also should of won Best Picture...)Again (like I said in my Star Wars review), I recommend viewing the original unaltered version of The Empire Strikes Back. Surprisingly, this movie's Special Edition received the least amount of changes of the trilogy, but I still think the changes Lucas made weren't very good. They changed the original Emperor to match the prequels and while that wouldn't be too bad, Lucas changed the freaking dialogue so that it could connect better with the prequels. Ugh... He also heavily CGI-ified Cloud City, which I found useless, and changed Boba Fett's voice from Jason Wingreen to Temuera Morrison (who played Jango Fett in the prequels) and I find that to be so stupid. I don't think Boba is as awesome as every other fan thinks he is (I don't really bother with much of the Expanded Universe), but I think Winsgreen's voice made him sound more ominous, Temuera sounded so bored. It's obvious he didn't want to replace Wingreen's role and probably found it very awkward.I'd really like that original cut on Blu-ray any time soon, Disney. Seeing how you're going to have full ownership of this movie in 2020...If you couldn't tell at this point, I absolutely love The Empire Strikes Back. I do admire the original Star Wars for starting all of this, but Empire helped cement this series for me. This is the heart of Star Wars. THIS is Star Wars. It does have a downer ending that confused audiences and critics on how they thought of the movie back in 1980, but now it's widely considered to be the best in the series and I absolutely agree. I don't just think it's the sequel ever made, I think it's the best MOVIE ever made. It's absolutely perfect, there's nothing in this movie that bugs me (well, aside from Luke and Leia kissing, but that's not really a plot hole or anything it's just kinda something you go back to after watching ROTJ and you just go eww...).It brings me so much joy every time I watch it.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"14 December 2015","score":"","review":" The original Star Wars may have a few issues holding it back from being perfect, but The Empire Strikes Back? F*cking flawless. Most sequels are NOTORIOUS for being poorly written and only made just to make large amounts of money. While Empire did make a lot of money, it had one of the best screenplays ever written, and it's all thanks to Lawrence Kasdan, who would thankfully stick around for Empire's sequel, Return of the Jedi and also came back to write Jedi's sequel, The Force Awakens.The writing is much darker and adds a lot more drama in the mix. Plus I'm sure Lawrence must not of had a difficult time writing this since all these characters were already established in the first movie. The story progresses in all the right ways. We see these characters continue to grow and they're not just thrown into this movie because, Hey look! It's those characters from the first film, isn't that cool? They all have a reason to be there and you're also just so glad to see them again.Han Solo and Princess Leia start a romance. Luke is told by the ghost of Obi-Wan to go to some random planet to learn the ways of the force from this Yoda character. Darth Vader, who had little screen time in the first movie (though he did make a good first impression), has this new obsession where he's hunting down Luke for some strange reason. Sadly, seeing how iconic this movie is, we all know why he is hunting for Luke. We all know what he wants from Luke. It's one of the biggest plot twists of all time, but if you're one of the few people on this planet who aren't aware of the big reveal, I'll let you watch the movie for yourself. I won't spoil it for you.Aside from previous characters returning, we also have new characters. We finally get a glimpse of The Emperor who was partially mentioned in the first movie. We meet Lando Calrissian and he's just as smooth and cool as Han Solo. Not to mention, Master Yoda is one of the greatest supporting characters ever brought on screen and he's a freaking muppet. You can tell he's a muppet, but somehow he's puppeteer-ed and voiced so perfectly that you believe he's a real living creature, and it's all thanks to the talents of Frank Oz with the help of Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Yoda's wisdom and his training scenes with Luke on Dagobah are so brilliant and entertaining. If I needed to just say one reason why Empire is better than Star Wars, my answer would be Yoda, he's such a pimp.John Williams returned to compose this movie and like always, he has done a terrific job.

Why did I give this film a perfect score? What specifically makes it so captivating? Why is it regarded as one of the greatest films of the nineties. Well, in one sentence, it seamlessly blends comedy and drama without missing a beat, delivering a film as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, as likable as it is nihilistic, as beautiful as it is gritty.I think if the Rotten Tomatoes review recap were a little more artsy, it would sound something like that.In 1987, a car insurance salesman, played nicely by William H. Macy, is desperate for money. A lot of money. So he arranges for his wife to be kidnapped by some random criminals in return for 80K and a new car. He will then tell his wealthy father-in-law (who owns the chain of car dealerships) about this, say the criminals want a million in ransom, give them the 80K, and take 920K for himself, so he can start his own operation and start making money his way.Now, if he were competent, this would have been a totally different movie. But he's not. No one is in this film. From the time you learn that he's a used car salesman, he feel almost a sort of pity towards him. He bungles around and sees everything crashing down on him, and there is nothing he can do about it. I won't spoil the ending, but it does not end well for him, or for any of the characters.There is nothing more powerful than a comedy-drama done right. Neither contemporary film critics nor general audiences usually like them at first, but history gives them windfall.Just because there is darkness does not mean that the movie has to be miserable. Thinking otherwise is how you get (relative) tripe like The Pianist or The English Patient while some of the greatest films of all time, like Leon The Professional, a film I was reminded of more than a few times during my viewing of this, are shut out.But of course, Leon, while it has a more vivid, more adventurous tone than one would expect for its subject matter, is not a comedy. This is. We throw the phrase 'dramedy' around a lot to describe a series or movie or game that has a lot of comedic and dramatic moments. But that phrase has never seen more apt than it is here. This film is not just a comedy and a drama, it is a full fledged combination of the two. And it is beautiful to behold. The drama makes the comedy better and the comedy makes the drama better. This approach is hard to pull off, but when it works, oh it works. And it never works has well as it does here.A major theme in this film is imperfection. Think back to the title they are in the far north, not the bright lights of NYC and Los Angeles. This motif is everywhere if you look for it, particularly in the characters. No one in this film is that confident or assured or smart. They are tragic characters, but not in the sweeping, cinematic sort of way, or even in the way we like to see reality portrayed. Rather, they are clumsy and awkward and angry; but not in an absolute way; they have some good in them too. Even one of the villains does something surprisingly selfless.At the start, we are told that this is a true story, but at the end, we are told that it is not. Right there is the confusion and sense of hollowness that the Coens make so much use of here. Risky conniving and strategy are cool when they are done well, but are tragic for most others, for most of us.

But he's not. No one is in this film. From the time you learn that he's a used car salesman, he feel almost a sort of pity towards him. He bungles around and sees everything crashing down on him, and there is nothing he can do about it. I won't spoil the ending, but it does not end well for him, or for any of the characters.There is nothing more powerful than a comedy-drama done right. Neither contemporary film critics nor general audiences usually like them at first, but history gives them windfall.Just because there is darkness does not mean that the movie has to be miserable. Thinking otherwise is how you get (relative) tripe like The Pianist or The English Patient while some of the greatest films of all time, like Leon The Professional, a film I was reminded of more than a few times during my viewing of this, are shut out.But of course, Leon, while it has a more vivid, more adventurous tone than one would expect for its subject matter, is not a comedy. This is. We throw the phrase 'dramedy' around a lot to describe a series or movie or game that has a lot of comedic and dramatic moments. But that phrase has never seen more apt than it is here. This film is not just a comedy and a drama, it is a full fledged combination of the two. And it is beautiful to behold. The drama makes the comedy better and the comedy makes the drama better. This approach is hard to pull off, but when it works, oh it works. And it never works has well as it does here.A major theme in this film is imperfection. Think back to the title they are in the far north, not the bright lights of NYC and Los Angeles. This motif is everywhere if you look for it, particularly in the characters. No one in this film is that confident or assured or smart. They are tragic characters, but not in the sweeping, cinematic sort of way, or even in the way we like to see reality portrayed. Rather, they are clumsy and awkward and angry; but not in an absolute way; they have some good in them too. Even one of the villains does something surprisingly selfless.At the start, we are told that this is a true story, but at the end, we are told that it is not. Right there is the confusion and sense of hollowness that the Coens make so much use of here. Risky conniving and strategy are cool when they are done well, but are tragic for most others, for most of us. And after all our quests and ventures, it so often is empty and worthless, which us all dying. It doesn't lull on it like dramatic films can, but rather weaves it into the dark comedy, which makes it all the more poignant.I do not like this film quite as much as No Country for Old Men, but it is a thoughtful, dark, masterfully-written, stunningly-shot, radiantly-scored film that you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see. You will not realize how invested in you are until half the film is already over.
