With a few stunts but not enough of them and action for this film to be great, you might think License to Kill sounds like a bad film to watch, not so because this has a good bit of drama and a performance from an actor portraying Bond who looked more serious in this role than ever before. I felt this was solidly OK, and here below is why.The story is slightly slower to start with than previous instalments but nevertheless shows us what the villain is doing and how vicious of a man he really is. I did think that this plot got slow through the middle and may leave you bored just for a little, but it depends on how much you are into the story. The story isn't bad or anything but what it doesn't bring is fireworks, the story just isn't fun enough to watch and even in the uneven plots in earlier Bonds they still brought an entertaining ride along with them. Timothy Dalton does a job here which I had huge respect for, he shook off what people such as Roger Moore made the role and made it his own, with his darker view of events he still manages to have a slight charm and seems sometimes like he could actually be a real special agent. I felt the villain also had an air of believability around him, the actor Robert Davi seemed to bring another rational character here and as the drug lord he is, he didn't come across as too ambitious as so many previous villains have had. Everyone else does a good job here too and the entire cast seem quite perfect for the characters they portray.Written and directed quite well, I did feel the writing could have been slightly better because it just seemed as previously said that the story doesn't offer enough to us the viewer, and Bond could have gone on a much more smartly made adventure. It lacks the major stunts we see all the way through previous films but does maybe two massive stunts which even for Bond are big on a large scale, they were highlights of this film.The film doesn't have a big mistake or something it does bad it just isn't full of entertainment and as you can see it is a running thing through the movie. The plot its much darker and maybe you could say that it is unnecessary violence but others may respect it, I feel people will be mixed as to whether much is wrong here. Bond fans should like it as it contains all the elements it usually does and all the trademarks of the franchise, although I feel because the dark element comes in some may dislike it's change away from big action\/explosions and big stunts as it is subdued slightly. Anyone could like this who likes action adventure films as this has it all, but as I have said a lot now, the film maybe lacks the fun we expected to see from this and could not be the most entertaining of Bonds to see.Overall I give this a 6\/10, a Solidly OK movie, not near being Good but it is far from just an average movie. With this just take it easy whilst watching, try to savour Daltons last performance as Bond and make for yourself where he ranks amongst the Bonds through the years. One last thing to say about this movie is this was also the last with a lot of people so this is truly the last film of the original creators etc, a sad thing to see to have them go but the future get's brighter trust me.

That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible.That final five minute speech given by Chaplin shows his true genius as a director, actor, and screenwriter. He was capable of understanding better than anyone the social realities he was part of and made one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films I've seen. Giving his character who had been silent up to that film such an important speech was such a powerful and historical moment in film history. I don't know why I always believed Chaplin was one of those directors that never managed to handle the transition from silent films to talkies very well, because ironically this (his first complete talkie) is my favorite film of his. The way he was able to use his physical comedy with as little dialogue as possible and then add some funny lines was a beautiful touch. He said what he could with his physical performance and then used sound to say what actions couldn't tell wholeheartedly. Chaplin had proved that actions speak louder than words with his Tramp films, but when those words are in tune with actions they can blow you away and that is how I felt with The Great Dictator. In 1940 no one knew about the horrendous crimes the Nazi's were going to commit against the Jews, but Chaplin was warning the world from the beginning how hate and racism could destroy the world. That powerful speech continues to resonate with audiences almost 75 years later and you can add that scene to Chaplin's wonderful legacy in film. There are several other memorable scenes in this two hour film (the longest Chaplin film I've seen, yet probably the one I would be most likely to rewatch), mostly all involving Chaplin's wonderful physical comedy as he makes fun of Hitler. While the entire world seemed to be ignoring Hitler and Mussolini's abuse of power, Chaplin courageously was warning us in the best way he could, through slapstick comedy, about their horrendous racial beliefs and the dehumanization it would lead to. The film opens during the First World War where a soldier (Charles Chaplin) who is later introduced as a Jewish barber, is saving the life of a pilot named Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). They escape on a small plane, but eventually they crash and the barber loses his memory. Several years later he is released from the hospital but everything has changed. They lost the war, and Dictator Adenoid Hynke (also played by Charles Chaplin) is now rebuilding the country of Tomania. The Jews in the ghetto are being discriminated and treated poorly by Hynke's soldiers and the barber has no clue as to what is going on. A friendly neighbor named Hannah helps him, but there is not much they can do against the soldiers. When he gets into trouble with some of them, the commanding officer arrives and it happens to be Schultz who immediately helps the barber and offers him and the people in his ghetto protection. For a while things look good for them, but when Dictator Hynke discovers Schultz is helping the Jews he sends for his arrest and the Jews suffer persecution once again. Hynke plans to rule the world so his first step is invading Osterlich, the place where Hannah and her family were forced to flee. Things aren't looking good for the Barber and his friends, but keeping his head up and joining forces with Schultz, they are ready to make a stand.The Great Dictator was truly a delightful and joyous experience. I don't know why I liked it more than his silent films because I really enjoyed all of them, but there was something about The Great Dictator that just hit all the right notes with me. I fell in love with this film and will definitely recommend it as my favorite Chaplin film. I wasn't considering watching his next two talkies, but after the experience I had with The Great Dictator I'm definitely considering watching them. I loved the way Chaplin clearly stated his beliefs in this film, mocking Hitler and his inhumane ideas with a courageous performance considering no one was doing anything to stop him at that time. But it's not just a brave film, it is really funny as well and I found myself laughing throughout many scenes. His physical comedic talents can still be seen in this talkie; one of his most memorable scenes involves a globe dance sequence. Paulette Goddard, who was also in Chaplin's Modern Times, gives yet another sweet performance, and Jack Oakie will forever be remembered for his role as Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, which was a clear lampoon on Mussolini. This was one perfectly executed satire that happened to come along at the right moment. Unlike in other politically correct films, Chaplin makes it evident that ridiculing Hitler was his main objective. It is a classic and a must see for film lovers everywhere.

In 1940 no one knew about the horrendous crimes the Nazi's were going to commit against the Jews, but Chaplin was warning the world from the beginning how hate and racism could destroy the world. That powerful speech continues to resonate with audiences almost 75 years later and you can add that scene to Chaplin's wonderful legacy in film. There are several other memorable scenes in this two hour film (the longest Chaplin film I've seen, yet probably the one I would be most likely to rewatch), mostly all involving Chaplin's wonderful physical comedy as he makes fun of Hitler. While the entire world seemed to be ignoring Hitler and Mussolini's abuse of power, Chaplin courageously was warning us in the best way he could, through slapstick comedy, about their horrendous racial beliefs and the dehumanization it would lead to. The film opens during the First World War where a soldier (Charles Chaplin) who is later introduced as a Jewish barber, is saving the life of a pilot named Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). They escape on a small plane, but eventually they crash and the barber loses his memory. Several years later he is released from the hospital but everything has changed. They lost the war, and Dictator Adenoid Hynke (also played by Charles Chaplin) is now rebuilding the country of Tomania. The Jews in the ghetto are being discriminated and treated poorly by Hynke's soldiers and the barber has no clue as to what is going on. A friendly neighbor named Hannah helps him, but there is not much they can do against the soldiers. When he gets into trouble with some of them, the commanding officer arrives and it happens to be Schultz who immediately helps the barber and offers him and the people in his ghetto protection. For a while things look good for them, but when Dictator Hynke discovers Schultz is helping the Jews he sends for his arrest and the Jews suffer persecution once again. Hynke plans to rule the world so his first step is invading Osterlich, the place where Hannah and her family were forced to flee. Things aren't looking good for the Barber and his friends, but keeping his head up and joining forces with Schultz, they are ready to make a stand.The Great Dictator was truly a delightful and joyous experience. I don't know why I liked it more than his silent films because I really enjoyed all of them, but there was something about The Great Dictator that just hit all the right notes with me. I fell in love with this film and will definitely recommend it as my favorite Chaplin film. I wasn't considering watching his next two talkies, but after the experience I had with The Great Dictator I'm definitely considering watching them. I loved the way Chaplin clearly stated his beliefs in this film, mocking Hitler and his inhumane ideas with a courageous performance considering no one was doing anything to stop him at that time. But it's not just a brave film, it is really funny as well and I found myself laughing throughout many scenes. His physical comedic talents can still be seen in this talkie; one of his most memorable scenes involves a globe dance sequence. Paulette Goddard, who was also in Chaplin's Modern Times, gives yet another sweet performance, and Jack Oakie will forever be remembered for his role as Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, which was a clear lampoon on Mussolini. This was one perfectly executed satire that happened to come along at the right moment. Unlike in other politically correct films, Chaplin makes it evident that ridiculing Hitler was his main objective. It is a classic and a must see for film lovers everywhere.

As it is, the film is no less than a great war film.There is a supreme ensemble cast which includes Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, George Clooney and a host of many other actors. They do a great job in empathizing with the characters and playing their roles perfectly. They become soldiers and behave like soldiers. Not for once, did I see a Sean Penn but I saw a passionate soldier fighting for his country. All the others have done a fine job I must say. Though there some hundreds of actors in the whole film, never did I was there was an extra or someone is out of place. That is what I think is utilizing resources appropriately.The cinematography by John Toll is exemplary and indeed I can say this is one of the finest works I have seen in a war film. I learned that this film even with such great camera work did not win an academy award for cinematography but it was awarded to Saving Private Ryan, which also has fine camera work and great choreography of war scenes. I can understand the fix, the jury would have been in deciding which one was better.I resisted myself from watching this, because I never thought I had the patience of sitting through a 3 hour full length war film, which is highly detailed and nuanced. Yet, after watching it today, I confess I have seen one of the finest war films of contemporary cinema and I salute the director Terrence Malick for showing the war as it is, unabashedly, uncompromisingly and more importantly, bringing the human emotions on to the surface without any drama.The director Terrence Malick has done very few films in his career. He began in 1969 and yet this was just his fourth film as a director. He surely has a vision that is grand and it takes time to detail all of those. But, I hope he does more work and showcases his talent giving such exemplary cinema.A 4\/5 for this one and I ma happy to have finally watch it. To watch it again, I need a lot patience though.

The costumes all look like they were made the night before by the cast's mothers and aside from all looking far too new, they don't fit very well and would be better suited to a high school pantomime.The script is laughable, chock full of crap one liners, crowbarred in to attempt to get the 8 year old's in the audience to laugh and probably failing miserably.

And to this day its one of my favorite top 10 horror films of all time. The whole idea of a dream demon invading the teenagers dreams on Elm Street in Springwood was so interesting and a whole new concept from the over done killer wearing a mask killing people. When we got introduced to Freddy Krueger played by Robert England we saw a character that came onto his own and didn't copy something else that had been done to death. I loved everything about the first film and then when I got done watching it I watched part 2 with the same excitement and wondered if it could pass the first film in suspense and horror. I can say this film didn't come close to the first film in terms of horror. I will admit its not the worst in the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise but it isn't close to the best. I just didn't think the whole story of Freddy trying to get back into the real world was logical. The whole point of Freddy being a dream demon is because hes about killing teenagers of the adults of Springwood who had hunted him down and killed him when he was a human. He was about getting revenge and tormenting the kids because the adults cant protect their kids in their dreams. Freddy trying to get back into the real world just goes against his whole revenge where the adults cant protect their kids approach. I also felt the characters were just coming off as too macho and tough at times. I felt like they didn't come off as teenage kids with normal teenage lives. Another approach was the character of Lisa. Normally a female is always the one who stops Freddy and is exstablished throughout the film. But she really didn't get much screen time in this as Jessie did and she really didn't start fighting Freddy until the final maybe 30 minutes of the film. To me this film was average. Again its not the worst but not the best. I still think the worst film in the Nightmare On Elm Street film was Freddys Dead the Final Nightmare. If you want to pass the time then go for it and watch the film. But don't expect the film to be as good as part 1.

But because it features two of the best actors around giving some of the bravest acting that I have seen this is a movie that is hard to hate.Kate Winslet stars as Ruth, an Australian woman who went to India and fell under the spell of a cult guru. To illustrate the spell of the cult there is a wonderful scene the guru places a jewel on her forehead and it turns into a third eye. Ruth's family wants to pull her away from the cult and hires 'cult exiter' P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel) to bring her to her senses. They fake a family illness to trick her into returning home where Waters takes her to a shack in the middle of nowhere to begin her program of deprogramming.After some quiet moments in which the two engage in a truly fascinating conversation about the meaning of beliefs the movie begins to lose it's way. I thought that this would be a movie about how P.J. uses his experience to break her down and how Ruth puts up the wall of her beliefs as a defense but it doesn't go that way.Waters begins to fall under Ruth's spell mentally and sexually. I could have handled that but it happens so quickly that there never seems to be any kind of power struggle. We are told that this is Keitel's 190th case but I was left to wonder how a man could be successful in 189 cases of deprogramming and fall for this young woman after only two days. The way Ruth brings P.J. under his spell its a wonder the guru didn't fall for her.Much as I hated the end of the movie I cannot dismiss it all together. Winslet and Keitel both give performances that are electrifying. Their sexual chemistry together had me longing for a better story, perhaps these two as an adulterous couple.Keitel has always been a risky actor, taking roles like 'Bad Lieutenant' that many actors would touch with a ten-foot pole. Kate Winslet is taking same track. She hasn't let her success in 'Titanic' be her easy ticket to a $10 million paycheck from Hollywood hot air turkeys like 'Charlie's Angels'. She has continued to seek out challenging roles in films like this and 'Hideous Kinky' and 'Quills'.'Holy Smoke!' is directed by Jane Campion and co-written by Campion and her sister Anna. Campion wrote a similar sexual struggle between Keitel and Holly Hunter in her 1993 masterpiece 'The Piano'. But in that film it was a struggle of personalities where this movie seems to be a matter over mind.

It's a warning about income inequality, and it's an encouragement to live life to the fullest.This is a remarkable film. It's hugely entertaining, heartfelt, considered, beautiful, and thoughtful film. Two graduating high-school students, one the son of privilege (Diego Luna as Tenoch) and the other from a lower-middle class background (Gael Garcia Bernal) take a road-trip to the mythical beach of Boca del Cielo which they invented in order to impress the estranged wife (Maribel Vertu as Luisa) of Tenoch's cousin Jano. Being 18 year olds, they are full of swagger and bravado but can't anticipate what will happen and this makes for the drama of the roadtrip. They see Mexico and we see it beautifully, as filmed by Emmanuel Lubezki. It's often seen from inside a car as the group heads southwest toward the coast and we seen the dry, brown Mexican landscape often in shade. Lubezki uses extended shots, lingering over the dry, sleepy landscape. As they drive, they stop in different places and Lubezki captures the locals in their everyday lives. We see regular people selling trinkets, driving buses, herding animals. The dignity of regular people is honored as we see their lives doing their jobs. We hear about social conditions in the area through some very interesting voiceovers. They are interesting because they serve as a counterpoint to the privilege of Tenoch, Julio, and Luisa. We hear about the life of Tenoch's maid. We hear about the life of itinerant fishermen, and we hear about the lives of people struggling through the desert to get to the United States. Many times voiceovers aren't particularly helpful, but in this movie they really add a lot of depth and heart to the movie. I can't think of a film in which voiceovers were used as well as in this one.The boys are immature but can also be very funny. Writer Alfonso Cuaron and his co-writer, his brother Carlos Cuaron, get the tone of 18 year old boys just right - boastful, over-the- top, overconfident. This is their first mistake. All sorts of betrayals and miscommunication lead to tension and fights. The boys fall out and make up. They bond and they bicker. There are awkward moments and moments of resolution. This movie is so much more than a coming-of-age movie. It's so much more than a sex romp. It is not just social critique either. It's beautiful cinematically also, but it's more than just a valentine to Mexico. It shows that movies can charm us with their beauty and humor and joy but also make points about justice and struggle and yet everything can go down easily.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"5 May 2014","score":"","review":" Haven't seen this till just recently, even though most people have seen this from childhood. I honestly regret it, it was such a fun movie. It centers around a group of little kids trying to find a pirate treasure using a map from the main kid's attic, which is a map of the city. They make their way to a cave within the mountains to get to the X, while being pursued by a group of bandits. Classic story that everybody knows and loves, and I haven't until now.Actors Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Corey Feldman, and others as kids, trying to find a pirate treasure, how can you go wrong. The characters are all unique in their own ways, and are fun to be around. Even the ones that are annoying, you learn to love. Chunk is a classic character, but when I saw him, it's like oh, they're trying to make him annoyingly charming, oh brother he's just annoying, but by the end of the movie, he was one of my favorite characters, so funny.

It's pretty depressing. Perhaps this is because my own birth mother deserted me as a small child. Who knows?I'll not waste a lot of time evaluating all that happens; you know the story. I'll just briefly relate the things that bug me the most My main objection is David has no choice in anything that happens to him, and it's almost all bad. He goes from a potentially fulfilling situation to a lousy situation to horrible to almost certainly deadly to uncertain and then ends up pathetic. Swell. Why not give him a dose of 'mecha' Tuberculosis just for kicks??And then when he finally gets what he wants and needs, it's only for one day and then it's gone forever. Pathetic.The other thing that irks me is the notion that the Earth's great cities will one day be under 200 feet of water. There's no Liberal Agenda at work there, is there?? That's all the attention this flick deserves. I'll never watch it again.

I find 'Taste of Cherry' one of those and that's why I loved it.. but if slow paced movies bore you and somewhat boneless plots irritate you then definitely its not your cup of tea.. From cinematic point of view, the landscapes of desert are worth watching.. the mood of the movie perfectly harmonizes with the mental condition of the protagonist.. some of the scenes and dialogs vividly express his thinking process but then there are some scenes that are apparently seems simple or dialogs that are said in a very casual way but after looking back and rethinking make you doubt if it was as simple and casual as it seems to be or if I overlooked what was trying to convey in a subtle way.. as I'm still thinking about the professions of all the men he met in reference to symbolism.. and last but not the least, its ending is an enough premise to start an endless debate that will lead to nowhere I guess.. but reading this quote by Abbas Kiarostami solves many puzzles.. When we tell a story, we tell but one story, and each member of the audience, with a peculiar capacity to imagine things, hears but one story. But when we say nothing, it's as if we said a great number of things. ... It's necessary to envision an unfinished and incomplete cinema so that the spectator can intervene and fill the void, the lacks. ~ Abbas Kiarostami ","genre":null},{"date":"5 May 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I love the kind of movies that instead of just telling a story make you think and preferably pose some questions too.. movies that make you feel the experience of some other world, not just in the sense of the world outside the characters but the world inside their minds too..

The Fog has a really cool atmosphere, and even the somewhat bad quality of the shooting adds to the feeling, which I think was much achieved. Aside from atmosphere there were the characters and the story. I thought the characters certainly had separating characteristics about them, but the development wasn't all that good. I didn't feel like I knew them enough to care a whole lot about them. But this is definitely the biggest of the flaws this movie has. The story itself was it's own thing. It was more like a scary story that you would tell at a campfire, and that is not an accidental thing either, as you will see at the beginning of the film. A cool back-story with an equally cool monster\/monsters. I would say definitely watch this movie for fun, for some cool inspiration maybe, and for a ghostly story.
