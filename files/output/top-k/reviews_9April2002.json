[{"date":"9 April 2002","score":"","review":"  Shrek is a brilliantly written masterpiece of animation, which fully deserved its recent Oscar. The genius of the piece is due to its appeal to such a wide audience the surface humor and plotline are simple enough to be enjoyed by young children, while there are many subtleties clearly included for adults. The casting in the film is perfect-in fact, Eddie Murphy is more perfect for the part of Donkey than for any other part I've seen him play. The film's comic gems include a scene in which Lord Farquod is interrogating the gingerbread man and ends up reciting the nursery rhyme Do you know the Muffin Man?, Donkey's rendition of I'm a Believer, and Donkey's attempts to sweet-talk a fire-breathing dragon, among many others. I give this film as many stars as possible and encourage everyone to see it, regardless of age. I first saw this movie dubbed in Italian with English subtitles, and even that did not take away from the film's comic brilliance.

Although this is no Disney film, it has the same, firm, family values, yet it also provides plenty of jokes to keep all ages in the family amused.The cgi is very chunky and colourful with an almost neon feel to the colours used. There are some truly spectacular effects dotted throughout, though the adult humans look like they have been made up of angular pieces.The script is lively and snaps along nicely and the voice acting is fine. The only minor quibble is that the story is incredibly unlikely, even for a fantasy, family film.Overall, Ice Age is a fun, entertaining film but I felt it was not quite as generally polished as Monsters Inc.7\/10. Fun and Colourful.  ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"9 April 2002","score":"","review":"  Ice Age offers a pleasant alternative to Shrek, Monsters Inc and the Toy Story films.
