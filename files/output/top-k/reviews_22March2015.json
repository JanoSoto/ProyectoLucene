For some reason she said I'm not sure you will like this one... but I called bulls'hit on that and gave the movie a shot. Wow. Much better than I could have imagined. The look of the movie is pretty cheap. It was made in the early nineties, but looks more like it's from the seventies. But that's not an issue. The story is your typical first-friends-but-then-one-of-them-goes- nuts plot, but the execution is marvelous. The suspense is built up very nicely. You feel like something is wrong, but they really don't rush with making it too clear to you why that is. You just feel like... something is odd... about Hedra Carlson. She seems to be fond of Allison in a way that borders on pretty goddamn obsessive. You can't get mad at her since he is nice, but at the same time, you don't really know whether she can be trusted or not. And the more she lives in Allison's apartment, the more suspicious she acts... What really made the movie what it is, is the acting. Bridget Fonda is great and Jennifer Jason Leigh is FANTASTIC. Must be one of her all-time best roles. God, did her character creep me out! She actually fits that role so well you forget it's only acting and not a real person. If that crazy bitch tried to be my inmate, I'd kick her out immediately! The movie's full of darkly grotesque scenes, both subtle and more evident ones. You know the typical scene where someone holds a knife against someone else's throat. Well, this was unlike every other of those scenes I've seen! Gross!!! Of course, it's not a masterpiece. There are some awkwardly out-of-place moments like Allison for no reason whatever watching Hedra masturbating (if it had been Hedra watching Allison instead, the scene would make more sense) and the ending, while pretty awesome, is still very predictable. But if you just want to watch a movie which chills you to the bone and you like a classic thriller, you will love this movie!

Just the way they move and how fast everyone interacts with each other is entertaining.However, Tarzan is not without some fairly major flaws.The biggest problem is the movie's plot. I know this is going off of some old material, but they aren't even following the original story very closely so it could've been improved. You can see where the movie is going almost a mile away and it has the same old cliché I'm a protective father who is super conservative and old fashioned and won't risk my people for your ways kind of deal. This kind of thing has been done more frequently AFTER this film was released, but it wasn't an uncommon theme beforehand... I mean... Pocahontas. And of course you know Tarzan is going to do something that will make everyone mad at him, but then Tarzan will have to redeem himself and... you get the drift. Fortunately, this movie is so fast paced that it doesn't even get caught in those boring details and these clichés wizz by super fast. All in all, Tarzan's plot is very weak and the bad guy is... hilariously obvious and I'm even more surprised that Jane and her father didn't even notice how obsessed he was with gorillas... not even slightly suspicious. Overall, I like Clayton's design and his character, but he isn't a truly deep or interesting villain.Regardless of the villain, the other characters have a lot of issues. Almost every character in this movie is a one-dimensional or a two-dimensional character. You have some depth with Tarzan, and maybe a little bit with Jane, but because the movie thinks that montages are equivalent to character development, you never really get any on- screen development. You see the characters before and after the development, but rarely during. This hurts Jane's and Tarzan's relationship the most. In Aladdin it kind of worked because Jasmine already kind of liked Aladdin and recognized that it was probably him. They already had chemistry between each other and they sang a duet. However, when the Tarzan equivalent is a montage and the only romantic part is roughly 20 seconds long... you have almost no chemistry.All of the human characters seemed to have been cast fairly well (not sure about Tarzan, but he sounds fine) but a lot of the animal characters sound... not like their animated characters. Tarzan's father has a voice that sounds a little too high and clear for someone who is supposed to be a massive, giant, powerful gorilla. Terk's gender is almost impossible to tell until you watch the movie long enough. Almost everyone I know who has seen this movie thought Terk was a boy. And there are a couple of other examples of voices that don't seem to fit their characters.The hand-drawn animation in this movie is fantastic. There is no arguing it is some of Disney's best as far as individual characters go. However, almost everything outside of the characters is CGI or painted background... on a CGI plane.

It also made bunches of money. The seventies were not as sequel crazy as our current climate but a hit of that magnitude still demanded continuation. But how does one sequelize the scariest film of all time? The assigned director, John Boorman, had made Deliverance and Excaliber, great films in their own rights. He also made Zardoz an unintentionally hilarious piece of tripped-out seventies camp. That film informed Exorcist II The Heretic more then Boorman's other. The film was derided when released and is still considered one of the worst sequels ever made.Exorcist II The Heretic makes the same mistake many sequels make. It takes a very simple film and attempts to build an elaborate mythology around it. In the first film, the entity possessing Regan was referred to as just the demon or the devil. Going off one line in the original novel, the sequel identifies the demon as Pazuzu, a Babylon wind spirit. Granting the evil entity a proper name, and especially one as silly sounding as Pazuzu, tries to explain the monster, making it weaker. Similarly, Regan McNeil is revealed to have a special purpose. She can heal the sick, has psychic powers, and a great ability to fight off evil. This overlooks two key points from the original film. Regan was a normal little girl, an everyday person, which is what made her possession so awful. Secondly, the girl was merely a stopping point between the battle between the demon and Father Merrin, part of a far older duel between good and evil. Making Regan special negates both of these points. Lastly, The Heretic is knee-deep in seventies pop psychology and pseudo-science. There's the whole business with the hypnotism, long since discredited as a psychological tool. It's achieved in an especially goofy way, with a machine that flashes lights at a slower speed. The original Exorcist is still timeless. The sequel is immediately dated.Despite a story that dramatically misunderstands the point of the original, Exorcist II is not without its pros. John Boorman's strength frequently lies in his ability to create a dream-like tone of unreality. Though mostly ridiculous, The Heretic occasionally makes use of this. The flashbacks to the events of the first film make use of a clumsy Linda Blair look-alike and a voice actor that kind of sounds like Mercedes McCambridge. Similarly, the sequences showing Merrin exorcising the African boy years ago are silly as hell. However, Boorman creates some striking images. He uses sets that are intentionally artificial, with high-contrast, orange lighting. The camera sailing over the Ethiopian desert or the looming clouds of locusts are effective. Probably the best sequence is the dream-like encounter between Father Lamont and an adult Kokumo, which involves a spitted out tomato and a bed of spikes.Unfortunately, any time Boorman creates a lyrical moment, he immediately undermines it with an ill-conceived moment of unintentional camp. The sound design makes extensive use of high-pitched shrieking and repetitive chanting. There are hard cuts between Lamont's adventure in Africa and Linda Blair tap-dancing in a ridiculous outfit. When Lamont is pelted with rocks, Regan begins to spasmodically convulse. Aligning the demon Pazuzu with locusts is a strange choice, especially when it leads to stationary shots of fluttering grasshoppers. Before the character become hypnotized, their eyes roll back in their heads in a rather comical fashion. The bleating sound of the hypnotizing machine are also a really silly sound effect. The Heretic is frequently affected by a very silly streak.Further troubling the film is its two main performances. As the pre-teen, non-possessed Regan, Linda Blair created a naturalistic, workable performance. In the sequel, Blair has grown a squeaky, distracting voice. She seems like an out-of-her-element teen girl and not in a good way. Her range proves limited. Blair is unbelievable in every scene in the film. Blair was basically still a novice at the time. So what's Richard Burton's excuse? Burton is sweaty, over-the-top, and constantly starring wide-eyed. Constantly being forced to yell Pazuzu! and Kokumo! doesn't help any. He stuffs every line with as much unearned pretensions as possible. Burton's ridiculous performance puffs up the film's already overheated tone. Kitty Winn, returning as Regan's tutor Sharon, seems unsure what to do with her part. She's usually given the expositionary dialogue, which is a real bad fit. Some performances are better though. Louise Fletcher is fine. Max von Sydow retains his dignity. James Earl Jones even adds some gravitas to his brief moments of screen time.Exorcist II The Heretic is a silly movie with an as silly conclusions. It has the good idea to return to Regan's Georgetown bedroom but, otherwise, ridiculousness has totally consumed the film by this point. Swarms of locusts explode from a door. A car slams into a wall, an unconvincing special effect. A girl burns in a fire, despite the actress seemingly not being anywhere near the fire. Linda Blair, wearing very silly contact lens, attempts to seduce Richard Burton. Regan banishes the evil spirit by dancing and spinning her arms around. Think of how stark and intense the last act of The Exorcist was. It's like the sequel goes out of its way to create the opposite of those emotions.Exorcist II The Heretic is not the worst movie ever made or even the worst sequel, for that matter. It is, however, a deeply misconceived project made by filmmakers who truly did not understand the power of the original.

It takes a very simple film and attempts to build an elaborate mythology around it. In the first film, the entity possessing Regan was referred to as just the demon or the devil. Going off one line in the original novel, the sequel identifies the demon as Pazuzu, a Babylon wind spirit.

She can heal the sick, has psychic powers, and a great ability to fight off evil. This overlooks two key points from the original film. Regan was a normal little girl, an everyday person, which is what made her possession so awful. Secondly, the girl was merely a stopping point between the battle between the demon and Father Merrin, part of a far older duel between good and evil. Making Regan special negates both of these points. Lastly, The Heretic is knee-deep in seventies pop psychology and pseudo-science. There's the whole business with the hypnotism, long since discredited as a psychological tool. It's achieved in an especially goofy way, with a machine that flashes lights at a slower speed.

Released in 1966, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a film adaptation of the Edward Albee play, which debuted four years earlier, about a sadistic, wickedly humorous married couple, George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), who draw a younger husband and wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) into their twisted dynamic throughout a very late night. Once considered so shocking because of its language and themes, which was relatively profane and outrageous for the time, it's now jarring to see a film explore the dynamics of human relationships with such well-observed intelligence, wit, candor, and complexity. It's sheer perfection and one of my all-time favorite films.Directed by then first-timer Mike Nichols, and adapted by Ernest Lehman, it stays wonderfully faithful to the play, even though some minor things are cut and added for the film medium and length. Albee sees people with an x-ray vision and gives George and Marta this ruthless sense of honesty. Not only do they strip the people around them bare, but they can turn the same fierce insight back on themselves. It has a devastating effect, like a car crash you have to watch, but it can also turn a dime and be absolutely funny.It's a highly dialogue-driven affair, with lots of long takes. You've got to be able to pay attention to get into this movie. And unlike some contemporary and rather self-indulgent dialogue-heavy writers like Tarantino or Sorkin, the dialogue never seems arch or self-conscious or unnecessary. Every conversation is very natural and has a deeper meaning, especially when you dive further into the film and discover just how self-constructed George and Martha's lives are. Their lies, fantasies, and fictions are ironic considering how brutally truthful they are in other moments. But, it goes to show just how honest and how dishonest people can be, at the same time. Even the most straightforward people lie to themselves and to others, at times, to be protected from the harsh reality of frustrations, doubts, failures, or unhappiness. And when this all emerges during the climax, it's totally heartbreaking.The writing is genius but the performances are really what seal the deal. In my opinion, there's not a link weak in the bunch. Everyone adds something different and distinctive to the film.Elizabeth Taylor rightfully won an Oscar for Best Actress for her hurricane of a performance as Martha. It might seem a bit overplayed, at moments, but that element completely works when you consider how overplayed Martha is, as a person. She is intentionally loud, obnoxious, rude, and vulgar. But, Taylor adds such soul, heartbreak and humanity to her that you can't help but feel for her and even see some of yourself or someone you know in her mean-spirited streak.Her then husband Richard Burton has, in some ways, the less showy role. George holds back quite a bit in the first act, seeming simply like Martha's sharp-witted yet castrated husband. But, when he lets loose, watch out. The passivity drops and he is totally ferocious. You see the anger that's been brewing inside of him for years with Martha, as well as the disappointment and emptiness. He should've won the Oscar.George Segal has the most thankless role of the quartet, having to basically be the sane one throughout the film. But, he also acts as our moral compass. You can relate to Nick's horror and discomfort at everything that's happening, as well as the way he's eventually roped into all of the games and how that's even more horrifying to him.Sandy Dennis gives an Oscar-winning performance full of unusual yet spot-on choices. She plays dumb very well, especially since Honey is playing dumb herself. She's just so awkward and out-of-place in the midst of everything that she has to act stupid and oblivious, as well as getting hysterically drunk, just to survive.This is a true acting masterclass and one of the most moving, layered, and truthful films I've ever seen.

Whatever he does on that day, goes away the next morning where he starts afresh. Only he has the memory and awareness of this loop. For everything and everyone else, this is a fresh start. For example, if he breaks a clock, the next morning it will be renewed, same with breaking somebody else's nose. Only he would have the memory of breaking the stuff. When he realizes this, as expected, he tries to get the max out of this situation in a hedonistic way. As none of his actions would lead to any consequences, he can now do whatever he wants. He also uses his ability to have multiple passes to the same events, gather larger world knowledge and use it to his advantage (securing a date for example). While doing so, he realizes his actual love for Rita, his co-worker. But however he might want to impress her, things just does not work out. He then contemplates suicide. And does it. But however he tries, he wakes up just the same at 6 am on Groundhog day. There is just no tomorrow for him.Once he is completely bored with suicides, he tries to build up skills. He learns, ice sculptures, piano, car mechanic's job and many different things. With multiple repetitions, he also has much more knowledge about the stuffs that happen on the small town. He uses these two knowledge to help many people around him. And finally, with all these, he manages to win the heart of Rita. Once he does that, tomorrow comes back to his life. He wakes up on 3rd February.That being the story, there are many philosophical, spiritual and metaphorical undertones in this movie.First, the repeat of 2nd Feb in Phil's life, in some way is a metaphor to our own materialistic, repetitive, absurd and boring days. And unless we do something significant, like learning piano like a pro, or helping out someone from choking, or finally getting our dream date, there is just no tomorrow for us. What we see as tomorrow is just the repeat of yesterday. As it comes out from this conversation between Phil and Ralph whom he meets at the café. Phil What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? Ralph That about sums it up for me.Each day, learn something new, feel something new, do something new. Make sure today you do something different from yesterday.It also touches life in another philosophical sense. Like Phil's 2nd Feb, our own life may very well be as pointless and may lack purpose, that does not mean we won't do our work or would not try to be a better person. Our life may be as pointless as the life of Sisyphus; but that does not mean we need to be unhappy about it. This story of a man doomed to relive the same day over and over again is not concerned about tomorrow. A true absurdist triumph, it cares not what the destination might be, for it knows that the pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful whether or not that pursuit is eventually rewarded.1 Just like it is told in Karma yoga.It also has a spiritual and philosophical undertone. Each 2nd Feb in Phil's life seems to be corresponding to the life. And just like Phil, we are stuck in endless cycle of birth and death, bound to the wheel of time until we get the promotion to next level 2.Overall it's a great movie.

Whatever he does on that day, goes away the next morning where he starts afresh. Only he has the memory and awareness of this loop. For everything and everyone else, this is a fresh start. For example, if he breaks a clock, the next morning it will be renewed, same with breaking somebody else's nose. Only he would have the memory of breaking the stuff. When he realizes this, as expected, he tries to get the max out of this situation in a hedonistic way. As none of his actions would lead to any consequences, he can now do whatever he wants. He also uses his ability to have multiple passes to the same events, gather larger world knowledge and use it to his advantage (securing a date for example). While doing so, he realizes his actual love for Rita, his co-worker. But however he might want to impress her, things just does not work out. He then contemplates suicide. And does it. But however he tries, he wakes up just the same at 6 am on Groundhog day. There is just no tomorrow for him.Once he is completely bored with suicides, he tries to build up skills. He learns, ice sculptures, piano, car mechanic's job and many different things. With multiple repetitions, he also has much more knowledge about the stuffs that happen on the small town. He uses these two knowledge to help many people around him. And finally, with all these, he manages to win the heart of Rita. Once he does that, tomorrow comes back to his life. He wakes up on 3rd February.That being the story, there are many philosophical, spiritual and metaphorical undertones in this movie.First, the repeat of 2nd Feb in Phil's life, in some way is a metaphor to our own materialistic, repetitive, absurd and boring days. And unless we do something significant, like learning piano like a pro, or helping out someone from choking, or finally getting our dream date, there is just no tomorrow for us. What we see as tomorrow is just the repeat of yesterday. As it comes out from this conversation between Phil and Ralph whom he meets at the café. Phil What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered? Ralph That about sums it up for me.Each day, learn something new, feel something new, do something new. Make sure today you do something different from yesterday.It also touches life in another philosophical sense. Like Phil's 2nd Feb, our own life may very well be as pointless and may lack purpose, that does not mean we won't do our work or would not try to be a better person. Our life may be as pointless as the life of Sisyphus; but that does not mean we need to be unhappy about it. This story of a man doomed to relive the same day over and over again is not concerned about tomorrow. A true absurdist triumph, it cares not what the destination might be, for it knows that the pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful whether or not that pursuit is eventually rewarded.1 Just like it is told in Karma yoga.It also has a spiritual and philosophical undertone. Each 2nd Feb in Phil's life seems to be corresponding to the life. And just like Phil, we are stuck in endless cycle of birth and death, bound to the wheel of time until we get the promotion to next level 2.Overall it's a great movie. A simple take on a complex subject such as time loop. Go watch it.References 1 http\/\/www.slantmagazine.com\/house\/article\/imagining-sisyphus-happy- a-groundhog-day-retrospective 2 http\/\/www.rogerebert.com\/reviews\/great-movie-groundhog-day-1993 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"22 March 2015","score":"","review":" Although it isn't the most incredible cinematic work to ever come out of Hollywood, it is understandable how Happy Gilmore is one of the mostly widely enjoyed comedies out there. It lacks a good story and has all of the trademarks of a standard Sandler movie, but it hits several areas of comedy that can please a lot of people with different comedic tastes.The storyline is structured much like Billy Madison with Sandler starting off as a burnout and going through some trials to achieve a goal and beat a villain that comes up partway through. Several points of the story feature rather far-fetched outcomes to hopeless scenarios. The plot is pretty weak in its gradual development with Shooter McGavin, and the movie might have been better off without any plot, but even in comedies, there has to be some kind of plot.None of the characters, like the storyline, have a whole lot of depth. Sandler's character has a much different personality from Billy Madison, but he, as always, has some goofy remarks, witty remarks, over the top antics, and spats of anger. Happy Gilmore is pretty much the character that all other Sandler characters are based off of. Grandma, Virginia, Chubbs, and Shooter McGavin have personality, but not arcs. Grandma losing her house is basically the driving force of the story, and we can see that she matters a lot to Happy. Virginia is primarily present to keep Happy from letting his hockey instincts get out of hand, and ends up as his girlfriend without realistic reason. Chubbs is a pretty likable character and is a rather pivotal besides. Shooter McGavin, while not an interesting villain like Heath Ledger's Joker or action movie villains, is still a great antagonist because of his ability to be such a hateable and passive-aggressive jerk. There are also a lot of small but memorable characters that Happy plays golf with or around, such as Bob Barker, his two caddy's, the obnoxious fan at the celebrity tournament, Mr. Larson, and the guy that talks about the golf ball's energy.As I said before, the comedy reaches several regions, though it maintains a constant goofy and blatant feel. Some of it's crude, but not as much as in, say, Anger Management. There is a good balance of situational and verbal humor. Basically every character, big and small, that has a line brings some kind of comedy in their screen time. Even the golf channel announcers, who are scripted like real sports announcers, contribute humor. Probably what sets this movie apart is its ability to bring a diversity of comedy into each individual scene. Not everything in every scene will strike you as funny, but there will probably be a couple of laughs in each.A quick word on the execution. The visual quality and cinematography with Happy's insane shots are nothing special, but somehow add to the general mood. The acting and scripting are debatable, as in most comedies, but you can tell that every actor fits their respective character.Again, this is pretty much the prototypical Sandler comedy so if you have liked any of his other movies, apart from maybe Airheads, this should be at least somewhat enjoyable. It doesn't take a high IQ to appreciate, and can be seen under almost any circumstances. I would recommend watching it on a road trip if the audience isn't too young. If you don't mind a little ridiculousness, it's worth a rental. Overall Rating 8.2\/10.

It did what all great movies do Spurn discussion. Some Christian condemn it, others supported it for making the devil real to a new generation. Even the critics were divided, some considering the film vulgar trash driven by shock value. Forty years later, The Exorcist's status as one of the greatest horror films ever made, if not the greatest, is well established. Few challenge this opinion. It's hard for me to declare any film the greatest anything but The Exorcist is clearly an incredible film.The story behind The Exorcist is well known. William Peter Blattey, a screenwriter best known for comedy, was inspired by the supposedly true story of a young boy possessed in 1950s Baltimore. Using this as a basis, he wrote the novel The Exorcist, which became a great success. Hollywood came calling not long afterwards, as you'd expect. Blatty adapted his own book. Accordingly, The Exorcist is an extremely close adaptation, following the book on a nearly scene-by-scene basis.William Friedkin, who just won an Academy Award for The French Connection, did not approach The Exorcist as a typical horror film. Friedkin shoots the movie with a docu-drama intensity. Though the film is famous for its chilling use of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, there's very little music in the movie. As we watch the McNeil household go about their days, and Karras' isolated existence, this creates an acute sense of reality. One the film slowly subverts. A sense of chilly unease is created in a simple scene of Chris walking down the street or Karras serving communion. This is best illustrated during Karras' nightmare, which is not outwardly disturbing but still unnerves the viewer. Or the long sequences of Regan in the hospital, focusing on her discomfort during the procedures. No matter how normal things appear at first, its apparent things are going to go very, very wrong.The creeping feeling of discomfort and established realism leaves the audience for the film's stabbing sequences of shocking behavior. The moments are well known now, widely parodied and referenced. Regan bloodily masturbates with a crucifix, pushes her mother's face into her bloody crotch, screams profanity, spews a torrent of green vomit, and cranks her head around in a circle. Even lesser moments like Regan speaking with the murdered director's voice are well known. Yet Friedkin's rooted-in-reality approach makes these moments creditable. Chris being attacked by her own daughter is shot in an intimate style, placing the audience in the character's shoes. What makes these moments horrifying is not that they're happening. Far more explicit scenes existed before and after. What makes them effective is that they are happening to this girl, in this house, in this way.The film builds towards the final act, when the titular exorcism takes place. Father Merrin's arrival brings a graveness to the already intense situation. The camera remains focused on the priests as they do their work. The girl blares profanity, moans blasphemy, and floats above the bed. The room shakes, the actors' breaths visible before them. These are special effects but the movie's total commitment to verisimilitude makes them seem plausible. The last third of the movie is still shockingly directed and completely effective. Every time it gives me chills.It's notable that The Exorcist's conclusion still triggers debate. Father Merrin dies, succumbing to his poor health. Karras convinces the demon to leave the girl's body and enters his. With his last ounce of free will, he flings himself from the window, dying. Has good truly triumphed over evil? Has Karras' crisis of faith been resolved in his act of self-sacrifice? If demons exist, God must exist, right? The Exorcist doesn't provide easy answers. What catharsis the ending creates is undermined by the scars still visible on Regan's face, the lines of aging on Chris'. These events will haunt them forever. Moreover, the eerie opening has Merrin, in Iraq, starring strangely at a Sumerian statue. The demon recognizes him upon his entry to the house. This is but one battle in a long, on-going war between demonic forces and those of human faith. Is it a battle we can ever truly win? Whether The Exorcist is faith-affirming or existentially unnerving is a matter of personal interpretation.Finally, The Exorcist is bolstered by a fantastic cast. Ellen Burstyn at first appears likable. As the events go on, her thread-bare emotions are bravely acted out, showing no sign for movie star vanity. Jason Miller's Karras is darker, more uncertain and troubled then the character in the book. He does a great deal of acting with his face. Max von Sydow's booming voice makes Merrin a figure of immediate respect. Despite only being 44 at the time, he appears much older and carries a lifetime of knowledge and regrets on his shoulders. How much credit Linda Blair can take for her performance is still debated. Blair is great as the cherub-faced Regan, a happy, mischievous child dealing with her parents' divorce. Once possessed, the voice of Mercedes McCambridge and Dick Smith's legendary make-up takes over, creating a disturbing, incomparable portrayal of demonic arrogance and vicious sacrilege. The only performance I'm not too keen on is Lee J. Cobb as Lt. Kinderman, a subplot that didn't entirely work in the book and seems even more extraneous on-screen.The best horror films are not the ones that simply set out to scare an audience. The Exorcist does that. Boy, does it ever. But it also discomforts us, presents us with difficult questions and themes about complex, real life issues. About faith, guilt, the existence of evil and the question of good. The film is a triumph of direction, sound design, and tone but also of writing and creation. To say The Exorcist is the greatest horror film ever made is too presumptuous. It is, however, clearly one of the greats, in this genre and any genre.

So Juan M. Klein is there in an airport minding his own business, waiting for his wife so they can have some champagne in a hotel when all of a sudden a policeman tows his car away. Juan tries to pull some shady 'I'm a policeman so give me a break' thing but he can't get away with it. Am I supposed to sympathize with a guy that pulls badge when he breaks the law? Why do I have to consider the policeman that is actually following the law and doing his job an arse? Anyways, Juan's car gets towed and he carries on waiting for his wife.There are some really nasty guys that are planning a reception party for a General. The bad guys are really mean cause they walk down hallways wearing angry faces in silence and they are still angry and silent when in the elevator. What if anyone farted? Would they smile then? The chief of the baddies is a naked ninja that shoots imaginary bullets with his imaginary gun (in reality a remote control) at the TV. The General they are throwing the klatch for is called Esperanza (meaning Hope which is nice), he used to be the dictator of the Republic of Valverde, a country located between Mexico and Argentina. You know, an imaginary country that says is in Latin America but does not point fingers in case those red countries have cinemas and their inhabitants might get offended.The baddies' plan is as follows. Step 1. Two guys will desecrate a church and kill the warden\/priest, who will die in slow motion. Step 2. Two guys will go to the luggage handling area to tamper with something, because we all know that main airport systems are located there. Step 3. The naked ninja and his bff will hang around the airport instead of going to the church because there's no other way of making Juan and naked ninja collide. Step 4. Gain control of the airport. Step 5. Throw a party for Mr. Hopes. Sounds easy, right? Wrong! They did not count with Juan being there and he being the only policeman with half a brain!

No wonder they get divorced! Hope's airplane lands and both naked ninja and Juan go to greet him, but a fight ensues, it seems they are both battling to see who is Hope's best friend. They shoot at each other with 90's bullet sounds that are super realistic. Juan loses and has to leave pulling the emergency escape thing from the pilot's chair, which throws him like 130 miles up in the air but he survives the fall because he's a ghost from the very beginning.A special task force arrives, but they are shooting only imaginary bullets cause they are on naked ninja's side and we all know how he loooooves imaginary things.Special Task Force, Naked Ninja force and Hope they all decide to go and have the party in the Bahamas, so they board another plane.

The operation is a success and after therapy Bill is like new. Bill begins to have disturbing dreams and visions of murder and one day he knocks his son across the room with his arm. Bill knows he didn't mean to and it was like the arm did it without Bill's consent. Bill wants to know whose arm is on his body so a buddy at the police department runs his prints and Bill discovers the arm came from a recently executed death row inmate named Charlie Fletcher (John Walsh) who had murdered over 20 people. With further investigation, Bill learns all of Charlie's body parts were transplanted by Dr. Webb who refuses to do anything about it. Bill tracks down the others who received part of Charlie and they are all suffering from similar problems. The person that got Charlie's head and mind is now slowly going around and taking his original body parts back so no one is safe. Eric Red directs this horror film with an eye on the psychological terror lead character Bill is going through. When Bill sits in a bar contemplating if evil is in the mind flesh or heart we are transfixed as an audience. What Red does very well is mix the emotional side of what is happening to his characters and the extreme violence and gore that is present with Fletcher recollecting his body parts. What could have been extremely silly and over the top isn't due to the nice balance within the story and how it was handled. Jeff Fahey as Bill Chrushank turns in a fine lead performance and the supporting cast is strong as well. Body Parts certainly delivers in the gore and blood department but it is mixed into an involving story that stays believable despite some wild leaps in the story.

I feel like if you do that you get to see what you think things would look like, and what people interpreted everything to look like. I also feel that if you only read the play and watch one version you have nothing to compare to and some people may prefer another version over the other.

I did like it but there were parts that should have been done differently. I like the actors, I like how it is modernized and I like the original story of Romeo and Juliet. I thought that in the beginning of the movie, there was a lot going on and that the movie would be hard to follow. After a little bit, I started to be able to understand what was going on and the movie got better. I also disliked how everything is modern except for how they are speaking. Some may find it funny but I don't. I would have preferred only certain parts to have the original writing. Although that is my opinion, I understand why it is written the way it is. If William Shakespeare wrote a book instead of a play, the movie would have modern day words, but it was written as a play, so it is spoken the way the play would have been. I would recommend you see this movie. I would also read the play and watch a different version of the movie. I feel like if you do that you get to see what you think things would look like, and what people interpreted everything to look like.

It fixed my main complaints for the original movie and improved in those areas. I think this is the best movie in the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's perfect but it's still a good improvement nonetheless. It has better action scenes, more memorable enemies, and less slow moments. The outback makes a great and better set then the first one. Many action movies have copied much of what this movie did because it made many great choices. After Max finds a group of people who took refuge, he plans to steal their oil but he finds out that another group of people are after them and he decides to team up with them to fight them. He becomes friends with the Gyro Captain and the Feral Kid and the movie gives some characterization. I also loved the death of the main antagonist. I found myself replaying the scene about 5 times because it was so spectacular. I don't feel that this movie did much revolutionary for its time but its great filming choices made it into a cult classic.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 March 2015","score":"","review":" Even as a young (28!) director, Kubrick manages to tell a story masterfully. It is a heist movie, and it tells you just enough to let you know what is going on. There is never a ok, here's the plan-scene, but rather you start piecing it together as you see it start unfolding. You are never explained how this assorted group of gentlemen find their way together, but the chemistry and (sometimes lack of) connection between them is still obvious.Maybe due to it being a cheap movie for its time, some of the acting is a bit overdone, but not in a way to break the flow of the story. And if you like the noir-style of man, you will not be disappointed.The climax of the movie is a bit silly compared to the rest of the movie, and while the relationship between the characters has its consequences, the ending of the movie is more about luck, or lack of it. Maybe that's a fine irony to have in a movie about betting on horses? All in all it holds up well. Kubrick didn't want to have narration, but it adds character to the movie, and makes it stand out against modern day films that are inspired by it. The fragmented way of telling the story seems natural, as it builds tension rather than act as a distraction.
