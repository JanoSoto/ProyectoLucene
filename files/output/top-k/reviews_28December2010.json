I decided it was time I saw what all the fuss was about and took the plunge when it came up on the TV schedules recently. To be honest, it's better than what I was expecting, although still a little too saccharine in places for my taste. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you more of my thoughts (summary haters please save that drowning angel while I write the next paragraph).George Bailey grew up in the small town of Bedford Falls. He has always wanted to leave and travel the world and find his fortune but the fates have always prevented his leaving. His father runs a local Building and Loan company with George's uncle Billy and when his father dies it is George that is chosen to carry on the business. His brother, Harry, who was supposed to take over when he left college, gets a better offer. Even when he gets married himself, to Mary, and they are about to leave on honeymoon, he is drawn back to the town. When a local businessman, Mr Potter, refuses him a loan after some money is lost, this is the last straw for George and he decides to take his own life, thinking he is worth more dead than alive. At this point an Angel (second class) called Clarence intervenes and shows George what life would be like if he had never existed, and I'm here to tell you it ain't pretty. Better not say any more, don't want to give the ending away.This is a very well made film, with excellent direction from Frank Capra and a tremendous performance from James Stewart as George Bailey. He really steals the show here and, not surprisingly, was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. Honourable mentions must also go to; Donna Reed as Mary Hatch, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as Clarence.As I said at the beginning, I found this film a little too saccharine in places, but it's still a great film and deserves its 'Classic' label. It is a very long film which mostly deals with events in George's life that lead up to his attempted suicide and it is all very well done. If you haven't seen it before I can highly recommend this film. I am not a religious man myself, but still enjoyed it.My score 8.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 December 2010","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I have heard many times that this is a classic Christmas film over the years but it has always evaded me, until now.

I enjoyed it way back then and have seen it several times since then. It still holds up well, though perhaps a bit dated compared to more recent horror\/ghost films. The two performances that stand out are of Pamela Franklin and Roddy McDowell. Both shine quite well in this film, especially Mr. McDowell. He is missed as he always brought an element of class to a film, whether it be good or bad. Ms. Franklin (The Innocents, Our Mother's House, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie) is especially appealing. I believe she started making films at the age of 11 and by the time this movie came out she had blossomed into a very beautiful young woman. As always she gives an excellent performance. It is a pity she gave up acting sometime in the late 70s to raise a family, never to return film or television again.I read the original novel on which this film is based on after seeing it in the theater. The movie is very much toned down compared to the book. I have never been fond of remakes, but this is one I would like to see made again as long as it follows the novel more closely and is done well. So much is left out in the film version, probably due to the time period and culture of the day. It would have received an R rating if it was more faithful to the book. Nevertheless, this is a decent celluloid version of it. It is sufficiently creepy, even today. It's scariness is not as intense as the original version of The Haunting (which scared me silly), my all time favorite ghost film but still is very suspenseful, with a very interesting storyline. What I don't like is how this film has been marketed; ie. the photo on the cover of the DVD. This is not really a violent film, yet they chose the one scene that shows blood for the DVD cover. That is very tacky.

It takes place in the future in Oceania, a society controlled through people's thoughts, or at least most of them. The main character, Winston Smith (John Hurt) lives his everyday life constantly battling over the fact that he knows what reality is in his mind compared to what the Party says it is. The film starts off surprisingly precise to George Orwell's book. The visual aspects of this film are so accurate and they look almost identical the manner that I pictured myself when reading the book. However, This film rushes through the storyline, leaving out many crucial scenes and patterns.Orwell intended this story to be battle of Winston and his mind. The most important aspect of the original book is Winston's thought life and how he commits thought crime on a day to day basis, going on unnoticed by the telescreens. Michael Radford's interpretation has very minimal dialog of Winston's thoughts. This film also does not introduce characters and ideas efficiently. For example, The film gives no introduction of the overall lifestyle and society of Oceania. It just jumps right in assuming everyone has read the book. Another is the mental portrayal of Big Brother. All you see is his posters and telescreens, you don't get a proper explanation of his purpose and intentions. This list of neglected scenes goes on and on. Winston's fear of rats, the scene where Winston brings Julia to O'Brien's and they make an oath to do whatever it takes to fight against the party, and the scene of the three inner party members who get arrested in the Chestnut Tree Cafe were either not properly demonstrated or not shown at all. With all my negative views, there were some positive ones. I thought the best depictions from the book are the 2 minutes hate scenes, with everyone screaming and stammering. I was also agreed with the affair scenes in the upper room of Mr. Charrington's shop. If you have never read the book, you will be utterly confused and upset. If you have read it, you will just be disappointed. The whole idea of the story centers around Winston's thoughts, while this adaption of the book has very few if his thoughts. It's almost as if Radford copied the book directly to screenplay, leaving out all the thoughts and emotions. To do justice for Orwell's masterpiece, this film would have to be made into 2 whole parts.

The beliefs and biases of the film maker, Frank Capra, are clearly shown. We can agree or disagree with what we see and therefore the audience was shown far more respect than what we get from films today. In today's films heavily effected by political correctness most filmmakers will go out of their way to blur the lines, grey out the divisions and seemingly anticipate every possible criticism so that you never know what the movie is really trying to say. I think this is partly a result of the McCarthyist witch hunts in the 1950s which did a lot to silence any kind of honest political culture in American film.The result of this more honest kind of black and white (yes both meanings are intended) film making is that we can really laugh, perhaps maliciously, perhaps sentimentally at Mr. Smith's struggles. I doubt anyone living in the era of Obama Barrack really believes that politicians like Mr. Smith even exist. If Obama isn't Mr. Smith, then who is? But we can identify with his frustrations and the cynicism of his secretary and other political veterans in the film.I like the fact that party affiliations were left out of the film. Even though this was obviously done to avoid anyone accusing the film of being biased towards one party or the other I think it has perhaps the unintended effect of criticizing the entire political system and not just the behavior of a few politicians.
