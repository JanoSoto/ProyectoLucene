Donald died in his dream to prevent Gretchen getting killed in the real life. Although he believes that the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind is antiseptics(!), Donald had a vision. He gave whatever Gretchen wanted from life; and when she got all of her desired, the destiny was rewritten putting effect the fact that she has actually never met with Donald. Gretchen had been killed accidentally by Frank. In order to make Donald save Gretchen's life; a restless supernatural spirit,that wore Frank's Halloween night dress, sacrificed Donald and saved Frank's life.Donnie Darko brought out who rule the destiny of the world. The answer is neither God or humankind. It is angels(and\/or daemons) that forms the fate and represents the balance of the nature. It is also clarified that only angels(and\/or daemons) can travel in time.Jake Gyllenhaal performed Donald(Donnie Darko) and totally took on the tough responsibility of playing a schizophrenic superhero. Maggie Gyllenhaal, his sister both in the movie and in the real life, looked as the cutest of all her performances ever. Jena Malone was surely the right choice to perform as Gretchen, although she didn't give any extra effort to catch viewers' attention.

Donnie Darko totally deserves to be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time for every aspect.Editing and theatrical cut was also a good job. There were deleted scenes that I got the chance to view from the DVD, just good to know. The film has been edited in a smooth and clever style. I got people all the time telling that Donnie Darko is a schizophrenic film, which is not fair. That would straiten the wide implications we can get. Those implications may include not just scientific thesis of quantum mechanics but also very important social criticisms. It is a mad world.

Eva was born an illegitimate child into a poverty riddled childhood. She had big dreams, and fought her way to the top as an actress, relentlessly using her charisma and sexuality to get ahead. When she meets and marries Colonel Juan Peron (Jonathan Pryce), she uses her savvy, strong will and empathy for the poor to help him become President of Argentina. During this time, her polarizing personality makes her loved by the masses, but loathed by the elite. By the time she dies of cancer at age 33, she leaves behind a legacy.I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, from beginning to end. I've heard complaints from some about the non-stop singing, but let's not forget that it is supposed to be a musical. The film is an adaptation of the Broadway play. The songs are energetic and ingratiating, especially since some of the melodies and lyrics are used more than once for thematic effect. It never feels gratuitous, but maybe that's because I'm a music lover and understand that music is another way to communicate. My favorite numbers are 'Buenos Aires', 'I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You' and the classic 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina'. I've also read some stuffy film critics complain that the film was not deep enough or the audience wasn't able to connect emotionally to Eva. But I would have to disagree. Eva Peron was a very complex woman. She's ambitious, cunning, passionate, generous, and vulnerable. The film, in my opinion, did a great job at showing her different layers and sides. A lot of this has to do with the lead actress, Madonna. Previously criticized for not showing enough range on screen, Madonna pulls out all the stops as she totally embodies the role of Evita. Most of the time, I was so absorbed in the character that I forgot that I was watching Madonna on screen (which is quite a feat for a superstar of her proportions). As the press and Madonna herself have pointed out before, she and Eva Peron have many things in common and I'm sure that helped her connect to the character. She definitely deserved her Golden Globe.Antonio Banderas also shines as the film's narrator, Che. Who knew that he had such a voice? He adds an intensity and flavor to to his role, and also serves as Evita's conscience at certain times. He displays the movie's message about Eva's multidimensional nature. She's not exactly the saint that countless Argentinians believed she was, but not the evil whore that the snobbish upper class thought that she was either.'Evita' really delivers. It is manages to be both entertaining and uplifting. I would recommend to any fan of musicals or to anyone looking to learn more about an iconic woman.

In Black Hawk Down (2001), U.S. soldiers were sent on a seemingly easy mission to round up two Somalian lieutenants but next thing they knew they were fighting to stay alive. The main characters are not hard to find. All of them are shown within 20 minutes of the movie. The story follows Staff Sgt. Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), PFC Grimes (Ewan McGregor), Lt. Colonel Danny McKnight (Tom Sizemore), Sgt. First Class Norm Hoot Gibson (Eric Bana), and Sgt. First Class Jeff Sanderson (William Fichtner). Throughout the movie the whole story is divided up by following each of these characters and all the conflicts they encounter. But the way the movie is set up you even get concerned about the other characters. For example, the two snipers that sacrificed themselves to save a downed black hawk pilot got me teary eyed because they knew they were not going to make it.The setting of the movie is Mogadishu, Somalia, but the movie could not be filmed on the site because it was considered unsafe. Instead the movie was shot in Morocco where they had everything they need to recreate Mogadishu. They even found a town that looked like the real place and served as a perfect substitute. I was impressed with how much accuracy the film had in it including the actual gear that the actors used. All the little details were covered down to the calendars, music, and TV shows of 1993. They production team was able to get black hawks for the film that was piloted and ran by actual U.S. soldiers. The helicopter squadron that did the flying in the movie was the 160th SOAR division and is the actual flight group that participated in the real event in 1993. The camera angles are mostly flat angle shots to give you the feeling of actually being there. But there are occasional close up shots to show the soldiers reactions and feelings which really help you feel that yourself. In one scene there is a night time shoot out and part of it is in slow motion with the close up of some of the soldiers. You could see the desperation in their eyes as they fire at the enemy. The music is one of the aspects of the movie that really helped me feel the sadness and sorrow that the soldiers were feeling. Hans Zimmer composed the music for Black Hawk Down (2001), the same composer for the Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) and Gladiator (2000). The beginning clip starts off with an elderly African man walking along the starving and the music is an eerie solo African chant. Even though it is in a different language, anyone can tell you that whatever he is chanting about there is a lot of sorrow behind his voice. It really set the mood and helped the audience feel bad about the starving people in the opening scene. Hans Zimmer also adds a lot of percussion and sometimes a little electric guitar to give the shootout scenes a little more excitement. The part we keep on hearing over and over was the main title song, Leave No Man Behind. It is mostly consisted of stings and a single piano. It sounds very solemn and gives it a feeling of remembrance, struggle, and hope. The song that really got me was the last one that is playing before the credits, Gortoz a Ran. Staff Sgt. Eversmann says goodbye to his best friend who died in the mission. He is in a big hanger with the coffins all lined ready to be put on a cargo plane to be sent back to the United States for burial. He talks to his best friend's coffin while trying to hold back the tears. A man and a woman sing in a foreign language that gives me the chills every time I hear it. It has a mournful tone to it and fits the ending perfectly. The closing clip shows all the coffins of the dead soldiers in the airplane as the door slowly closes. Then screen goes black and you see the names of all the soldiers that died during the fighting but you also hear their voices as they say goodbye to their loved ones. It is enough to make anyone shed a tear. Overall the film was very effective on explaining what happened that day. The emotional point was very well expressed and made you actually feel for the soldiers trying to survive. The main theme during the whole movie was the strength of the brotherhood between the soldiers with each of them looking out for one another. True courage and duty was displayed under fire by these soldiers who did not know they possessed these characteristics and they did it with the man beside them in mind. General Garrison (Sam Shepard) went to one of the black hawks before the mission took place and told his men leave no man behind. This quote was said throughout the whole movie by multiple soldiers and was carried out to the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see true valor displayed and selfless acts carried out by soldiers under fire and with seemingly no way out. Relying on each other to get through and survive. I give this movie 9.7 out of 10 and is by far the best movie I ever watched.

","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"9 December 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When the bulk of our generation thinks of black and white movies, we instantly imagine a largely boring experience, filmed on a set with a painted background, with tiresome monologues given by stiff actors and actresses. The movie Paths of Glory (1957) proves these stereotypes wrong and is perhaps more enjoyable than many modern films.Paths of Glory (PG), directed by Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut), is a story set in World War I era France. It documents a French military exploit that is doomed from its conception. The protagonist, Colonel Dax, played by Kirk Douglas(Gunfight at the OK Corral), is given the task of attacking a heavily-fortified German position, the anthill, by his commander General Paul Mireau, George Macready(Commandoes Strike at Dawn). General Mireau decides to issue this insane order after he is tempted with a promotion. The attack ultimately fails and General Mireau wishes to blame his cowardly troops for the loss. He has three men court-marshaled for cowardice (Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel, and Tim Carey). It is then Dax's job to defend them against the biased French military command. The movie gives an insightful snapshot of the Great War that was never attempted by any other film, modern or old, and also contains very strong anti-authority\/ anti-war messages purposefully intended by Kubrick.The filming techniques that Kubrick uses in this movie are unique for the time of its filming. When I first saw this movie, I was convinced that it was a modern film, done in black and white for dramatic effect, but I later discovered it was produced in the 1950's. Kubrick breaks away from tradition and gives very personal close-ups of the characters in the film. This method shows the actor's emotion in great detail, and adds to the complexity of the film. Kubrick added subtle details to his scenes, like shooting the commanders from a low angle during the battle scene, which gives them an appearance of gods looking out over their creation. He also adds shadows in the office of the cowardly and drunk Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris), to make him even more villainous. There is also great use of eye-line match while both General Mireau and Colonel Dax are walking through the trenches, which adds to the realism of the movie. The eye-line match also gives the viewer a picture of all the various soldiers in their different forms of apprehension before the battle.The age of this film does not harm its appearance. Unlike many black and white films, this one was filmed entirely on location. Kubrick paid much attention to detail. He even created a very convincing no-man's land in a German farm field. The court martial takes place at Schleissheim Palace in Munich, Germany, which adds great character to the film and shows the viewer the decadence of the French high command compared to the regular officers. The costumes for the film are very authentic for the time, Kubrick even made sure to have the regimental numbers on the soldiers collars. There was no detail left unnoticed in this movie, and it gives me all the more reason to like it.Kubrick restrained himself in the use of music, there is little sound track other than a march, which opens the film. He does have a great use of drums for suspense, during a night patrol scene in which three characters go out into no-man's land. The last scene, however, contains a very beautiful song. It is sung by Christiane Harlan, who later married Kubrick. The scene has little to do with the plot of the movie, but I feel adds greatly to the films effect. It takes place in a dirty bar, where Harlan is a captured German civilian, who sings a native song to the French officers on leave. When the soldiers jeers and taunts turn to silence and tears, it creates a very moving scene.The characters in the movie are not well-developed and little is given about their background, however, I feel it does not ruin the story. The actors all give great reactions to their situations that I feel are very realistic and honest. There are many moving scenes in this film, the court martial being one of them. Kubrick also adds many subtle details, like having wounded troops pass behind General Mireau while he is laughing.Overall, this film is largely overlooked by the public and should be considered to be one of the great movies of the 1950's. Paths of Glory presents a realistic and enjoyable movie experience, and presents a very stunning picture of authority and war that can relate to any time. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to watch a very moving film. I give this movie 10 out of 10.

It takes place in a dirty bar, where Harlan is a captured German civilian, who sings a native song to the French officers on leave.

Kubrick also adds many subtle details, like having wounded troops pass behind General Mireau while he is laughing.Overall, this film is largely overlooked by the public and should be considered to be one of the great movies of the 1950's. Paths of Glory presents a realistic and enjoyable movie experience, and presents a very stunning picture of authority and war that can relate to any time.

The movie Paths of Glory (1957) proves these stereotypes wrong and is perhaps more enjoyable than many modern films.Paths of Glory (PG), directed by Stanley Kubrick (Full Metal Jacket, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut), is a story set in World War I era France. It documents a French military exploit that is doomed from its conception. The protagonist, Colonel Dax, played by Kirk Douglas(Gunfight at the OK Corral), is given the task of attacking a heavily-fortified German position, the anthill, by his commander General Paul Mireau, George Macready(Commandoes Strike at Dawn). General Mireau decides to issue this insane order after he is tempted with a promotion. The attack ultimately fails and General Mireau wishes to blame his cowardly troops for the loss. He has three men court-marshaled for cowardice (Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel, and Tim Carey). It is then Dax's job to defend them against the biased French military command. The movie gives an insightful snapshot of the Great War that was never attempted by any other film, modern or old, and also contains very strong anti-authority\/ anti-war messages purposefully intended by Kubrick.The filming techniques that Kubrick uses in this movie are unique for the time of its filming. When I first saw this movie, I was convinced that it was a modern film, done in black and white for dramatic effect, but I later discovered it was produced in the 1950's. Kubrick breaks away from tradition and gives very personal close-ups of the characters in the film. This method shows the actor's emotion in great detail, and adds to the complexity of the film. Kubrick added subtle details to his scenes, like shooting the commanders from a low angle during the battle scene, which gives them an appearance of gods looking out over their creation. He also adds shadows in the office of the cowardly and drunk Lieutenant Roget (Wayne Morris), to make him even more villainous. There is also great use of eye-line match while both General Mireau and Colonel Dax are walking through the trenches, which adds to the realism of the movie. The eye-line match also gives the viewer a picture of all the various soldiers in their different forms of apprehension before the battle.The age of this film does not harm its appearance. Unlike many black and white films, this one was filmed entirely on location. Kubrick paid much attention to detail. He even created a very convincing no-man's land in a German farm field. The court martial takes place at Schleissheim Palace in Munich, Germany, which adds great character to the film and shows the viewer the decadence of the French high command compared to the regular officers. The costumes for the film are very authentic for the time, Kubrick even made sure to have the regimental numbers on the soldiers collars. There was no detail left unnoticed in this movie, and it gives me all the more reason to like it.Kubrick restrained himself in the use of music, there is little sound track other than a march, which opens the film. He does have a great use of drums for suspense, during a night patrol scene in which three characters go out into no-man's land. The last scene, however, contains a very beautiful song. It is sung by Christiane Harlan, who later married Kubrick. The scene has little to do with the plot of the movie, but I feel adds greatly to the films effect. It takes place in a dirty bar, where Harlan is a captured German civilian, who sings a native song to the French officers on leave.

Years later, it is due to reopen. But while the new counsellors prepare the camp, an unseen intruder stalks the camp, picking the counsellors off one by one.When John Carpenter's classic Halloween came out, the slasher film was born. But while that film created the whole concept of the slasher, in which fun-loving teenagers are stalked & brutally murdered by a masked intruder, it wasn't until two years later that Friday the 13th made the concept popular. Indeed it set the standard for a whole heap of imitators & ripoffs, not to mention NINE sequels to date.For all it's success (& a sizable cult following), Friday the 13th is a surprisingly crude film. The film was greenlighted before a script was even written, in fact a magazine ad featuring the title smashing through glass was instrumental in getting it off the ground. The script, written in a hurry, is minimalist to an extreme degree. When you think about it, everything in the film is either very stupid or very badly written. The only reason Betsy Palmer's villain gives for going on a killing rampage is the death of her son. If that's the case, if she doesn't want any other child to die, why doesn't she work to establish a safety code for the camp, instead of just killing off all the workers? The acting varies, with the performances ranging from lacklustre to downright bad. The direction consists of stalking scenes patterned after the opening scene of Halloween, which becomes hard on the eyes after a few seconds. Then there's the score&#133; If composer Harry Manfredini thinks that the 'ki, ki, ki, ma, ma, ma' sound is spooky, then he's an idiot. Instead of sounding spooky, it just sounds cheesy & reeks of overkill.

Then again, he had already made a name for himself with Assault on Precinct 13, and thanks to brilliant editing and camera work, great performances and that unforgettable score (which he wrote himself), even its tainted legacy of seven sequels can't tarnish Halloween's iconic status. In fact, it could easily be the best horror movie ever made.The key to the film's genius is simplicity. This is obvious as early as in the opening shot, a nerve-cracking long take which references Psycho in depicting a gruesome murder without actually showing any blood - and it's all seen from the killer's point of view. The deranged individual in question, one Michael Myers, is subsequently locked up in an asylum, from which he escapes 15 years later (the film is set in its real year of release, 1978) to continue killing. The only one who can claim to even begin to understand him is a psychiatrist named Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who follows Michael all the way back to his hometown, Haddonfield, where a bunch of teenage babysitters, including a certain Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature debut), might as well be celebrating the last Halloween of their lives.A lot of things have been said about this movie how the killer's mask was actually obtained from a Captain Kirk mask, how Michael's actions might be linked to sex (something Victor Miller admits to having expanded on when he wrote Friday 13th), how Carpenter used character names to reference some of his inspirations, like Rio Bravo (Sheriff Brackett is named after Howard Hawks' frequent writing partner Leigh Brackett) or Psycho (Loomis is the name of one of the victims in that film; in addition, Janet Leigh happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis' mother), yada yada yada. None of that really matters. The important thing is how Carpenter constructed a classic in the most basic way, filming everything on location is just three weeks, using friends and crew-members as extras (his collaborator Nick Castle plays the adult Myers) and instilling an everlasting sense of fear through a cunning use of long takes (that and the fact that Michael's face isn't seen for most of the movie).Also, he obtained something most people wouldn't write home about when it comes to slasher films (a genre that was practically born with Halloween) really good acting. Curtis is impressive playing a role that is so far away from the Scream Queen cliché (which didn't exist at the time, but still...), and Pleasence is so outlandishly creepy (even though he's playing the good guy for a change) it's no surprise to learn Christopher Lee still regrets turning down the part. Of course, his remorse is most likely a reaction to the film as a whole, and that's just another piece of evidence regarding its untouchable status.One night, HE came home, the tag-line said. That phrase could easily refer to the director as well as the character Carpenter may not have known it when he first thought of the concept, but his decision to do something cheap (in the good sense of the word) and different from any other horror movie led to the birth of a milestone in the genre's history, arguably the finest of those made by the '70s-'80s New Wave (Carpenter, Romero, Hooper, Craven), an achievement that still hasn't met its match.

If you type Junior in to Google, the first hit is this movie, but if you type it in to the IMDb, the first hit is George W. Bush. I just thought that was funny.So by 1994, Schwarzenegger had just done a series of pretty hardcore action movies &#150; Terminator 2, Last Action Hero (shut up, that movie rocked), and True Lies &#150; so I'm really curious to know who came up with the idea of making a movie in which he gets pregnant and carries a baby to term. Yeah, Last Action Hero and especially Kindergarten Cop showed the world that Arnold was a big action movie star that was not above having a little fun with himself, but a pregnancy??Amazingly enough, however, the movie is much better than you might think. He stars as Dr. Alex Hesse, a scientist working on a new formula that will help create successful pregnancies for women having trouble conceiving. But the problem is that they are unable to get authorization to perform necessary tests so, desperate to prove that their formula works, Hesse and his partner Dr. Larry Arbogast decide to create a pregnancy in Hesse &#150; the world's first pregnant man!They do not, however have any intention of allowing the pregnancy to go on for more than a month or a month and a half, they just need to prove that their formula works.

Yeah, Last Action Hero and especially Kindergarten Cop showed the world that Arnold was a big action movie star that was not above having a little fun with himself, but a pregnancy??Amazingly enough, however, the movie is much better than you might think. He stars as Dr. Alex Hesse, a scientist working on a new formula that will help create successful pregnancies for women having trouble conceiving.

The second rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club. However, you don't learn these until later in the movie. Instead, you're first greeted by Edward Norton's monotonous voice, which as the movie progresses becomes even more depressing yet funny at the same time. I am Jack's smirking revenge. I am Jack's complete lack of surprise. Norton's character utilizes these sayings at random times throughout the movie and makes himself appear even more deranged and dark.Norton plays a nameless insomniac who seeks solace and fulfillment in his life by attending random support groups for illnesses he does not have and by filling his apartment with useless IKEA furniture. You start to feel sorry for his characters pathetic existence until he meets new people who give his life a sort of twisted meaning. First, is Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter, a fellow tourist of support groups who has some serious mental and emotional issues. Second is Tyler Durden (Pitt). Tyler is everything Norton wishes he could be, fearless and provocative. He can read Norton's character like a book and spits out ideas about anti-consumerism. These two pair up and form an underground fight club where dissatisfied men go to beat each other up in order to regain their masculinity and ultimately their freedom in life. The fights are not about winning, they serve as a device to men to prove to themselves that they can take a hit. The fight scenes can become very bloody and gruesome, making this the ultimate guy movie. The plot takes a turn after this and the original fight club transforms into something much more sinister and rebellious, thanks to Tyler's secret Project Mayhem. The movie ends with a final conflict between Norton's character and Tyler. This reveals just how twisted Norton's personality had become, just before showing his revelation of change.The entire movie is shot in dim light, making some of the setting obscured. We do get a good view of Tyler's house, which is a dilapidated place where not even rats would dare venture. This reflects Tyler's scorn of material objects and his hippie-like attitude. Most of the camera angles are shot at middle range, where we can see the upper half of the actor's bodies, but during the fight scenes the camera pans around in order to view the fight better and also to catch the reactions of the other fight club members. Some exceptions are when Norton's character is lying awake at night; the camera is normally above him, so we can see his whole body and therefore his struggle with insomnia. The first shot in the movie was excellently crafted, a shot of Norton struggling to speak with a gun in his mouth, to give a glimpse of that final confrontation between Pitt and Norton's characters. Overall the director, David Fincher, does not focus so much on the setting or costumes (excluding Tyler, who wears eccentric clothes like red leather pants and fur coats) but rather on the characters actions and especially Norton's wonderfully sardonic narration that will keep you chuckling throughout this 4 star movie.

What you didn't know is that 80% of the cocaine smuggled into America during the 1970's-80's was by one man, George Jung. Jung (Johnny Depp) is the main character in Blow, which is based off of his life and the adventures of being a powerful drug lord. We learn about the high stakes, high reward lifestyle of someone who claims to import that high number of cocaine into America in a certain time period. We follow the ups and downs of a father who isn't able to be there for his child when he wants, and see what its like to be a rich and powerful man with nothing but money on his mind and will not take no for an answer from anyone.Early in the movie we are introduced to George's father (Ray Liotta), a hard-working man who has to earn every penny to survive and provide for his son and wife. He struggles mightily to keep his business afloat, and a constant money flow is also a problem and its something young George worries about. His father tells him that money is not real, something George fails to listen to. George moves out to California and quickly decides that he wants to make as much money as possible, but does not want a 'real' job. He settles for the career of selling marijuana and quickly becomes one of the most popular dealers on the beaches of California. He meets up with an old friend back east, and transports the marijuana back home to almost double his earnings. This career choice does not pan out that well for George and he quickly finds himself being ratted out to the police by his mother after being caught with 400+ lbs. of marijuana. In the one scene in prison, he describes his stint in prison by saying I went into prison with a diploma in marijuana, and came out with a degree in cocaine. This movie will take you on a trip to Colombia to visit one of the biggest and most famous drug lords in history, Pablo Escobar. The realness of these scenes are remarkable, using genuine Colombian people, giving a sense of realness to the film. George and Pablo work together and quickly figure out a scheme to make millions upon the millions they are already making. Also you get to witness the beautiful beaches of California, quick showings of how prison life was like, the beautiful cars and houses he had, and his beautiful wife (Penelope Cruz). The makeup they used to show the aging George is tremendous, and show him from the stages of being a little boy to his days in prison spent wandering around the yard. The terminology was extremely accurate, adjusting with each time period being portrayed throughout the movie. They especially translated the drug slang enough for the common viewer to understand, yet have enough in it to make it real. Being based on someone's life, the sets are very authentic, mostly being shot at the exact location it took place in, in real life.Towards the end of the movie you are introduced to George's little girl, and his struggle with seeing her due to his wife leaving him after getting him arrested during a very dramatic scene. We clearly see how much he cares for her and how he wants to provide for her wit the things his father couldn't, but can George realize that the only thing she wants and needs is him to be around with his love? At some points in the movie you can almost catch yourself feeling sorry, or maybe in the end shedding a tear, but we must remember that George Jung was a criminal dealing a very illegal drug. You truly learn the ins and outs of what that lifestyle is like and how it can tear you and you're family apart. It's a great story told extremely well and acted out tremendously by Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast.

An obvious satire of both the religious right and the liberal left South Park delivers on its promises to upset disgust and outright cry with laughter.
