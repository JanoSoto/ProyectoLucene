Even though I've never always agreed with them, they are probably my all-time favourite movie critics. These two have blasted some of the worst movies of all time. This includes Kazaam, Batman & Robin, and even Bio-Dome! So when I heard Roger Ebert say this about North I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. I hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it. I had to watch it. Seeing Ebert being so harsh on this movie was so hilariously fascinating! So when I found this movie on Netflix, what did I find?Oh.....GOD!!!! THIS is now officially the worst movie I've ever watched. Mostly because of how cold the characters were, and how insensitive it was to so many different racial stereotypes with such offensive jokes! On top of that, there were even some bad jokes referring to pedophilia! I mean, this was 1994! HOW DID THIS MOVIE EVEN GET MADE???? Oh, and I'm not done yet. The plot seems simple at first, with a boy named North divorcing his parents and travelling around the world to find new ones. No harm in that, right? Well, by the end it gets so needlessly complicated. (SPOILERS....if you care that is) North heads back to New York after realizing that he can't find better parents. (Which is weird, since that family with John Ritter, Faith Ford, Scarlett Johansson and Jesse Zeigler was near- perfect for him! I'm not kidding!) So what's with this plot to assassinate him? Is this really necessary? Also, did they need Bruce Willis to appear in the forms of the Easter bunny, several ancestors from around the world, and hell, even a FedEx driver? It makes you wonder how this movie didn't destroy his film career. One more thing I need to talk about, and that's the twist ending. The whole thing turned out to a dream. A DREAM. I mean, this twist has worked in other movies before, but here it just feels cheap. Even though I obviously couldn't care less about the story, I felt cheated!(Spoilers end here.)In conclusion, after watching North, I think Roger Ebert was being too nice to this movie.

So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did.Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't.Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson.The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability.I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say Yep, that's Baraka, Yep, that's Mileena. The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors.Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision.It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did.

Dustin Hoffman gives another winning performance as Louis Dega, a currency forger with an unlimited amount of cash hidden inside his intestines. Starring together for the first and final time, the two men have a particular goal of escaping the hellish, tropical South American penal colony known as Devil's Island.Having seen the original PLANET OF THE APES, Schaffner has a distinctive visual flair which makes him truly underrated as a director. While watching the opening scene in PAPILLON, one must feel the desperation that the prisoners are going through. Stripped of their belongings and nationality, the march around the streets of Paris (or in this case Madrid) is melancholy but at the same time mesmerizing. The film's combination of Old Hollywood epic storytelling with gritty New Hollywood filmmaking is nothing short of remarkable cinema.Despite seeing PAPILLON in all its widescreen glory on DVD, the picture quality is inferior but the 5.1 sound re-mix of Jerry Goldsmith's score is outstanding.

Sounds like a bore, but turns out to be quite the opposite. The back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case. Henry Fonda with his understated play is in the lead of the doubters, supported by strong character actors like Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden or Martin Balsam.The reluctant, some even clearly prejudiced members of the motley jury all look at the case from very different angles, but they are made real by distinguished acting and screenwriter Reginald Rose's crispy dialog, which never misses the mark. Also remarkable is the fact that the battle of the jurors is embedded in a highly believable environment - a hot day, people sweating, emotions getting the better of them, then a downpour outside, there are casual conversations about what's on people's minds in the breaks, restroom scenes which serve further character elaboration. Director Sidney Lumet on his part focuses on making the film as claustrophobic as he possibly can. He uses subtle camera tricks to gradually make the confined space even seem closer to the actors as the film progresses to add to the mounting intensity and the final shots are made from below eye level to reflect the change that has taken place. 12 Angry Men above all is a captivating character study. It is not about solving a crime, but characters confronted with decision making and how they approach it. Exceptional film-making.Side note 12 Angry Men was remade in 1997 with another outstanding ensemble cast headed by Jack Lemmon. A decent film, but no reason to miss the original.

I read through the various 1- star reviews and I have to laugh at the inaccuracies in the reviews as they try to point out inaccuracies or cliché in the movie. I know it is hip and cool to think you are a film snob and all of that but let's get a few things straight.One reviewer mentioned the Omaha Beach scene was unrealistic because at the rate the characters were getting killed, the 1st and 29 Divisions would have been wiped out and unable to continue the war. Well first of all the entire 1st and 29th didn't participate in the first wave, the 16 Regimental Combat Team of the 1st and the 116th RCT of the 29th did, and they were both combat ineffective after the first 10 minutes of the landing.Other complaints mention the entire landing was depicted in 20 minutes when it took several hours to break out from the beach. Um, it is a movie you know? Not a real-time depiction.The movie only shows Americans because Americans were the only soldiers landing at Omaha Beach. The British and Canadians were miles away. I never understand this criticism. The movie is an American movie about an American unit that landed on a beach assigned to Americans. Sorry we can't include every other nation in the Allies. This movie isn't about that. As far as I know, Americans made up the 2nd Rangers and 101st Airborne.To those that complain the Germans were portrayed as bumbling idiots, the Germans made a lot of mistakes in Normandy. They failed to commit their armored reserves in time. They staffed the Atlantic Wall with inexperienced conscripts that were either older or younger than they should have been. Hitler wasn't even made aware of the invasion right away. Even after the breakout the Germans were still convinced the real invasion would be a Calais.Another reviewer complained that the American army would have simply contacted Ryan's unit and ordered the CO to send him home. That would have been impossible for weeks as the Airborne were scattered all over Normandy with no real communication with each other, much less an organized chain of command. Mixed units roaming the countryside was the norm for several days after the landing.Others complain that a squad-sized group could wander around occupied France without being discovered. How is that implausible? Remember the Airborne were mis-dropped all over the region. Small squads moving around undetected was the norm.Radar wasn't a secret in WWII.The P-51 did provide close air-support, even though calling it a tank buster is a stretch. The P-47 is more fitting for that role. But hey, they don't look as cool. Its a movie after all. But to the reviewer below that says P-51s were never used for ground support - you are completely wrong.A lot of people claim the movie demonizes the Germans. I am not sure I see that. The Germans fight hard for their country. I don't see where in this film they do anything remotely evil. They kill the Americans when they get the chance. Wasn't that their job? Weren't they defending their country? It doesn't even really mention Nazis at all. Can someone please point out how the movie shows the Germans as evil? The movie is from an American perspective. Of course the American soldiers are going to think the Germans are evil.I also have to laugh at the people who say the dialog wasn't real because people didn't curse then. Right. Soldiers in WWII didn't say the f word. Um, OK.Pick on the dialog all you want, but seriously most of you are reaching at straws. The movie is about as realistic as you can get and still remain a movie.
