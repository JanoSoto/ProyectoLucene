Meaning, I wasn't cruising all the A.I. websites, scraping up as much info as possible.  I tried to keep my mind fresh.  The previews don't give a hell of a lot away.  Which is a good thing.  I had a very vague idea of what this movie would be about when entering the theater.  And I think that's how Kubrick wanted it to be.  Before releasing the much-anticipated Eyes Wide Shut Kubrick simply showed teaser trailers, setting a montage of images from the film to Chris Isaak's Baby Did a Bad Thing (or something like that).  So I think Spielberg was simply carrying on Kubrick's legacy by keeping A.I. in seclusion.I'm a big Kubrick fan myself, and yes Kubrick would've done a better job at directing this fascinating sci-fi epic.  But this is KUBRICK we're talking about!  He was able to make anything into a masterpiece!  Even Spielberg (who is an excellent, prestigious director with worldwide fame) pales in comparison.  Of course, Kubrick would've given A.I. a darker edge and a more subtle tone.  There are, undoubtedly, some dark moments in this film, so parents shouldn't expect their children to have a jolly time.  You're better off taking your young ones to see Shrek.  But Kubrick would've darkened the atmosphere even more.  As I read from another user, Kubrick was originally going to have the mother (the beautiful Frances O'Connor) be an alcoholic.All in all, I was deeply engaged during many points in the film.  This is just a fascinating, original work and it took a great imagination to conjure up these ideas.  I don't know where people get off comparing A.I. to E.T.--besides the fact that the two titles sound alike and it gives them potential to insert a smart-a** remark.  For example, I read one review with the headline  E.T. it A.I.n't.  I think the two movies completely stand for themselves.  If anything, you can compare this to the tale of Pinnochio--which the film makes references to here and there.  David (Haley Joel Osment), the Mecca (robot) with a heart, wants to become a real boy, just like Pinnochio.  He believes that he'll find a blue fairy that'll transform him into a real-live human being and his mother will love him.  And I love how the scene where David lops off a piece of his Mom's hair actually had significance later in the film.  A quite noble significance, too.  When his mother leaves David stranded in the woods with his robotic bear\/companion Teddy (who sometimes steals the show and is so cute!), he meets his fellow Meccas scrambling for spare parts and the villain (great Irish actor Brendan Gleeson) captures these Meccas, so he can destroy them in front of millions of human beings (who are angry because the Meccas are outnumbering their kind) for entertainment by shooting them out of cannons and using other brutal methods that will keep the crowd cheering. David later on meets Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who is (you've guessed it) a gigolo.  He's also a Mecca and tries to help David on his journey to find the blue fairy that will make him become real.The set designs and art direction are superb and keep you in awe. Spielberg did a terrific job at creating this surreal, futuristic world.  Forget the boring visuals in Pearl Harbor!  You want to see some good visuals? Plese check out A.I.  I guarantee it's like nothing you've ever seen! Absolutely unbelievable!The performances are good all-around.  Haley Joel Osment turns in yet another fine performance that might yell Oscar!  First The Sixth Sense, then Pay it Forward and now this!  Haley, you're going places!  Jude Law is quite entertaining in a quirky and funny performance.The movie runs approximately two hours and thirty minutes, and it does get slow at points (could've used a little more editing), but I was completely fascinated and stunned by this mind-blowing, thought-provoking sci-fi fantasy!  Spielberg's done it again!  I'm sure Kubrick would've had a list of notes (if he can communicate with Spielberg in spirit) to give the director, being the huge perfectionist he is, but after seeing the final product I'm sure Kubrick would've been pleased.  This is a truly remarkable motion picture!
