The film embraces neither extreme position, that the settlers of the Old West were honorable heroes or that the Indians were always simply innocent victims by evil white men. Rather, its a portrait of humanity as a whole and still applies today. As an example, think of the relationship and parallel between the villain Scar and Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards. Both are racists, but both are extremely knowledgeable of the language and customs of the other race. Both were subject to deaths in their family from the other side that led to their attitude, both took wives from the other race.

But I've definitely seen worse! If you love musicals (like me), you will adore this movie (also like me). But if you aren't a big fan of musicals to begin with, don't even think about watching this one! It's the most extravagant, over-the-top, extreme musicals I've ever seen. The costumes are colorful, the sets are colorful, and, most importantly, the personalities were colorful! I had never seen or heard Ethel Merman before seeing this film a few months ago. I personally love her. I don't think her voice is the most gorgeous thing I've ever heard. But it's so powerful, you forget she might not have perfect pitch. She's also a great actress, making me laugh often.Dan Dailey was very nice. I had a slight grudge against him. But it's a long story. Let's just say, Donald O'Connor (a co-star in this, and my favorite actor) was in the process of divorce from his wife, the beautiful, yet intolerable Gwen Carter, while making this. Gwen, being pretty clueless, began dating Dailey during the making of this film. I had a negative view on Dailey for quite some time. But, boy, he can sing! And dance, for that matter! His acting is certainly top-notch. I enjoyed him greatly.Johnnie Ray isn't much. Don't get me wrong. He's a remarkable singer. But his acting is so low-key, he almost doesn't seem to care. He can't act, that's for sure. His character isn't even in it that much. But he needed to be there to add to part of the story. But his bad acting can be overlooked because of his singing.Mitzi Gaynor. What can I say? This girl is great. Her dancing is amazing. And she's a cutie! Her acting is much better than I thought. She manages to sing like Merman in one scene, which is quite a feat! She is so good! I loved her! Marilyn Monroe...hmmm...well...let's just say it's a good thing she's gorgeous! Her singing is alright. Nothing to applaud about. But it's just plain alright. She can't dance. Then again, nobody can dance next to Gaynor and O'Connor! She's not a bad actress. But it's still hard to imagine her and O'Connor as a couple. I think they were both very good looking. But in completely different ways. Monroe's is so prominent, she almost explodes with sex appeal. O'Connor, is more of a boy next door style. But they made them work pretty well. Not the worst one screen couple. But certainly not the best. Monroe was good. But the only reason she standed out form the others at all is from her looks, not talent, in my opinion.I saved the best for last Donald O'Connor. This film shows all of his talents in one movie. His singing is shown in A Man Chases A Girl. His dancing is shown in anything he dances to. He never disappoints me. His acting really good. The drunk scenes had me laughing out loud. Again, begin partnered with Monroe certainly was something we will never completely understand. But it actually worked out alright. Back to O'Connor. I loved his Midnight Choo Choo Reprise with Gaynor. One of my favorites from the film. The A Man Chases A Girl is so great, I recommend to go watch it on Youtube right now! He is actually quite graceful, which was a surprise to me. I would have never thought that the loose-limbed, running-up-walls O'Connor could have grace! But believe me, he does! I personally adore his singing voice. This film showcased it quite well. (For better singing from him, Check out Call Me Madam, also with Merman.) In my opinion, it is O'Connor's performance that single-handedly makes this a great film.So, to summarize, this is a screen-full of greatness! I recommend it very highly. Only, you might want to be careful with little kids about this one. With Monroe involved, there's bound to be something in there. The Heat Wave number is probably the most revealing. Also is Monroe's After You Get What You Want and Gaynor's Paris version of Alexander's Ragtime Band. But other than that, a great, great movie! (Mostly because of Donald O'Connor!)

Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script.You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either. It's just too stupid and ridiculous to the point where instead of anything being funny, it is all just sort of awkward and forced.By the end of this film it takes a turn towards the serious, but fails just as much here as it did when it was a comedy. This is probably due to the fact that I just had no interest in the characters or their story by this point in the film. Everything that had happened up to this point was just so pathetic and forgettable that it built a wall between me and the films emotion. Maybe under different circumstances in which the first half of the film had been engaging, the last half would have really pulled at me heart strings. But in this case it didn't at all and I could have cared less what happened to Jack and all his friends. Nothing about this film seems real. It all feels like actors delivering a mediocre script, all the while wondering what the hell they are doing on this set for such a bad movie. Then they remember, oh right! I'm getting to work with the genius behind The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Only now he's lost his mind and is directing horrible dramadies.Watching a film like this just makes you want to go back and watch the Coppola classics, just to remind yourself that this man is a genius. And that's the thing. With so many incredible films under his belt, Jack can be easily forgotten and we can all pretend like it never happened. Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived. But even if you take Coppola out of the equation, Jack is still an awful movie with no motivation and no heart behind it. Spare yourself the two hours and avoid this film at all costs.

Hell, Coppola could direct Smokey and the Bandit sequels for the rest of his life, but he would still go down in history as one of the greatest directors who ever lived.

Not because it is a good movie, but because this immature, idiotic, brainless mess was directed by the same person who directed The Godfather! How does that happen? How can a man have such an incredible run in the 70's, making literally some of the greatest movies ever made, and then go on to make Jack? But I digress. Jack is the story about a boy who ages four times faster than a normal human being. He lives in his house with his two loving parents and his tutor, played by Bill Cosby. Why Cosby subjected himself to this schlock I don't know, but that's beside the point. After ten years of seclusion Jack realizes he wants to go to school, so his parents reluctantly enter him in public school. It seems the smarter thing to do would have been to put him in private school, but let's face it, there's nothing smart about this film. But anyways, Jack begins to make friends and meet all kinds of new people, his age and older. What is supposed to be a heartwarming tale of friendship and acceptance really just turns into a silly and jumbled mess with a boring story fueled by a poor script.You know your film is set for disaster when it starts with a dumb premise. There's only so many places a premise like this can go, but the film doesn't even make the most out of what little it has to work with. Every situation is predictable, and nothing elicits a laugh, at least not from me. I could blame this on Jack being a kids film, but the problem is, Jack is not a kids film. It's rated PG-13 and has all sorts of innuendo and adult situations. Jack gets his friends adult magazines and they sit in their treehouse talking about erections and women. So I feel like the humor here is supposed to be adult, but I didn't enjoy it at all, but I hardly think a child would either.

Just as ever, Hitchcock knew how to pick the right people for the job. Needless to say that Grace Kelly and James Stewart did a brilliant job. Besides the tension which surrounds the crime, we also get to see the full aspect of a relationship between two major characters which evolves throughout the storyline.

Each frame, each shot, every single detail on the set is adjusted towards perfection. I heard somewhere that all the residue material, after the master editing, was able to fit on a single roll of film... that's simply amazing. If I ever become a true film director (since I'm an amateur one, for the time being), my only wish would be to closely match Hitchcock's skill, since reaching his level of perfection fits in the domain of impossible. 10 points is way to little for Rear Window.

Stuart Gordon successfully put together a film that blended the macabre with the genuinely humorous. In doing so Re-Animator wisely played things dead straight.

This naturally makes the funny moments all the more hilarious and the gruesome stuff properly effective.Jeffrey Combs is of course quite brilliant as Herbert West.

However, it would be entirely remiss to not acknowledge the other fine performances in this film. Bruce Abbott, Barbara Crampton and &#x96; especially &#x96; David Gale all are great in their respective roles. It's unusual to see a low budget horror flick full of good acting but this is one of the things that sets Re-Animator apart from its peers. Of note too are the gory set-pieces. They are very well presented and used in many creative ways. The final zombie attack is a well orchestrated sequence, while the headless mad doctor is well conceived and presented. The moment when this character has a, shall we say, intimate moment with Barbara Crampton is certainly the most notorious moment in the film. But it's a hilarious one. So wrong, yet definitely inspired. Inspired is a generous way of describing the soundtrack. It was certainly 'inspired' by the Psycho theme.

Today, even the most despicable female villains must be sexy enough to compensate their lack of morality, what do they call that? Redeeming qualities? Three-dimensionality? I don't know &#x85; I don't dislike it either, but it became such a cliché now that I really miss these old-school villains, over-the-top and hateful enough to be feared but played with a convincingness that makes you take them very seriously. And 'Baby' Jane Hudson is one of these villains that you can never forget &#x85; My experience with the Hudson sisters' story is quite peculiar, I saw the TV version first when I was 11, I wasn't traumatized but that was a close one, and even though I saw the movie only once, I've never forgotten some particular scenes, nor did the creepiness of Baby Jane's face fade in my memory &#x85; this ugly make-up, this weirdness that contrasted with Blanche's personality &#x85; well, I was disturbed and I was probably more scared of Baby Jane than any other villain, she was creepy in every meaning of the word &#x85;And then, cinematic maturity growing on me, I knew this was only the TV remake starring two real-life sisters, which I thought made the film stronger and more believable &#x85; but that was until I learned that the original starred two rivals, two legendary actresses that notoriously hated each other. So if the first (which was the second) interaction was driven by love, in the 1962 classic, it was a hatred so convincingly disguised as love that you wonder if it was not a true sisterly hatred disguised as love in the film. Not that it adds a level of complexity, but it's a fascinating aspect that sure elevated this film to its cult status Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, two stars whose rivalry is the only thing that opposes them with (however) the same level of vanity that makes them so bitchily appealing.And Jane is sure a bitch with a modern authenticity delightfully combined with campy 'Disney-esque' manners; it's a real-life Cruella, Evil Queen, Medusa that would have scared the hell out of everybody if she wasn't so heart-breaking in her lucid moments. Baby Jane is a tragic figure and the story is about a victim who's not necessarily Blanche, the crippled sister, and an evilness that doesn't just inhabits Jane's twisted mind. The real and forgotten antagonist of the film is time, this implacable enemy that transforms the most beautiful creature into a hideous scarecrow, the cruel passing of time that contaminates hearts with the same cruelty. And time is so unfair it doesn't annihilate youth with the same zealous attention.While Blanche maintained a bit of beauty and dignity, Jane, the fictional Shirley Temple of an era so prehistoric women wore hat high enough to bother the audience, drowned the loss of her stardom in an alcoholic ocean, prematurely ravaging her face until becoming the shadow of herself. The lost beauty is symbolized by that ugly doll with a broken face was she already ugly or did that deformation make her so? In Jane's case, her soul was precociously ugly and time didn't help. So the solution was to freeze her image into the eternal figure of a little child.

Captain James T. Kirk, we learn, is the only person to have ever beaten this no win scenario. How? He reprogrammed the simulator, thereby changing the rules and parameters of the game. As a result, Star Trek 2 had an interesting tension. On one hand we had an egotistical Captain Kirk who repeatedly wins all scenarios, who knows only success, who can't deal with defeat, who always finds a way to break the rules and change the terms of engagement. And on the other hand we had Kirk's confrontation with his own mortality, his learning that with time eventually comes defeat, death and loss. This tension, between life and death, immortality and mortality, daredevil successes and inescapable failures, is epitomised by the Genesis device, a super-weapon in the film which had the power to both create and destroy life.The lesson Kirk learns in Wrath of Khan, a lesson which helped humanise a cast of larger than life superheroes, is undone in Star Trek 3 The Search For Spock. Whilst Kirk's arrogance and ego leads to the death of a character called Spock in Star Trek 2, a pointy eared alien who is also Kirk's best friend, in Star Trek 3 Kirk's devil-may-care arrogance leads to him resurrecting his green blooded buddy. The film's message is that this resurrection comes at a price, that Kirk loses his starship and his own son so that Spock may be reborn, but such losses amount to nothing. His starship is swiftly returned in subsequent episodes (upgraded!) and his son was an annoying brat who we never really got to know anyway. In other words, Kirk beats the Kobayashi Maru and cheats death yet again, but the film tries to pretend otherwise.The 1980s were the golden age of a certain kind of popcorn science fiction movie (Star Wars 5 and 6, Star Trek 2, 3, 4 and 5, The Thing, The Terminator, Mad Max 2, Back To The Future, Aliens, Scanners, ET, Blade Runner, Altered States, The Fly, Videodrome, Tron, Brainstorm, Ghostbusters, Dune, Brazil, Starman, Robocop, Innerspace, Predator, Akira, Critters, Explorers, Daryl, The Last Starfighter, The Quiet Earth, The Final Countdown, 2010, The Abyss, Nausica, Iceman, Short Circuit, Looker, Flight of the Navigator, Bill and Ted etc etc). Most of these didn't take themselves too seriously, and were a stark contrast to New Wave science fiction literature of the late 60s and 70s. Scifi literature itself experienced a resurgence in the mid 80s, with the birth of cyberpunk (William Gibson), a rise in grimy dystopian novels, and a number of great novels by hard SF and speculative fiction authors (Asimov, Clarke, Cherryh, Flynn, Haldeman, Ballard, James Hogan, Niven, Pohl, Kim Stanley Robinson, Carl Sagan, Charles Sheffield, Alan Steele, John Varley). Though the spark was kept alive by various television franchises, in subsequent decades interest in science fiction would dwindle tremendously. The world was now already Sci-Fi, future speculation under capitalism became impossible and technology had become thoroughly banalized.Nevertheless, one of the best of those 1980s popcorn SF movies was Star Trek 2, a film which holds up well today thanks to some fine writing and classy direction by Nicholas Meyer. In comparison, and despite its much larger budget, Star Trek 3 is a mess, actor turned director Leonard Nimoy failing to match Meyer's slick work. His cast turn in good performances, but Nimoy frames (and lights) virtually every shot badly, and he demonstrates no gifts for such a logistically complex project.The film contains a handful of action sequences, but they pale next to the standards set by Meyer, who brought a Hitchcockian sensibility to his set pieces. While Meyer milks the lead ups to conflicts and delights in verbal sparring and battles of wits, Nimoy simply throws money at the screen. The film is so unimaginative that it even climaxes with a literal fist fight. Christopher Lloyd is cast well as a pantomime villain, but unfortunately most of his dialogue is not in English, and even he can't touch the scenery chewing theatrics and cool Shakespeare quoting bad guys of Meyer's films (Meyer directed Star Trek 2 and 6, the best films in the franchise).7.5\/10 - Star Trek 3 spends too much of its running time acting like it's dealing with weighty, portentous material, when in reality it's resurrecting caricatures. Though visually inept, the film nevertheless contains several good shots in which Nimoy had no input.

But between his first sci-fi film THX-1138 and his big hit Star Wars, Lucas made a comedy film (excluding the Star Wars prequel), American Graffiti which was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Set in the early 60s, American Graffiti tells the story of four friends before they go their separate ways on summer night. They is Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) who is having doubts about going to university on the other side of the country who is searching for a blond beauty driving a white Thunderbird and ends up getting mixed up with some greasers. Steve (Ron Howard) is also going to university and in the middle of an on-off relationship with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams), starting with him breaking up with her at the start of the film. John (Paul Le Mat) is a hot-rod racer who accident picks up a young girl, Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) and ends up getting challenged by a rival racer (Harrison Ford).

There is also a really good soundtrack of late 50s and 60s song, fitting for the film.It is a film that shows an idealistic version of the 60s, set in a white, wealthy, middle-class small town where teenagers have nice expensive cars, have no really issues and any delinquency they get up to is minor and tame. The late 50s and 60s was a period of post war affluent in America people were becoming wealthier and having more disposable cash. It was also a period where teenager culture grew and divided childhood and adulthood.The film itself is really a series of a events rather then a narrative structure, they is no real aim in the film. Curt is possibly the closest thing we got to a main character who is has a real decision either go to university on the other side of America or stay, be safe and find a girl. Steve is a jerk, he breaks up with his girlfriend because he wants to screw around at university and then in a later scene pressures her into having sex. John is your typical bad-boy with a heart of gold he is annoyed with Carol at first but he slowly likes her and feels sorry for her. And Terry is your typical movie nerd, who is bullied, used and abused and is socially awkward but he is optimist and wants to get with a pretty (properly the first girl who has shown any interest). John and Terry are the funniest characters in the film they have the funniest lines and the funnier scenarios. Terry particularly is in a scenario many young men have been in, trying to impress a young girl and buying alcohol underage. One of the funniest jokes was expertly parodied by The Simpsons.I do have to question this world the characters live, where it is okay for men to pick up young girls in their cars, a girl allows her younger sister to go with a much other man, a man obviously looking for a girl to have sex with and these teenagers are out all night and their parents do not question it? I am also surprised that American Graffiti has a PG rating because there is a bit of swearing, but I assume this was because the PG-13 and 12 ratings were created.George Lucas was able to make a fast paced film after a slow start.

The other a brusque and loud 100% music snob Barry (Jack Black) who knows better than everyone else, including customers. Especially customers.Rob is in between, he loves his music but seems to respect everyone else's right to like what they like even if he doesn't agree. He seems a low key music snob. Rob's business remains afloat only through the continued business of similar music snobs of varied levels who go out of their way to shop there.The trio often share mixtapes and make impromptu music related lists with such titles as Best Side 1, Track 1s or I would guess Best revenge songs.This is not what the film is about. This is merely a description of Rob and his two staff and the goings on in his record shop called Championship Vinyl.This is actually the part of the film I like best because it is the bit I identify with most.In my 20s I was the loud and obnoxious music (and movie) snob. I knew better than you (still do) and was more than happy to prove it. Mixtapes were my specialty, and if we were going for a drive of more than 15 minutes I would make sure that I had a tape or CD of my own, as I could not stomach listening to the radio or someone else's crappy music that was invariably nowhere near as good as mine.Now in my 30s I am probably more like Rob. I still think I know better, can still prove it on demand (my last mixtape &#x96; now Mix-CD was done a couple months ago), but I am happy to let others like what they like, admittedly behind a visage of well concealed disgust. I don't think I have it in me to be the withdrawn each to their own guy.And don't think that the correlation between me and the guys in this movie hasn't been pointed out before, many, many times.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ That's only the backdrop though. High Fidelity is actually about Rob (who I need to mention somewhere is played by John Cusack so there you go), and his relationship with Laura.Near the start of the film Laura dumps Rob unceremoniously, and due to the long term and intertwined nature of their relationship they remain in reasonable proximity.Close enough to give each other the shits and allows themselves to get wound up over nothing. Laura moves on, Rob stays and mopes, using music as his coping mechanism. He starts by reorganising his vast personal collection in different orders (personal CHECK!), not alphabetically or oldest to newest, but in order of purchase. He then lists the best breakup songs followed by his own personal Top 5 breakups from his past.Rob ultimately decides he must revisit these Top 5 breakup women personally to gain some form of closure. What results is a Schneider-lite version of the various wacky things that must ensue in film when you have a montage of different people, only without the obscure and pointless disorders that Schneider films (and Seinfeld episodes) demanded.Some meetings go well, others not so much.Later on Rob breaks the ice and hooks up with a local 27kg singer-songwriter played by Lisa Bonet, while Laura has moved in with her new man who not so conveniently lives in the floor above Rob's apartment. The best part being that the new lothario is played by an over-the-top Tim Robbins at his greasiest and most faux-sincere.Things get complicated as they must when Laura's situation changes once more only in more dramatic circumstances than a mere break up.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ High Fidelity justifies its existence through the inclusion of much guy banter with a keen eye on the role music plays as (guys) mature and move through life.If you are a guy and have no idea what that sentence above means, then this is merely a rom-com for you. Stay away.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ John Cusack is John Cusack, reliable, sensible and convincing. Like an old warm jumper you know what you're gonna get, and you like it.Jack Black steals the show in a role that he played before he morphed into Funnyman Jack Black. (If I ever had the good fortune to run my own music shop I would go broke in 10 minutes as I would refuse to sell mainstream crap and would forever be pushing obscure CDs that no-one else would want to listen to but me. That is why JB's Barry is an employee, he would similarly fail if running the show.) Tim Robbins is hilarious in his bit part and Iben Hjelje is convincing in the confused and undecided Laura, especially when things turn and she momentarily loses her way.And Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas is actually vaguely likable and dare I say it attractive for a nanosecond despite being one of the more loathsome creatures on the planet.High Fidelity is a movie for music-snobs or people that at least partially identify with the obsessive nature of collectors or fan-dom. I think if you are a go with the flow sort of person not much of this will ring true and you'll be left with a run of the mill rom-com.I like High Fidelity, but I no longer identify with it quite as much as I did 10 years ago.Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 \/ 10.

Mixtapes were my specialty, and if we were going for a drive of more than 15 minutes I would make sure that I had a tape or CD of my own, as I could not stomach listening to the radio or someone else's crappy music that was invariably nowhere near as good as mine.Now in my 30s I am probably more like Rob. I still think I know better, can still prove it on demand (my last mixtape &#x96; now Mix-CD was done a couple months ago), but I am happy to let others like what they like, admittedly behind a visage of well concealed disgust.

High Fidelity is actually about Rob (who I need to mention somewhere is played by John Cusack so there you go), and his relationship with Laura.Near the start of the film Laura dumps Rob unceremoniously, and due to the long term and intertwined nature of their relationship they remain in reasonable proximity.Close enough to give each other the shits and allows themselves to get wound up over nothing. Laura moves on, Rob stays and mopes, using music as his coping mechanism. He starts by reorganising his vast personal collection in different orders (personal CHECK!), not alphabetically or oldest to newest, but in order of purchase. He then lists the best breakup songs followed by his own personal Top 5 breakups from his past.Rob ultimately decides he must revisit these Top 5 breakup women personally to gain some form of closure. What results is a Schneider-lite version of the various wacky things that must ensue in film when you have a montage of different people, only without the obscure and pointless disorders that Schneider films (and Seinfeld episodes) demanded.Some meetings go well, others not so much.Later on Rob breaks the ice and hooks up with a local 27kg singer-songwriter played by Lisa Bonet, while Laura has moved in with her new man who not so conveniently lives in the floor above Rob's apartment. The best part being that the new lothario is played by an over-the-top Tim Robbins at his greasiest and most faux-sincere.Things get complicated as they must when Laura's situation changes once more only in more dramatic circumstances than a mere break up.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ High Fidelity justifies its existence through the inclusion of much guy banter with a keen eye on the role music plays as (guys) mature and move through life.If you are a guy and have no idea what that sentence above means, then this is merely a rom-com for you. Stay away.+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+ John Cusack is John Cusack, reliable, sensible and convincing. Like an old warm jumper you know what you're gonna get, and you like it.Jack Black steals the show in a role that he played before he morphed into Funnyman Jack Black. (If I ever had the good fortune to run my own music shop I would go broke in 10 minutes as I would refuse to sell mainstream crap and would forever be pushing obscure CDs that no-one else would want to listen to but me. That is why JB's Barry is an employee, he would similarly fail if running the show.) Tim Robbins is hilarious in his bit part and Iben Hjelje is convincing in the confused and undecided Laura, especially when things turn and she momentarily loses her way.And Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglas is actually vaguely likable and dare I say it attractive for a nanosecond despite being one of the more loathsome creatures on the planet.High Fidelity is a movie for music-snobs or people that at least partially identify with the obsessive nature of collectors or fan-dom. I think if you are a go with the flow sort of person not much of this will ring true and you'll be left with a run of the mill rom-com.I like High Fidelity, but I no longer identify with it quite as much as I did 10 years ago.Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 \/ 10.

He has two staff, one a mopey withdrawn emo-type named Dick who would like it if you agreed with him but y'know, no pressure. The other a brusque and loud 100% music snob Barry (Jack Black) who knows better than everyone else, including customers. Especially customers.Rob is in between, he loves his music but seems to respect everyone else's right to like what they like even if he doesn't agree. He seems a low key music snob. Rob's business remains afloat only through the continued business of similar music snobs of varied levels who go out of their way to shop there.The trio often share mixtapes and make impromptu music related lists with such titles as Best Side 1, Track 1s or I would guess Best revenge songs.This is not what the film is about.

Anyway, as a vigilante film most of the clichés are here, a seemingly powerless police force, the helpless victims bullied & brutalised, your typical bad guy's & a no nonsense hero who dishes out some justice. Not that much happens here, Bronson & the main bad guy play off against each other for the majority of the film with me sitting there just thinking why don't one just shoot the other dead?

D-Fens is emotionally unstable at best, not accepting any turned down remarks and always questioning people. Even though he may be causing a ruckus to store owners, restaurant managers and gang members to name a few, we still find D-Fens to be a likable character for stating his message in the most effective ways, whether blood is to be shed or rounds are to be fired.A cop on his last day retirement, played by Robert Duvall, is kept on his toes about this situation, and he will follow down any traces. Even though his co-workers and wife do not approve of this and prefer him to take it easy on his last work day, he won't stop until he gets his hands on D-Fens.Society in general can manage to bring out the worst of us, and Falling Down just proves this further. Sure, it's unethical to cause destruction and mayhem to speak your voice of dissatisfaction, but in this film, all the restraints are broken and the city of Los Angeles is receiving its payback to the mental destruction of this man. Not many films will address it like this anymore.
