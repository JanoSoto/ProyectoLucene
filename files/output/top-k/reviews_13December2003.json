This is the same mentally that Redford adopted in the late 60s, an actor whose trademark is always being the pure-hearted purveyor of truth and justice in all he does.  Redford never changed, maybe Denzel will.  What's funny here is Willis playing against his 'Die Hard' self.Oh well, on to 'The Siege'.  Before 9\/11 it would be considered an unremarkable film.  Several other similar films would have to include 'Black Sunday', 'Die Hard 2', and (yet again) 'Manchurian Candidate'.  Terrorism has never been a bigger concern of the trillion-dollar machine known as Hollywood.  The big question remains Who cares?The point made here is the same homily from 'Glory'.  We Americans in authority love to stereotype and be racist and oppressive monsters.  So how do you get a society to hate another society?  Dehumanize the opponent, of course.  No better place is this basic knowledge of sociology displayed than in 'Aliens' where we dehumanize to the point of making the opposition, literally, into aliens.  If only Zwick picked up on that theme.  In the end, we become the very demon we are trying to make other people into.  The American love to hate.Oh, yes, the movie.  There was a movie and it avoided most of the big questions that arise with its topic because of probable PC worries.  I guess they didn't want to worry about the stereotype of 'True Lies' and risk offending anyone.  In that perspective, 'The Siege' isn't a movie.  It was a load of baloney.Overall, to all you political aficionados, I say skip this movie.  A filmmaker is part politician and Zwick needs some American history lessons first, 'Last Samurai' has proved that big time.  1.5 out of 5.
