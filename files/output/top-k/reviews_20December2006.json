Lucky because it was shown in the director's cut version. More than 200 minutes. And boy, what 200 minutes was that now...You have to get used to the rhythm of this movie. It goes the way it wants to go, which means Carefully. Slowly. Treebeard-style. Which is unique and great in one. Other movies about raids and battles transfer the impression, warriors were just running through one battle after the other and the war was just one hell of a rush. Not this one here. This one takes it's time to develop the different characters, the whole style and it loves to play with the Japanese environment and background. I'm fond of ancient Japan so I enjoyed the long takes.Because everything evolves so steadily you suddenly find yourself in big tension, when the fighting starts. And you actually feel sad for every one who falls in battle. You can relate to the villagers. You know the plan of the town. And most of all, you wanna fight amongst the seven Samurai.And when the credits start rolling over the screen, I just didn't want to stand up. I wanted to go on with the guys. I was in a totally different world. Ever since I'm waiting for the director's cut on DVD but in Switzerland, it doesn't seem to exist. But I won't give up! This masterpiece is a sure investment, for your time as well.And if you liked this one, check out RAN as well. Also Kurosawa but in colour.

This is about what really happens if you wait to the last minute to get your kid a toy he's always been wanting. What happens when all Christmas Eve all you do it try to go looking for that one toy, only to find it's not so easy to please your kid as you thought it was and the true meaning between the love of a father and son. This is a wonderful movie with those classic characters we've all met in our life one time or another. It is also funny and there are points were your heart does start beating really fast just because of the suspense. It is wickedly entertaining and there is never, I repeat, NEVER a dull moment during the movie. And if you're worried about Arnold .S...don't worry. His acting is decent enough and he sure as hell won't ruin the movie for you. At least not that much if you really hate him. This is a very underrated Christmas movie, up there with Home Alone.

The fact that Morricone wrote the music before Leone started shooting the film fortifies my opinion that this movie had two directors, working like one.But even the best painter is powerless without paint. Luckily, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and, above all others, Charles Bronson had the specific look Leone needed to create this epic.It is a simple and yet impressive way, Morricone and Leone cook up the tension in this tale. First, the main characters are presented in a breathtaking way. Cheyenne freezes with his appearance a whole cowboy stop. Frank exposes some of the most devastating cruelties ever to be carried by a villain. Jill, the flower in the wilderness. And then of course Harmonica, starting with killing three western legends and going on by mocking even scary Cheyenne.After the characters are portrayed, the interaction starts. And step by step, more relations are exposed or created. Just the first meeting of Cheyenne, Jill and Harmonica is the most thrilling moment I have experienced with a movie so far. The bouncing shadow of Bronson's hat, covering and revealing his unique face while he plays, silent and calm as a monk, his harmonica always snatches me like the freezing squall of a blizzard.One thing, everyone in the film loses just in the right moment The mystery. You never know, why Harmonica chases Frank, just until the end. You never know, why Cheyenne becomes a noble guy, just until the end.

And if it so happens that you are an absolutely devoted fan of deep-brain-cell-destruction-while-in-a-totally-drunken-state-of-mind, a copy of jackass, jackass the movie 1,2 or (even 3 someday?) might be your choice of the moment. All of the above are movies or series that I enjoyed watching a lot, depending on whether being up for something intelligent, entertaining, sad, or just stupid time-wasting. But  Die Blechtrommel is just nothing . No Sense. No enjoying. No crying. No nothing. Please burn every copy. It is more senseless than watching 2 hours of your local station's test signal or a digitally transmitted picture of a fireplace. My only relief right now would be to see the people mainly responsible for that movie burn in the just mentioned place right now, really. Or at least in a nice and secure place where they are being helped to cure their diseases.

Once there Chrissy (Dana Kimmell) becomes reacquainted with her boyfriend Rick (Paul Kratka) who is also staying with them. However there is someone else there, someone uninvited who wants to gatecrash the party, it's the homicidal maniac Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) who intends to carry on his killing spree...Directed by Steve Miner Friday the 13th Part III is pretty much the same as any other Friday the 13th film which in itself isn't a particularly bad thing as I rather like the series. Any 80's slasher fan worth their salt will know what to expect from the script by Martin Kitrosser & Carol Watson, a group of teenagers gathered in an isolated location being killed off one-by-one until only one survives & in that respect Friday the 13th Part III doesn't disappoint. So why do I like this? Well I like Jason as a film character, he's probably my favourite horror killer, the character's are slightly better than usual with OK back-stories, it moves along at a nice pace, there's a decent body-count & the murders are pretty cool although it's a shame they had to suffer at the hands, or should that be scissors, of the censors... There isn't really much else to say other than if your looking for a slasher film that ticks all the right boxes as far as the slasher sub genre goes then you could do a lot worse than Friday the 13th Part III that's for sure. This is also the first time that Jason wears the now infamous hockey mask although he takes until about halfway through he film to do so.Director Miner does OK although the big point of interest as far as Friday the 13th part III goes is that it was originally shot in 3D & it is to date the only Friday the 13th film to be shot in the full 2.351 aspect widescreen ratio, so make sure you pick up that DVD version of it! Obviously the 3D effect is lost when viewed today although I thought it was quite fun to spot all the scenes where the 3D gimmick would have been used, from washing line posts shoved into the audiences face to juggling fruit, from a yo-yo to a chained fist shooting out of the screen & then there's the kills which use it as well like when Jason shoots a harpoon into someones eye, when he sticks a pitchfork trough someones throat & a strange bit when he crushes someones head & their eyeball pops out! While the kills have obviously been trimmed there's still some decent gore, someone is cut in half with a machete, someone is impaled on a hot poker, there's a slashed throat, someone has a meat clever stuck in their chest, there's knitting needles in the back of peoples heads, there's a knife stuck through a girls back which ends up coming out of her breast & someone has their hand cut off.With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 Friday the 13th Part III is well made & is certainly a lot better than most of the straight-to-video horror film crap that's been released lately. A special mention goes to the absolutely awful opening & closing credits theme music which is hideously bad! Thankfully the music used during the film itself is more fitting. The acting was alright, the girls are suitably good looking & that's what counts in films like this.Friday the 13th Part III is admittedly just another slasher in a limited & overcrowded sub genre but the Friday the 13th series is my favourite horror film franchise & I actually like all of them, anyway it's not for everyone but Friday the 13th fans like myself will lap it up.

Heck, I'd place it only behind Pulp Fiction and Ed Wood. Its impressive that a film about the 70s could come to define the 90s as well. Even more impressive is how the film takes potentially campy material (the 70s have long been the source of ridicule) and manages to make it serious. I have absolutely no interest in the disco era and only a passing curiosity for the golden age of porn, but I was captivated throughout. The film works so well because of its believable and multi-layered characters. Few filmmakers can take such flawed protagonists working in a generally sleazy industry (porn than is much different than it is now) and make them entirely sympathetic. Its just as much about the era as it is a character study. Paul Thomas Anderson has made some other good films, including Magnolia, but this is by far the best work he's done.The ensemble cast is all very impressive. Burt Reynolds received a lot of attention for his role, mainly because he hadn't delivered such a good performance since either Deliverance or the original The Longest Yard. It should have started a comeback just as Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta, but he hasn't seemed to live up to this promise yet. I always thought that Mark Wahlberg was even better, mainly because he has to make such a massive character transformation and manages to pull it off. No one saw this skill in either of them at the time. The rest of the ensemble cast is superb. The cast is made up of some of the finest talents working in film today (Reynolds, Wahlberg, John C. Riley, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Chedle, Heather Grahm, amongst many others). Special mention must go to the soundtrack. It doesn't seem like an attempt to sell the soundtrack album, but all the songs perfectly match the action on screen in a way only Goodfellas also did.If P.T. Anderson continues on with the potential he's shown, he'll certainly be considered one of the greats. This is a masterpiece that unfortunately got overlooked in a year that included the good L.A. Confedential and the incredibly overrated Titanic. If you haven't seen it yet, see it now as its one of the definitive films of the decade.

Daniel gets attacked by bullies and is saved by an unlikely martial arts master. Daniel learns there is more to the martial arts than fighting.Being a martial artist myself, I can heavily relate to this movie. While I didn't' learn from an unlikely master, I did learn over my years of training the spiritual aspects of the martial arts.The fights scenes are simple and not over the top. The acting is done very well, and the coming of age theme is done very well.I've many of the types of people in the film in real life. The martial arts master who promotes physical force, instead of using your mind.

This film spoke to me on a number of levels.Having grown up in the 60's I understand the culture at the time and do not doubt for a moment that good people committed violence in the name of the greater good. Those who made that mistake paid a huge price, an example of which this movie illustrates. (Lest the younger among us get the wrong impression, most rebels in the 60's did not resort to violence, and, in fact, abhorred it along with the violence of the Vietnam war itself). The coming of age of the River Phoenix character Danny\/Michael is poignantly presented without resorting to over-romanticizing. The story isn't flat out rebellion, or coming to grips with one's own sexuality, or even Danny\/Michael simply discovering who he is. It's a combination of all. Added to this is his extraordinary love and loyalty he has for his family. This last element is sadly missing in many coming of age movies, where the parents and family are often seen merely as annoying obstructions to forging out and becoming one's self. Finally, there is the story of the parents coping with the growing up of their children and their eventual departure from the family. This plot is not given much play in Hollywood movies, perhaps because it is seen as too ordinary to be of much dramatic interest. How wrong. The family breaking up is one of the most significant events in a lifetime, for parents as well as children. I believe the central scene, which only lasts for a few moments and which others here on IMD have commented on, is the one in the coffee shop with Annie\/Cynthia and her father, from whom she had been estranged for many years. In this scene, all the above plots converge in a nuclear explosion of emotion which will send you reeling. It is one of the more memorable scenes in movie literature -- spare, understated, and masterfully acted. Get the hankies ready.These plot lines are explored with sensitivity and insight. Overall the movie has a good heart. Its minor flaws are easily overlooked. A fine movie, I would think with near universal appeal.

But one of the good things about seeing the film at this point is that I got to have a lot of laughs with the sketches I'd already seen and liked (some of them, like the Parrot sketch- albeit classic in a kind of vaudevillian way- aren't necessarily my favorites). I really enjoyed the ones too I hadn't seen, like the Marriage Guidance Counselor sketch where Michael Palin is in one of his funniest bits to date. Other classics I really do love, especially on repeat viewings, are the Lumberjack song, with it's always expectable joke funnier than the first, Killer Cars, Man with Tape Recorder Up His Nose, Expedition to Mount Kilmanjaro, and especially the Self Defence Class (maybe my favorite, albeit it might've worked a little better on the show). Flasher too. Sure, it might be a little disconcerting to see some sketches that didn't make it in, or that there are some in there that shouldn't be. It's also a little lackluster- at least in comparison to the later Python films- due to Ian McNaughton being a TV director and more used to the point-and-shoot style of TV as opposed to the camera almost being in on the joke too with Holy Grail and Meaning of Life.
