I especially loved Geoffrey Rush as the Queen's special advisor. And Cate Blanchett was the perfect choice for the title role.

It evoked many questions and made people who were paying attention to the movie face their beliefs on God, science, and the possibility of alien life.  The acting was wonderful for the most part.  Despite a few corny, predictable moments, the movie was very enjoyable.  However, did the ending remind anyone else of Flight of the Navigator (1986)?  The protagonist makes contact with an alien and returns to earth and wonders if the trip actually existed, but then a small but significant piece of evidence proves the trip.  It may be a stretch, but I think it's a pretty valid connection.

Where was the awe, the emotion, the wonder, the divine inspiration?The mixture of CGI and traditional animation was as fluid as oil and water. It reminded me of an old Mad Magazine satire that showed Donald Duck cowering naked in a realistically rendered henhouse. The contrast was almost embarrassing. The story either went too slowly or too quickly. I never really made an emotional investment in any of the characters.The story jumped from one Money Scene to the next Money Scene with awkward transitions. The distortion of the legend making Moses the Pharaoh's adopted son instead of grandson was not believable. Why would a mother, especially the pharaoh's wife, with a very young son of her own so readily adopt another, and a stranger at that? It was just a plot device to trump up a sibling rivalry, and not a particularly interesting one at that. Moses came off as being too tortured and not heroic or enough. In a movie like this, belief (in the divine) is supposed to make you strong. And God, who is supposedly the point of all Bible stories, was reduced to a cameo role. The character animation was annoyingly angular, with eyes ridiculously far apart and on top of the forehead. And the clanging mixture of flat American (Pfeiffer, Bullock), regal British and traditional Jewish accents was particularly jarring. The songs were pretty much forgettable.  Well, I could go on and on, but you get the idea.Katzenberg could say all he wants about how this is a film for adults and he is breaking new ground in animation and making the world safe from Disney mush. But if the movie fails to find an audience, it's not because he aimed too high, but because he missed his mark.
