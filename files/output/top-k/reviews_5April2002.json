This film shows her as she is just starting her writing career, where she is played by Kate Winslet, and also when she is ending her career due to the swift onset of Alzheimer's, where she is played by Judi Dench. In the early years, Iris is a wildly energetic free spirit, sleeping with anyone and doing anything she chooses to. During this time she meets her future husband and fellow Oxford professor John Bayley (played by Hugh Bonneville in the early years and Jim Broadbent later), who is both incredibly awkward and incredibly smitten. The later period of the film starts just before the first signs of the disease begin to appear, and shows the effect of it both on her and on her husband. John's devotion to Iris in the early period of the film is critical in understanding and believing his devotion in the later period, when small good moments shine through the overwhelming difficulties.Besides the basic story, the presentation is of both periods of Iris's life almost simultaneously, cut together everywhere. I noticed one particular cut where someone is going through a door, and as is normal practice the cut was between the person starting to open the door on one side to them coming through the door from the other, but in this case the place, person, and time were all different -- cool.The performances were all very good, with three of the primary characters up for Oscar consideration. I wasn't as blown away by Dench's performance as I expected to be, but with her expectations tend to be pretty high.Lastly, I'll have to mildly agree with Roger Ebert that the story left me wanting to see something of the middle part of Iris's life, when she was at the height of her career.

However, his latest release, Panic Room, isn't what most would expect from him. Unlike his previous films, the plot of this one is considerably straight-forward. Jodie Foster plays Meg Altman who, as a single mom having recently settled a divorce with her wealthy husband, moves into an expensive four-story brownstone in the Upper West Side of Manhattan along with her 11-year-old daughter, Sarah. The brownstone looks to them like the ideal place to live - equipped with all the modern-day conviences. It even has a panic room that encases you behind a steel door in the event someone were to break in. Now that's protection!What they didn't expect though was that three burglars - Junior, Burnham, and Raoul - had come prepared to rob the house that night. They're looking to find a safe, one that the original owner of the house had kept hidden in the floor somewhere, that contains millions in bonds. They break inside, surprised to find the the new owners had already moved in. Meg wakes up and finds there are thieves in the house, and immediately runs to wake up her little girl. The mother and daughter quickly lock themselves up inside the panic room, narrowly escaping capture. Unfortunate for them, even though they're safe, the emergency phone with which to call the police is dead. And of course, as you may have guessed, the safe that these crooks are looking for happens to be inside in the panic room.Burnham, the burgular whom Forest Whitaker plays, built the house and knows every niche and cranny of the place. He informs Junior and Raoul that it is impossible for them to penetrate the steel door. He says that in order for them to get inside the panic room, they have got to somehow get the woman to come out. This incites a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse between Meg and the men who threaten the lives of both her and her little girl. Its all very intense.Panic Room is somewhat different from David Fincher's other movies. According to the director, the film is a popcorn flick. There are no great, overriding implications, he claims. It's simply about survival.Even so, Fincher still manages to deliver the goods as usual - displaying the same stylish cinematography he showed in Fight Club, as well as his knack for keeping people on the edge of their seat as he did with Alien 3 and Seven. Not only that, but the film also features a terrific and energetic performance from screen veteran, Jodie Foster. Altogether, I recommend this film to suspense fans who are looking to see something different for a change. This one is definitely worth a look.

As the film opens we see him working very diligently and effectively at Starbuck's, organizing the sweeteners, busing the tables, and delivering the coffees. He complements everyone on having made an excellent choice. Then he is reminded that today is the big day and that he needs to go to the hospital, where his daughter is born. When the mother runs away, he is left with the baby, who he names Lucy. While he is overwhelmed with the task of raising a daughter (which we see by the camera swirling around him to show his confusion), he gets some help from a neighbor (played very well by Dianne Wiest in a small role) and manages to raise her. The film goes through these early years quite quickly to get to the heart of the story, which is when Lucy begins to surpass her father's intelligence. The authorities decide that perhaps Sam is not such a good father after all, and he is forced to fight to keep her. He doesn't really understand what's going on, but manages through luck and determination to get a lawyer, played by Michelle Pfeiffer. This part of the film, which needed to be edited a little more aggressively, becomes a bit too manipulative and movie of the week for what would normally be my taste, but it is done so well that it worked for me, and I didn't mind.Penn's acting is amazing, with only one brief moment when I saw his intelligence flash out from behind his character. You really can't appreciate what he does here from watching the clips or the movie trailer. Dakota Fanning, who plays Lucy, is also quite good most of the time, especially considering her age (7 in 2001). Pfeiffer is acceptable most of the time, but is obviously acting (or attempting to) in her biggest scene. I'll also mention that Brent Spiner has a very short part in one early scene (so small I expected him to be uncredited, but he is listed), and Laura Dern does good work when she appears later in the film.And lastly, I should say that the soundtrack is made up of remakes of Beatles songs, which also fits into the story because Sam falls back on the lyrics of Beatles songs when he doesn't know what else to to (like when he names his daughter after the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds). Surprisingly, I do not believe that All You Need is Love is used, because that would perhaps summarize the message of the movie.

I wasn't impressed.  I've been an animation fan since childhood, but i had become more demanding in what I expected from an animated feature.  Disney and Dreamworks presentations were some of my favorites.  I hadn't realized that some anime presentations were full length movies until my 7 year old was kept home with the flu, and my wife rented some cartoons to keep him happy while I fed him chicken soup.  My son fell asleep, (the flu will do that to a kid) but I kept watching.  The breathtaking artwork, and incredibly beautiful music had me hooked.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  I watched the movie 3 times before we turned it in.  Needless to say, I've been looking for anime movies ever since, and though I have found quite a few that are either dubbed in English, or have English subtitles, I haven't found one that comes close to Princess Mononoke.No movie is perfect however, and I feel I must include the downside to this film.  The characters are not what I would call fully developed.  I find myself wondering about who these people are, and what makes them tick. This makes the story a bit confusing as it has many characters which are important, and doesn't focus on any of them long enough for you to get to know them.  I am not extremely familiar with Japanese people, but I feel from watching many anime films that a lot is lost in the translation, primarily due to the differance in our cultures.  One other thing to note is that although this film has a generally wholesome attitude, there is some very graphic violence involved.  If you are concerned, watch it before you show it to your kids, or watch Kiki's Delivery Service instead.If you've never thought very highly of japanese animation, give this movie a chance to change your mind.  I'm still not an anime fanatic.  There is a lot of it that is frankly not worth watching in my opinion, but there are a few gems like this one that makes it worthwhile to keep looking.

Showtime is by no means a spoof.A spoof is meant to deliver alot of laughs, and they should be clever too...Showtime provides you with stale laughs, and an extremelly poor plot, but it's a Spoof isnt it?

Though i would say there was a waste of talent here, and Eddie Murphy was making me pretty much sick, he is so over.Robert Deniro barely did a good job either, i liked him in MEET THE PARENTS but how could he accept such a poor script? A script that had absolutely no support? I mean honestly around 25% of the film has a few chuckles in there, the other 75% you would just be wandering what the hell this is all about! I personally dont reccomend you wastch this, the film is short, stale and terribly plotless.ACTING The acting was nothing more than annoying, Roberty Deniro would always have that same facial expression, note that him ageing hasn't helped his acting either. As for Eddie Murphy he stole most Chuckles, yet i found his presence very annoying too, i mean where has he been all this time?ACTORS Good talent is used in the film, even though they dont tend to take advantage of that.

The whole film was set in a city\/dock sort of setting and it wasn't pretty at all. I found the camera work to be absolutely normal, they could have done something different, but it was same old, same old.COMEDY The Comedy in Showtime is Thin.

Spielburg has made a least three or four films that I would rate higher then E.T.,but in terms of a emotional investment,this one is peerless in his canon,invoking laughter,tears and everything else between as we follow little E.T.'s odyssey to return home(a popular kid flick motif also found in,among others,The Wizard of Oz,Lassie Come Home,The Homecoming of Benji,etc.) Years later,the film still has not lost none of its magical glory and in this new version there is very much to savor;the remarkable performance by Henry Thomas as the alien's soulmate Elliott;the equally impressive turns by Robert McNaughton and 6-year old Drew Barrymore as Elliott's siblings;also included in this new version is a very short cameo appearance by Harrison Ford as Elliott's school principal;the majestic sweeps of one of John Williams' best scores(for which he won the Oscar that year in 1982 for Best Musical Score);Dee Wallace's achingly real performance as the kids' vulnerable single mom(To the question of why Dee Wallace never became a bigger star after the huge success of E.T.and other movies she did after that remains a mystery to this day);PeterCoyote's chilling portrayal as the government agent out to capture the alien and to separate the bonding between E.T. and Elliott is one of the most scariest parts of the movie;and the isolated sequences that were deleted(the bathtub scene,the classroom frogs,Elliott kisses the girl in the science class,the flying bikes,etc.)that will continue to delight moviegoers to generations to come.

After the dire 6th Day, which left a bad taste in my mouth, I felt that a similar flop from Arnold would mean a similar standard but no, it was pretty good at times. The film has had a lot of press attention that has obviously had a negative effect on the gross but I see no reason to have delayed it because of some sparse similarities with the sept 11 tragedies, terrorist films are so common I don't see why this was delayed and other flicks like for instance Air Force One and Passenger 57 were not temporarilly taken off the shelves. The fact that terrorists are involved and that Ahh-nuld plays a fire fighter are where any similarities end. It would never have been accused of cashing in on the disaster as it was shot months before and it is truthfully a whole different aspect of terrorism. When all is said and done though and the dust has cleared over a lengthy wait what you get is a fairly routine action thriller. All the wait and a big let down for most people including the most ardent of Arnie fans, reflecting on its dismal box office display not yet recouping even half of its 85 million budget after about six or seven weeks and not likely to either. Anyway the film itself has a standard plot, Gordy Brewer witnesses his wife and sons death in an explosion, and is the only man to have seen the terrorist's face. He is known as the wolf and is fighting for a cause to help innocent Colombians. The film is really a showcase for some great pyrotechnics and generally lots of loud banging explosions. It also features some second rate cgi affects and also Arnold in a jaccuzi with a cgi waterfall behind him amongst other things. The start of the film is great, an introduction to Gordy a heroic firefighter in the middle of a burning building. The first half hour or so of the film has a good thrillerish feel, nicely paced with the explosion and Arnold showing some of his best acting work by looking upset when his family die, his acting in this film is probably his best ever but we all know that a Nic Cage or Tom Cruise etc would have shown a more convincing grieving father. The fact that Arn shows a slight lack of emotion to such a dreadful situation undermines the rest of the flick slightly but this is true of most films with an action star as opposed to an actor. As soon as he is captured in a Colombian prison the film drops well paced plotting and turns it into an action attack, this was a little disappointing but the action scenes, while lacking in style, where big and brash, the 85 million being put to good use. The film also features a plot twist that I saw coming from a mile off but actioners are never known to be clever. This film does take itself very seriously and Arnold is in good form, this film is a worthy edition to his CV and is his best role as an everyman kind of guy. Truthfully though, I and most others like Arnie as a Cyborg or as a wise-cracking one man army in films which are tongue in cheek and mindlessly destructive.Anyway the supporting cast are quite good, Cliff Curtis is okay as the wolf and Elias Koteus as the somewhat dirty FBI agent. Also the stunningly attractive Francesco Neri is good as the wife of the Wolf. All in all the opening firefighting scene and the last fifteen minutes stand out in an otherwise average action flick. Amazingly as well, as many have pointed out, Arnie never uses a gun once which is good, and this film also does have some gruesome moments such as a particularly nasty death scene involving a snake. Overall an passable enough way to spend your afternoon unless Blade 2 is showing at the same time of course.

A LOT to talk about afterwards.  If the sign of a great film is that it provokes heated discussions, then Shallow Hal was probably THE greatest film of 2001.  But of course it isn't, and it isn't.  Probably the reason it's such a good conversation piece is that it's deeply confused, down to its very atoms (one example among many Hal at the start is both insensitive to any virtues except physical beauty, AND wrong about what constitutes physical beauty, but the film treats these two faults as though they were one, possibly because it's just as guilty of the second charge as Hal is) - and it's hard to resist the impulse to dig through the rubble of mixed messages on the film's surface in order to uncover yet more rubble.  Even if I'm wrong about the content, though, what comes across most strongly is the Farrelly brothers' deplorable lack of cinematic and storytelling skill.  Yes, they're in many ways inspired writers, but they need to be placed under the command of a good director in order for their talents not to be wasted, and they're NOT good directors.  (There's Something About Mary was pretty sloppy, too.  I haven't seen anything else they've done.)The film has a decent ending, so we're liable to forget just how bad the rest of it was.  But cast your mind back and recall just how DULL everything was before Hal received his gift from the self-help guru.  The deathbed scene that explained why Hal was so shallow was contrived and tedious (it's not easy to be as tiresome as this in just two minutes), as was the scene in the lift, and neither they nor anything in between them was in the least bit entertaining.AFTER the lift scene, it's no longer boring; it is, instead, excruciating torture.  Hal looks at unattractive women, some plain, some truly hideous, and sees them as beautiful (correction he sees more or less ordinary specimens of the Maxim magazine type, which he mistakenly thinks of as being beautiful; I'll agree that they're not UNattractive), so when Hal chats these women up, there's a constant dissonance between what he thinks is going on (his comments about appearance are obvious allusions to her beauty, the stares he's getting from others are stares of envy), and what everyone else thinks is going on (his comments about appearance are either cruel jokes or misguided attempts at charity, the stares he's getting from others are stares of bewilderment).  It's like watching one of those contrived cross-purposes conversations that only ever happen in movies (usually, for some reason, in restaurants) - except that this one goes on and on for over an hour.  Hal is negotiating rapids with a blindfold on.  Sooner or later he will crash into something, and the longer he doesn't, the more unbearable the tension becomes, and the greater the affront to our common sense.This is not the KIND of tension that can be used to good effect; in fact, it isn't used to any effect, except to make us uncomfortable.  When the crash comes, and there are no longer any cross-purposes left, it's a blessed relief.  That's why the merely competent conclusion seems better than it is.It's interesting, in a kind of a way, that there's just ONE truly gorgeous woman in the entire film (out of, I don't, fifty?) a guest at the party in the very last scene, the one in a blue dress who's standing a bit to the left as Hal and Rosemary get in the car.

Chisco Amado is the writer and is a key character due to the fact that something will happen with him and Dani (Ramallo), and that is seen due to a phrase.  There are unforgetable phrases.  When Nico says I must have sex before 17.  Superb. Incredible.  Enjoy.

Jack has made known that he wants his ashes scattered in the water at Margate, and the general structure of the film is his friends and his son Vince (Ray Winstone) on their way there, reminiscing about their lives. Jack's now widow, Amy (Helen Mirren), does not make the trip but is a major character nonetheless. This present day story is intercut with flashbacks of the characters at various stages of their lives, including Jack and Amy's first meeting and scenes from the war, when the characters are played by different actors, and more recent scenes when the same actors (including Caine, who obviously doesn't appear in the present) are seen. The film is comfortable in dealing with the interconnections of life and death and between people, and while there is a surprise or two along the way, the journey seems to be the main point. Of the characters I have not already mentioned, Bob Hoskins as Ray was definitely my favorite. The accents in the film are fairly thick and American viewers will miss some words. It's not bad enough to be a significant issue, but if I were to watch this on DVD I would probably turn on subtitles the first time I watched it.

And I have to say, I was somewhat disappointed. The first half of the movie was extremely boring and seemed to go on forever, until the movie finally picked up at the last half hour. Dee Wallace is looking more depressed than ever, but then again I've never seen her in a film where she didn't. Christopher Stone is definitely not one of the better actors out there. And what was the purpose of the 2 warewolf hunters? ( At least I think thats what they were. ) But the performances are descent all in all. The warewolves are nothing special either, they somewhat resembled the ones in  An American Warewolf in Paris  but were not as big. The direction and script is what saves this film, without a doubt.

I was watching the indie spirit awards on IFC and I saw that it was nominated for a couple things, including best actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, so I decided to check it out. Lets just say my first reaction was wow.The story is about a teenage boy, haunted by a daylight hallucination. A demonic bunny rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end on October 30, 1988. He is driven to do things he wouldn't normally do, like flood his school or burn down a Love yourself guru played by Patrick Swayze. Not normally a role you would see him in. Throughout the story we meet the girl (Jenna Malone) Donnie falls in teenage adolescent love with, Grandma Death a woman who wrote a book called the Philosophy of Time Travel, An English teacher (Drew Barrymore) trying to get through to her troubled students, a chemistry teacher (Noah Wyle) who tries his best to explain time travel to Donnie without getting fired, and best of all, Frank, who we aren't really sure actually was a person of just a figment of Donnie's imagination. There is a point where they are sitting in a movie theatre and Donnie asks, Why are you wearing that stupid bunnysuit? His chilling reply is  Why are you wearing that stupid mansuit? Donnie then says Take it off. And we see a boy with a ruined eye. It makes us think. Why do we wear Mansuits? The diologue fits well in it's minimal amount, and the scenes with no diologue are even better. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal transforms his character magnificently, changing his voice from normal when he is awake, to scared childlike when he is hypnotized or talking to Frank. Jena Malone strives to meet his character, but doesn't quite get there. But then she isn't in it enough to make much of a difference. The conservative parents voting for Bush and Donnie's sister voting for Dukakis represent a tension between generations, and simple messages written on the white board on the fridge (Where's Donnie? or Vote Dukakis) leave us wondering, what was that for? Director Richard Kelly wrote this as a teenager and as a teenager myself, it is inspiring to learn that we can create beautiful works that traumatize the mind and relate to our lives and experiences. I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind, or wanting to confuse the hell out of themselves.

Granted, it looked like another silly horror\/stalker flick from the previews way back when, but I kept an open mind as I sat down to watch this latest suspense\/thriller.While it wasn't spectacular, I did have some fun with it.I think that came from the fact that the leads were enjoyable, and there were some entertaining and funny moments throughout all of Rusty Nail's stalking.  It's the timeless story of two kids driving cross-country, and why it's not a good idea to mess with people too much.  It's also a good lesson in that when one gets busted for something like this, it's not a good idea to tell the recipient of the practical joke what an idiot they are for falling for the gag.What we're left with is an angry truck driver who remarkably has more leads and connections on these kids that the Psychic Friends Network could only dream of having.  Therein lay the problem for me.  Rusty Nail knew remarkably too much about these characters, and I kept wondering why is it that he never had to report in to anybody, like his bosses for example.  Don't truck drivers have to keep a schedule, and aren't some trucker agencies going to be more than a little unhappy if these schedules aren't met?  I don't know of too many truck drivers who have the luxury of postponing their deliveries to go chase a few practical joking kids all over the country for a few days.  Maybe that's a benefits package I simply haven't heard of.Regardless, some of the scenes were entertaining (the fate of the ice truck early in the film comes to mind), there were funny moments, a decent tense spot or two, and given the circumstances and how far one is willing to just sit back and relax with the movie, some of the situations concocted managed to work.
