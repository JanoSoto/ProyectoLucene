(It even says so in the goofs section; you can look for yourself!) What is also great about this movie is that the filmmakers chose to tone down the blood\/gore (except for the hospital scenes) and language enough to get a PG-13 rating. This feels like a kids' movie in comparison to Saving Private Ryan and the like. Just be careful not to get the R-rated director's cut. This movie also has one of the most powerful and emotionally overwhelming film scores I have ever heard.

But William Holden?! What a stupid casting decision! Plus, this character was supposed to be amoral--so who do you root for in this film?! The Southerners are often portrayed as rather unlikable and mean and the Northerners are generally shown as being rather bland and stupid.While Richard Widmark and William Holden aren't the greatest or most familiar Western stars, they were excellent actors and with these two and a rather substantial budget, this still should have been a much more compelling picture. Even with morally questionable and unlikable characters and miscasting of Holden, the film should have generated some level of excitement. Instead, it's at best a time passer--and not a particularly memorable one due to occasionally over-done music, indifferent acting, and some portions that are just too talky and dull.

All the elements were there great story, great acting, and a great spooky setting befitting a horror story. There were many scary scenes The monster sneaking up behind Dr. Frankenstein, the monster entering a secret door into the child's bedroom, the monster's anger upon seeing himself in a mirror, The monster's anguish upon finding the body of Ygor, and the monster contemplating hurling the child into the sulfur pit, to name a few. Many were disappointed that Karloff didn't have a speaking role, but to me this made the monster much more horrifying. In my opinion, Karloff did a super acting job in portraying the monster's emotions with gestures, facial expressions, and mannerisms. Later, when I saw Bride of Frankenstein, I thought that speech greatly diminished the mystique and horror of the creature. Bride was a great movie, and Karloff's acting was super, but the movie just wasn't scary--and after all, it was supposed to be a horror flick.Speaking of scary, I was a young kid when I saw Son of Frankenstein, and it scared the heck out of me.

The director of the film was F.W. Murnau, who based his film loosely on the novel Dracula written by Bram Stoker. The film later came into legal problems with the movie rights or licensing because the film was based on the book without authorization. Even with certain names being changed like Count Dracula to Count Orlock, you can still get a sense of who they are referencing to from the book within the movie. The same goes for the other characters that are portrayed in the film. Max Shreck who plays Count Dracula in the film Nosferatu leaves you with an incredible image of what might a real vampire might look like. Since I have never seen the movie until now, I was mesmerized by the detail that went into the character of Count Dracula. Details such as pointy ears, long fingers and fingernails, and never blinking within the movie made this film unique in the 1920's film era. Having read the book Dracula by Bram Stoker you see where Murnau got his ideas on his movie from the book. The film doesn't go by the book quite exactly which helps shed new light on how Murnau's version of the story is for him. Certain shots throughout the film were fascinating. Shots that I noticed that were quite interesting to me were how they made Count Dracula fade in and out of certain shots within the film. It was an incredible special effect that I have never seen done on a black and white film made in the 1920's. Furthermore, to see on the shots taken where Jonathan Harker is picked up by the phantoms is baffling. The scene depicts the horse carriage moving extremely fast, while everything else is moving in normal time. I also thought the shot taken on the boat where Count Dracula arises from his coffin straight as a board was an impressive take. You do not see any strings or wires to help him make such a move, so it leaves you to wonder how they thought of doing that without making it noticeable on film. One other shot that was impressive in my opinion was the scene where Count Dracula is walking up the stairs in the mansion that the Harker's live in. It is interesting the way you see his shadow ascends up the stairs on the wall and the shadows of his arms stretch along the wall into the room and onto Mina. All of these were incredible effects done in this film, which makes you wonder how they shot them in the year that they made this film. I noticed that through out this film Murnau shot a lot of shots at eye level form. I would say that eighty percent of this movie is shot at eye level. He did use some low angle shots though, like when they are shooting Renfield on top of the roof of the building trying to get away from the police that are trying to put him back in the asylum. He even used high angle shots within the film that I noticed only twice. Once when Harker is at Dracula's castle looking down through a window watching these men load piles of earth into these coffins, and even see's Dracula himself get into one of the coffins. It is also another time within the film that is depicted by fast movement of people doing actions in this fast pace motion. Another time he uses a high angle shot is when he shoots the scene where Harker see the town people caring coffins of their loved ones down the street that have died from this plaque that they have thought has infected their town. The film was well shot though, especially beginning and ending every shot with the picture looking through a peep hole getting smaller to bigger or bigger to smaller. One thing in the film that I thought was kind of a problem was that since it is filmed in black and white you could not really tell if it was night time. Because the filmmakers shot everything in the day, it was difficult to depict day time scenes from night time scenes. In some scenes you see Dracula walking around outside when it looks like it is daytime with the sun up, but you know that it could not be possible due to the fact that if it was so Dracula would be dead. So in that sense you just had to know that it was night time all the times you see Dracula within the film until the end. I also found the music to be quite odd in this movie. Some parts of the film had wonderful music to go along with the story, but then there were other parts that seemed different from what I have ever seen done in a silent film. I noticed that Murnau was trying to go for something out of the norm, and more into something that was unique and different with the music and sounds that were put into this film. Overall the movie was an amazing film made for its time. It was extremely thought out with great detail and cinematography. I was incredible impressed with how the film was put together to do such special effects for its time. For anyone who likes old movies and the story of Dracula, Nosferatu is a must see film.

I also thought the shot taken on the boat where Count Dracula arises from his coffin straight as a board was an impressive take. You do not see any strings or wires to help him make such a move, so it leaves you to wonder how they thought of doing that without making it noticeable on film. One other shot that was impressive in my opinion was the scene where Count Dracula is walking up the stairs in the mansion that the Harker's live in. It is interesting the way you see his shadow ascends up the stairs on the wall and the shadows of his arms stretch along the wall into the room and onto Mina. All of these were incredible effects done in this film, which makes you wonder how they shot them in the year that they made this film. I noticed that through out this film Murnau shot a lot of shots at eye level form. I would say that eighty percent of this movie is shot at eye level. He did use some low angle shots though, like when they are shooting Renfield on top of the roof of the building trying to get away from the police that are trying to put him back in the asylum. He even used high angle shots within the film that I noticed only twice. Once when Harker is at Dracula's castle looking down through a window watching these men load piles of earth into these coffins, and even see's Dracula himself get into one of the coffins. It is also another time within the film that is depicted by fast movement of people doing actions in this fast pace motion. Another time he uses a high angle shot is when he shoots the scene where Harker see the town people caring coffins of their loved ones down the street that have died from this plaque that they have thought has infected their town. The film was well shot though, especially beginning and ending every shot with the picture looking through a peep hole getting smaller to bigger or bigger to smaller. One thing in the film that I thought was kind of a problem was that since it is filmed in black and white you could not really tell if it was night time. Because the filmmakers shot everything in the day, it was difficult to depict day time scenes from night time scenes. In some scenes you see Dracula walking around outside when it looks like it is daytime with the sun up, but you know that it could not be possible due to the fact that if it was so Dracula would be dead. So in that sense you just had to know that it was night time all the times you see Dracula within the film until the end. I also found the music to be quite odd in this movie. Some parts of the film had wonderful music to go along with the story, but then there were other parts that seemed different from what I have ever seen done in a silent film. I noticed that Murnau was trying to go for something out of the norm, and more into something that was unique and different with the music and sounds that were put into this film. Overall the movie was an amazing film made for its time. It was extremely thought out with great detail and cinematography. I was incredible impressed with how the film was put together to do such special effects for its time. For anyone who likes old movies and the story of Dracula, Nosferatu is a must see film.

I've never seen actors throw themselves into roles the way the ensemble did in this film. Ellen Burstyn was simply amazing and heart-wrenching as the mother of drug user Jared Leto. She is a Brooklyn Jewish mother whose dream is to be on television, and gets it with a phone call that gives her a new-found energy for life. However, her favorite red dress no longer fits, so she turns to diets and eventually diet pills, which she becomes addicted to. Her son, along with his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and best friend (Marlon Wayans), are all addicted to heroin, and become sellers to make money for their dreams. They all become more and more addicted and begin to do whatever to stay in the high.As I read the other comments about this movie, it is a stark difference in people. Some people found it to be a simply moving experience that they will never forget, while others found it unrealistic and crappy. All I have to say is here's a list of people who won't like this film 1. People who have great health insurance and think hospitals and doctors are your friends and only want to help you no matter what; 2. Drug users (part-time or full-time) who don't think drugs are addictive and harmful (or in denial of it); 3. Sheltered people who have never done drugs in their lives and think it can't be that bad; 4. Brain-washed idiots who want happy endings and gumdrop smiles for all; and5. Rich people who don't have to make money to survive the week, and can afford luxuries like food, health care, and vacations.Anyone who knows about being poor and not having every privilege in life will at least understand the message of the film, and that is the power of addiction, loneliness and poverty, and how it can mess up your life and make you go after anything to change it, or at least to find that one little bit of happiness, a reason to get up in the morning.I won't give away what happens in the film, but just think this don't sit there and say situations can't happen because it's impossible and no one would EVER do that because of procedures and rules, because if you can't afford to be taken care of, you won't be. That's all I'll say about it.To the haters of this film, I'm sure Hope Floats and Pretty in Pink are still waiting to be rented. Let the real people enjoy their movies in peace.

Citizen Kane was one of those movies that have slipped through my fingers as a kid and before you know it, you've never seen it but have only heard about it. In fact, usually you hear so much about some films, you have no motivation to see it. There are people out there (and we meet them all the time) that haven't seen the The Godfather yet, so situations like this do exist. So, after finally getting my hand on a copy of Kane, I gave the film it's due attention.A little overrated. Although this film belongs in IMDb's Top 250 and agree Kane should be considered a benchmark for movie directors, I had a tough time watching this movie.

This one gave me a good look at the impact that this particular school has (or had) when it comes to football in the United States. It's kind of hard to believe that all this actually happened at South Bend way back in 1975. Does that mean that it never happened anywhere else at all in history? That's kind of off-topic here, but it was good to watch nonetheless. This movie shows you what can happen when you decide you want to do something bad enough and all the (*fun stuff*) you sometimes have to go through to get there. I though Sean Astin did a stellar job in the lead role, he was a little weird here and there, but I think one of the interesting points about this movie is that in South Bend (and a lot of other US cities), football takes precedence over just about everything. I was also surprised to see Vince Vaughn's name in the credits as I definitely did not recognize him in the scrimmage scene. These players aren't professionals, even though some do make it that far, I thought Rudy did a good job shedding some light on how the sport of football rises to the top in terms on national pastimes in the nation. Also, it would have been cool to have actually been there to see the real Rudy make that sack and get carried off the field, but I'm not that old!

I'm at a bit of a disadvantage in trying to review this movie, because I've never seen the original Pink Panther (or any of the other Pink Panther movies to be honest) and so have nothing to compare this to but can still say that it's quite funny in places. Clouseau is probably Peter Sellers' most famous character, and he plays the role effortlessly. The story - revolving around the theft of the diamond - isn't particularly engrossing, but in this kind of movie the story is secondary anyway. It's Sellers, and Clouseau's dealings with those around him - in particular Chief Inspector Dreyfus, who is eventually driven completely insane by the bumbling Clouseau, and who is played brilliantly by Herbert Lom - that make the movie. Sellers engages in physical comedy, offers some wonderful slapstick humour and, of course, his fake French accent and disguises are worthy of chuckles all the way through. Donald Sutherland as Charles Litton and Catherine Schell as Lady Charlene Litton offer good supporting performances. Schell herself seemed to be laughing all the way through at Sellers' performance.

The movie grabbed me at the first scene and I was entertained until the end. The two components that make this movie what it is are the spectacular cast and the intricate heist plan.For a movie with thirteen characters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffin did a great job of giving each enough screen-time and personality to make them each interesting. Clooney and Brad Pitt are charismatic as usual in their roles as the heist's ringleader and primary accomplice. Andy Garcia is cold and calculating as the owner of the targeted casinos. Though, some of the best performances come out of the supporting cast. A lot of the movie's best scenes feature Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is a bit under-used in her role as Tess, Danny's ex-wife, but makes for a pleasant distraction. Playing just as large a role as any person in this film is the setting, Las Vegas. We are treated to great visuals of Vegas and it gives the movie a grander, flashier vibe.The heist in this movie is definitely complex, and there are still parts I'm not too clear on.

Only after the two of them land in Slovetzia does the truth come out. Never mind, Joy tells the public servant, she will do her best to teach those kids. The country's leader, Boris (Timothy Dalton), however, is a no-nonsense guy who rules his family and his country with an iron fist. Indeed, Slovetzia is depressingly similar to the Soviet Union at its worst. Boris is struck by Joy's charm and beauty but insists there will be no goofing off in the classroom. The children are sweet but one daughter, especially, longs for a bit more freedom. Can Joy bring a touch of democracy and levity to the dismal country? This darling little film will please both fans of romantic comedy and those who love Drescher. If The Nanny was your cat's meow, you will adore this film that came out years before, for it is strikingly similar. Indeed, Drescher and Dalton make a dynamite combination and are very pleasing.

In fact with Duck Soup, they left them rolling in the aisles.Duck Soup is helmed by the greatest director the Brothers ever worked for in their film career, Leo McCarey. He guided this anti-war lampoon of Ruritanian pictures with a sure hand. It's the shortest film the brothers ever did, but there's hardly a minute in it without a gag or three.I think that Leo McCarey had in mind a satire on the Merry Widow, where if you'll recall the plot has the richest widow in Marovia ready to leave the country bag and baggage for Paris. It's up to Count Danilo to woo her for the country. People have done worse for patriotic motives. A silent version by Erich Von Stroheim was already made of The Merry Widow and next year Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier would do it for MGM. But here we have Freedonia's richest citizen, Margaret Dumont not willing to underwrite her little country unless she names its prime minister. And of course she names the man wooing her, Groucho Marx. Of course that foils the plans of Louis Calhern, the ambassador from neighboring Sylvania. War eventually breaks out between the two countries over some absurdities you'll have to see to believe.Harpo and Chico play a pair of hapless spies who change loyalties at the turn of a dime and seem to wind up doing more good for whoever they're working against at the moment. They even take time to have a battle with poor Edgar Kennedy. Note that scene in the bathtub with Edgar Kennedy and Harpo, it may be Harpo's best moment from their films.This was Zeppo's last film, he did not make the journey to MGM with his three brothers. I'm not sure too many people noticed because his contribution seem mostly to act as a foil for Groucho's barbs. He became an agent and as a comic he was a good agent.Duck Soup is only 68 minutes long, but you cannot believe how many laughs you can get in a picture that short.

He guided this anti-war lampoon of Ruritanian pictures with a sure hand. It's the shortest film the brothers ever did, but there's hardly a minute in it without a gag or three.I think that Leo McCarey had in mind a satire on the Merry Widow, where if you'll recall the plot has the richest widow in Marovia ready to leave the country bag and baggage for Paris. It's up to Count Danilo to woo her for the country. People have done worse for patriotic motives. A silent version by Erich Von Stroheim was already made of The Merry Widow and next year Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier would do it for MGM. But here we have Freedonia's richest citizen, Margaret Dumont not willing to underwrite her little country unless she names its prime minister. And of course she names the man wooing her, Groucho Marx. Of course that foils the plans of Louis Calhern, the ambassador from neighboring Sylvania. War eventually breaks out between the two countries over some absurdities you'll have to see to believe.Harpo and Chico play a pair of hapless spies who change loyalties at the turn of a dime and seem to wind up doing more good for whoever they're working against at the moment. They even take time to have a battle with poor Edgar Kennedy. Note that scene in the bathtub with Edgar Kennedy and Harpo, it may be Harpo's best moment from their films.This was Zeppo's last film, he did not make the journey to MGM with his three brothers. I'm not sure too many people noticed because his contribution seem mostly to act as a foil for Groucho's barbs. He became an agent and as a comic he was a good agent.Duck Soup is only 68 minutes long, but you cannot believe how many laughs you can get in a picture that short.

I never thought much of Roger Moore's time out in the tux. I feel Bond is someone with a dangerous edge, and sadly Moore doesn't have that quality. Also the seven films he did contained some of the most ludicrous and overblown plots ever to (dis)grace the Bond franchise.But watching TLD is like a gust of fresh air. The plot may be a little convoluted (even for a Bond film), but the sudden injection of seriousness feels that all the more welcome, especially with the supreme silliness we had to endure during Moore's tenure.Set in a grittier, more dangerous era, that somehow feels appropriate. The film needs a like-minded actor to carry it off. And Timothy Dalton is that actor. He's come in for a fair amount of criticism, but he has all the right qualities. This is a Bond with a startling edge.Right from the very beginning you know TLD is going to be a very different Bond film from what you've (sadly) seen of the character over the last few years.Beginning with a test scenario on the Rocks of Gibraltar, M sends three of his agents to outwit the SAS. Until an assassin shows up and kills one of them, sending the message Death To Spies. One of the agents happens to be 007, and what we get next is one of the most exciting and perfectly sustained action sequences to feature in a Bond film in a good long while.This murder sets a chain of events in motion including a phony KGB defector, an insane US army general, faked assassinations, beautiful cellists and lots and lots of action.I have to admit the plot for The Living Daylights is a bit of a head scratcher. Labyrinthine plotting is one thing, but after awhile I did start to get a bit lost. The writers may have made the film a little too complex. For instance, instead of just giving us one major villain, the film wheels out two. But despite all that, I really enjoyed TLD. I know he has a legion of haters, but Timothy Dalton is quite excellent as Bond. People tend to criticise him for his deadly serious interpretation of the role. Anyone who says that has no understanding of the character whatsoever. Ian Fleming created Bond as a ruthless agent with a borderline cruel streak. He's someone who would shoot you with nary a glance. And Dalton encapsulates those qualities perfectly.Its that side of Bond that Dalton wanted to embody, making his take on the role the most faithful of any other actor. Even more so than Sean Connery. And besides, its nice to see a Bond film taking itself seriously after so long. Seeing such a dramatic, plot-driven character based Bond film reminds one of the days when Connery was in the role. And its because of this approach that The Living Daylights gets back a lot of the self-respect that had been lost through Moore's tenure.Also TLD has some of the most breathlessly staged action sequences you'll ever see in a Bond film. Aside from the wonderful pre-credits teaser, we get a really exciting car chase in Bond's customized Aston Martin, complete with rockets, lasers, bulletproof glass and even skis!And there's also the usual plethora of fistfights to enjoy. There's a hair-raising one between Bond and an assassin on a plane's cargo net, hanging out a cargo door in midair, while there's a bomb on board just minutes from going off. There's even a good one between the same assassin and an MI6 agent. Its a good fight too! It's nice to see one where Bond isn't playing the big hero. Can't imagine any other film in the series trying something like that!The Living Daylights is not without its flaws though. As I said, the plot is more complicated than it needs to be. I did get a bit restless when the film makes a somewhat needless sidetrip to Afghanistan. Joe Don Baker and Jeroen Krabbe are two of the most forgettable Bond villains in recent memory. What their masterplan entails is never properly explained. The new Miss Moneypenny hardly sets the world on fire. And Maryam d'Abo, although radiant, is one of the less inspired Bond girls.Director John Glen keeps things going at a breathless pace. He considerably redeems himself after the unfortunate double-act of Octopussy and A View to a Kill. And he makes sure things never get too silly. Something that seemed to completely escape him on his previous two films.Its a shame Timothy Dalton's Bond films are so disliked. I thought they did a superb job of rebooting the stale Bond series. Something Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig would continue to improve upon in their entries. The Living Daylights is not quite a classic, but its such a vast improvement from what had been seen beforehand that it makes me like it all the more.An underrated Bond film well worthy of reevaluation.
