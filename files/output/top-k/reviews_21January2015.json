[{"date":"21 January 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Coming up on almost sixteen years, The Matrix still shines as a solid Sci-fi masterpiece. Amazing character and a well crafted universe that compliments dynamic characters. An amazing soundtrack helps create an atmosphere that can only be described as exciting and gripping. Its bizarre to think that originally will smith was going to be cast to play Neo, but gave up the opportunity in order to pursue the roll of James West in Wild WIld West. Thanks to that decision, we get Keanu, in a roll that oddly really suits his personality. His dead eyes and expressionless acting seem to add to the character of Neo. If there is anything that can take away for this experience, it is probably that some of the visual effects are starting to look a little seasoned. Thats nothing to be surprised about considering that this film is a decade and a half old. Great film all around, would recommend it to anyone.
