I remember thinking how i didn't really want to see the movie until the huge 100 foot wave at the end with the boat barely hanging on for dear life. This is the money. Almost every special effects movie has one. Independence Day had the white house explosion, Godzilla had the big lizard goot stepping on the cameraman, and now vertical limit has someone jumping from one mountain to another. These images make you want to see the film and in the case of the perfect storm it was my only reason.I have to say the movie isn't bad at all. it's Just not the action packed extravaganza that the trailer promised and that's ok because now we get to experience the tragic story of the andrea gail and its crew. The first 45 minutes is the set up of the characters. The characters aren't throughly developed enough but that doesn't mean we dont care about them. What might be disappointing for the viewer is that we know how the film will end so even if the film presents a chance that the crew might make it we still know that something will get in the way.The special effects are awesome. I will never look at the sea the same way again. when at its angriest the sea can become a beast and a force to be reckoned with.The acting is pretty good from all the actors. clooney and wahlbergs characters are the most developed and they also give the best performances but the best performance is by the sea itself.As for the money shot. it was satisfying and intense. it stands out as one of the best effects shots caught on camera in my opinon.By the end however i was left with a weird feeling. i saw this movie based on its special effects and action but by the end i felt for the characters and my heart really went out to the real people. so the film wanted us to feel for the characters it won me over.

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is.  Everything you've heard is right.  It may not be the most wondrous thing ever...but it is a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart...that also has some absolutely breath-taking action scenes.  Crouching Tiger..., I am told, is representative of a specific literary\/cinematic genre in China Wu Xia...the wizard\/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia!) to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights.  High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in the winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called wire work in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Washowski's but the choreographer of Crouching Tiger... also staged the wire-fights of Matrix.  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The guy with whom I saw the advance screening and I...the whole packed-in audience at the big theater at Pipers Alley...burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...  At other moments, I found myself in absolute weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become all drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from anything, this is a grand story!  It has passion...love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in semi-love with her for a long time.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than anything I've seen her in (she was a recent Bond Girl).  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.The center of the film...remarkably...is a girl who looks to be about 15! Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  I say that she is remarkable because her story is the binding element of the film.  And she holds the film together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both the dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas de deus (okay...did I spell that right?) that frame the conflicts between them.  She is the Luke Skywalker of the piece, if you will...though Crouching Tiger... has everything the Star Wars saga had excitement, thrills and magic, but here, it is wrapped in those things Lukas film wanted to give, but succeeded in delivering in only the most self-conscious way heart and deep-placed spirit.By the way this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood onscreen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the Full Peckinpaw, if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully!While there are those who might grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and trick photography...okay...true enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is put in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile burdens of emotions!So there.    Enough?  Just go see it.I can't wait for the DVD!

She is the Luke Skywalker of the piece, if you will...though Crouching Tiger... has everything the Star Wars saga had excitement, thrills and magic, but here, it is wrapped in those things Lukas film wanted to give, but succeeded in delivering in only the most self-conscious way heart and deep-placed spirit.By the way this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood onscreen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the Full Peckinpaw, if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully!While there are those who might grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and trick photography...okay...true enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is put in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile burdens of emotions!So there.    Enough?  Just go see it.I can't wait for the DVD!  I'll probably see it again, maybe see it twice again, before it hits the home-market.

You remember the Romeo, the virgin, the slut, the BMOC (big man on campus), and at least one African American tossed in for some good ol' ethnic diversity.

It's filled with splendid scenery and beautiful sights. It's a feast for the eyes. Tim Burton is a master-mind of weirdness and creepiness. He directs the movie with such skill it's incredible. The animators do a spectacular job making the world come to life. Jack Skellington is tired of doing Halloween every single year. One day, he wonders into Christmas Town, a town where it's always Christmas. These scenes are beautiful. He loves it so much, he decides to make his own X-Mas. He tells the citizens of Halloween Town about X-Mas. They don't get the idea and they make X-Mas to be a horrible event. Three misguided children kidnap Sandy Claws and send him to Oogie Boogie, the meanest guy around.As I said, the movie is a feast for the eyes. There are some very funny jokes in the movie as well. Oogie Boogie's lair is awesome looking. It's like this room that is one big black light. The movie is stop-motion-animation. A concept we have seen in early movies used as special effects. I think it has become a Burton trademark. (Look at Beetlejuice) I'd like to see more movies that are completely stop motion animation. We have this, James and the Giant Peach and Chicken Run. Don't forget Wallace and Gromit. Even with those movies, I'd like to see more. Sure, computer animated is great, but I'd like to watch a movie that uses classic methods. Something... simple.The vocal talents are great. Catherin O'Hara is always good in her roles. Some of the Halloween Town voices are creepy. That's how good they sound. And of course, Danny Elfman's score is incredible. The songs are wonderful. Especially Jack's What's This song when he enters X-Mas town. Plus, you don't have to wait until X-Mas to watch it.

The animators do a spectacular job making the world come to life. Jack Skellington is tired of doing Halloween every single year. One day, he wonders into Christmas Town, a town where it's always Christmas. These scenes are beautiful. He loves it so much, he decides to make his own X-Mas. He tells the citizens of Halloween Town about X-Mas. They don't get the idea and they make X-Mas to be a horrible event.

Oogie Boogie's lair is awesome looking. It's like this room that is one big black light. The movie is stop-motion-animation. A concept we have seen in early movies used as special effects. I think it has become a Burton trademark. (Look at Beetlejuice) I'd like to see more movies that are completely stop motion animation. We have this, James and the Giant Peach and Chicken Run. Don't forget Wallace and Gromit. Even with those movies, I'd like to see more. Sure, computer animated is great, but I'd like to watch a movie that uses classic methods. Something... simple.The vocal talents are great. Catherin O'Hara is always good in her roles. Some of the Halloween Town voices are creepy. That's how good they sound. And of course, Danny Elfman's score is incredible. The songs are wonderful. Especially Jack's What's This song when he enters X-Mas town. Plus, you don't have to wait until X-Mas to watch it.

If done properly this can be fun(Mission Impossible). But what about this movie? Charlie's Angels is just what it pretends to be A fast packed fun action movie. The martial arts scenes are fun to watch and well choreographed. For some reasons the scenes involving Crispin Glover as The Thin Man remind me strongly of the Darth Maul scenes from Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace, but maybe this was done intentionally. It is also obvious that some scenes were explicitely ripped from other popular movies from the last decade(The Matrix and Mission Impossible for example). Also the actress that plays Vivian Wood(Kelly Lynch) reminds me strongly of Madeline from the Nikita series. As usual within the Charlie's Angel's series the movie is a little over the top, but never becomes annoying.  All three of the actresses play their respective parts well, but none really stands out(which would spoil the movie, since they are supposed to be all equal). Bill Murray is funny as usual, but seems to be getting old fast(he's not half as funny as in Ghostbusters for instance). The special effects are done well, but none of them are really spectacular. The music really adds something to the movie. Blind by Korn really improves the martial arts scenes. Conclusion This movie is fun to watch , but also predictable.

Thank you Mr. Mendes and the entire cast of American Beauty for making a film that actually makes desensatized people like myself actually begin to feel something again. I recommend this film to anyone with a brain.  However, people who are easily offended, prudish, or sheeplike and unable to think for themselves should steer clear of this movie due to the fact that it touches real yet uncomfortable subjects such as drugs and homosexuality\/homophobia.

Lauderdale International Film Festival this year; maybe that is because when we are not laughing at the quaint and lovable humor in State and Main, we are smiling at it.The film begins like a character study, and in some ways is, but as the movie progresses, we realize it is not the characters who overrun the story, but it is the characters and the screenplay working together that create a very effective storyline; the characters follow the inventive flow of the plot smoothly. They are not kept within strict boundaries, but have leeway to explore relationships and feelings. Because of the careful measures Mamet takes, we come to care enormously about these characters and thus the story is greatly involving. State and Main takes stereotyping to a whole new level; each and every character in this film is over-the-top in their expected vision. The story details a film crew's misadventures when they travel to a sleepy location (Waterford, Vermont) as they prepare to film The Old Mill, only to learn the great impact their presence makes on the ordinary residents. There is the stereotypical director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), who is bound and determined to construct the movie, even without an old mill. He spends most of his stressful time on a cell phone or ordering his crew around. Then there is the producer, Marty (David Paymer), who is, as expected, sly, stylish, and cunning as he is plotted against by a greedy lawyer, MacKenzie (Clark Gregg). There is a whimsical romance between the movie's temperate, near\/far sighted screenwriter, Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and a gentle bookstore owner, Ann (Rebecca Pidgeon). Then there is the film's actors, the handsome and arrogant superstar Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), who is sexually overwhelmed, a tempting but teenage staff at the crew's hotel (Julia Stiles). The leading lady, a blonde bimbo and sex symbol named Claire Wellesley (appropriately portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker), who refuses to expose herself on camera at the last minute, even though she is contract obligateds her to do so.A lot of the film consists of dialogue and eccentrics of the characters, and is often left going in many different directions at once, which occasionally becomes a nuisance. However, the dialogue is so cute and smart, we do not need a lot of action or slapstick to enjoy this little piece of comedy heaven. Mamet creates thought-provoking subplots within his broad original story, giving us variety and generous opportunities to become involved; if we do not like one of the characters and his or her quintessence, then there is plenty of others to make up for that.The performances and casting are what really allow the picture to take off. The irony that makes the film so witty and funny, as I have said, comes from how the actors stereotype their characters to the point of almost spoof. William H. Macy, winner of the Jury Prize mentioned, is well cast and effectively takes the role of an exploiting, fast-talking director; his performance is unique and ecstatic. After starring in unusual roles in movies like Chill Factor and Carpool, it is fun to see David Paymer as an aggressive, cynical, distinguished producer in this production, as he plays his character straight and humorously. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always a pleasure to watch, and although his best performance is still in The Talented Mr. Ripley, he fits his character well here, with delicate persona and perfect charm. Alec Baldwin holds nothing back from his esteemed, self-centered character, and Sarah Jessica Parker reprises her Dudly Do-Right role.State and Main is the type of movie where you leave the theater smiling and happy. It is not profound or explicit, but sticks with you for a while because we so rarely find a movie with this much joy and satisfaction. This is one of the better movies released this year.
