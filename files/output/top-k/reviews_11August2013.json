I like the action, the drama, and the especially the chase scenes. Matt Damon does a phenomenal job bringing this character to life as only he can. Like so many other actors in so many other roles it isn't easy to imagine someone else in those roles.I have listed favorite scenes in other movies, but not all movies I have reviewed. I have three scenes that I especially like.The first scene I like is when Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franke Potente) leave Bourne's Paris apartment. They are cornered and Jason decides to run, but he is trying to get Marie to leave. Marie doesn't want to leave so Jason brings her along for the ride. And what a ride it is!Jason drives an Austin Mini Cooper through the streets of Paris to escape the Paris Police. One of the best parts is when he drives the car down a set of stairs. He escapes the police and does so with flare. Can you imagine having a high speed car chase in a Mini Cooper? I think it is funny as hell.The next best scene is when Jason confronts The Professor (Clive Owen), another agent like Bourne. He does this with flare as well. Bourne blows up a large propane tank to distract The Professor. Then Bourne runs into a field and is able to shoot and wound The Professor. After getting little information from him, Bourne watches as The Professor dies.The last of my favorite scenes is after Bourne confronts Conklin (Chris Cooper), his former boss. Bourne hits Conklin and renders him unconscious, seconds later Bourne must fight his way out of the apartment building by killing four agents. One agent he kills by shooting through the forehead while falling through the air and landing on the body of one of the agents.I do have some advice for those that want to read the books by Robert Ludlum or Eric Van Lustbader. Don't read the books thinking that you will be able to follow the movies. I have only ever read the first book. The only similarity between the first book and the first movie is as follows the title, many of the character names, and Jason Bourne's amnesia. The rest of the book is completely different from the movie. I have to say that that was probably as it was supposed to be, since the book was released in 1980 and the movie came out 22 years later.I give this movie 10 stars out of 10.

The character presentation was magnificent. Though Al Pacino had other great movies prior to this, Brando obviously took a shine to him and really mentored this actor in ways I believe no one can imagine. Pacino evolved and solidified the role of the head of the family that I believe is still being used in references today. A strong but loving Father figure, ruthless and forceful at times, Pacino drew on his personal background greatly during this role.James Caan was spot on as Sonny. The typical view of Italian temper as well as showing the eagerness to make a dollar. This role was the glue in the first half of the film. Talia Shire, just too good. What can one write about a flawless performance. The quintessential bad Italian daughter, awful wife and terrible sister. Scorned by her brother, bitter in the end of this movie, Mrs. Shire is wonderful in portraying the suppressed spirit of the true Italian mob family member.John Cazale is a piece of work. As Fredo, he embodies the mob family's image of the family member you should have just given money to instead of letting him in the business. What a smart role for a great actor. Through it all Fredo was the one family member that was actually true to himself the whole time. He loved his family dearly, wanted to earn money, and absolutely craved respect. I love how he was always like the lamb in the lions den no one worried too much about. The movie was tailored such that if one thinks about it, the family is the one that let Fredo down by not recognizing his inherent shortcomings.Robert Duvall is a Master Counselor in the movie, but most the important contribution Duvall made was as an outsider. Not an Italian. His portrayal as someone who could be loyal and not blood Italian was huge in the USA at this time. I believe Duvall's role made it almost OK for races to interact with each other better without using side glances. This is a great testament to Duvall and one I don't believe was intended by the director or screenplay.Finally there is Mr. Marlo Brando.

I first enjoyed NotLD on the big screen way back in the antediluvian days of college, pre- videotape\/DVD\/BluRay collections, pre-Internet, pre-Androids etal., when Romero's unassuming film was burning up the midnight film circuit and burrowing deep into the collective unconsciousness of horror fans and cinemaphiles everywhere. Little did I know at the time just how influential this little homegrown nightmare would prove to be, but there was no denying its raw power to shock and unsettle unsuspecting audiences, and all on a budget just somewhat above rock bottom.Imagine, if you will, several hundred Boomer college kids packed into a darkened auditorium, most of them likely intoxicated on one thing or another, all eager to see this scary movie that so far they'd only read about. They knew that Roger Ebert hated it, which only made it more alluring. They knew it pushed the boundaries of graphic depictions of murder, and that, too, made it all the more the forbidden fruit. And, perhaps most of all, they knew it wasn't a Hollywood movie, and that made its rising star all the brighter. Imagine now that very first viewing of that rough gem in all its lo-fi glory...Almost a half-century later, even the most forgiving retrospectives will admit to the film's flaws; only the most churlish could deny them. The acting is at times unpolished, and the make-up is simply crude by today's standards (one can only wonder how it might have looked had Tom Savini not been dragooned off to Vietnam). The camera-wrangling is well-informed, though, by Romero's prior commercial experience, eminently bolstered by darkly evocative lighting and editing; the choice to shoot in black-and-white was, of course, a financial one, but turned out to be the serendipitous one as well. I can't even conceive of this film being in color, and have steadfastly refused to ever watch the colorized version. NotLD remains a classic example of inspired (and inspiring) make-do indie film-making and quite rightfully deserves its many accolades and awards of honor. It's far from perfect--even the script is a let-down at times with its occasionally clunky dialog--but it hits all the right dramatic notes, tapping into a nervous zeitgeist in a way that still works in a post-9\/11 world--perhaps even more so than ever.If George A. Romero & Co. hadn't made Night of the Living Dead, I have no doubt that someone else would have eventually come up with something similar.

There are so many little nods and cheeky references to the action genre and to Hollywood that you can't possibly catch them all the first time around. It appears, on the surface, to be this huge action film but really the entire film is poking fun at the genre. And who better to bring on board to do that but the King of eighties action Arnold Schwarzenegger. There is so much right about this film. The scenes with Arnold playing himself and the interaction between him and Jack Slater are just awesome. The cameos and the world they create inside the movie is just so much fun to watch. The problem is that the film is almost too much of a joke. Fans of Schwarzenegger and action films might find their genre being made a total fool of a bit much to handle. And also one of the leading roles is really not good but more on that in a minute. It is definitely a PG-13 movie and while there is nothing wrong with that, it feels like it struggles to purposely try to stay PG and it has trouble doing that.I love Arnold Schwarzenegger, he has just always been one of my Hollywood icons. This is such an odd role for him because he is making fun of himself and what he does best. However, it works well and he is actually fun as Slater. He is especially fun in the brief scenes where is playing or over-playing himself. The banter between him and real life wife\/ex-wife Maria Shriver is just awesome. Austin O'Brien is the young actor portraying Schwarzenegger's partner and his fan as well. O'Brien is unfortunately the character I mentioned previously that really holds back this film. He is simply unnatural and gives a strained and poor performance. It just is very underwhelming. The chemistry between him and Schwarzenegger is nearly awful and that would be the key point to this movie. Charles Dance is very good as the evil villain Benedict. He is over the top but looks menacing and certainly is the perfect personification of an action movie villain. Tom Noonan is also good as the twisted Ripper villain who is also an amped up spoof of a slasher villain. Everyone else in the film are basically cameos but there are some really good ones worth mentioning. F.

The scenes with Arnold playing himself and the interaction between him and Jack Slater are just awesome. The cameos and the world they create inside the movie is just so much fun to watch. The problem is that the film is almost too much of a joke. Fans of Schwarzenegger and action films might find their genre being made a total fool of a bit much to handle. And also one of the leading roles is really not good but more on that in a minute. It is definitely a PG-13 movie and while there is nothing wrong with that, it feels like it struggles to purposely try to stay PG and it has trouble doing that.I love Arnold Schwarzenegger, he has just always been one of my Hollywood icons. This is such an odd role for him because he is making fun of himself and what he does best. However, it works well and he is actually fun as Slater. He is especially fun in the brief scenes where is playing or over-playing himself. The banter between him and real life wife\/ex-wife Maria Shriver is just awesome. Austin O'Brien is the young actor portraying Schwarzenegger's partner and his fan as well. O'Brien is unfortunately the character I mentioned previously that really holds back this film. He is simply unnatural and gives a strained and poor performance. It just is very underwhelming. The chemistry between him and Schwarzenegger is nearly awful and that would be the key point to this movie. Charles Dance is very good as the evil villain Benedict. He is over the top but looks menacing and certainly is the perfect personification of an action movie villain. Tom Noonan is also good as the twisted Ripper villain who is also an amped up spoof of a slasher villain. Everyone else in the film are basically cameos but there are some really good ones worth mentioning. F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Frank McRae, Robert Prosky, Anthony Quinn and even Ian McKellan are just a few of the faces you will recognize and they give good solid campy performances.If there was any director they should have gotten to direct this film it would be John McTiernan. Die Hard, Predator, The Hunt For Red October, Die Hard 3, Medicine Man...and more. Every action film he has done has at least been decent so he was the perfect choice to do this film and poke fun at the genre. The action scenes are well done and yet overdone at the same time (which granted is the point.) Last Action Hero is fun and exciting but is held back by making fun of itself almost too much. Still, it is a modern day cult classic and more and more people are calling it under-rated and when you look at some of the hidden Easter eggs in the film, it becomes even more fascinating and fun. 7\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"11 August 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Pulp Fiction is a story of how two hit men Vincent and Jules who work for L.A.'s crime boss Marcellus Wallace and how Jules begins to have a change of heart due to feeling that he witnessed a miracle for God. It is also about a boxer who double crosses the crime boss and how they eventually handle their conflict. There are also sub plots about Marcellus Wallace's wife and her night out on the town with her husband's employee Vincent Vega. All of these stories culminate in Jules having an epiphany as he spare the lives of a would be robber couple. In this film, Quentin Tarantino weaves several extreme stories together- some romance, a little contract killing, drug use and overdose, kidnap, rape, a double-cross and a manhunt- into an extremely shocking, yet entertaining coherent film. In this movie there are multiple themes communicated to the viewer. One of the prominent themes was about never judging people because anyone at anytime can change and choose to become more. He demonstrated that theme in scenes where enemies become allies and hit men save life instead of taking it. Another major theme was that every choice a person makes has its inevitable consequences. Tarantino emphasized this by showing those who choose to hurt people will be repaid in kind. The cheater gets cheated, a killer gets killed, and people who abuse drugs nearly die from overdose. Tarantino also uses his creative license throughout this film in order to jump back and forth in time thus drawing the viewer in. Tarantino deliberately leaves the viewer trying to figure out what is going on piece by intriguing piece, as well as allowing the viewer to try and understand the behavior of characters in earlier scenes that while entertaining seemed shocking and sometimes comically absurd. Although sometimes viewers may know or think they know what will happen to a particular character before it happens, it is still impossible to know how that character will react or what kind of impact it may have on the other characters within the film. Quentin Tarantino is totally unpredictable so that makes outguessing him nearly impossible. Tarantino's movies on the other hand, always have his signature flare. This movie is filled with shocking dialog, and he creates comedy by contrasting extreme violence with irony. There are instances where characters would have casual conversations about being vegetarian, or the Big Kahuna Burger while in the process of killing a roomful of people. One of them even asked one of the soon to be victims if he could taste his Kahuna Burger and have a sip of his tasty beverage. The length of the movie was a bit long (two and a half hours) and does have long stretches of dialog with little action, but the outrageous and shocking action scenes that follow definitely make them worth tolerating. Overall this film is very entertaining with surprising plot twists and a powerful conclusion. With shocking scenes and witty dialog, along with an all star cast, this movie should be on everyone's must see list.

The villain is played by Rupert Everett, who completely ignores the Doctor Claw character in the cartoon, and gives one of the worst performances in cinematic history. Throughout the whole film he just acts like a homosexual mental patient. All the other actors are hardly worth mentioning. Most of them are terrible and add nothing to the film.The one thing that's really exceptional about this film is the editing. It looks like it was done by someone who just had a lobotomy. In some scenes it feels like you entered right in the middle, and that a part of it was just cut out. The film also has some idiotic transitions between scenes, that are supposed to be funny, but are just completely pointless.Nothing about this movie is funny or even remotely entertaining. I know it's for children, but it's all just stupid, cheap slapstick with horrible, over the top acting. This is like someone took the Inspector Gadget cartoon, chopped it up, burned it, marinated it in diarrhoea, called it a motion picture, and served it to the audience. Don't bother watching it, unless you're in a masochistic mood.

She's occasionally useful and at first serves as a stand-in for the audience as she learns more about the mysterious Bruce Wayne, but that role erodes over time and by the end she's just your garden variety damsel in distress whose every other line is a shrill scream.The script is atrocious. I understand the Joker's plan is intended to be chaotic, but the way the story is told is so clumsy. We don't know enough about the characters to care about them, especially Batman himself who gets little screen time in comparison to the Joker and Vicky.

Their unrelenting fear about the possibility of the truth being revealed drives them into a miserable marriage and a range of other heinous acts that they consider necessary to protect their wealth, power and freedom.Martha (Barbara Stanwyck) is a ruthless and successful businesswoman who lives and works in a small industrial town in the Midwest. She's married to the local district attorney, Walter O'Neil (Kirk Douglas) and they're profoundly unhappy as a result of an event that took place in their childhood. Walter's also an extremely troubled individual who's tormented by guilt and shame and whose circumstances have turned him into a severely depressed alcoholic.As a young girl, Martha had attempted to escape from her cruel guardian but she and her accomplice, the streetwise Sam Masterson (Van Heflin), had been caught by the police and Martha had then been returned home to the rich industrialist, Mrs Ivers (Judith Anderson) who'd raised her since she became an orphan at a very young age.Sam, who'd made a successful getaway from the police, later returned to the Ivers mansion with the intention of continuing to help Martha to escape and there met the young Walter who was the son of Martha's private tutor. The planned escape never took place, however, because of an incident which took place on the staircase that led to Martha unintentionally killing her stepmother. When Walter's father came to check what had happened, Sam had disappeared and Martha made up a story about a mystery intruder who'd broken into the property and murdered Mrs Ivers.Purely by accident, 18 years after Mrs Ivers' violent death, Sam returns to his home town and is immediately attracted to Toni Marachek (Lizabeth Scott) a young woman who's only recently been released from prison. After the local police accuse her of violating the terms of her parole, Sam tries to use his influence with Walter to get her released. The highly suspicious Walter immediately assumes that Sam's real motive for being in town is to blackmail him and Martha and the series of events that follow build up to the story's shocking conclusion.The Strange Love Of Martha Ivers is a sharply written and well directed movie with memorable characters and some great performances. Kirk Douglas (in his film debut) and Barbara Stanwyck are terrific in their roles and Van Heflin exerts considerable charm as the easy going war hero who's also a gambler and a drifter. Lizabeth Scott also provides great support as the most sympathetic character of the piece.

Nineteen years on I decided to put it right. Director Robert Zemeckis has gone on to have a distinguished career and is a Hollywood stalwart, a traditionalist in the Spielberg mould.

We never see the Commies in Vietnam, just Gump's bravery, we do see those subversive anti-war protesters and Black Panthers though, but even dim Gump manages to see his way through.Told in flashback, and with amusing and inspired manipulated archive footage to put Forrest at the heart of historic action , much pivots upon Forrests's star crossed relationship with a girl, played by Robin Wright.

Also William Fichtner is always fun to watch. Gallagher plays a role that is indeed a very complicated one, as the person he is playing is a very deeply troubled soul with a lot of self loathing shame that he condemns on himself and which his character's brother condemns on him as well. Gallagher's character leaves a woman he loved years before, for no rhyme or reason(actually a little bit of a reason, but not enough to constitute one leaving), and his character vanishes out of her life for many years before returning back into her life again. Gallagher plays the character with such likability that you feel for his character's confusion of himself, and his nomadic ways of being able to just leave on people he cares about, just like that. You feel for his character in being the black sheep in his brother's eyes and his indifferent ways. A Self Study of a person's confusion and their search for self love as well as love from another person and also walking the line with themselves between right and wrong and trying to make amends for past wrongs. Worth a watch for the deep, precise performance of Peter Gallagher.
