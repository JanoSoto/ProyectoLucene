The usual suspects are still around, Leo (Joe Pesci) is now a private eye, still irritable, yappy and profance. Riggs kept a woman alive for two films in a row, and now Lorna (Rene Russo) is one of the preggers chickies along with Roger's eldest daughter Rianne who ignored her own condom ad and got knocked up by a young loud mouthed cop named Butters (Chris Rock), who seems to be there to be a similarly abrasive counterpoint to Leo and to create a dumb running joke where Roger thinks he is gay for him.As always the case comes to them, this time it is a people smuggling operation lead by villainous Chinese criminals, after it is busted open the 400+ are sent back; but not a dozen or so that Roger decides to keep for himself in some kind of 'free the slaves' arrangement. This ludicrous turn of events only gets worse when he decides to keep them all in his home. What exactly did he plan to do with them?? Doesn't matter, because in a stroke of luck this one family is the main one the smugglers actually wanted to get into the country (why the other 400 odd then?), and they head to Roger's house to claim them.

Maybe as a DVD extra guys, but a sappy way to close out a 4 film series where most of the fun was found in potty talk and head counts.Final Rating - 7 \/ 10.

Lethal Weapon 2 might be the same as the first, but when they are both equally entertaining you can forgive that, and this film might have the same ratio of action to comedy but here the jokes are funnier and more of them hit the mark.After Lethal Weapon 2 opens with a kick-ass car chase that serves to both get the adrenalin pumping, and reminds us that Riggs (Mel Gibson) is the crazy one and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) the more staid one who is 'too old for this sh*t and about to retire... still.We learn quickly that the new foe are a nasty South African crime group with management in high places, and half the things said or seen in the early stages serve as omens for the final 40 minutes or so.The boys are also given another task in this film and have to babysit a diminutive, motor-mouthed money launderer named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who has luck would have it has ties with the very same South African gang that Riggs and Murtaugh are after. Leo's OK, OK, OK jabber is amusing and annoying in equal proportion, so thankfully Leo gets more a bit part than a supporting role.All Lethal Weapons have great setpieces and action sequences, but this film is remembered for three things- The exploding toilet scene - DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY! - Mel and hottie South African secretary Rika getting' it onnnnnn.The fact that South Africa was right in the middle of apartheid when this film was released added a new wrinkle for the pair, obviously Roger, and made shooting white people cool again.Of course both Riggs and Murtaugh get their own personal nemesis to deal with and everyone nearly dies multiple times, but only those with less than 4 lines of dialogue actually bite the dust.Lethal Weapon 2 shouldn't work but thanks to the chemistry between the two leads, the efficiency of the action and the just right blend of action and comedy, you'll go a long way before you see a sequel as good as Lethal Weapon 2.Final Rating - 8.5 \/ 10.

Riggs lives in a trailer on the beach with a dog as his only companion, and he has a myriad of techniques and skills in the art of killing, a crack shot with pistol or rifle and a martial artist, let's just say.The new pair are investigating the death of a young blonde woman who leapt to her death from a tall building, landing on a car below, which I only bring up to ask if anyone who ever jumped from a tall building DIDN'T land on a car? Regardless the young girl was a prostitute who more than dabbled in drugs and porn, and she was the daughter of one of Roger's buddies from Vietnam. It is discovered that her drugs were laced with poison and if she didn't jump from the building she would have died very soon in any case.Roger relays this new information to the father, who makes it very clear that regardless of Roger's badge and job description he wants the people responsible D.E.D.D.Pausing only to jump a jumper and to ponder the worth of his life, Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case...Being an 80s movie the plot is complex but not unnecessarily convoluted, the duo rapidly learn that they are up against a team of extremely dangerous mercenaries who intend to make a large shipment of heroin in only a few days, the team are led by the General and his loyal 2IC Mr Joshua (Gary Busey), who as well as being a crack soldier is perhaps the equal of Riggs in the insanity stakes.The mercenaries are vicious and brutal, and they target anyone in their way or anyone who might pose a threat, they quickly decide that Riggs and Murtaugh are both. Thankfully Riggs and Murtaugh are equally determined to deal with them and have no intention of running away. Each of them even get their own personal nemesis to off in the finale.After the initial wariness and friction Riggs and Murtaugh gradually develop a bond, which by the end of the film is already an easy chemistry. There are many setpieces that are extremely effective and some cool 80s stuntwork and driving sequences.This film wasn't as worried about the comedy elements as the sequels so it doesn't try so hard, but as a result the jokes work a little better, and of course they are often thrown around in the middle of crisis situations.Lethal Weapon is one of the better preserved classics of the 80s, it has aged very well and aside from being a little slow at times in comparison to today's action flicks it stands up against any film of the last decade and features a cast full of bit actors from half of the films made in the decade. The reasonably straightforward plot is a plus - the good guys are good and the bad guys need plugging full of holes - and the action to comedy ratio is just in favour of the action.As it should be.I said to my wife that Riggs is Gibson's Rambo or Rocky, and if you think he hasn't strongly considered dragging him out of retirement to attempt to rebuild his image you're nuts. I then joked (repeat JOKED) that given his tirades in the last few years Riggs would take on a group of Jewish criminals... then turn the gun on Roger.If that sounds off-colour it is more a reflection of Gibson than anything else.I wouldn't watch Lethal Weapon 5; but I must (begrudgingly) admit that the original Lethal Weapon is a great flick.Final Rating - 8.5 \/ 10.

Regardless the young girl was a prostitute who more than dabbled in drugs and porn, and she was the daughter of one of Roger's buddies from Vietnam. It is discovered that her drugs were laced with poison and if she didn't jump from the building she would have died very soon in any case.Roger relays this new information to the father, who makes it very clear that regardless of Roger's badge and job description he wants the people responsible D.E.D.D.Pausing only to jump a jumper and to ponder the worth of his life, Riggs and Murtaugh are on the case...Being an 80s movie the plot is complex but not unnecessarily convoluted, the duo rapidly learn that they are up against a team of extremely dangerous mercenaries who intend to make a large shipment of heroin in only a few days, the team are led by the General and his loyal 2IC Mr Joshua (Gary Busey), who as well as being a crack soldier is perhaps the equal of Riggs in the insanity stakes.The mercenaries are vicious and brutal, and they target anyone in their way or anyone who might pose a threat, they quickly decide that Riggs and Murtaugh are both. Thankfully Riggs and Murtaugh are equally determined to deal with them and have no intention of running away. Each of them even get their own personal nemesis to off in the finale.After the initial wariness and friction Riggs and Murtaugh gradually develop a bond, which by the end of the film is already an easy chemistry. There are many setpieces that are extremely effective and some cool 80s stuntwork and driving sequences.This film wasn't as worried about the comedy elements as the sequels so it doesn't try so hard, but as a result the jokes work a little better, and of course they are often thrown around in the middle of crisis situations.Lethal Weapon is one of the better preserved classics of the 80s, it has aged very well and aside from being a little slow at times in comparison to today's action flicks it stands up against any film of the last decade and features a cast full of bit actors from half of the films made in the decade. The reasonably straightforward plot is a plus - the good guys are good and the bad guys need plugging full of holes - and the action to comedy ratio is just in favour of the action.As it should be.I said to my wife that Riggs is Gibson's Rambo or Rocky, and if you think he hasn't strongly considered dragging him out of retirement to attempt to rebuild his image you're nuts. I then joked (repeat JOKED) that given his tirades in the last few years Riggs would take on a group of Jewish criminals... then turn the gun on Roger.If that sounds off-colour it is more a reflection of Gibson than anything else.I wouldn't watch Lethal Weapon 5; but I must (begrudgingly) admit that the original Lethal Weapon is a great flick.Final Rating - 8.5 \/ 10. One of the best buddy cop action flicks. Well paced with big explosions, car chases, snappy quips and a high body count. Immensely entertaining.

Drive by shootings were a constant threat and violent crime was rife.Colours mostly follows two cops. The experienced and soon to retire McGavin (Robert Duvall) and new gung-ho, hotheaded rookie Hodges (Sean Penn). McGavin knows the streets and the right people on both sides of the law, Hodges just wants results quickly, and thinks McGavin is past it and should get out of his way. In the early scenes this tense dynamic comes to a head on more than one occasion as they jostle for control. Each of the two have their own moments of success and failure, they bicker and fight at times, each thinking the other has a lot to learn.Colours is less about a series of defined events than it is a month or two in the life of a couple of cops, they perform the normal duties that I must assume were required in the era, patrols, raids, questioning suspects and generally striving to keep the peace when all around resent them &#x96; even those they are trying to protect. McGavin has a strong relationship, almost a friendship with certain known gang members who give him snippets of information, in return he seems to leave them alone to take care of themselves.Eventually though the partners find themselves on the wrong side of some particularly naughty gang bangers (who include Don Cheadle and Damon Wayans), and they are subsequently targeted.

By necessity it does contain elements as mentioned above but they never seem forced or simply there for entertainment value.Colours is reasonably low key, gritty at times and deliberately paced. It is by no means the definitive LA Gang's film (Boyz in the Hood) but it is an interesting couple of house with solid performances and a fairly believable plot.

The Spaghetti Westerns peeked my interest for a while, but there have been very few in recent years that have caught my curiosity. This, however, is a different kettle of fish altogether. This is one of the few that I could watch several times over and still get something out of. Clint Eastwood really knows how to tell a story; I suppose while working with the likes of Sergio Leone, something had to rub off.

Word is put out that a bounty of One Thousand Dollars has been put up for the lives of the two perpetrators. A young man calling himself The 'Schofield Kid' hears about it but decides he might need some help. He calls on Bill Munny, a former gunfighter and asks him to come out of retirement. Bill is a reformed character, having married and raised a family, but with his wife recently deceased, he is tempted. He sends the kid on his way, but can't help thinking about it. Eventually he decides to follow and leaves his children to fend for themselves while he's away. He calls on his old partner, Ned Logan, and persuades him to join them. Meanwhile, back in the town, another gunslinger, English Bob, arrives and is given short shrift by Little Bill, who makes an example of him and sends him on his way. The trio finally arrive in town with Munny suffering from a fever. He is badly beaten up by Little Bill but not before the other two make contact with the whores.

I'll leave it there as I'm sure there are many out there that haven't seen this and I don't want a show-down with the spoiler police in my local saloon.As with many Eastwood-directed films, this has quite a slow and deliberate pace, but it is always interesting. I love the way he allows the story to evolve. As usual, an excellent performance from Clint Eastwood himself as Bill Munny. Also great were Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggett, Morgan Freeman as Ned Logan and Richard Harris as English Bob&#x85; but why they picked an Irish actor for the part I'll never know! Also worthy of note was Jaimz Woolvett as The 'Schofield Kid'.As I've already said, the storytelling is excellent and the characters are interesting and hold your attention. I get the impression they were looking for realism in the look of this picture and it does look like what I imagine the Wild West really was like. I just wish they had made the interior shots a little brighter, much of the action takes place at night or indoors and you can believe they are shooting by candle-light in some scenes, it's so dark! This is the thing that let this one down for me, I was struggling to see who was shooting who in some situations. But that aside, it's a very fine piece of work and fully deserved it's 4 Oscars (including best picture) and five other Oscar nominations.

His casual hippie-esque drawl is peppered with profanity and he calls almost everyone he meets, male or female Man. When dressed up he might wear a t-shirt and shorts, this is not often. Standard attire is an open robe and slippers.The Dude hasn't worked for some time and he lives a simple, meagre existence in rented accommodation with few friends. His only non-negotiables are bowling and White Russians, an alcoholic beverage.The Dudes only known friends are his bowling buddies, members of a league team, a league that they take extremely seriously.

He treats Donnie with disdain and almost always brings everything back to a Nam story.Donnie is the opposite, simple, friendly and curious, he is always questioning and inserting randomly pointless comments into proceedings (I am the Walrus).The fun starts with a case of mistaken identity, a message made for a Lebowski is served to the wrong Lebowski being The Dude's AKA, this leads him in turn to the right Lebowski, specifically the Big Lebowski for a chat.The chain of linked but totally unpredictable events that follows this simple mistake are realistically largely irrelevant to your enjoyment, aside from facilitating the introduction of various characters and providing The Dude and often Walter with a purpose for a short time. The convoluted plot is often broken up with insane yet totally entertaining dream sequences, generally bowling related and short sequences involving red herrings and bit characters, not the least of which is named The Jesus.Highlights though include- A ransom request leading to a botched payoff. - German nihilist pornographers - An inconvenient stolen car - A freaky naked feminist who paints via flying fox - A moustachioed cowboy narratorThe banter is often hilarious (and always profane), the ridiculous situations are often hard to follow but this never seems to matter anyway, and the cameos and brief go-nowhere scenes make the film even better (More highlights?

They did not grip my interest i did not care of them as i normally do in a movie such as this. I felt myself not caring when characters were killed which really disappointed me.

This movie is about a squad in world war 2 that is sent to save a man who had lost all his 3 brothers in the war. Since he was the only son left in his family the government made a decision to send a group of men to go save the last remaining son (Damon) of course on the way they lose men and face trials of humanity.Even though what i said above i still highly recommend this movie to everyone.

Five complete strangers that do not know each other team up for the perfect crime, they do not know each other's names but they got each other's numbers pegged. My film choice shows a theme of mistrust and deception. The main actors and their character names are as follows; Harvey Keitel as Larry Dimmick, a.k.a. Mr. White, Quentin Tarantino as Mr. Brown, Tim Roth as Freddy Newandyke, a.k.a. Mr. Orange, Eddie Bunker as Mr. Blue, Michael Madsen as Vic Vega, a.k.a. Mr. Blonde, Lawrence Tierney as Joe Cabot, Chris Penn as Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. The two main scenes that can give example of mistrust and deception are as follows. The first scene is the beginning scene were they are all sitting around having breakfast, the general conversation displays mistrust and deception as they interact with each other over and after breakfast telling stories and analyzing another movie they all have seen. The second scene is where Mr. White played by Harvey Keitel defends Mr. Orange played by Tim Roth; that he is not an undercover cop, against Nice Guy Eddie's and Joe's accusations that he is. Again throughout the entire breakfast setting in the introduction before the beginning credits roll displays the perfect example of dialogue displaying the theme's mistrust and deception. The angles also help when the story is unfolding different camera angles are used to show multiple scenes at once showing how things went and how the mistrust and deception muddies it up. The lighting and color also contribute a little you will have to view the movie for yourself to gain the display. The music that the movie is set to also helps display the mistrust and deception and set the mood to the theme as well. I liked how the non-linear use of the storyline in displayed, for me it makes the movies interesting. The violence is not too much for me as well. And the racist remarks just helps add depth to the character's showing the time era and up bringing that they had as children. The best scene if I have not mentioned it for an example of violence in the movie is the scene were Mr. Blonde played by Michael Madsen torture's the uniform cop for his mere amusement.Another movie that can be used as an example of all these things is Pulp Fiction. There are many scenes that best show the dialogue in the movie for me I like the scene were they are given names and some are OK with their names and others are not, e.g. Mr. Pink is all upset about having that name and wants to trade, one person will trade but the old man that put the crew together will not let them and then there is a whole discussion about why they cannot trade and why they have to keep the names they were given. Another good scene for dialogue is when you find out that one of them is an undercover cop place in the crew to bust them, it is the scene where he is meeting with his superior and giving him the low down on everyone and their names and providing as much background information on them as he can. Additionally, another good scene for dialogue is the scene were one of them finds out that he is and undercover cop and another sticks up for him, as they debate back and forth about him being a cop and him not being a cop, which in reality he is an undercover cop and man is that guy mad he stuck up for a cop. All and all this was a great movie and I am glad it was on the movie list. The motif's by most of the characters in the movie also greatly helps display the movies theme of mistrust and deception among the movies characters. Another good example of mistrust and deception is when the movie gives background on Tim Roth's character Mr. Orange on how he is an undercover cop. Another motif that moves the movies forward is accidents; which is a trademark style of the writer\/director Quentin Tarantino. I believe that Quentin Tarantino made certain scenes overly racist, vulgar, and\/or violent to purposely get a reaction from individuals in the audience.References Boggs, J. M. & Petric, D. W.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Fast Times is indeed great and I had been seriously ripped-off in my past viewings. In fact, it seemed like I was seeing the film for the first time! The story is set in a California high school in 1982. What makes Fast Times work so well is, despite the goofy Spicoli antics, it honestly attempts to depict the high school\/teenage experience in all it's glory & shame, good times & bad. Too many films of this ilk focus on raunchy shenanigans and go no deeper. Fast Times doesn't make this mistake. The film features quality characters with great depth and the viewer experiences (or re-experiences) the fun\/painful high school years through them. Although there's a little nudity and sexual explicitness it's not overkill and, besides, it belongs in a film that endeavors to honestly depict the high school experience, otherwise it wouldn't be true-to-life; in other words, it'd be a lie.Damone is a great character with his smooth-talking mesmerism. He strongly believes in putting on airs to succeed and conceals any weakness. If he falls flat, so to speak, he immediately covers-up and acts like nothing happened. Never advertise your failings or the savage wolves will tear you to pieces, he seems to think. Many of his pithy sayings & beliefs are absolutely true, e.g. Wherever you're at, that's the place to be. In other words, Live in the moment. Although he uses a girl as a sex object and swiftly loses a good friend & follower as a result, I found it interesting that he later genuinely apologizes, which shows humility and character. The friend then sees the humanity behind Damone's smooth-talk and properly opts to forgive & forget. This is great stuff.Another quality character is Stacy Hamilton, played excellently by Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's petite, cute and can cop an alluring expression for the object of her desire, which totals three in the story.The other characters are strong as well -- Stacey's likable older brother, Brad; the surfer dude Spicoli; the awkward-but-trying-hard Mark Rat Ratner; Stacey's sexy best friend, Linda (Phoebe Cates); etc.Late in the film we observe Stacey make a huge mistake and suffer the consequences. It's to the movie's merit that this episode is genuinely heart-wrenching, especially considering that the film's largely a comedy. Then her brother unexpectedly shows up, faithful and dependable; he doesn't say much but it's clear he loves his sister dearly. It's scenes like this that propel Fast Times head & shoulders above the competition.Another sequence that hits home is when a certain character humorously fantasizes about his dream girl, but it goes too far and... (I can't give it away, but it's totally hilarious and true-to-life).Then there's Spicoli's relationship with Mr. Hand. On the surface these two are nemeses, but we observe a different dimension to their relationship near the end when Mr. Hand has a tutoring session with Spicoli in his bedroom. The teacher is almost enlightened when he discovers that Spicoli actually understands the principles of history, it's just that he phrases the data according to his sub-cultural lexicon. Also, as unlikely as the tutoring session in Spicoli's bedroom seems, I had to do this when I was in high school due to a broken leg and literal body cast. An older gentleman would sit by my bed and tutor me a few times a week for a few months.Of course, the soundtrack is a highlight as well. Go to IMDb's soundtrack listing for all the songs, like We Got the Beat, Kashmir and Somebody's Baby. CONCLUSION Like I said, Fast Times is one of the best high school comedy-dramas out there, along with Dazed and Confused.

There are other countries in Asia and elsewhere where a movie like this simply could not be made even today because it glorifies individualism and standing up to authority. I mentioned in my comments on Baby Face how Warner Bros. was the studio that featured rebels and that broke social rules. This is a typical example, although the story would seem tame by today's standards. I'm not sure how it was received at the time, particularly by the Navy, but I doubt it generated a rash of mutinous behavior, in part because James Cagney's character was so thoroughly dislikable that few actual Navy captains could live down to such a standard. Nobody on this Navy ship respects the captain, and they only obey him grudgingly. And it is not a joke. More precisely, they detest him. How many countries would condone such a theme? The first time I saw this was as a youngster in a 16 mm screening to an audience of old Navy sea dogs (it was actually shown outdoors during a rendezvous on a beach). I have seen it many times over the years, and it still moves me. This is an unusual movie in that it is even more powerful when you do know the ending. And coming to know more about the history of WWII has increased my understanding of what people like this were going through.It's only weakness is that the acting of the secondary cast falls into a stylized form of some 50s movies that is not as realistic as in some modern movies. But Cagney's performance is so biting that you have to remind yourself he really was a human being off the set, and a gentle one, at that. This is a classic example of Fonda's cool, almost detached acting. We see a very young Jack Lemmon who is the precise opposite. And then there is the wise old doctor, William Powell, star of the 1930s, who retired after this film, who turns in a masterful, moving performance. He is the one who brings the most emotion to his role. With these four stars we see four different styles of acting, and strongly contrasting personalities, another mark of the individualism that makes this movie interesting.

Once there, he dons a white mask a huge butcher knife and and stalks babysitter Laurie Strode (Curtis) can Myers doctor Sam Loomis (Pleasence) save the residents of Haddonfield.Hot or Not Halloween has everything you want from a horror movie. It is perfectly directed, from the chilling opening credits with the pumpkin to the mysterious ending.The first 10 minutes are amazing and show great direction and camera skills and set up the rest of the film it opens the film to atmospheric brilliance.Carpenter manages to make a mundane town, desolate and terrifying the long location shots instantly make the viewer un easy even in the day time scenes. No matter when you watch the film Summer, Winter or Spring, it makes you feel Autumy, it makes it feel like Halloween. Another thing that makes this film creepy is the way the shape can move around in the day, it suggests that you are never safe day or night.The music in the film is brilliant, the piano is brilliant a score written by Carpenter and builds the tension amazingly. It is a score only rivalled my the Exorcist (1973).There isn't much gore here and it is not needed. Its good to see how horror films use to be made before the excessive gore of modern films.

Donald Pleasence (Loomis) gives a brilliant intense performance, his dialogue and one of lines are brilliant.Bottom Line Halloween is a must for anyone who says they love the Horror genre.

Therefore, he revolutionized the Industry of film-making, not the mentalities. He never made thought-provoking or introspective films like Apocalypse Now or Taxi Driver.This attachment to the past, to childhood cemented Spielberg's indisputable talent to entertain and touch hearts, genuinely or deliberately. Spielberg had a traditional view on film-making, which consecrated him when the 80's saw the return of a more conventional style. In the early 90's, he was the most successful director capable of the best like Duel, Jaws or The Color Purple, movies where, ironically, his touch was less present, as much as the worst like Hook which caricatured the Spielberg traits to the extreme.When Spielberg dilutes himself behind the camera, he can be incredible, when he indulged himself to express some sentimentality; it rarely worked after the 80's. That's why my favorite of his films, The Color Purple is the most misunderstood, why Jurassic Park will never surpass Jaws and why Saving Private Ryan is weak compared to the movie I'll review now  Schindler's List.SCHINDLER'S LIST The movie opens on a religious ceremony, the colors slowly fade, like a painful flash-back into an episode forever rooted in memories. And the black-and-white cinematography suggests the haunting presence of death in the minds of people whose only crime was to be Jewish and the hearts of us, viewers, whose only excuse was to be born after that tragedy. And there starts a tragedy of epic proportions following different levels of grief.DENIAL OF EVILNESS  When a one-armed old man is killed like an animal because he's useless for the Third Reich, I was caught by surprise. When kids were shot, I was shocked. And I have no words to describe the whole Krakovia Ghetto massacre sequence. The duality of horror as the most atrocious form of barbarity that contaminated civilized men ; how can a man who plays Bach or Mozart, exterminate a family with the same hand? Or a beautiful gift allowing sick people 'to never hear the gunshots'.ANGRY INCOMPREHENSION  One of the most despicable movie characters ever, Amon Goeth, whose leisure consisted on killing Jews in the most gratuitous way, doesn't even deserve to be called 'villain' as his evilness transcends any cinematic perception. The shooting of the engineer Diana Reiter is the part I couldn't get out of my mind, so unexpected, random and cold-blooded, the moment defines the torture endured by people in Concentration Camps, not just physical, but psychological, as any day could be the last one of your whole life, depending on the mood of an officer, or a defect in a gun.DEATH ACCEPTANCE  The absurd level of cruelty changes the very perception of death, and provides sometimes some sort of darkly comedic reliefs moments, like when a kid points his finger on the chicken thief who's 'coincidentally' the first man shot by Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes as the suave beast, who exercised his right to kill or spare like a Roman Emperor, perfectly captured the essence of evilness trapped in his own torments, probably loving his power more than hating the Jews, as the exaltation of a kind of bestial superiority.DEVASTATING SADNESS  The word 'depression' would be an indecent understatement, some passages are absolutely devastating, thanks to a direction, guilty of perfection, and John Williams' sober and emotional score. I understand this must have been painful for Spielberg, a man who loves children, to shoot the part where kids hid in a toilet hole, where the little girl in red 'reappeared', not to mention the gut-wrenching climactic shower scene. My heart was hysterically screaming with these women who thought it was the end.LIGHT OF HOPE  Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler as a man with a way with people and women in particular. However, his depiction is undermined by something betraying the ambitious nature of a War profiteer. This characterization proved to work for characters like Rick Blaine (there's something strangely Bogart-esque in the way Neeson holds his cigarette) but the subject here is too serious for glamorization. He's a businessman who thinks of interests, and progressively, his natural charisma will become providential. It's ironic how he, the German, and his Jewish assistant, Yitzhac Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, handle as a business project what will be one of the most generous and humanistic acts ever. Who saves one life, saves the humanity &#x85; CONCLUSION Whatever I said in this review concerning Spielberg loses its relevance when it comes to Schindler's list, his greatest film because it's probably the only one where you can find both the personal touch, and something that speaks for Humanity, to remember one of its most shameful pages.But the criticism starts again regarding the reception of Schindler's List. The film has been described with so many superlatives that I really question the sincerity of this immediate prestige and if it's not just proportional with the gravity of the subject. Does Schindler's List really deserve to be in the American Film Institute's Top 10? Is it really that iconic in American Pop Culture? I also read that Schindler's List was voted the best film ever made by the German film magazine 'Cinema', and it felt like the film was automatically praised as a way to make up for the guilt of having allowed these crimes to be committed. I hope I am wrong because I truly love Schindler's List, but I just don't like the simplistic and systematical way the movie is praised.But I sincerely hope the inspirational message of the film would inspire others about so many overlooked atrocities, just because some countries can't generate a film-maker with the same talent and influence as Steven Spielberg.

The shooting of the engineer Diana Reiter is the part I couldn't get out of my mind, so unexpected, random and cold-blooded, the moment defines the torture endured by people in Concentration Camps, not just physical, but psychological, as any day could be the last one of your whole life, depending on the mood of an officer, or a defect in a gun.DEATH ACCEPTANCE  The absurd level of cruelty changes the very perception of death, and provides sometimes some sort of darkly comedic reliefs moments, like when a kid points his finger on the chicken thief who's 'coincidentally' the first man shot by Amon Goeth. Ralph Fiennes as the suave beast, who exercised his right to kill or spare like a Roman Emperor, perfectly captured the essence of evilness trapped in his own torments, probably loving his power more than hating the Jews, as the exaltation of a kind of bestial superiority.DEVASTATING SADNESS  The word 'depression' would be an indecent understatement, some passages are absolutely devastating, thanks to a direction, guilty of perfection, and John Williams' sober and emotional score. I understand this must have been painful for Spielberg, a man who loves children, to shoot the part where kids hid in a toilet hole, where the little girl in red 'reappeared', not to mention the gut-wrenching climactic shower scene. My heart was hysterically screaming with these women who thought it was the end.LIGHT OF HOPE  Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler as a man with a way with people and women in particular. However, his depiction is undermined by something betraying the ambitious nature of a War profiteer. This characterization proved to work for characters like Rick Blaine (there's something strangely Bogart-esque in the way Neeson holds his cigarette) but the subject here is too serious for glamorization. He's a businessman who thinks of interests, and progressively, his natural charisma will become providential. It's ironic how he, the German, and his Jewish assistant, Yitzhac Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, handle as a business project what will be one of the most generous and humanistic acts ever. Who saves one life, saves the humanity &#x85; CONCLUSION Whatever I said in this review concerning Spielberg loses its relevance when it comes to Schindler's list, his greatest film because it's probably the only one where you can find both the personal touch, and something that speaks for Humanity, to remember one of its most shameful pages.But the criticism starts again regarding the reception of Schindler's List. The film has been described with so many superlatives that I really question the sincerity of this immediate prestige and if it's not just proportional with the gravity of the subject. Does Schindler's List really deserve to be in the American Film Institute's Top 10? Is it really that iconic in American Pop Culture? I also read that Schindler's List was voted the best film ever made by the German film magazine 'Cinema', and it felt like the film was automatically praised as a way to make up for the guilt of having allowed these crimes to be committed. I hope I am wrong because I truly love Schindler's List, but I just don't like the simplistic and systematical way the movie is praised.But I sincerely hope the inspirational message of the film would inspire others about so many overlooked atrocities, just because some countries can't generate a film-maker with the same talent and influence as Steven Spielberg.

By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain.Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoudé, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole).Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious.Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor.
