[{"date":"19 August 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek is a classic fairytale. It includes just about all of the typical features of such An evil king, a misunderstood individual, a merry and simple companion that proves to be an emotional savior, a dangerous journey, saving the princess and love triumphant. This has been done so many times resulting in so many cliches, and Shrek includes just about all of them. Even with this classic joy-killer it is still an extremely good movie, but why? I think the answer is Because it's really well done. They managed to take all of the classic traits and jam it in a movie that still seems new and innovative. The soundtrack is a strike of genius, making the movie seem modern against all odds. The dialogue is brilliant and the lead animated characters personality is brilliant and complete in all of its simplicity. Several scenes had me doubled over laughing, and even in the more serious scenes I still sat there with a headshake and a disbelieving smile because of the sheer brilliance of the new wrapping. My rating 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek is a classic fairytale.

The plot wanders and the messages are confused. The movie isn't funny. We sat in a nearly silent theatre listening to titters of embarrassment rather than the laughter of humor.

With amazing special effects,makeup and sound but unlike most big summer block-busters this has a great script and nearly tops the statue of liberty ending. The acting is great as well. Especially Tim Roth as the main villian General Thade. Behind Shrek,Evolution and Swordfish as quality films of the summer.
