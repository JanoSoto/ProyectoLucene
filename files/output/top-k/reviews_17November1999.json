But it is also scary as hell. Directed by George Sluizer, this foreign effort was completed in 1988, but never found a North American release until 1991 because it was feared that our audiences would never be to able handle the film's relentlessly grim and nihilistic tone. Indeed, Sluizer tried to gain more exposure for this highly acclaimed piece of work by directing a remake of it in 1993, but the film was a cliched, Hollywoodized disaster that angered fans of the original by changing its ending - which was one of the most shocking ever put into a movie. But while this grave artistic mistake effectively put an end to Sluizer's promising career, the bright side of it all is that it only upped the realization that the original Vanishing was one-of-a-kind masterpiece. All traditional genre cliches are chucked right out the window in this film. The story involves a Dutchman named Rex, who goes on vacation in France with his girlfriend, Saskia. The opening scenes establish how happy this couple is, but things suddenly take a turn for the worst, when they stop off at a gas station and Saskia disappears. We soon come to realize how big a nightmare a situation like this can be as Rex searches around for her in panic, and learns the horrifying news that she was seen leaving with another man. Three years pass by and Rex is still searching for her. His obsession takes over his life and sidetracks his relationship with another woman. During the opening scenes, we catch a brief glimpse of Raymond Lemorne, the man responsible for Saskia's disappearance, and soon after, the story switches to his perspective. It is here that The Vanishing establishes itself as a thriller that will be unlike all the rest, as Lemorne is presented as one of the most frightening but complex villains ever put on film. A successful and seemingly ordinary teacher with a loving wife and two daughters, his villainous actions is only provoked by that the fact that there is, quite simply, nothing that can technically stop him from doing so. He is very smart, but not exactly perfect at what he does. There are scenes in this movie that manage to be both funny and chilling at the same time as Lemorne practices his kidnapping routine, and then pathetically tries to lure young women into his car without any success. His scheme fails many times until he meets Saskia.This may sound like pretty nihilistic stuff, but as stated in the opening paragraph, it is all done with a complete absence of violence and gore. Much of The Vanishing's impact is produced from what we imagine rather than what we can see. The film may not seem that suspenseful at first glance, but the tension builds up so subtly that by the time the film is over, one is surprised at how drained they actually are. Sluizer's storytelling genius stems from the fact that the audience is so anxious to find out what happened to Saskia, yet when the truth finally arrives, we are almost wishing he hadn't told us. Even Rex, who has had his life completely taken over by his obsession about Saskia's fate, ends up realizing that he would have been better off not knowing either. I will not go into the specifics about the ending of the film, only to say that it is one of the most shocking you will ever see - and therefore, one of the best. Unlike most twist endings, it manages to pull off the supremely difficult feat of seeming both surprising and inevitable at the same time. Even if you can't stand the concept of subtitles, all fans of the thriller genre are urged to check the original Vanishing out at all costs. It will make you think twice before ever making contact with a stranger again.

At the same time, there is present a level of comedy that cannot be escaped.  Viewing it carelessly will produce the idea that the film is a dark and serious film peppered with moments of bizarre physical comedy and the odd pratfall.  Watching more closely reveals that the film is much tighter and more consistent than it might first appear to be.The performances, also, are superb.  Peter Sellers is simply wonderful in all three of his roles (and while I have a hard time imagining it, I bet he would have been great in Pickens's role as well).  George C. Scott takes a script which makes the military look ridiculous (and more than a little disturbing) and milks it to the bone, pulling every ounce of power out of a finely crafted piece of writing.

Some might complain that it's slow in places, and I suppose that's fair.  But I wouldn't cut or trim a thing.  The long scenes of procedure aboard the plane are absolutely crucial, since the film is about the inanities of military procedure.  The long scenes of dialogue in the war room are absolutely crucial because the film is about the inanities of government decision making.

Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view, you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever.  But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  The story doesn't end when the credits roll.

But I really don't think that is what I want to touch on in this review, after all anyone reading the El Mariachi page probably already knows about the film.  What needs to be said, and I know others have said it before me, but in my own words I have to say thank you.  Thank you to Robert Rodriguez for having the sheer will to make this film.  Every once in a while underdogs come around in film and they inspire many people to realize their dream.  In years past there were guys like Sylvester Stallone that wrote Rocky in three days after seeing an unknown boxer go the distance with the champ.  He held out selling the film because he wanted to play Rocky.  The rest they say is history.  In 1978 John Carpenter had a low budget of under a quarter of a million dollars and he scared the hell out of everyone with what I believe is the scariest film ever made, Halloween.  You have Spike Lee making the film School Daze on a shoestring budget only for us, the audience, to see what a gift he has behind the camera, the rest they say is history.  Then you have Tarantino that got his lucky break because someone he knew knew someone who knew Harvey Keitel's wife and she got a hold of the script and gave it to Harvey and then Reservoir Dogs was made and the rest they say is history.  Then there is Kevin Smith and his $27000 film Clerks that was made on credit cards and loans.  Now Smith is in the big time with movies like Dogma.  Kevin Smith in my opinion is one the best writers in the game today.  The rest they say is history with him as well.  And who can forget Daniel Myrick and Ed Sanchez.  With $35000 they redefined horror and filming techniques by making the Blair Witch Project.  Their filming techniques were completely unorthodox and the film went on to gross a staggering 140 million dollars in North America alone.  And then of course there is Robert Rodriguez.  A guy that was basically a lab rat for three weeks and used the money to film this film.  This is a guy that was just hoping his film would get some small Mexican-straight-to-video deal.  But then an exec sees it and decides that with a little work, this film could be quite good.  And the rest they is history.  Guys like Robert Rodriguez and all the other people mentioned here are guys to look up to, guys to admire.  They had a dream and they pursued it relentlessly and they succeeded.  Perserverance is almost a euphanism for success.  Maybe not at first but if you keep trying then possibly someday all your hard work will pay off.  Look at Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  They have both been in Hollywood for years with small parts in various films.  Finally somehow Robin Williams gets a hold of Good Will Hunting and they are Oscar winners.  For every film like Titanic and Phantom Menace, you occassionally get films like El Mariachi and Clerks.  This is why the smaller films, although lacking in budget and technical areas, are sometimes better and more exciting and cared for than a studio sized budgetted movie.  Because the people that make them care.  Look at Tobe Hooper and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, no budget, no lighting, no actors and yet one of the scariest films ever made.  Sam Raimi, director of A Simple Plan and For Love of the Game.  Back in the early 80's he made a film called Evil Dead for $50000.  It was one hell of a scary film and people noticed.  Now he is not neccessarily an A-list director but he is thought of when projects are mentioned.  Wes Craven made Last House on the Left in 1972 with the future producer and director of Friday the 13th, Sean Cunningham.  While the film was a gut wrenching experience, it had no backing by the studios and it was made for next to nothing, yet it succeeded and now look at Craven.  His Scream franchise is one of the hottest properties in the game right now.  I mention all of these along with Robert Rodriguez because they all share a passion for film.  They all started off with humble beginnings and succeeded when they shouldn't have.  Rodriguez may be the best story of the bunch.  It's guys like him and others that are mentioned that should be remembered when you are going for your dream, whether it be with film or with whatever you choose in life.  I have been personally affected by guys like Rodriguez and Tarantino and Stallone and Affleck and Damon and Carpenter and Raimi and Kevin Williamson and so on.  You can look at guys like this and see them for the relentless spirit and passion that they have to get the job done.  They inspire me to pursue my dream and hopefully one day in the near future, people on the IMDb will be reviewing my work and saying how it was cool that the Dan guy pursued his dream and succeeded.  And if that happens then I can look to guys like Robert Rodriguez and say thank you for inspiring me to go for it.  When a guy sacrifices his mind and body for three weeks at a drug testing clinic so he make a movie, well that is about all the inspiration I need.  I just wanted to take this brief time out of my day to say thank you to Rodriguez and every other person that has given it their all and fulfilled their dream of film.  You have kept me entertained and you have given me a dream and hope.  That is the best education that you can give to anyone looking to fulfill their dream.  This film may have cost $7,000 to make but it has put Rodriguez on the map of Hollywood and it has inspired me and many others to go for it ourselves.

But I really don't think that is what I want to touch on in this review, after all anyone reading the El Mariachi page probably already knows about the film.  What needs to be said, and I know others have said it before me, but in my own words I have to say thank you.  Thank you to Robert Rodriguez for having the sheer will to make this film.  Every once in a while underdogs come around in film and they inspire many people to realize their dream.  In years past there were guys like Sylvester Stallone that wrote Rocky in three days after seeing an unknown boxer go the distance with the champ.  He held out selling the film because he wanted to play Rocky.  The rest they say is history.  In 1978 John Carpenter had a low budget of under a quarter of a million dollars and he scared the hell out of everyone with what I believe is the scariest film ever made, Halloween.  You have Spike Lee making the film School Daze on a shoestring budget only for us, the audience, to see what a gift he has behind the camera, the rest they say is history.  Then you have Tarantino that got his lucky break because someone he knew knew someone who knew Harvey Keitel's wife and she got a hold of the script and gave it to Harvey and then Reservoir Dogs was made and the rest they say is history.  Then there is Kevin Smith and his $27000 film Clerks that was made on credit cards and loans.  Now Smith is in the big time with movies like Dogma.  Kevin Smith in my opinion is one the best writers in the game today.  The rest they say is history with him as well.  And who can forget Daniel Myrick and Ed Sanchez.  With $35000 they redefined horror and filming techniques by making the Blair Witch Project.  Their filming techniques were completely unorthodox and the film went on to gross a staggering 140 million dollars in North America alone.  And then of course there is Robert Rodriguez.  A guy that was basically a lab rat for three weeks and used the money to film this film.  This is a guy that was just hoping his film would get some small Mexican-straight-to-video deal.  But then an exec sees it and decides that with a little work, this film could be quite good.  And the rest they is history.  Guys like Robert Rodriguez and all the other people mentioned here are guys to look up to, guys to admire.  They had a dream and they pursued it relentlessly and they succeeded.  Perserverance is almost a euphanism for success.  Maybe not at first but if you keep trying then possibly someday all your hard work will pay off.  Look at Matt Damon and Ben Affleck.  They have both been in Hollywood for years with small parts in various films.  Finally somehow Robin Williams gets a hold of Good Will Hunting and they are Oscar winners.

Now, he lives with his son and his new girlfriend (Hope Davis), one of his students.  One day, when he comes back at home, he finds a boy with blood on him and he will save his life.  The boy's parents (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack) become friends with the Faradays.  Their son will play with the other son.  And all of them live on the Arlington Road. But Michael will start to suspect Oliver (Robbins) of being a terrorist.  He will make researches and will learn several things about him.  So, this is a story of paranoia and terrorism.Well, most of the time, terrorism is badly exploited in film.  They are always big action films with a happy end and stupid unreal characters. Arlington Road surprised me a lot.  Ehren Kruger made a wonderful script with an intense story and without clichés.  Michael is a teacher, a job always represented by women, and his wife was a FBI agent, always men.  This is very good and much more interesting because of its originality.  The way the story is developed is extremely well.  The end is fantastic.  There is hope for anti-Hollywood people like me, there is finally a writer who does not apply to the stupid rules and he is great.  When I learn that he was the one who wrote the final draft of Scream 3, I was stunned and so happy.  It will not be cliché and predictable.  The last ones wasn't, but I agree about their choice so Scream 3 will not be like I Still Know&#133; Also the characters are realistic and human.  The movie is of course unpredictable, the ending especially.  Well, this is the best movie I have ever seen about terrorism.The interpretation by Jeff Bridges is totally intense and powerful.  He is great and realistic in the movie.  It's the same thing for Hope Davis, Joan Cusack and Tim Robbins. They are perfect in their role.  For the movie director, he gave a special style to the movie that I like a lot.  I played with the light to give a more negative, cold atmosphere.  The beginning, just before the credits, is wow.  The boy walk in the middle of the street, and it is beautifully filmed.  All the rest is good, except for one scene where it seemed to exaggerate, when Michael go to the Oliver house when he searches his kid.Well, the power of the film is in the story and everything.  The violence is present of course but it is intense and extremely sad because of the absence of clichés.  Most reviews I read on the site were not good because they didn't like the end.  Well, I am not happy by the end, but it's reality, we do not choose who will die and who will not.  The cinema is there to make the spectators escape from reality, but also to denounce things in it, and Arlington Road does it very well.  People will just have to change their point of view on the cinema and they will see that the end of this movie is better than most of the end of other films that I won't tell you (I mean almost all the films of the summer).Finally, this movie is one of the best of the summer, it is more specifically the second best.  I also believe that people will try to write more unconventional suspense and stories like Arlington Road.  I think it is the next step to improve a lot American cinema, but again, this is my opinion.Don't miss this film.  9\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"17 November 1999","score":"","review":"  Arlington Road is the story of a man, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) who loses his FBI agent wife.

If you like bad dreams then you will love this movie. And like most dreams, most of it doesn't make much sense.BackgroundI am a 24 year old male engineering and computer science student living in SC. I do have a large humanities background.OverviewThis is a long movie, over two and a half hours I think. And in some ways it is pleasing to watch... Your eyes will love this movieThere is a lot of dream imagery in this movieOh, look at her run through the field of green flowers, and now red flowers, and now blue flowers, and now yellow flowers, and let's not forget the purple flowers. How about some pretty clouds too? Yes, you get to see almost ten minutes of cloud footage. Happy clouds, sad clouds, angry clouds... you name them this movie has 'em. More eye-candy! Yes, there is blood, blood, and more blood. Even the maps bleed in this movie. How many ways can you kill someone without modern weapons? Answer See this movie and you will know. Okay, okay, they might have left one or two ways out but that is it. Slow motion! The movie wouldn't have nearly taken so long if it played at full speed. But since half of it is a dream you have to watch that half in sllooowwww motion...I must admit listening to everyone talk is fun. There is one warrior whose voice is so impressive I want to give this movie a 7 instead of a 6. And Joan's voice is good too.And that was the good part...Your brain will hate this movieThe movie gets a lot of things wrong by trying to do too much. In the end it does a lot of things, but none of them. It builds up a way of looking at something, only to turn around and tear it down. And again in the end there isn't much left. Of her army or of the movie...It could have had a really cool King Arthur Knights of the Round Table kind of story where the hero is the chosen instrument of God sent to set things right and save the king and the country. Now wouldn't that have been nice and worth seeing, but no... Amazingly nothing ever happens to the characters you dislike. The manipulating step-mother keeps her son, the future king of France under her thumb and that's that. Don't not like her too much cause nothing is ever going to happen to her in this story. And it is definitely not Cinderella. Not only is there no happy ending, but the ending doesn't even make sense!Basically Joan is torn down by her countrymen, her enemies, and herself in the end. Built-up and then torn-down. She's their hero one minute and then she's just a heathen the next minute.There is a graphic murder-rape scene right from the start that makes the movie a little hard to take. I have a bad opinion of movies that have rape scenes, especially when you aren't sure why they have them. It's a little too much of a sex scene for me. And if they want a sex scene they should just have a sex scene.It really isn't a horrible movie. It just had some big problems. If I had it to do over again I would have still watch it. It does have something to offer. But I still wouldn't have liked the movie overall.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.

I have a bad opinion of movies that have rape scenes, especially when you aren't sure why they have them. It's a little too much of a sex scene for me. And if they want a sex scene they should just have a sex scene.It really isn't a horrible movie. It just had some big problems. If I had it to do over again I would have still watch it. It does have something to offer. But I still wouldn't have liked the movie overall.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.

He finally got the opportunity to direct some lighter material for once, and the final result was Music of the Heart, a feel good movie starring Meryl Streep as a woman who teaches the violin to underprivileged schoolchildren (!). Despite my attitude towards this subject matter, I shall reserve judgement on Craven's latest career choice since I have not yet seen the film (and have very little desire to do). I will just wish Mr. Craven success in his new genre and hope that his venture into lighter material is much more successful than his previous attempt in 1982, which gave us a lackluster film called Swamp Thing.Prior to Music of the Heart, this was the only PG-rated film Craven ever did, and was his attempt to appeal to younger audiences. Unfortunately, the end result is a very cheap and sloppy picture. Now, Craven is a director who can actually use cheapness and sloppiness to enhance the effectiveness of his films (see Last House on the Left, an all-time fave), but here, his shortcomings leave you frustrated and often bored. The film is marred by a very lame and corny screenplay, and (as you might've guessed) unconvincing makeup effects. Of course, any film involving a guy running around in a rubber suit can be fun, but Craven makes the fatal mistake of taking his material way too seriously. Shooting this film in the swamp was reportedly a real nightmare for him, thanks to poor planning by the studio, and when he realized that the conditions would make it impossible to make a movie that was convincing enough for one to take seriously, there should have been some major re-writes to the script. Still, despite the flaws at the production level, the actors are still fun to watch. Louis Jourdan is wonderfully campy as the mad villain, Dr. Arcane, and who wouldn't enjoy the sight of the bouncy heroine, Adrienne Barbeau, running around for half the picture? And, of course, the film also earns a few merit points for the most welcome presence of David Hess, as Arcane's main henchman, though the PG rating prevents him from doing what he does best. Overall, Swamp Thing is a film that young kids may enjoy, but those who have sat through and loved Last House or The Hills Have Eyes are going to be in for a huge letdown.

These are not very attractive people, from a personality point of view.  Eddie is neurotic, paranoid, and manipulative.  Mickey is calculatingly manipulative. Phil is dangerously unstable.  Darlene is by turns endearingly flighty and ruthlessly self-centered.  Yet all of them live and breathe in front of you. Even if you've never met someone like Eddie, you know he's out there. They're all out there.  With any luck, they don't hang out together.Okay, so it's dialogue driven.  Stop whining, already.  Just enjoy the beautiful language.  It's easy to craft a detailed character through action.. Try doing it through words.  Then, throw in deliberate as well as unconscious self- and other-deception.  If, after all that, your characters are still clear and true, you are as strong a writer as David Rabe.Three acts, clearly visible in the film.  The first is, as first acts generally are, mainly to set-up the characters, their relationships, etc. It's also very funny (the cell phone scene, just to name the most obvious). More important than establishing the characters, which is done remarkably quickly, this act establishes the tone of the piece.  You know what these people's lives are about.  Everything that happens later in the film, as impossible as it is to predict, and every background detail that is added along the way, slips snugly into the framework as initially established.The second act is the funniest.  It's one year later, and not much has changed.  This fact alone is rather disturbing.  As manipulative and coldly backstabbing as Mickey is, Eddie is still living with him in some sort of (adequate) friendship.  What does that tell you?  This act also introduces the biggest surprise of the film... Meg Ryan.  I never knew she was an actress.  Well, learn something new every day.  The dramatic arc of this act is a wonder to behold.  It's all one sequence, with no significant temporal gaps at all.  It's all dialogue, without even the frenetic scene changes of act one to provide the illusion of forward moving action.  And it's brilliant.  Act two, as vital as it is to the overall development of the film as a whole, could stand magnificently on its own.  Act three takes these lives, these strained relationships, and attacks them with a crow bar, smashing them apart.  Phil's death, the initial catalyst of the final collapse.  Eddie's ultimate break-down.  The return of Donna from act one, far wiser, in a way, but no less lost than Eddie when you get right down to it.Does Eddie learn in the end that he underappreciated his true friends Phil and Artie?  He thinks he does, but he doesn't.  The tragedy of this film is not the senseless death of Phil, it's the senseless life of Eddie.Throughout the whole film he's barely staying afloat, not making progress but not quite going under.  He goes under (literally), is rescued (miraculously), and is returned to his point of departure.  What happens one year later when he sinks again?

At the theater where I saw this movie, there were picketing protesters calling this film Anti-Catholic and Anti-God. This is religious satire folks. It is supposed to be taken with a grain of salt. Among the complaints against this movie, the main one was the character Bethany, a Catholic who works in an abortion clinic. That was inserted in the film for its absurdity. It depicts a woman who does not know any more where her faith is. She, like so many, attends church out of obligation. She doesn't really know what she believes any more, though. Hence, she feels no guilt in that her Catholic faith and her job conflict. The film was not in any way trying to make a statement about abortion. Some great works of literature are religious satire, and they are still read and studied at high schools and universities without this kind of c**p from ignorant protesters. What I find most ironic is that by protesting this film, many Catholics are proving the point that the movie makes. They are blindly following their church without weighing the facts themselves (i.e. see the movie before you complain about it).Enough on the topic of ignorance, though. This is supposed to be a review.I found Dogma to be outrageously funny and thought provoking. However, it was a bit slow, and I found the last scene depicting God as a ditzy young woman to be pretty stupid. Kevin Smith's script is brilliant, though. As is made evident by Chasing Amy and Clerks, Smith has a flair for combining slapstick comedy with raw philosophical discussion. Mallrats was strictly comedy, but it was quite good as well. The film's funniest moments include Matt Damon's overly dramatic executions of sinners. He has some great one-liners in these scenes, particularly the one in the conference room. Silent Bob and Jay steal the show, though. When they first appeared, the audience in the theater where I saw Dogma erupted in applause. You can't even look at them without laughing. Chris Rock was great as the thirteenth apostle, omitted from the bible because he was black. His comic talent was underused, though. Another character that I wish I had seen more of was Jason Lee as the demon Azrael. Lee stole the show in Mallrats, but his comic ability was missing in this movie. Overall, this film is an outstanding religious satire that raises some very important questions about faith. Do Christians follow God or do they just follow their church? I think that the response from the Catholic church to this movie shows that far too often it is the latter choice. However, Smith himself is Catholic. By making this movie, I believe he is presenting a challenge to his fellow Catholics to do more thinking on their own. I give this movie an 8\/10 because of the poor ending. Were it not for that, it would get a 9 or even a 10. However, it's definitely worth seeing whatever your faith.

Also, the legions of film critics that down the movie on the basis of knowing nothing about Pokemon. The most frequent complaint I hear from critics is that the main focus of everything Pokemon is fighting, yet the movie tries to teach that fighting is wrong.  Anyone that is familiar with the show should realize that the nature of the ending battle royale is very different from the regular battles seen on TV.

I'm not saying this movie sucked (though my husband, who I dragged to go see it, thought so) not at all. It just didn't live up to my expectations, and to the screenplay I read. In all fairness, I had fairly high expectations. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as American Beauty, but I was expecting it to be one of my 5 favorite movies of the year. I read the screenplay at least a year ago-maybe more like a year and a half-when it first got put online. I wasn't a big Kevin Smith fan at the time but I needed something to read. It just blew me out of the water, I was laughing my butt off and thinking how brilliant it was. Unfortunately, lots of the scenes I was looking at the most either weren't filmed or ended up on the cutting room floor. I do remember reading that the first cut was around 3 hours, so obviously they had to do a lot of trimming. But man, cutting out the Fat Albert scene? Now THAT scene would have been politically incorrect and blasphemous.Speaking of that, I don't see what all the protesters are so riled up about. I guess I could see Disney being not too amused by the Mooby boardroom scene, but it wasn't any more offensive than Life of Brian. Also, all they're doing is drumming up publicity.Anyway, I've talked to a few people who felt the same as I did- we all read the screenplay and liked the movie OK, but felt let down. We all agreed that the script was brilliant.The special effects were pretty low-rent too- lots of the cool stuff I saw on News Askew didn't even end up in the movie. The angel wings looked good, but the rest...looked too low-budget. I know people are gonna get super-p****d at me for saying that, but I was really surprised at how kind of slapped-together most of it looked.The acting was fine--Chris Rock and Salma Hayak stood out, but I'll see a movie just to see them. Chris Rock, well, it seemed like after his first scene they sort of didn't know what to do with him. Jay and Silent Bob I never was too amused by before, but I loved them in this, especially Bob's facial expressions. Janeane Garafolo was underused. Fiorentino I like, but she got on my nerves at some points.  Alan Rickman was great. George Carlin was also hilarious. Affleck and Damon- they were better than I thought. Ben Affleck is actually more talented than I gave him credit for. IN fact, by the end of the movie he was pretty sexy--wait, what the hell is wrong with me?But anyway, it just didn't come together.When someone asked what I thought of it right after the movie, I thought and finally said, It was just kind of all over the map.The audience was packed full of Kevin Smith fans who lovedJay and Silent Bob, but even the most diehard fans didn't laugh when Bob took care of the Golgotha monster. There was just this kind of awkward silence in the theater. A couple people even booed. No-one clapped after it was over--and I saw some people walking out with the same let down expression as me. I think when you've been looking forward to a movie for over a year, that's bound to happen to a certain extent.Like I said, not a terrible movie by any means. I think it's Smith's best yet, but he could have done better. I wish I'd had more fun seeing this movie than I did--I really wanted to.

The world of Soylent Green could become the reality of tomorrow.Yes, the film is flawed. It does have that 70s Deco feel. Everything isn't fully explained...like why some people are still allocated so much room while others are crumpled in the streets.Despite its flaws, this movie is definitely worth repeated viewing. Its best scenes are the beginning title sequence, the intense going home scene and the scene where Thorn brings home some strawberries to Sol. If you watch this movie, pay close attention to these spectacular and moving scenes.I absolutely love this movie. It shows that a film can have the courage to try and look at a very possible future and not sugarcoat anything.

I think I have the sort of imagination which can cope with the 'suspension of disbelief' required to enjoy most fiction\/horror.But sorry folks. It just *is not frightening*. Nope. No siree. Not even the finale rescues it. Sure, the potential for tension and fear are there, but the best ingredients are not played up enough, not allowed to development. And though there are brilliant (and totally convincing) scenes of the group's developing hysteria  (the actors, especially the girl, give creditable performances), the whole is somehow soul-less.I'm fascinated by the supernatural, and have seen films which leave me feeling pretty vulnerable and uneasy. But not this one.  The required suspension of disbelief isn't enough to make you feel sympathy for the group (maybe it's the fact that they're so ill-prepared for what happens? I don't know).Full marks to the marketing men; this might have been a good 20 minute short. But if it does force a re-evaluation in Tinsel Town then maybe it will have done some good (apart from to the pockets of the producers...).If anyone out there really fainted with fright whilst watching this movie I recommend they find a boy scout to help them next time they try to cross a busy main road.
