I figured then, that I'd take this moment to finally flesh out the reasons why Spielberg's critically, well... criticized film has held my interest for so long.First off, going in, one has to understand that this is foremost a children's movie. That said, the adult themes introduced (ie. parental neglect, childhood rebellion, suicide, murder, revenge, forbidden love, etc.) all add a mature quality that takes this film a step above, say, Disney's hokey rendition of the Peter Pan story. Painting Peter as an adult, unaware of his origins, lost in a world of politics and material things (he's a lawyer, in essence a pirate by society's standards), ultimately makes him the polar opposite of his childhood self, thus necessitating the greatest change possible of the character by the end of the narrative. And giving him kids with whom he's all but estranged, but must travel to Neverland and face his past in order to rescue? Brilliant.Secondly, the setting. Some might call it corny, others might call it fake and contrived... I think that the feeling you get when you enter the world of Neverland for the first time isn't far from the feeling you get walking into a large theater. With set pieces hanging, and props laid out, and lights casting shadows onto decorated walls. You know it's artificial, but there's a certain magic about it because of that. Peter Pan was originally written as a play, and having Neverland mirror a stage set brings the enchanting story of Peter Pan back to its foundation. Everything from the Lost Boys' tree to Captain Hook's ship gives that same synthetic impression of a dreamlike world imitating reality. Which, in principle, is what Neverland was from the beginning.Also, how can I not talk about the casting? Robin Williams stars as Peter Pan, and he's not only at the top of his comedic game here, but he's nearly at the top of his career. In the early nineties, his name was synonymous with laughter, and children knew his face like they know Ben Stiller's now. He was ultimately a boy who wouldn't grow up. The perfect man to play Pan's adult self. And Captain Hook? Dustin Hoffman personifies Peter's nemesis perfectly. No other portrayal of the villainous Neverlander has been so spot on. The dark humor inherent in his performance is captivating and real, and leaves me shivering now the way it left me shivering when I was six. 'Pretty Woman' Julia Roberts even steals the show and adds a romantic tension that we feel just beneath the surface... giving Neverland a taboo sexiness that we've never really experienced before.Finally... and I'm sure I missed dozens of minor elements that make this film what it is, but it would be nothing without the incredible score by John Williams. He captures every possible tone of this film with brilliant complexity. From the title screen to the epic Hook versus Pan battle at the movie's climax, the entire musical composition is like a living organism. Breathing along with the action of the film in perfect rhythm.So yeah. That's why this movie is so awesome. And yes, I've seen all other versions of Peter Pan, and I've read the original script Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up by author J.M. Barrie, and I have to say that Hook does the original source material the most justice in every way.

If they offered you enough money for the rights to a story, you drove to the California border and stopped. You threw the contract to those on the other side. They threw you back a check. Then you got back in the car and raced away.That must be what happened here. Well, if you don't know or admire the story, which is among Hemingway's best, maybe you won't find this abortion as troubling as I did.The short story open with a blunt, pregnant, italicized paragraph about the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard found near the snowy top of Africa's highest mountain. It's not posed as a riddle or anything. It just floats there and shimmers, unconnected to the narrative. Hemingway's story then briefly sketches in the professional quandary and love life of a promising writer who's gest for perfection failed and who now lies dying in a remote African hunting camp. The story ends with the writer hallucinating his departure on a rescue airplane. The hallucination is convincing until the surrealistic ending when the pilot turns and looks at his passenger with a bizarre grin and makes some remark about flying right into the sunrise.The writer of this screenplay, Casey Robinson, has Hollywoodized everything and the director, Henry King, hasn't helped. It's a soap opera with a couple of incidents in Africa to please those in the audience expecting some sort of adventure to go with their romance.I really can't go on about this tripe. I'll give one example, which has no more to do with the story than any other example would. Gregory Peck, the writer, is searching for his lost love, Ava Gardner. He tries to visit her in Madrid but the hotel is closed due to the Spanish Civil War. He finds himself swept up into one of the armies, with no tedious explanations of why or how. The war is being fought all over the country but Peck accidentally finds Gardner wounded, lying half under a spilled ambulance on a battlefield. Gardner has been praying, Oh, mother of God, please let Harry find me. But just as he's kneeling over her, finally confessing his deep love, the medics arrive and begin to cart her off. Peck rushes after them but an officer, believing him to be a deserter, shoots Peck in the leg. Last shot of this wretched scene -- a wounded Peck hobbling after the departing stretcher, shouting for them to stop, before falling to the ground, unable to continue.If you can sit through this, you'll really enjoy the rest of the movie. The script makes a great deal out of that scintillating first paragraph. It's become a riddle which Peck solves. He even spells out the solution in case you might miss it. And at the end, instead of Death flying him off into a blinding sun, the vultures fly away, Peck lives, and triumphant music swells on the sound track. Everybody is happy. Even Hemingway, who may have hated the way Hollywood sanitized his work but who happily cashed its checks.

I say this as a former fan of Nicholson. However, revisiting his films as an adult, I've realized he's not playing anyone but himself. Hell, his name in almost all his movies are Jack. Ponder why? Heath Ledger completely changed the role of The Joker with his performance. It easily outshines Nicholson, without trying. Why? Because Ledger wasn't ever a villain, really. He never was psychotic. He became The Joker. Nicholson did the same old song and dance.Joel Schumacher is probably 60% at fault for ruining the franchise of Batman, but Burton is not innocent. Michael Keaton was the definitive Bruce Wayne, but never ever was I convinced that nobody couldn't figure out he was Batman.

A friendship that exceeds all of the preconceptions. I agree that this is a tale of happiness under tragic circumstances. Plus, it portrays an ignorant side of society. Many believe that AIDS is strictly a gay disease and transmittable through the air and mock and treat miserably those who have it. This movie can teach us all many lessons and morals.This story is about two unlucky boys with different personalities and some problems in common (both are rejected and unwelcome by society). Erik is, I assume, 12 years old (like Brad Renfro himself back then), an easy target for a bunch of dorks and his mother is a horrible person and ignorant (and so is his unseen grandmother). Erik's neighbor Dexter is 11 (like Joseph Mazzello at the time). Dexter has a loving mother but he is a cursed child. He is very nice and sweet but he got AIDS from a blood transfusion when he was a baby and just because of his illness he is treated by the ignorants as if he was a plague. This is Dexter's drama. Poor Dexter!Erik and Dexter got off to a bad start but Erik quickly learns to like and respect Dexter and they become great friends. Together they live adventures and moments of fun and happiness at the same time they attempt to find a cure to save Dexter. Their friendship has no boundaries and both find out they're braver than they ever imagined, as their courage helps them in sticky situations. Erik gives Dexter a chance to live life as it should be lived.There is a number of heartwarming moments, such as the scene when Erik gives his tennis shoe to Dexter to comfort him and make him feel safer. Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line «My blood is like poison» and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital.During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter «Are you ready for another victim?» and Dexter smiles and nods Yes, the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it.The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter.Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was.

Another part that gets me every time is the tense sequence when Dexter stabs his hand and says the haunting line «My blood is like poison» and gets far weaker after this bravery act and has to be taken to a hospital.During Dexter's stay at the hospital, there are some fun moments which serve as a perfect comic relief under a tragic circumstance. The boys prank the doctors that Dexter is unconscious in two occasions. Dexter scares the hell out of the doctors and laughs a lot. But in a 3rd attempt to prank them, when Erik asks Dexter «Are you ready for another victim?» and Dexter smiles and nods Yes, the sad irony is that Dexter no longer wakes up. The cure is not found. The nice tyke doesn't make it.The two boys take the movie all by themselves and shine like stars Brad Renfro as Erik and Joseph Mazzello as Dexter.Brad Renfro was talented and always looked mature for his age. That and the fact that his voice sounded mature for the age made him look some years older than he really was. Shame he did put himself in a bad spot few years after this movie was made and passed away early.Joseph Mazzello always proved to be a fine young actor. He is simply wonderful in this serious role. And he was a very cute kid and had the cutest and most adorable voice, along with Judith Barsi.Annabella Sciorra's acting as Linda also deserves my praise. The soundtrack is worth of my praise too, it sounds so peaceful-minded, fits perfectly in the mood of the film. This movie is a classic, deserves much better luck than it got.Title in Portugal 'Laços de Amizade'.

The problem is that with Hoffman, work and career have always come first, and he hardly knows his son.

In the end of our self made choices we carry them on, living life with that knowledge. Sophie (Streep), a Polish immigrant had made so many choices in her life. These very decisions drove her to so much, and so little for other's to see. It doesn't really matter what others think, because the truth of the matter is that our decisions can't be influenced by anyone else. Only we have control. There are in fact times when we think our decisions were made by others rather than ourselves. It's a very common and very cowardly response, one which I rarely saw Sophie exhibit through the course of this film. The film starts with the narrations of Stingo (MacNicol) a young and curious writer hoping to complete his work, as he moves to a small apartment in Brooklyn. Upon his arrival he easily befriends a pair of lovers named Sophie and Nathan (Kline). Sophie, a Polish Catholic who's own survival of the Holocaust baffles her, and Nathan, a Jewish\/supposed biologist, with even greater mysteries surrounding him. On and off he goes crazy on Sophie, exhibiting anger beyond control, inexplicably accusing her of infidelity, and even mocking her surprising survival of one of the world's darkest moments. Meryl Streep portrays a truly tormented character who is suffering, but not just from her own experience in Auschwitz, but at the deepest corners of her soul lingers the memory of the most difficult and haunting decision she'd ever made. Upon her arrival in the camp, her presence as a Catholic Polack had given her an opportunity at life. In the control of a typically perverted Nazi guard, her fate was made with the choice of which of her two children may live, and who may die. A decision, no parent can possibly or even put any sense into considering. Unfortunately, out of her desperation to end that very moment of stress riddled insanity, her daughters' life is declared to be over. Her son's life wasn't to last very long either. Sophie could not know, being on one side of the camp, while her only remaining child lived in a disease infested section of the children's zone. In the time she had opened herself to Stingo, the attempt she made to take her life, can only further describe her anguish, as well as her still remaining motivation to live on. Nathan, a man who's brilliance is very unique, whether it's in the manner of which he expresses himself philosophically, or in the thrilling and quite often humorous persona he uses to define himself. His very existence alone is Sophie's reason for living. Despite his flawed personality, and even surprisingly revertible emotional expressions (all a result of later discovered Schizophrenia), Sophie remains with him. To many of us viewers were going to ask ourselves, why. Why doe she stay with a man that can be so kind one minute, and so dangerous the next minute? It's hard for most people to understand, because obviously the 2 lovers have a very odd relationship. Maybe their relationship is suitable for their inner demons. Sophie battles her grief and remorse of her children, and Nathan lives with the lies of hiding his disorder, while constantly battling it at hand. The main truth of this film revolves around more than just Sophie's past choices, but it also focuses on her current decision to remain with a man who is as equally damaged as she is. That's probably what defines their spiritual connection for one another, their inner torment. Together, to the eyes of Stingo, and even viewers they seem perfectly happy, and they probably are when together, but when separate and without each other, their worst feelings of inner misery are truly expressed up to the point when both of these intriguing characters meet their own self destructive ends at the hands of a cyanide injection. The loss of his beloved friends, with whom he learned and bonded with so much, results n Stingo's departure from Brooklyn, leaving the very home where many fond, but painful memories will lie. It is through the narrations of his older self, that Stingo tells us the story of a moment in his life where he discovered so much. Through the kindness of Sophie and Nathan, he learned a sense of friendship that seemed truer than any bond he had with anyone else. His own feelings for Sophie, as well as his loss of virginity with her, made him further see clearly in the end, as he narrates this event as if it were an actual written story. Using a tone of calm and yet sophisticated expression, he tells his greatest and most fulfilling moment in life with such tender love and gratefulness. In fact I myself feel this film is very heart warming, using the theme of a tormented persons guilt to further explain the reasons for her choices. Meryl Streep is a tremendous actress, making her character so authentic, with not just her mastery of fluent German and Polish, but also with the very mannerisms of the character's crucially damaged and still benevolent persona. Kevin Kline brings the thrilling nature of his character with such ecstatic behavior using his intelligence, anger, wild humor, and desire to live life with joy and excitement to the best of his own definition. Sophie's Choice is what I call a very rare and powerful movie to view, using both the elements of tragedy, drama, and love to further guide viewers into the real nature of this film's title.

Despite his flawed personality, and even surprisingly revertible emotional expressions (all a result of later discovered Schizophrenia), Sophie remains with him. To many of us viewers were going to ask ourselves, why. Why doe she stay with a man that can be so kind one minute, and so dangerous the next minute? It's hard for most people to understand, because obviously the 2 lovers have a very odd relationship. Maybe their relationship is suitable for their inner demons. Sophie battles her grief and remorse of her children, and Nathan lives with the lies of hiding his disorder, while constantly battling it at hand. The main truth of this film revolves around more than just Sophie's past choices, but it also focuses on her current decision to remain with a man who is as equally damaged as she is. That's probably what defines their spiritual connection for one another, their inner torment. Together, to the eyes of Stingo, and even viewers they seem perfectly happy, and they probably are when together, but when separate and without each other, their worst feelings of inner misery are truly expressed up to the point when both of these intriguing characters meet their own self destructive ends at the hands of a cyanide injection. The loss of his beloved friends, with whom he learned and bonded with so much, results n Stingo's departure from Brooklyn, leaving the very home where many fond, but painful memories will lie. It is through the narrations of his older self, that Stingo tells us the story of a moment in his life where he discovered so much. Through the kindness of Sophie and Nathan, he learned a sense of friendship that seemed truer than any bond he had with anyone else. His own feelings for Sophie, as well as his loss of virginity with her, made him further see clearly in the end, as he narrates this event as if it were an actual written story. Using a tone of calm and yet sophisticated expression, he tells his greatest and most fulfilling moment in life with such tender love and gratefulness. In fact I myself feel this film is very heart warming, using the theme of a tormented persons guilt to further explain the reasons for her choices. Meryl Streep is a tremendous actress, making her character so authentic, with not just her mastery of fluent German and Polish, but also with the very mannerisms of the character's crucially damaged and still benevolent persona. Kevin Kline brings the thrilling nature of his character with such ecstatic behavior using his intelligence, anger, wild humor, and desire to live life with joy and excitement to the best of his own definition. Sophie's Choice is what I call a very rare and powerful movie to view, using both the elements of tragedy, drama, and love to further guide viewers into the real nature of this film's title.
