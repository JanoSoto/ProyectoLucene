Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, the baddest and meanest son of a bitch ever to walk the Earth...and killer of women and children. It's simply amazing that Eastwood not only starred in this, but also directed and produced it. One of the few examples of this that can be given. Mel Gibson also did a decent job in his Braveheart. I think that if you have seen all of the Western Eastwood classics that this movie might even be more enjoyable for you, as it's rumored that Munny is simply an extension of some character he's played in the past. After finally getting around to seeing this one, I will most definitely go out and educate myself in this genre.Let's face it, Eastwood is William Munny...he just is. It's hard to even fathom anyone else in this part simply because Eastwood is so damn convincing and undoubtedly helped by the immense experience he's gained over the years playing similar parts. The audience needs no convincing of his character. Although simple, a very powerful performance from an actor that holds enormous screen presence. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman also deserve recognition for their performances. Overall, a great cast.The true strength in the film, besides Eastwood's character and acting, is the story. Quite simple, it is, but also extremely effective. A old, bad man comes out of the woodwork to do one last job to help his kids get a good start by snatching some much needed cash. And haunted by the memory of his late wife, Munny questions his actions, knowing all too well that his wife would not approve if she were still alive. His deeds from the past have come back to haunt him, as he hears his reputation is still quite alive and well and is the entire reason he gets involved in the job in the first place. I loved hearing the stories of the man he used to be, giving glimpses of what we may get to see later in the film as his character progresses. It is also particularly humorous that Munny's memory of the past isn't all that great either, even though some of the events seem unforgettable. All because he was a drunk badass. As the story progresses towards it's climax, we get more and more hints that the satanically bad man Munny used to be is still somewhere under the surface, and is undoubtedly going to rise like a phoenix straight out of the ashes of Hell if he's pushed too far. And while the film progresses like the journey itself, slowly moving along establishing it's themes and characters, it all leads up to one hell of a climax. One for the history books. When it finally was all about to go down, chills literally went down my spine. But I don't want to spoil it for anyone.As a fellow reviewer previously mentioned, Unforgiven succeeds as a film and story because it does not try to preach a message or convey one about morality. The characters are who they are, and do things for their own reasons and ask no forgiveness. Whether it's right or wrong ain't got nothing to do with it, just like deserve ain't got nothing to do with it.Very highly recommended. A truly great film worthy of it's recognition.

Whoever scrawled that on there has perfectly summed up the world of Brazil and all its impersonal insensitivity and madness.The first hour or so of the movie is world-class. The England it depicts is a society so choked by bureaucracy that any human element is lost, and so cut-throat in its petty materialism that no one misses it. Jonathan Pryce plays our hero -- a completely unheroic everyman who drags himself from his non-descript apartment block to a stifling job under an idiot, the monotony only broken by being dragged to lunch with his mother at hideously pretentious restaurants filled with her mindlessly chatting socialite friends. Terrorist bombings are a constant, but are marginalized so as not to interfere with profit or pleasure -- suspects are simply dragged off to their death by black ops stormtroopers. Obviously this film was very relevant when first released, but it seems almost prophetic now.Unfortunately, when the film begins to stray from this chillingly credible line, its brilliance rapidly fades. The camera style slips out of the tightly-controlled groove it had been it and lingers on grandiose, meaningless panoramas. The writing becomes sloppy, with no discernible motivations being given for character's actions, and Kim Greist's awful performance as Jill certainly doesn't help.

The character studies are rich and complex and never too revealing, adding mystery and depth. The location in Utah's Monument Valley is magnificent. The Technicolor is simply stunning. And of course, the story set a standard for all action movies to come. The plot is simple and engaging and the subplot allows us to take a break from the relentless search. John Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards is memorable. The dark, anti-hero persona gives the movie an edge not seen in those days. Jeffrey Hunter (Martin Pauly) and the rest of the cast give solid performances that are very natural and spirited. All of this is credited to the brilliant directing of John Ford. It is a great movie to watch. It is a great outdoor movie that should be seen on a big screen.People say that this movie is very racist and stereotype Indians. I disagree. I think this movie is about racism, period. Both races are ruthless and barbaric in this movie. Let's take a look1. The calvary massacres an Indian village. 2. Ethan's hatred of Indians consumes him. But his hatred has a reason. And he is not naturally racist.3. Ethan is a loner, hated and feared by his own people. 4. When Ethan and Marty are hiding out in the canyons, they shoot the Indians in the back as they retreat. Not very noble, is it? 5. Ethan shoots three white men in the back during a shootout. I guess Ethan can do it to his own people as well! 6. When Ethan sees a group of tortured white women who were rescued from the hands of savage Indians, he fears for the worst. But when Lucy is found, she looks well and cared for. Ethan, upset with this unexpected result, decides to kill Lucy because she has turned 'injun.' 7. Marty accidentally marries an Indian woman. Although ridiculed by Ethan, the Indian woman is portrayed favorably throughout the film.8. Marty and a friend fight for Laurie's love (Marty's fiancée). It is a civilized fight among gentlemen. Ethan and Marty meet with Scar, the Indian chief who abducted Lucy. Scar realizes who they are but does not kill them on the spot. Why? It is a Commanche code of honor not to kill someone when he is at a disadvantage.9. Both races are good and evil in this movie. Ethan and Scar are both driven by revenge. One dies in the end, the other continues to live a life of a loner, dead in the eye of society. There are many reasons why I love The Searchers. It is a very simple story, yet says a lot. It is very entertaining and never boring. Unless you are a meat-head who cannot handle anything except mindless action sequences, this is the movie that stands the test of time, up there with Citizen Kane, Vertigo and The Godfather. Enjoy! Watch it on the big screen if possible. The special edition 2-Disc DVD set from Warner Brothers is an absolute must. If you are a fan, you will not believe your eyes when you see the new transfer. The film has been restored to its original VistaVision widescreen, color by Technicolor! On a final note, the last scene is pure poetry. Truly one of the greatest moment in film's history. John Ford really struck gold with this one.
