Again, Vincent who had to figure out where the case even was; later, he shoots Sheamus saving idiot Sam's life again. The writing is surprisingly poor for a Frankenheimer movie. The first time you watch it you will be overwhelmed with the great action and car chases.

Gregor, who is portrayed as ruthless enough to shoot school kiddies, this man thought Mickie would let him walk away with the money? Notice that with the exception of Sam with Bean or the tunnel scene, Sam is a completely unprofessional idiot. He is constantly being bailed out by Vincent. Yes, it develops their friendship but it also shows Sam to be a terrible agent. He should have been killed at the end for his impetuousness, which contradicts the whole characterization up to this point, but we have the deus ex machina of Vincent miraculously saving him. The first twenty minutes of the movie we watch, in great boredom, as Sam surveys the bar where he meets Deidre and the crew. He then secrets a gun, outside for an emergency. Is this the same character who runs after Sheamus though blind corners and doors?There is great acting and chemistry between DeNiro and Reno with Skarsgaard doing his usual great job. The action and the car chases are worth seeing but I would not buy this movie. Frankenheimer was always terribly overrated; please, Black Sunday and The Osterman Weekend, he made some really lousy movies. The first time you watch it you will hate my review; the more times you watch it over, the more you will notice how badly written it was. The whole romance between Deidre and Sam has such a sense of unreality about it given the aforementioned hyper caution of Sam. Supposedly, the make out at the surveillance site triggered this uncontrollable passion in Sam. Does he look like a passionate man to you? Later, he misses an opportunity because he will not shoot Deidre which again is so bizarre and contradictory to the characterization. A very overrated movie that drags quite a bit between action scenes. Pryce is his usual great villain; the acting is powerful but the writing sinks the movie.

It is a grave error to see this as simply a movie about greed by moralists. Curtain and Howard defeat it easily, Howard more easily because of his age and nearness to death. Dodds is destroyed; he is consumed until nothing of his personality remains. We see the predilections that led to this outcome. Notice his vanity with the haircut, hardly a necessity when begging, and his chasing after the prostitute. The little scene of his cruelty to the lottery boy all seem to be quite trivial and innocuous. Sadly, they are the inclinations that grow into monstrous proportions once the piles of gold begin to accumulate. Notice, Dodds is the one who wants it split up every night, this triggers hiding one's stash, always on the lookout for discovery. Huston takes some of the real bite out of greed and its partner murder by having the bandits arrive just when they are about to shoot Cody. Again, Cody is conveniently killed in the battle, again, sparing us from seeing the murder all three of them were about to commit for their gold. The voting to kill him is a nice reminder not to enshrine democracy, the majority is often wrong. Do not fall in love with the consensus of idiots. Dodds begins spiraling out of control whenever temptation falls on him. Howard leaves to help the natives, Dodd's complaints about the extra burros is just a subterfuge for stealing Howard's goods which also is why Dodds endorsed Howard leaving with such enthusiasm. This is not good enough; he projects his greed onto Curtain and convinces himself he has to kill him to survive. As before, with his stash, earlier predilections in Dodds are growing getting more and more dangerous. After he thinks he killed Curtain, watch the fire grow and grow as he mocks having a conscience, trying to convince himself. You do not need me to tell you what the growing fire signifies. Do not feel sorry for Dodds at the waterhole where the bandits kill him; he would have joyfully shot all of them if he had any bullets. Many people think the natives slow down or wreck the film, they are there to remind us of the poor and suffering surrounding these gold mad maniacs.The point of the movie is not that greed is evil; it is how to handle losing things which is an existential fact of human life. First Howard then Curtain laugh at losing everything, having it blown by the Hand of God back to where it came from. When they were saying what they would do with the money, listen to the beautiful music, re-prised again when Curtain talks about picking fruit with the poor and sleeping, singing under the stars. This is the film's message a simple, basic spartan life free of desire. It is so hard within an economy that thrives upon creating eternal desire and boundless wants. The message is not just that greed is evil; it is how much do you require to be happy? Happiness is from within where all true wealth is, its reification into material goods will only be like drinking sea water; it makes you thirstier. Lose and laugh, my friends, for the last laugh is on all of us. We too blow away in the wind, love and goodness are all we can ever take with us. They are meant to be given to all we meet.

Many people think the natives slow down or wreck the film, they are there to remind us of the poor and suffering surrounding these gold mad maniacs.The point of the movie is not that greed is evil; it is how to handle losing things which is an existential fact of human life. First Howard then Curtain laugh at losing everything, having it blown by the Hand of God back to where it came from. When they were saying what they would do with the money, listen to the beautiful music, re-prised again when Curtain talks about picking fruit with the poor and sleeping, singing under the stars. This is the film's message a simple, basic spartan life free of desire. It is so hard within an economy that thrives upon creating eternal desire and boundless wants. The message is not just that greed is evil; it is how much do you require to be happy? Happiness is from within where all true wealth is, its reification into material goods will only be like drinking sea water; it makes you thirstier. Lose and laugh, my friends, for the last laugh is on all of us. We too blow away in the wind, love and goodness are all we can ever take with us. They are meant to be given to all we meet.

It is a grave error to see this as simply a movie about greed by moralists. Curtain and Howard defeat it easily, Howard more easily because of his age and nearness to death. Dodds is destroyed; he is consumed until nothing of his personality remains. We see the predilections that led to this outcome. Notice his vanity with the haircut, hardly a necessity when begging, and his chasing after the prostitute. The little scene of his cruelty to the lottery boy all seem to be quite trivial and innocuous. Sadly, they are the inclinations that grow into monstrous proportions once the piles of gold begin to accumulate. Notice, Dodds is the one who wants it split up every night, this triggers hiding one's stash, always on the lookout for discovery. Huston takes some of the real bite out of greed and its partner murder by having the bandits arrive just when they are about to shoot Cody. Again, Cody is conveniently killed in the battle, again, sparing us from seeing the murder all three of them were about to commit for their gold. The voting to kill him is a nice reminder not to enshrine democracy, the majority is often wrong. Do not fall in love with the consensus of idiots. Dodds begins spiraling out of control whenever temptation falls on him. Howard leaves to help the natives, Dodd's complaints about the extra burros is just a subterfuge for stealing Howard's goods which also is why Dodds endorsed Howard leaving with such enthusiasm. This is not good enough; he projects his greed onto Curtain and convinces himself he has to kill him to survive. As before, with his stash, earlier predilections in Dodds are growing getting more and more dangerous. After he thinks he killed Curtain, watch the fire grow and grow as he mocks having a conscience, trying to convince himself. You do not need me to tell you what the growing fire signifies.

The interminable journey to meet the deity who has probably nodded off at this point. It is his ship, he doesn't know how anything works. The dialog puts the B in badly written.

See, when you fight people and mutual deaths occur, they do not stop and have a chat with you. Can you tell these people know as much about real battle as they do about fornicating, to quote Patton? The film shows to all aspiring filmmakers the craft of directing and why it is such a powerful role Shatner does nothing right, bad acting, photography, editing, and pacing.

Sidney is his little demonic imp planting the stories of destruction, digging up the dirt and watching over JJ's most treasured possession; his baby sister. He keeps her locked up, for her best interest, with him in his palatial penthouse suite. When we first meet her she has been beaten down into a shy, frightened little mouse by the kind ministrations of her putatively loving brother. The movie is the story of two people breaking free of JJ, Susan of her own initiative to a rising sun of liberation and Sidney, involuntarily, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. JJ has a Freudian jealousy of Susan; when the film begins, Sidney is in the doghouse for not obliterating Susan's jazz playing boyfriend Dallas; we watch as Sidney scrambles to get the lying poison printed to appease his master. He uses a cigarette girl who adores him, poor thing, he reciprocates by using her as a trap against married men or lustful old fossils drooling all over her. We watch in disgust as Sidney strikes out blackmailing the married man, right in front of his wife, but scores with a lecherous old coot that loves young girls. Watch the look on the cigarette girl's face when she opens the door and sees Sidney is not alone, this is not the first time. Sidney also likes to get early editions of JJ's column than put the arm on a comic pretending that the writing was his to shake him down for the money. The destroy Dallas operation blows up in Sidney's face over time. Dallas has the temerity to tell JJ what a hypocritical, arrogant ass he is right to his face, in public; JJ's boundless ego will never tolerate such blasphemy, hear how he has insulted his radio listeners, it has nothing to do with him personally. Susan always knew JJ was behind the red, pothead smear on Dallas; this crosses the line of no return for Susan. JJ now has his crooked cop, on his leash, beat Dallas into the hospital. This triggers the death spiral for Sidney who gets caught trying to save Susan while being alone with her in the apartment goodbye Sidney. We watch Susan finally stand up to him and free herself. When you watch this great movie over it is as much about Susan as JJ. It is the story of her liberation from her tyrannical brother who will never allow anyone to challenge his hegemony over her. The dialog is without equal; the most cutting, brilliant literary level interchanges; this was before comic book movies. If you are used to their movies better bring a dictionary. My favorite line,You are dead son, better get yourself buried. That is Lancaster's JJ Hunsecker as mean as a rattlesnake. Lancaster's best performance in any movie including ELMER GANTRY. Curtis also gives a brilliant performance in one of the most unsympathetic roles; who would want to play this snake? Watch him verbally spit at Dallas' integrity, he then gives a dissertation on how to destroy Dallas by using his morality against him. This is a masterpiece; you will never see writing and acting at this level in your entire life.
