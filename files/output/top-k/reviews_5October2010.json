I had to watch this movie as a school project and thought it was amazing. To be able to get the real message of the movie, you have to dig deeper. When Eric Liddell says God made countries, God makes kings, and the rules by which they govern. And those rules say that the Sabbath is His. And I for one intend to keep it that way. he is not insulting anyone, he is simply stating the fact that he himself wants to live by the laws. If you ever get in a situation where someone is trying to change you mind on a moral decision use the line I intend to keep it that way. Also, Eric Liddell says  I believe God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run I feel His pleasure. When you do some thin you love, do you feel God's pleasure. Try to feel it next time. Also, a reverend says You can praise God by peeling a spud if you peel it to perfection. Don't compromise. Compromise is a language of the devil. Run in God's name and let the world stand back and in wonder. What he is saying is that you can honor God by doing simple things perfectly. Everything you do, doesn't have to be great. Do not compromise because it means you are giving in, and when you give in, it means you are falling away from what you believe. I will admit, the movie starts out kind of bland, but turns into a movie that, if you truly understand the meaning, can bring you to tears. Aubrey and Lindsay watched their friends die, watched the legends die. The movie is their remembrance of them. Let us praise famous men and our fathers that begot us. All these men were honored in their generations and were a glory in their days. We are here today to give thanks for the life of Harold Abrahams. To honor the legend. Now there are just two of us - young Aubrey Montague and myself - who can close our eyes and remember those few young men with hope in our hearts and wings on our heels.

That fact helped make up for the times when I lost interest in the story a bit. Visually, it's excellent. Artistically, there are a lot of great ideas, they just don't all come together well.   I don't want to spoil the plot, but it involves missing children, a scientist who can't dream, a army of blind (well, not quite) men, a kind-hearted strongman, orphans, and a hateful set of Siamese twins. Mostly though, it's about the desire for family. The relationship between the two main characters, Miette and One, is quite touching, but there's also humor and action to be found.  As I said, this movie is kind of all over the place, and some aspects work better than others. Still, I'd recommend it be seen just because of how genuinely different it is. Take a dark adult fairy tale\/fantasy movie like Pan's Labyrinth (though, not as good) and add in a bleak dsytopian setting and some sci-fi, and you've got a good idea of what The City of Lost Children is like.

He wrote the book Of Mice and Men from his own experience as a bindle-stiff in the 1920's. He worked as a farm hand, just like the two lead characters George Milton played by Gary Sinise and Lennie Small played by John Malkovich, in the movie. The movie Of Mice and Men is categorized a drama film, and takes place in California during the Great Depression. George and Lennie are two hired work hands who though very poor and not very fortunate are lucky because they had each other. During this time period and setting loneliness and alienation was common for all men like George and Lennie. Most men traveled alone to find work. George feels responsible for Lennie because George knew Lennie's aunt who took care of him until she died. Lennie had no one to take care of him so George took him under his wing. Throughout the film you learn about Steinbeck's motives and underlying truths weaved into the dialog of George and Lennie.Of Mice and Men begins with a woman screaming, crying and running in a prairie- like field. With her are men on horses with guns and dogs that seem to be chasing or tracking down something. George and Lennie are running from these men because Lennie gave a woman the impression he was raping her by grabbing a hold of her dress. Lennie is mentally disabled and does not know how to control himself. He loves touching soft things and when he saw the woman's dress he couldn't help but grab it. They escape to this pond where George explains to Lennie if he ever gets in trouble to come back to the pond and hide in the bushes. At the new ranch that George and Lennie go to work at, Lennie finds something else soft to touch and feel. The head ranch hand has a dog that has recently given birth to puppies and Lennie falls in love with petting and feeling the runt of the bunch. There is a story that Lennie loves to hear from George and frequently asks him to retell it. George tells him about their dream. This dream is told throughout the movie. Steinbeck is trying to portray this dream of man constantly falling short of their hopes and dreams. He portrays not what we read about or what makes us happy but the truth. The truth in this time period was that man was constantly fighting just to survive, it was a daily struggle. There was this constant desire for companionship and ownership of land or anything to call their own. In the film the boss that George and Lennie work for has a son named Curly who has a wife that Steinbeck chooses never to name. She had no more worth than just property to Curly. He constantly acts and talks to her like he owns her and tries to keep her in the house at all times.In Steinbeck's film we can understand the entire movie, plot and Steinbeck's motives by just one dialog by George and Lennie when George is retelling Lennie their dream. George says to Lennie, Guys like us that work on ranches are the loneliest guys in the world. They ain't got no family and the got no place. They got nothing to look ahead to. Lennie interrupts him in mid sentence saying, But not us George! Tell about us! George continues with a grin, Well we ain't like that. We got a future. We got someone to talk to that gives a damn about us. If them other guys gets in jail they can rot for all anybody cares. Lennie interrupts again, But not us George, because I, see, I got you to look after me, but you got me to look after you. This simple dialog can explain everything about the outlook of man at this period in time. Man had nothing to look forward to but to survive and nothing to call their own. Steinbeck illustrates this sad but true picture through his dialog throughout the whole story of Of Mice and Men. In the end I believe Steinbeck was trying to portray the life of the men that no one notices or looked over. The truths behind what others would leave out and I would recommend this film strongly to anyone not just looking for a good movie but for those in search of something pure, true, real and historic.

They don't repeat characters or plot elements, but they all follow a similar winning formula &#x96; not merely that of Hitchcockian suspense (of which there isn't really that much in Secret Agent), but of the notion that scrambling all over Europe bumping off spies and leaping off trains, constantly in fear of your own life, can be made to look rather good fun.First we have the cast and characterisation. A relatively young John Gielgud takes the lead and, although the director reportedly didn't like his performance, he does here epitomise the classic British hero. Laid back, unassuming, with an air of effortlessness, he is in some ways reminiscent of a certain other fictional British spy popularised in the latter half of the twentieth century, although Gielgud's Ashendon is far more human than the somewhat mechanical Mr Bond. Paired with a bubbly and very believable Madeleine Carroll, and supported by bluff gentleman Percy Marmont, chirpy yank Robert Young and crazy generic foreigner Peter Lorre, the overall feel is like one of those Brits on holiday comedies. The only difference is, occasionally people kill each other or send out coded telegrams.Then there is the Charles Bennet screenplay. Bennet was, after Elliot Stannard in the silent days, the second writer to really work well with The Master of Suspense&#x99;. Like Hitch, Bennet loves double meanings and secret knowledge. Take the scene where Gielgud arrives at the hotel finds out from the clerk that his new persona has a wife. He asks the clerk Did she look well? meaning of course Is she attractive? It is of course a little joke with no bearing on the plot, but it's moments like this that keep us engaging with the material and root us in the world of spying and bluffing. He also brings characters in with memorable bits of business to give us strong and meaningful impressions of them &#x96; for example Peter Lorre chasing a woman up the stairs or Percy Marmont being introduced when Gielgud trips over his dog.And then there is the director, who is let's face it the only reason anyone pays attention to what would otherwise be obscure English films in the first place. Hitchcock has simplified and streamlined his technique, which a few years earlier had been little more than a needlessly showy display of camera tricks. He's still not subtle &#x96; he never would be &#x96; but at least he is now tasteful. We see here his regular method by which the camera leads the audience by the hand, dollying in on an object or throwing a close-up at us as if to shout Look at this! What's good about it is that it allows Hitchcock to move the audience at any rate he wants. At the end of the first scene there is a dolly in on a portrait of a soldier. No-one is looking at or gesturing at it, but Hitch forces us to take notice. Later, when Gielgud walks into his hotel room and finds both Carroll and Young inside, there is a quick montage of close-ups as he checks he has the right number, and we essentially ride with his thought process for a few seconds.Secret Agent is by no means as good as The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes, not really having any major build-ups of suspense or danger. However, it does gently pull us along for a well-paced and slightly irreverent ride, and is ultimately watchable because it has very few bad bits. It is a good example what Hitchcock and co. were creating at Gaumont &#x96; pictures which were undemanding on the attention because they were smooth, unpretentious and yet continually gave us something to tickle the brain.

Paired with a bubbly and very believable Madeleine Carroll, and supported by bluff gentleman Percy Marmont, chirpy yank Robert Young and crazy generic foreigner Peter Lorre, the overall feel is like one of those Brits on holiday comedies. The only difference is, occasionally people kill each other or send out coded telegrams.Then there is the Charles Bennet screenplay. Bennet was, after Elliot Stannard in the silent days, the second writer to really work well with The Master of Suspense&#x99;. Like Hitch, Bennet loves double meanings and secret knowledge. Take the scene where Gielgud arrives at the hotel finds out from the clerk that his new persona has a wife. He asks the clerk Did she look well? meaning of course Is she attractive? It is of course a little joke with no bearing on the plot, but it's moments like this that keep us engaging with the material and root us in the world of spying and bluffing. He also brings characters in with memorable bits of business to give us strong and meaningful impressions of them &#x96; for example Peter Lorre chasing a woman up the stairs or Percy Marmont being introduced when Gielgud trips over his dog.And then there is the director, who is let's face it the only reason anyone pays attention to what would otherwise be obscure English films in the first place. Hitchcock has simplified and streamlined his technique, which a few years earlier had been little more than a needlessly showy display of camera tricks. He's still not subtle &#x96; he never would be &#x96; but at least he is now tasteful. We see here his regular method by which the camera leads the audience by the hand, dollying in on an object or throwing a close-up at us as if to shout Look at this! What's good about it is that it allows Hitchcock to move the audience at any rate he wants. At the end of the first scene there is a dolly in on a portrait of a soldier. No-one is looking at or gesturing at it, but Hitch forces us to take notice. Later, when Gielgud walks into his hotel room and finds both Carroll and Young inside, there is a quick montage of close-ups as he checks he has the right number, and we essentially ride with his thought process for a few seconds.Secret Agent is by no means as good as The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes, not really having any major build-ups of suspense or danger. However, it does gently pull us along for a well-paced and slightly irreverent ride, and is ultimately watchable because it has very few bad bits. It is a good example what Hitchcock and co. were creating at Gaumont &#x96; pictures which were undemanding on the attention because they were smooth, unpretentious and yet continually gave us something to tickle the brain.

And during my two-hour view I was waiting for that moment when I'll be truly AWED. It didn't come though! I was highly entertained and thought-provoked... but never touched. The movie digs deep into one of the most unsettling problems in the American society (and it makes me think maybe I'd be more touched if I were an American myself!) and materializes its social impact. Director Tony Kaye did a great job shockingly portraying the gruesome and painful outcomes of this vicious circle of hate. However, he heavily depended on melodramatic score and slow-motioned takes and flashbacks to heighten this effect, which, I think, was quite cheesy. The movie is beautifully written, and wonderfully performed. Edward Norton has this magnetic charisma that you can't help waiting for the next scene he'll be in.

This was after he directed the dystopian science-fiction film THX 1138 (1971) and the rites-of-passage American Graffiti (1973). Star Wars was inspired by the Flash Gordon cartoon strip. It cost $8 million to make in Britain with three little-known Americans in the leading roles, supported by British actors. The story is a simple adventure yarn, and Lucas draws on samurai films, Westerns and every kind of myth, ancient and modern. The dogfights are based on a close study of World War II films. Star Wars was an immediate success. It became one of the great phenomena of cinematic history. It spawned two sequels, three prequels and endless imitators, creating a demand for spectacular blockbusters that has not yet ended. Industrial Light and Magic, the special effects unit that served the film, became a multi-billion dollar organization. Lucas himself also became and has remained one of Hollywood's most powerful figures. The film certainly struck a nerve in an America recovering from the humiliations of the Vietnam war. Ronald Reagan, elected president three years after Star Wars was made, spoke of the Soviet Union as 'the Evil Empire' and gave his proposed space-defense system the title Star Wars. The original Star Wars trilogy contributed to the worldwide renewal of the filmgoing habit, but in creating an appetite for child-like blockbusters that depend on special effects rather than on character and subtle narrative, the film unfortunately played a key role in what was to be called 'the dumbing down' of America and popular culture.

Sinise and Steinbeck were close friends and when Steinbeck died Sinise decided to create the motion adaptation into something that he knew from his heart that Steinbeck would have enjoyed to watch over and over again. John Malkovich plays the character Lennie Small, with music by Mark Isham, and Kenneth MacMillan as the Director of Photography. This movie is set in the depression era and is no doubt a drama. The riveting story is a tale of two men whom travel together across the land to make money to fulfill their dreams. George is a small quick witted man, while Lennie is a slow giant. They often have to find work elsewhere because Lennie accidentally falls into trouble. Lennie and George came together because George knew Lennies aunt Clair whom use to give Lennie rabbit and mice to pet because he loved to pet soft things. Lennie would often kill the animals by petting them too hard, so aunt Clair stopped giving them. Clair died and asked George to take care of Lennie, so George made the promise. Since then they had been traveling together with the thought of one day owning a land of their own. George would often tell this detailed story of owning the fat of the land to Lennie, and promised him that one day he would get to tend the rabbits.When watching this movie compared to the book one thing to think about is how convincing and well played everything is. Most can say that it depends on the actors skills to persuade the audience, but without the perfect camera location, the movie could look like another youtube sensation. Kenneth MacMillan does an excellent job at creating mood solely with the camera, for example when Carlson was persuading Candy to let him shoot his old dog. Carlson walked over to his bunk to retrieve his gun, but Slim was having a conversation with Whitt about somebody in the newspaper. However Slim and Whitt were blurred out, showing Carlson in the back ground showing that although other things are happening within the room. Candy is only focused on one thing. Another thing to consider is the music placement within the film. Mark Isham did the music track to this film and definitely made the movie a seat gripping experience when something were to occur. Music can change the mood and emotion of just about anything. Just in the beginning when it showed the woman in the red dress running for her life the music was very appealing to the ear letting us know that nothing completely fatal had happened, but something unfortunate and accidental may have occurred. The music throughout the movie is very western and well placed.Overall this film was a hoot and a holler. John Malkovich played a stunning roll as Lennie, and Gary Sinise could not have done a better job at re-creating such a great book into a movie. Watch this with an open mind and you will be placed into their shoes, as well as their hearts.

Sinise and Steinbeck were close friends and when Steinbeck died Sinise decided to create the motion adaptation into something that he knew from his heart that Steinbeck would have enjoyed to watch over and over again. John Malkovich plays the character Lennie Small, with music by Mark Isham, and Kenneth MacMillan as the Director of Photography. This movie is set in the depression era and is no doubt a drama. The riveting story is a tale of two men whom travel together across the land to make money to fulfill their dreams. George is a small quick witted man, while Lennie is a slow giant. They often have to find work elsewhere because Lennie accidentally falls into trouble. Lennie and George came together because George knew Lennies aunt Clair whom use to give Lennie rabbit and mice to pet because he loved to pet soft things. Lennie would often kill the animals by petting them too hard, so aunt Clair stopped giving them. Clair died and asked George to take care of Lennie, so George made the promise. Since then they had been traveling together with the thought of one day owning a land of their own. George would often tell this detailed story of owning the fat of the land to Lennie, and promised him that one day he would get to tend the rabbits.When watching this movie compared to the book one thing to think about is how convincing and well played everything is. Most can say that it depends on the actors skills to persuade the audience, but without the perfect camera location, the movie could look like another youtube sensation. Kenneth MacMillan does an excellent job at creating mood solely with the camera, for example when Carlson was persuading Candy to let him shoot his old dog.

The story is simple enough, a good high school football player has dreams of playing for his favorite football team, Notre Dame. So a good football player should get a scholarship, correct? Not in the case of Rudy who is very undersized. Basically, a lot of desire, but not a lot of physical talent. So he does what he can to try and first enroll at Notre Dame and then get onto the football team as a walk on. You get to see the bumps and physical pounding he endures as he basically plays kind of a practice team player, basically a guy who never sees the field, but helps the first and second and third stringers get ready for their games. So it is a bit inspiring to see this guy keep plugging away and trying his best and getting smashed.

Gary Sinise plays George Milton, a struggling farm worker with dreams of one day having his own farmland to work, while protecting his dim-witted and strong-backed friend Lennie Smalls played by John Malkovich. Lennie is a sweet but slow man, who due to his learning difficulties and the stigma attached to that at the time, often ends up getting in trouble and the pair lose their jobs, and are forced to hit the road once again in search for new work. The Film begins with the George and Lennie on a train escaping their previous job, where they were chased away by men and dogs, running because Lennie, in his innocent way, created a problem that was misunderstood. Its obvious that George cares deeply for Lennie, not only through the way he takes care of Lennie, but also how he tells to Lennie of how when they raise enough money to buy a plot of land they can tend, and Lennie will raise the rabbits, because of his fondness for soft and cute things. As they make their way to their new place of work having been lied to by a bus driver not wanting to take them all the way to the new ranch kicks them off the bus and they have to make their way on foot. Stopping in a creek bed to rest, George tells Lennie about the farm they will have together again, and tells Lennie should anything bad happen to meet him there again. After they meet the farmer they meet his son Curly, who is an angry young man, and fearsome fist fighter to boot. Curly's wife is bored and left alone by Curly on the farm and always trying to talk to all the farm hands to spark Curly's anger. The story continues and them men work in the field, none quite as efficiently as Lennie, who is strong enough to double the speed of all the other hands. This leads to some griping to those who cannot keep up with his speed. Lennie is finally rewarded with a puppy of his own to care, although it is not old enough to leave its mother, he sometimes sneaks it away to pet, until George catches him at it. The climax starts to rise as George and Lennie bring the old man Candy, with one hand, who will help pay for the farm, because once Candy becomes to old to be any help, the ranchers will fire him, and he will not be able to cope on his own even though he has $350 saved up. Gary Sinise as director was clever in the way he created the feeling of the film, by not explaining too much about George and Lennie's past before they were in the boxcar of the opening sequence, expressing the details of what happened that led to the chase, in quick shots that are supposed to be memories. Sinise also uses Candy's old dog which the men call useless as a simile to Candy's own age and ability to work with only one hand. Eventually the men coerce Candy into letting them put down his dog, to which Candy later commiserates to George that they will not to do him, only firing him, and Candy would then have no way of helping himself. The Music was edited to be playing only in certain parts of the film that were emotionally charged, whether happy like when George was telling Lennie the story about the rabbits, or when danger loomed at the beginning when the boys were being chased out of their old job. Generally the music is very subdued and fades in and out from scene to scene. Most of the time when the men are working or just talking there is no music at all. Generally, Of Mice and Men is a fantastic drama, telling the story of life in the depression, and societal reactions to those with disabilities. Lennie is the sweetest of characters and only causes trouble because of the way he is. Be sure if you watch this movie, to look for repeated motifs put in place by Sinise, and pay attention to how well the music sets off the emotions of the scenes.

In any case I have cut off contact with most of the people I met during that time and with little regret. The bright spots during those eleven years and the only ones that influenced me in any long-term fashion were 1. vacations with my extended family, 2. Calvin and Hobbes and 3. Power Rangers. I suppose this last just goes to show the mind-numbing and escapist nature of television and in particular its stifling effect on children's creativity (and that of other things in American culture, but to reveal this would be to betray a part of my childhood that I would love to amputate). All the same, when I lost interest in the show, working on the unrealized potential of the characters in unpublishable stories in scrapbooks helped me to start down the long road to mental recovery. (I have since burned all those stories, as good as I esteem some of them to have been, as a means of soul epuriation.)However, this is not a review of the TV show, but of the movie. Interestingly, I saw this movie with my grandmother on one of those lovely aforementioned vacations, and so it is a memory that nicely synthesizes many of the high points (as I saw them at the time) of my childhood from ages 8 through 18. That is not to say that I would choose to see this again, but it carries positive connotations of a lovely ambiance. The three-day road trip on down to my grandparents' house (my parents absent), my ever-energetic grandmother (still strong and upbeat at age 80 despite deteriorating kidney health!) those cool fast food toys, the shiny metallic uniforms, et c. ad infinitum were just unbeatable to an idiotic 10-year-old.Although the teenagers on the show are supposed to be high school students (who almost never do homework yet seem nevertheless to remain in the good graces of their teachers--and actually, this is not unrealistic for contemporary American high school), the school is absent from the Angel Grove of this film, which looks eerily like Sydney, Australia (because, of course, that is where it was filmed). The snippets of their personal lives--which serve no purpose except to open up a rock and roll! ambiance--look very much like a child's or teenager's dream vacation, and I suppose that was fitting for a movie coming out in summertime. So much the better for children to relate to!The characters, though, are a real disappointment, even for Power Rangers. The little quirks we saw on the show--Kimberly's prima dona valley girl act that melts in the face of a real challenge to reveal a thoroughly beautiful person, Tommy's fierce sense of dedication thwarted by a severe lack of punctuality, Billy's incomprehensible genius--are all gone here, probably because the traces they left in the original script just totally overwhelmed the total blandness of their new teammates Rocky, Adam and Aisha and stole the film away from these latter three. A very tight, personality-driven team of six teenagers is a ripe opportunity for exploitation and doesn't have to dumb down the poor children mesmerized by the flashing colors, but the halfhearted and uneven exploitation seen on the show is nowhere to be found here. The actors do not have a good reputation, but on the show, at least Jason Frank, David Yost and Amy Jo Johnson (along with their original three counterparts) shone brilliantly whenever they got the chance to show some character.Saban Entertainment was of course notoriously cheap given that the TV show pulled ratings of 11.0, it was rather pathetic that they couldn't have plunked some capital into keeping around the talent they had and developing the characters into something meaningful. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie was really their comeuppance, though I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget!On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites.Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Movie was really their comeuppance, though I understand the film grossed only 38 million out of a projected 125 million in the United States--and this for the most popular children's franchise in America for the time! Compare with the Ninja Turtles movie from just a few years earlier--and with a similar budget!On that note, the interesting thing is that the movie is not, production-wise, cheap. For 1995, the special effects and the Zord scenes work quite well, and the planet Phaedos is a real eye-feast. The fight scenes are satisfying, as fight scenes go. The updated costumes are awful to look at but definitely more believable as protective armor. Given all this, could they really have been in the impossibility of finding a scriptwriter to inject just a bit more into this? The original script was, as I understand, better but unproducable... the final one looks like it needs about eight rewrites.Anyone presently over the age of 45--one of those who wailed and moaned about having to put up with these color-coded spandex-clad space-ade superheroes--will doubtless not be surprised at the negative aspects outlined in this review. Doubtless they will also be wondering why on Earth I gave this thing such a high rating. Frankly, fellow humans, it is simply this while you can resign yourself to amputate a gangrenous leg, you cannot help but enjoy the memories of having had it and regretting the necessity of having it cut off. I watched Power Rangers. I went to see the movie. I had a great time doing both, and the movie was seen in the context of real, lasting, good memories of very special people. I will not allow my children to see this (moreover, at age 25 I no longer have a TV set) and I have no desire to relive it, but there it was, a little forgotten part of me that I smile at from time to time.

Sullen, monosyllabic one-dimensional Stallone becomes a little tiresome as movie lead. But - I got a surprise.Stallone plays a hit-man. He's the maestro. Long in the business and meticulously careful, with a low profile. But he's had about enough and wants out. His contracts come via the internet (that's not something you could do post 9\/11). At his next hit, he finds himself upstaged by another killer, played by Antonio Banderas. He's also extremely good at killing, but he's halfway over the blue wall, slaughtering anyone who is the least inconvenience with a maniacal relish. He's the new kid on the block and wants to be No1. But it's obvious that such overt, ferocious excess couldn't possibly stand the test of time. The authorities would have to track him down. A star that burns twice as bright shines for half as long, etc.It appears that both men have been played-off by their contractor. One of Stallone's next hits is a female computer-hacker who sells secrets to foreigners - a traitor, in other words.Instead of bumping her off (he's an unemancipated sucker, you see) he decides to defend her from his heir-presumptive firebrand who is likewise after her scalp. What follows then often resembles 'The Terminator', where hero Kyle Reece tries to keep Sarah Connor safe from the relentless cyborg. Though there are other plot threads too.I found this a thoroughly entertaining romp. It far exceeded my expectations. Sly's sluggish demeanour is well suited to the quiet, calculating character he plays. Whilst Antonio Banderas has played the manic pistolero often enough to know the score. All the players give a decent turn for their paycheques. When the action comes - it comes plentiful and fast. Meanwhile the corpses accumulate. But it's not all road-rage and shoot-'em-up. There are plenty of mood moments and lots of clever original plot details. I particularly like the exchanges of money and goods by means of a radio-controlled model truck via the hotel ventilation ducts.All of the technical issues like lighting and editing are on the mark. The soundtrack and incidental music are interesting and well-chosen. I was only a little disappointed by the ending. This movie has far more to engage the viewer than Tom Cruise's verbose and rather over-blown 'Collateral' (which also features a hero protecting some female from Cruise's brutal assassin). Frankly, I think the critics have been unreasonably harsh; there's some solid entertainment here. Recommended.

It stars John Malkovich, Lennie, and Gary Sinise, George. Alexis Arquette and Sherilyn Fenn are the female actors in this movie. It's a very good and interesting movie and serves its purpose pretty well.It is very symbolic that the film begins and ends at the pond. It's trying to say that life comes in full circle. The characters are so powerless to accomplish their dream. They are limited to their circumstances and the social environment surrounding them. Their dreams never come true. Every time, they try something they end up back at the same point. It allows the audience to reflect on how life is full of difficulties, and unfortunately, many of them are caused by injustice. But we need to work hard and try to take the right steps. John Malkovich does a great job being Lennie. He portrays Lennie's character so well. Lennie is so naive despite all his extraordinary physical strength. He is as pure and kind hearted as a child. There is only one thing that he really understands; and that is love. You can clearly feel the impact of love on him. He appreciates George's love and care for him, so he is willing to do anything for him. Lennie is as a clear hollow reed &#x96;empty of all the veils we, human, create for ourselves- which love can flow through him to anything. John is fully able to help the audience really feel this. He's able to help us relate to Lennie's character. Gary Sinise is also able to portray George's character very well, and make the audience feel like he\/she is involved in the story. He is very good at having appropriate facial expressions and body language in each scene. He makes you believe you're in there. In the story, George shoots his beloved companion, Lennie, to spare him a cruel death. He knows that Lennie will be killed by the angry mob, for (accidentally) murdering Curley's wife. On the other hand, Candy is not able to shoot his old dog. Perhaps, if Candy was in the same situation, he would shoot his dog to spare him a cruel death. These parts of the stories are just different expressions of genuine love for another creature. Some could be a good role-model and some a bad one, depending on the conceptual beliefs of an audience.All characters of the movie are lonely in a way or another. George and Lennie, have no home, neither family. Still, loneliness could be seen different for each. George doesn't even have someone to understand him, consult with, and share his thoughts with. On the other hand, George knows Lennie pretty well and tried to understand his circumstances. Curley is isolated because he's trying to be that leader \/ Son of the Boss which he is so disable to accomplish. He's on the wrong path. He never learned that he can do that by building strong relationships and being a good example. His wife has no one to interact with. There are no females on the ranch, and all the men try to ignore her because they're afraid of Curley.At the end of the story, Curley is trying to find Lennie and kill him. His real motivation for wanting to kill Lennie is not so much to take revenge for his wife's murder. Curley finds this, a good opportunity to take revenge for what Lennie did to his hand, to stop him from beating him up. He also thinks that this is a good chance for him to show off his power and find his place as the number one guy.
