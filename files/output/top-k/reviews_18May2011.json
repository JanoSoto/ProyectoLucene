[{"date":"18 May 2011","score":"","review":" In Fight Club, viewers are introduced to the nameless narrator played by Edward Norton, a man who has become numb for the knowledge of his being trapped within a structured, white-collar life. Things take an unexpected turn for the up when he chances to meet Tyler Durden, a mysterious, charismatic, and volatile individual who, with the narrator's help, creates an underground group to which many men begin to congregate like Christians to Sunday mass so to fight against one another in intense, free-form brawls; in short, a Fight Club. However, the premise of this group is deceptively simple, and what begins as a means of connection and freedom between individuals soon spirals out of control into something much more sinister than the main character could have predicted.The movie places a heavy emphasis on consumerism, and does not cast the practice in a forgiving light one scene has the main character detailing the list of items he orders from catalogs, and as he goes about enumerating his purchases the camera pans from left to right, filling out the nooks and crannies of his apartment with items that look as though they belong to the pages of a home decorating magazine. In another scene, the camera slowly retreats from inside a wastebasket, showing along the way discarded wrappers, cans, and various utensils manufactured by large, brand-name companies. In effect, the main character, as well as those men drawn to fight club, have been raised , as Tyler says, to work jobs we hate so we can buy s*** we don't need. It is Tyler Durden who points this out to E.N.'s character, telling him the things you own end up owning you, and from there on out the narrator is at Tyler's mercy, becoming but one of the many people swayed by his charming antagonism toward larger society. The cinematography and screen angling help to support his status as icon. All of the men in the film excluding Tyler Durden himself are average looking individuals who appear no different than from someone you might pass on the street. Tyler, in contrast, possesses rugged good looks and an Olympian body, and the film's shots make no attempt to hide this. In one scene, the narrator walks past Tyler having sexual intercourse with Marla (a woman who begins as much of a social vagrant as Edward Norton's character in the beginning before falling for Tyler's charm), and when Tyler pulls open the door to ask him what he is doing we are shown everything from just above his genitals and up; his narrow hips, his rock-like abdominals, his lean and granite-sculpted arms, his broad shoulders and chest. The lighting of the film is such that at any moment when Tyler's frame is seen, it is done so where the shadows work to the favor of his body's contours; whereas all the other men appear plain and average, everything of Tyler Durden, from his muscle tone, to his face, to his ostentatious clothing, is given room to shine; as such, he appears less like a human and more like a God, and at times, such as in one scene where he flurries his blood-streaked head back and forth like a feral dog, so that great globs of putrid scarlet are flying off his scalp, like a demon. The music of the film is almost scant; aside from the opening and ending credits, there are few moments in the film where music is a prime factor. The gritty nature of the film almost demands its absence, for many of the scenes are presented in so stark a setting that to pepper the mood with musical notes would only cheapen the effect. However there are some instances where music does indeed make its appearance, such as the scenes wherein the narrator explains to the audience the rapidity with which fight clubs begin to emerge throughout the country. The music at such times is simple yet catchy, and lends itself to the philosophy of the film well Just because something is not complex does not mean it cannot take hold of you and, whether you realize it or not, drag you along for the ride&#x97;even if that ride involves you holding on for dear life, kicking and screaming.

Fresh out of the Godfather, Serpico was the film that further cemented Al Pacino's status as a powerhouse performer. Based on the story of real life cop, Frank Serpico, who had almost the entire police department turn against him for being an honest cop, Serpico is a gritty drama about dirty cops and the politics that came with it in the police department in the 60s.Given the material, this could've been an edge of the seat fast paced thriller that could have easily catered to the popcorn entertainment bracket but when you have Sidney Lumet's name in the credits, you could almost always be rest assured that it wasn't going to be the case. Now, make no mistakes though. Serpico may not be fast paced and it certainly isn't a pop corn entertainer but a thriller it still is, and intense in ways that makes this film worthy of an intelligent audience.Adapted from the Maas book by Waldo Salt and Norman Wexler, Serpico is a difficult film about police corruption and the man who tried to fight it. Although backed by a fine supporting cast, Serpico is a film that belongs to one man and one man alone and not only does he justify his presence in the role by giving it what it demands, instead, he goes two steps further and delivers a splendid performance! Near flawless and a testimony to the enormous amount of talent the man is credited for.From the clean Shaven look to the handlebar mustache to the bearded Hippy look, which Serpico adapts to avoid alienation from the regular crowd which a normal cop suffers, Pacino slips into the skin of the character and shines in what has to be one of his most natural performances. This was the Pacino before he got into his other avatar. The Pacino before Scarface and Tony Montana. The Pacino, before he developed his other loud style which to be honest, still kicks ass!! This was the Pacino that you saw in The Godfather and you would go on to see in The Godfather Part II and Dog Day Afternoon.Like all Sidney Lumet films, this one too, is a slow film and tests your patience at times, but sit there till the end and you will be rewarded with a film that goes beyond just making a shallow statement or telling a simple story. It tickles your conscious and makes you question and that, in my opinion, has always been the sign of a good film. The fact that you can relate to a character like Serpico, a man who wants to do what he always wanted to do and will not turn a blind eye to things, even if it risks his own life, is not surprising. Serpico is a character who's in a place where you've once been yourself or you surely know someone else who was.At 2 hours and 10 minutes, Serpico may feel lengthier than it is, but at the end of the day the big question always is that whether it's worth it or not! Thankfully in Serpico's case it is! A fine example of good writing and a realistic approach, there's a good reason why this movie is rated as one of Pacino's finest. Lumet, to me, as brilliant as he was, was a hit-or-miss director. From that perspective, not only is Serpico a hit, it hits the bloody bull's eye!

The places Sergio Leone's 1984 film, the last before his 1989 death, will go are places not necessarily inclined towards painting images of the place as the song would suggest; his film an other-worldly and quite fantastic hierarchical tale told across numerous decades in the early to mid-twentieth century about kids coming to grow into adults but all the while living a persistent existence as criminals. The film begins at the ground zero stage of the 1920s streets of Brooklyn, New York City, before going on well into the 1960s; a stage by which time friendships have been forged; mistakes have been made and people have come and gone for whatever reasons. By the time it has ended, we are exhausted but in a strictly positive way.Despite being as close to death as he was, we don't necessarily feel Leone lost much of what made him the director he was. When a gangster rummages through an opium den with his cronies looking for somebody specific, he comes face to face with a female patron and her lover; a scene which is allowed to play out in that fashion that sees it oddly disgusting in its overall tone and yet oddly beautiful in its overall craft; that fashion Leone was always able to wedge out of such instances &#x96; a wordless exchange purveyed through facial expressions and feeding off of the threat somebody carries via their lowered brows and narrowed eyes. Such an instance is similar to that of how a group of ugly, disfigured bandits waited at a train station nearer the beginning of 1964's A Fistful of Dollars &#x96; their toying with the surroundings, systematically seizing and weighing absolutely everything up as what is essentially a hunt for blood takes a brief excursion, feeling prominent.The reasoning for the gangsters doing what they're doing is because of what Robert De Niro's David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles, got himself involved in at a very early age and kept with him as he grew up. Leone has the sorts of people after Aaronson mercilessly gun down a young blonde and then beat a guy within an inch of his life in hunting their prey, a playful cut to the desired lying face-up in said drug parlour looking severely spaced out and rather vulnerable heightening tension. As it is, Aaronson knows his time has come; the curious notion of having a lead character in a gangster film effectively run from his both troubles and the enemy, when the comparable thing might be for confrontation thus leading to action. Aaronson's exit and re-entry to New York a whole forty years later is carried out in a remarkably played sequence paying sly homage to its own passing of time; specifically, utilising the sole words of yesterday (temporally) and suddenly (spacially) so as to establish an awareness of the transition from one era to another.The proceedings begin in earnest in the 1920s with Aaronson still a boy; a boy forming a clan of four with some friends and a boy whose chief items on one's mind lie in that of milling around with these pals, stealing a little something here and there, and the equally young Deborah towards whom he takes a fancy. We feel Aaronson has a genuine fondness for Deborah; the instance in which, through a corrupt cop doing things he ought not, he is permitted sexual relations of some kind however brief and crude, does not deter him from an overall goal of naturally coming to bond with Deborah. It is during these promiscuous times that he comes into contact with that of the slightly elder, but equally street smart urchin, Max Bercovicz; eventually played by James Woods. Bercovicz appears to ride into proceedings, indeed town, with his family on a horse driven cart, as if unreal; as if coming on in from the horizon this mythical figure surely not even belonging to this realm. Aaronson and Bercovicz's oneupmanship begins mere minutes after they first meet, the targeting of an elderly drunk as a robbery victim seeing Bercovicz effectively come out on top over Aaronson but nicely teeing up what will become a series of fascinating crime infused interplay. The distinct underpinning of homoeroticism in the pair's relationship is fascinating. Overhanging it all are failed relationships with various women and quotations when things get heated, such is the way these two bicker like an old couple, along the lines of Maybe I really should just dump you or De Niro's gem Wherever you go, I go; entirely encapsulating the nature of their ties.Without letting up, Leone's exploration of these men whom grow up out of the boys we initially witness is little short of tremendous; a firm eye on the pratfalls of a life of crime. The covering of the advancing through a life of crime by Aaronson and Max et al is as dramatic as it is fraught with a great deal of substance; an occurrence in which the crew execute a diamond robbery and then double-cross the employers seeing said instance unfold within an isolated coastal locale rich in grounded tug boats. The killing of those executed a figurative running aground of those, perhaps literally, previously having had to pull along the likes of Aaronson and co. &#x96; now reduced to neatly echoing the presence of a number of small tug boats in the vicinity rusted, unnecessary and not needed &#x96; their time to be discarded has come. Leone crosses from strand to strand; decade from decade with ease, the overhanging mystery of whom it is is involved in Aaronson's calling him back looming over everything in what is a miraculously played, really rather wondrous gangster film that is wholly recommended.

As it is, Aaronson knows his time has come; the curious notion of having a lead character in a gangster film effectively run from his both troubles and the enemy, when the comparable thing might be for confrontation thus leading to action. Aaronson's exit and re-entry to New York a whole forty years later is carried out in a remarkably played sequence paying sly homage to its own passing of time; specifically, utilising the sole words of yesterday (temporally) and suddenly (spacially) so as to establish an awareness of the transition from one era to another.The proceedings begin in earnest in the 1920s with Aaronson still a boy; a boy forming a clan of four with some friends and a boy whose chief items on one's mind lie in that of milling around with these pals, stealing a little something here and there, and the equally young Deborah towards whom he takes a fancy. We feel Aaronson has a genuine fondness for Deborah; the instance in which, through a corrupt cop doing things he ought not, he is permitted sexual relations of some kind however brief and crude, does not deter him from an overall goal of naturally coming to bond with Deborah. It is during these promiscuous times that he comes into contact with that of the slightly elder, but equally street smart urchin, Max Bercovicz; eventually played by James Woods. Bercovicz appears to ride into proceedings, indeed town, with his family on a horse driven cart, as if unreal; as if coming on in from the horizon this mythical figure surely not even belonging to this realm. Aaronson and Bercovicz's oneupmanship begins mere minutes after they first meet, the targeting of an elderly drunk as a robbery victim seeing Bercovicz effectively come out on top over Aaronson but nicely teeing up what will become a series of fascinating crime infused interplay. The distinct underpinning of homoeroticism in the pair's relationship is fascinating. Overhanging it all are failed relationships with various women and quotations when things get heated, such is the way these two bicker like an old couple, along the lines of Maybe I really should just dump you or De Niro's gem Wherever you go, I go; entirely encapsulating the nature of their ties.Without letting up, Leone's exploration of these men whom grow up out of the boys we initially witness is little short of tremendous; a firm eye on the pratfalls of a life of crime. The covering of the advancing through a life of crime by Aaronson and Max et al is as dramatic as it is fraught with a great deal of substance; an occurrence in which the crew execute a diamond robbery and then double-cross the employers seeing said instance unfold within an isolated coastal locale rich in grounded tug boats. The killing of those executed a figurative running aground of those, perhaps literally, previously having had to pull along the likes of Aaronson and co. &#x96; now reduced to neatly echoing the presence of a number of small tug boats in the vicinity rusted, unnecessary and not needed &#x96; their time to be discarded has come. Leone crosses from strand to strand; decade from decade with ease, the overhanging mystery of whom it is is involved in Aaronson's calling him back looming over everything in what is a miraculously played, really rather wondrous gangster film that is wholly recommended.

Sometimes those stories can be entertaining, but this film is undone by pretension, an inability to figure out the most interesting elements of its own story and the inclusion of a character who belongs in a completely different movie.Amy Brennerman and Aaron Eckhart play a married couple. They're friends with Catherine Keener and Ben Stiller, who play a couple who live together. Jason Patric plays Eckhart's and Stiller's bachelor friend and Nastassja Kinski plays a museum assistant they all come into contact with. Brennerman's character is what people used to call frigid, greatly frustrating her and her husband. Stiller's guy is an emotionally immature chatterbox who somehow ended up with Keener's angry woman that pushes away real intimacy because she's afraid of losing her individuality. Patric plays a narcissistic sociopath who turns into a human cartoon after a bizarre sauna confession that doesn't fit anything else in this movie. Eckhart is, I guess, supposed to be the relatively normal guy the audience can identify with but becomes strangely passive just when a normal person would start to get angry at the miserable things that happen to him. Kinski plays, well, just a needy lesbian.The pretension of this movie is pretty unmistakable. None of the characters are named throughout the film, but then in the credits they all have similar sounding names (Cary, Terri, Jerry, etc). Eckhart, Keener, Patric and Stiller all play the same exact scene with Kinski at different points. This is very much a film that wants to be thought of as clever, but you usually need to be clever to have people think that.The second problem is that the movie is largely focused on its men, when the most interesting characters are Brennerman and Keener. Brennerman is a basically decent woman who can't have a satisfying sexual experience and feels incomplete without it. You can see how the lack inhibits her and how the need energizes her. Keener is a woman who wants to be in a relationship but is desperate to not be part of a couple. You can see it in how she keeps Stiller at a distance but is heartbroken when she learns of his unfaithfulness and you can see her repeating the same pattern with Kinski, wanting to be together but not wanting to be close. But the story doesn't spend enough time with them and both characters end up being not much more than their emotional problems.And even when the film focuses on its male characters, it gives short shrift to the most compelling facet of their relationships. The dynamic of Stiller and Eckhart living vicariously through Patric's sexual adventures and of Stiller playing the junior partner to the more masculine Eckhart and Patric is only alluded to. We don't get enough of the three of them together and too much of Patric and Stiller on their own.Patric's performance is also wildly misplaced. The movie imagines itself to be about what could be happening with the people who live next door but Patric is like the serial killer who lives down the block. He's hard and cold and sharp and looks like he was teleported in from an alternate dimension compared to the other characters.Keener and Brennerman are quite good and if Your Friends and Neighbors had been more about them, it might have been a worthwhile film. As it stands, I can only recommend it if you can't comprehend how Neil LaBute could go from making In The Company of Men to doing a remake of The Wicker Man. Your Friends and Neighbors might have convinced LaBute and Hollywood that his creative shtick really had nowhere else to go.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what that means. Karmic is basically the adjective form of karma, which is the Buddhist principle of retributive justice that determines a person's life and whether it is positive or negative. There are no parallels between the story lines of the two films and I can't draw any connections between the themes or motifs of either film. So I think what it comes down to is just ignore what Soderbergh has said and look at Full Frontal as a completely separate film.So now that we've cleared (or rather disregarded) any confusion I can continue this review without any necessary mention of sex, lies, and videotape. Full Frontal is about a group of people in the film industry whose lives intertwine in different ways, all primarily through a producer named Gus. The opening of the film displays character cards for all the main players, accompanied by voice over from that character. In this film we have a down on his luck writer named Carl Bright. His wife is a lawyer named Lee Bright and he is having issues with her that carry throughout the film. There is Lee's sister, Linda who is a massage therapist. There is a stage director named Arty who has been chatting with Linda online as the two of them use aliases that are much cooler than who they actually are. Then there are two actors, Calvin and Francesca, who for a majority of the film are in a film-within-a-film scenario that, honestly, finds itself much more profound than it actually is. These characters are all coming together for a party thrown by Gus, and along the way there are some surprises and discoveries made about themselves.This film is mostly just odd. It's offbeat, it's quirky, and it also tries very hard to be clever. Granted there are scenes that are clever, but there are others that sort of miss the mark. Soderbergh does a great job with the story structure and the way he brings the characters together. He has a clear cut goal for this film, but the process of getting there is pretty rocky. What Full Frontal suffers from the most is just plain dullness. This film really does get boring at times. But it isn't unbearable by any means. It is one of those films that just when you start to realize how slow it is getting something happens to bring it back and you are drawn in once again. I almost see this as cheating because a good film will keep you drawn in consistently from start to finish, not just throw in certain moments to grab your attention and then skimp on the rest. Full Frontal isn't as guilty of this as other films because Soderbergh makes an effort to keep the film entertaining in its entirety, but the effort goes to waste at some moments that just really drag the film down.But in spite of everything you have to admire this film for just having a good time. Soderbergh directs it in a sort of mockumentary fashion. When I see this movie I think of The Office and the way it is shot as if the camera crew is with these characters, filming their day to day business, and the characters know it. There is a significant amount of voice over work done in this film that is all interviews with the characters. Soderbergh allegedly filmed the actors in this film about their character and then used some of the results for the film. There is a lot of obvious ad libbing in the film that adds a sense of quirky authenticity to the look and feel of this film, making it unique, if only slightly.Full Frontal tries to be a lot more than it is. It is definitely a smart film with a nice touch of cleverness, but in the end it doesn't seem to amount to much. I think Soderbergh was trying to create a very in depth character study disguised as a quirky comedy film, but I think more of the quirky comedy came out than the profundities of the character study.

Her appearance and mannerisms continue this image. Carrie is innocent and naive, despite the prevalent culture of the 1970's. Margaret White wears clothing that is reminiscent of early Puritans. However, her voluminous red hair fits the image of a witch more readily than a Puritan.The setting of this movie could be any town in the U.S. There are really no distinguishing factors to the location. In a horror movie, this generic location is important. Viewers must feel that something similar could happen right around the corner, or even to them.Most of this movie is shot from a third-person perspective. There are a few close-ups that could be seen as a change in perspective so that the viewer is looking through Carrie's eyes; when Carrie and Tommy vote for themselves as Prom King and Queen, and when Carrie is reading about telekinesis. At the end of the movie, the viewer is shown a kaleidoscope view through Carrie's eyes of people laughing. This view is meant to show the viewer that Carrie has had a mental break; she is no longer in touch with reality. The viewer can see that Carrie thinks everyone is laughing, when most are not.The religious symbolism is everywhere in Carrie's home, from the basic architecture of the home to the pictures on the walls. Scenes shot inside the home of Carrie are dark, even the scene where Carrie walks in to find hundreds of candles burning. The only scene in the house that is not dark is when Carrie's mother is planning to kill Carrie. The lights are suddenly turned on in this scene.

This allusion to Hitchcock continues with the back-lit image of Chris' hands on the rope. The technique that is used is clearly the same as is used in the shower scene of Psycho.

Scenes shot inside the home of Carrie are dark, even the scene where Carrie walks in to find hundreds of candles burning. The only scene in the house that is not dark is when Carrie's mother is planning to kill Carrie. The lights are suddenly turned on in this scene. The movie makes frequent reference to blood and a red hue is used extensively in the final scenes. Along with menstrual blood comes power the power to control things, the power to attract men, the power to control men, power to compete with other women, power that attracts negativity from other women, and lastly great power of destruction. The protagonist, Chris, is sexually promiscuous and frequently licks her lips at the thought of blood. Carrie is pure and the blood scares her.The scene where Carrie is dancing with Tommy makes use of interesting camera angles. The camera looks up at the two of them, elevating them in the viewer's eyes. The camera spins as do the dancers. The effect is almost fun-house. The viewer is brought more into the movie and made to relate more to what Carrie is going through at that moment. She is so happy that it is dizzying. Every time Carrie uses her telekinetic powers, there is a sound in the background that is reminiscent of the noise in Psycho before someone dies. This allusion to Hitchcock continues with the back-lit image of Chris' hands on the rope. The technique that is used is clearly the same as is used in the shower scene of Psycho. The combination of incredible acting, meticulous sets, great dialog and character development make this a classic film. The issues that it raises are still relevant today.

French novelist Pierre Boulle took it to its extreme with his novel of the same title on which this film is based. For those that are maybe too young, or have been living under a rock for the last forty or so years, here's a brief summary.Colonel George Taylor and his surviving crew, Landon and Dodge, crash land on a planet they think is far from Earth in the Orion constellation. It looks very barren but the air is breathable and there is water. They set off to find if there is any life. Eventually they find plants and then primitive mute human like creatures. These humans are foraging for food when they are attacked by apes! No ordinary apes though, these can speak, ride horses and use weapons. Dodge is killed and Taylor is injured in the throat before he is captured. He is taken to the Ministry of Science where he is put under the care of Dr. Zira who treats his injuries. She is intrigued by his attempts to talk. Her friend, Cornelius, is more cautious and her boss, the Minister of Science, Dr. Zaius, wants him put down. Still unable to talk, Taylor eventually escapes but is re-captured after an exciting chase through the town. It is here he is heard to say the memorable line, Get your filthy ape hands off of me!. What can this mean for the apes? A human that can talk! There are plenty of witnesses who believe man to be inferior to them and is to be treated like any dumb animal. All this and much more is revealed but, of course, I'm not going to tell you here.Somebody really thought about the world the Apes inhabit, there is a clear structure to their society. Orang-utans are the administrators, chimps are the scientists and gorillas are the military. It's not clear who does all the menial jobs, but there is a structure there. The cinematography is quite superb; it would have looked great on the big screen (I've only ever seen it on TV). Of course the make up effects are also groundbreaking and quite brilliant for the time it was made. The music is quite unusual, but still in keeping with the visuals.I thought Charlton Heston did a great job as Colonel George Taylor, he played it with the arrogance and swagger the part needed. Kim Hunter was also really good as Dr. Zira, she was really great despite the limitations of the costume and the make-up. Of course, Roddy McDowall is best known for his part as Cornelius, and various parts in the other 'Planet of the Apes' films and finally as Galen in the much loved '70's TV series of the same name. Also worthy of note are Maurice Evans as Dr. Zaius, James Whitmore as the President of the Assembly and Linda Harrison as Nova (although she didn't have to say much).This is the best of the 'Planet of the Apes' films, even the 2001 reboot starring Mark Wahlberg. It gained a huge following and started a very lucrative franchise for the studio. It is really well made although I thought it took quite a long time before we actually saw an ape. It also struck me that for a species of vegetarians they wear an awful lot of leather&#x85; just an observation. So, over all, a really well made and iconic film with some great ideas that really took hold of the public imagination.

Landing his second Oscar nomination, Newman's role as Eddie Felson was memorable for a number of reasons, the most obvious of which was the intensity of his acting, which came across as cool yet charismatic. Newman's natural flair for acting with composure had seen him racked up more than half a dozen Oscar nominations, though his only competitive win came in 1986 for Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money , a sequel of sorts to The Hustler.Directed by Robert Rossen (not to be confused with the French director Robert Bresson), The Hustler is often thought to be his greatest film. While I have not seen many of his works to give an opinion, I feel that it is an excellent film but not a great one. Shot in black-and-white, Rossen's film is no more about pool than Raging Bull (1980) is about boxing (Berardinelli). It is a character-driven film that pits Eddie not against his opponents but with himself. Drunk and obsessive about winning, Eddie succumbs to his character flaws in his long-drawn match against Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) in the film's early action set- piece.Much of the film after that does not quite reside in pool hustling. Instead Rossen calls to attention Eddie's romantic relationship with Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie). Their romance is not seen as a subplot to the film's main narrative but another lens to look at Eddie's character. With Sarah, Eddie is warm and nice, though there are occasional instances of volatility. But put a cue in his hands and he is a changed man. And for the worst, if I may add. One of the film's supporting characters, a rich cutthroat gambler named Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), calls Eddie a born loser and one who is without character.It is this quest to find that character that sets Eddie to build towards it, to prove himself that not only is he the greatest pool player anyone has ever seen, but also one that, win or lose, acknowledges the value of integrity, something he has failed to see for most of his life, and as a consequence in numerous situations, failed him as well. The Hustler, while quite effective as a conventional character study on human behavior and emotions, is less potent when it comes to dealing with the psyche of its lead character. The film does not seem to have the prerequisite grittiness to flesh out Eddie's psychological motivation (or ambiguity).Further, Newman's image as a clean and likable, albeit rebellious dude, coupled with the film's polished cinematography by Eugen Schufftan, who won an Oscar for his work here, suggest that The Hustler is not cut out to be a deep, complex, and raw character study in the mould of Taxi Driver (1976). Here, Rossen takes his film to a level that is enough for us to understand and root for Eddie. He refuses to go further and seeks instead to give us the pleasure of watching Newman and co. strut their stuff on the pool table.

I was not around when this film came out, and I never even heard of it until sometime within the past few weeks when I saw a clip from it, the part showing the character known as the Lady in the Radiator singing the haunting and repetitive song, In Heaven! This made me curious enough to watch the movie, and it didn't take long at all before I did just that. I got plenty of warning about how incredibly weird and sometimes gruesome it was before watching it, and as popular as I knew it was, it wouldn't have been surprising if I got basically nothing out of it, but that's not what happened.In a decaying, post-apocalyptic society, Henry Spencer is a printer who lives in an industrial town full of noisy machines, and is currently on vacation. His estranged girlfriend, Mary X, invites him over to her family's house for dinner one night, so he comes over. After a very strange session at the dinner table, Mary's mother takes Henry into another room and informs him that Mary has just given birth to a baby very prematurely, and he happens to be this baby's father! Because of this, he is now obliged to marry his estranged girlfriend, so Mary and the baby, a severely mutated child, move into Henry's apartment with him. When the couple attempt to sleep, the mutant baby just won't keep quiet, so Mary decides that she can't take it anymore and temporarily moves back in with her family, leaving the disfigured child with Henry, who is now headed for one bizarre and frightening mixture of instances!As I watched the beginning here, I could already tell that it certainly wasn't going to be one of the most understandable films I've ever seen, showing bizarre scenes in a slow-paced manner. It looked like I was going to find most of Eraserhead boring at first, and I wasn't finding the acting in the sporadic moments of dialogue to be all that impressive, but I wasn't going to give up yet. I kept watching to see what would happen, and I think I started finding the film more intriguing when Henry comes over to the X family's home, though I didn't find absolutely everything before that to be boring. From this point on, I found lots of tension in this very weird story which is a lot like a crazy dream with its incoherence, but that's not necessarily a bad thing! Some parts didn't grab me as much as others did, but the all the insanity was definitely enough to hold my attention basically all the way up until the very sudden ending! I think the gloomy atmosphere and constant sounds of machinery and howling wind really helped.Many consider this 1977 feature-length debut from David Lynch to be a masterpiece, while there are also lots of people who have been absolutely disgusted by it, and I can understand that perfectly. It's truly a mind-boggling motion picture, and it sure can get disturbing, especially during the scenes with the mutant baby! Also, what exactly the movie is about is probably largely up to the viewer to decide. You can be VERY sure that Eraserhead is not for kids, and many adults wouldn't be able sit through it, either, which I certainly can't fault them for. If you're used to mainstream cinema, you'd better prepare yourself for something very different if you're going to watch this polarizing cult film, and also be ready for the constant weirdness and unusual gruesomeness that you're bound to see. You've been warned! It's definitely not a film I would want to watch multiple times, but you just might find that you don't even want to watch it once, or maybe you'll be even more impressed than I was!

I got plenty of warning about how incredibly weird and sometimes gruesome it was before watching it, and as popular as I knew it was, it wouldn't have been surprising if I got basically nothing out of it, but that's not what happened.In a decaying, post-apocalyptic society, Henry Spencer is a printer who lives in an industrial town full of noisy machines, and is currently on vacation. His estranged girlfriend, Mary X, invites him over to her family's house for dinner one night, so he comes over. After a very strange session at the dinner table, Mary's mother takes Henry into another room and informs him that Mary has just given birth to a baby very prematurely, and he happens to be this baby's father! Because of this, he is now obliged to marry his estranged girlfriend, so Mary and the baby, a severely mutated child, move into Henry's apartment with him. When the couple attempt to sleep, the mutant baby just won't keep quiet, so Mary decides that she can't take it anymore and temporarily moves back in with her family, leaving the disfigured child with Henry, who is now headed for one bizarre and frightening mixture of instances!As I watched the beginning here, I could already tell that it certainly wasn't going to be one of the most understandable films I've ever seen, showing bizarre scenes in a slow-paced manner. It looked like I was going to find most of Eraserhead boring at first, and I wasn't finding the acting in the sporadic moments of dialogue to be all that impressive, but I wasn't going to give up yet. I kept watching to see what would happen, and I think I started finding the film more intriguing when Henry comes over to the X family's home, though I didn't find absolutely everything before that to be boring. From this point on, I found lots of tension in this very weird story which is a lot like a crazy dream with its incoherence, but that's not necessarily a bad thing! Some parts didn't grab me as much as others did, but the all the insanity was definitely enough to hold my attention basically all the way up until the very sudden ending! I think the gloomy atmosphere and constant sounds of machinery and howling wind really helped.Many consider this 1977 feature-length debut from David Lynch to be a masterpiece, while there are also lots of people who have been absolutely disgusted by it, and I can understand that perfectly. It's truly a mind-boggling motion picture, and it sure can get disturbing, especially during the scenes with the mutant baby! Also, what exactly the movie is about is probably largely up to the viewer to decide. You can be VERY sure that Eraserhead is not for kids, and many adults wouldn't be able sit through it, either, which I certainly can't fault them for. If you're used to mainstream cinema, you'd better prepare yourself for something very different if you're going to watch this polarizing cult film, and also be ready for the constant weirdness and unusual gruesomeness that you're bound to see. You've been warned! It's definitely not a film I would want to watch multiple times, but you just might find that you don't even want to watch it once, or maybe you'll be even more impressed than I was!

It is a vast improvement after the overly silly Moonraker and would begin a more serious tone in the 1980's Bond films. The film starts with one of the most memorable Bond intros, where James Bond finally kills his old archenemy Blofeld (though his name is never said). Due to copyright problems the movie makers hadn't been able to use Blofeld as a villain in their films since Diamonds Are Forever and this was their way of saying they don't need him. The rest of the film has nothing to do with the intro. A British spy ship with a highly advanced communication device sinks at the sea of Albania. The Secret Service wants to retrieve the device before the Russians get it and send James Bond after it. While on the case Bond meets Melina Havelock, a Greek woman on a journey to avenge the murder of her parents. This is my favorite Roger Moore Bond film. After the last two films that put much emphasis on gadgets and action, For Your Eyes Only is back to more simpler Bond investigates, which I usually prefer. The plot is good and action is well done, especially the scene where Bond and Melina are used as shark baits is very intense. Also Sheena Easton's theme song is simply beautiful. Roger Moore seems to have woken up after Moonraker and this is the most serious Bond you get from him. Jokes and witty comebacks are at the absolute minimum here and Moore shows Bond's own ruthlessness when he pushed villains' car over the edge of a cliff. Carole Bouquet is great as Melina, adding far more to the plot than majority of Bond girls usually do. It doesn't hurt that she can be gorgeous and kick ass. Unfortunately, the film lacks a proper villain. In Bond films villains are usually greater than life megalomaniacs or not so incredible but usually played by great actors. The villain Kirstatos is play by Julian Glover, who simply lacks the charisma to become a memorable villain these films need. He also played villain in third Indiana Jones movie with as little success. All in all downsides of this movie are few and far between. This is a great Bond movie that's serious and tight, and great medicine after Moonraker. Roger Moore at his best!

The stone lies beyond a trap door fortified by a massive three-headed dog absurdly named Fluffy. In a jam-packed chain of events from such highlights as Harry's night-time rovings in his invisibility cloak and seeing his late parents in a conjuring mirror to eluding Fluffy into a full-scale chessboard, the young threesome has its nerve and cleverness weathered to the utmost in a clash of obvious good versus evil, though the chess match alas underscores violence over suspense.Harry's found to be so skillful at piloting a broomstick that he's made star player on Gryffindor's team in Quidditch, a staggeringly unsafe sport that has its pre-pubescent players hundreds of feet above an arena on brooms in frantic pursuit of very hard high-speed balls. The airborne element is excellently achieved visually, but the Quidditch match itself is one sequence that indulges speed with suspense and loudness with excitement without the support of narrative motion.Regardless, the cast recompenses flat out, especially the sweetly extroverted Emma Watson as the prying, sharp-witted Hermione, and Rupert Grint, whose Weasley grows charmingly from a perfectly nebbishy second-banana comic foil into indispensable sidekick.

Though it has some of the touches from his earlier movies, overall it is quite unlike them. Though Chaplin still play a clown who is a tramp at heart.In the movie he seems to be playing himself as he is a clown who is nearly retired. Nobody laughs at him anymore. He has become old and lost his comedic touch. Then we meet the typical Chaplin heroine, a damsel in distress who is in love with another man. While the girl wants to end her life, the wise tramp is there to amuse her and give her lessons on life itself.The final act is the return of clown to limelight which is designed to appeal to nostalgia so that more people will come to see his show.

His life is rather complicated so a good story can be produced from his life. As for the movie, it is not a really horror movie because it hasn't any slashing, blood, or scare factors. It is just a psychological supernatural thriller but one of the great thrillers of all time. The casting is great. After a while you may have the feeling as their characters are real. Mia Farrow is perfect in the lead role. Ruth Gordon, who wins Oscar, is also great as the colorful, eccentric, and annoying old neighbor. I was deeply affected by her, somehow. She gave me the shivers whenever she rings the doorbell. I think Ruth Gordon rightfully deserved Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.I'd like to draw attention to some points which should be queried in the movie. For example, it is weird that Rosemary without hesitation accepts the unknown herbal drink that is given by her neighbor Minnie. How could you drink it every day even if it is given by your neighbor? You do not know what it is or how it is made. She could at least have wanted to see the herb and its make. The another point is that Rosemary never suspects her baby. She combines the clues wrongly. She just thinks that her baby will be killed by the neighbors who are witches and she runs away from them. She should have understood that there was something wrong about her baby. As long as she runs away, she realizes she will not get rid of them. She abandons herself to her fate and face the fact in the end. His husband winks at her impregnation by Satan in order to become a famous actor (Actually I doubt about her husband whether he is from one of the witches from the beginning) and he says it to her face shamelessly. Rosemary gives birth to the baby of Satan. At first she cannot admit this fact but then she cannot stand his cry. She looks at her baby compassionately so that this look makes us said That is the motherhood.On the whole the message of the movie is that It is really hard to find a sense of trust in social life so you will be defiled and become like the others whether you want or not.

It has some great performances and a strong build-up, but the story doesn't really work and the whole thing sort of flames out and sputters to its conclusion.Leo Handler (Mark Wahlberg) is a young man fresh out of prison and returning to his family. Leo is neither well educated nor particularly bright, but he is hopeful of getting a job with his Aunt Kitty's (Faye Dunaway) new husband. Frank Olchin (James Caan) runs a subway car manufacturing company and strongly urges Leo to get the training to qualify for a good union job. That would take a few years, though, so Leo decides to throw in with his best friend Willy Gutierrez (Joaquin Phoenix). Willy is essentially Frank's bag man, handling the payoffs, petty larcenies and sabotage that are the seedy underbelly of doing business in the city. But when a nighttime trip to vandalize a competitor's subway cars goes murderously wrong, Leo becomes the linchpin of a scandal that could destroy his family or cost him his life.There's a lot to like about this somber and quiet tale, chiefly the work of this fine cast. Mark Wahlberg as an actor has, I believe the phrase is, a limited instrument. Put him in the right role and he can be electric. Put him in the wrong role&#x85;and you get something like Wahlberg him in the Planet of the Apes remake. Leo is the right sort of role. Wahlberg's common, uncomplicated performance provides a clear window into the corrupt world of Frank and Willy. James Caan is pitch perfect as a man who is aware of the criminality at the heart of his business but believes he and his family can glide harmlessly over it. Joaquin Phoenix plays Willy as a successful version of Leo; a street kid who thinks he's making good. Phoenix, however, has a greater depth of talent and is able to show the audience far more as Willy's life falls apart. If he and Wahlberg had switched roles, Phoenix could have still shined but Wahlberg would have been a fiasco as Willy.The distaff side of The Yards doesn't get as much to do but manage to do as much as they can. Charlize Theron plays Erica, Leo's cousin and Willy's girlfriend. The character isn't much more than a plot device that takes off its shirt, but Theron gives her much more depth than she really deserves. Ellen Burstyn as Leo's mother is, again, more of a tool to get Leo through the story. Faye Dunaway as Erica's mom and Frank's wife does get just a little sliver of substance in her role. Plotwise, Aunt Kitty is largely just an obstacle but she also embodies one of the themes of the story. Kitty married a rich man to try and give herself and her daughter a better life. Yet Frank's wealth only disguises the fact that he and his world are exactly the things Kitty was trying to get away from.The Yards is also a decent take on the subject of big city graft and how that sort of corruption persists year after year. It's not really an organized conspiracy. It's just people making self-serving deals and trying to get a leg up in what they see as an unfair world.But as I mentioned, you can't think too hard about any of this stuff. For example, there's a section of the plot where the only way it could happen is if the entire police force were made up of utter morons and there's a big cover-up that, if you consider it logically, couldn't possible cover anything up. The ending also feels&#x85;off. Everything is tied up a bit too neatly, both in circumstance and morally.

And I don't like open or semi-open endings.The actors did well. Most of the time, I don't like the acting in old movies. Because it just looks fake to me. But in this movie I could follow the acting very well. The lead role was portrayed by Mia Farrow. I have to say that I don't like this type of women in real life. This is my personal opinion, of course. Her way of communicating with others is so childlike. But I guess that was the role she played. She was a fragile woman. She almost never left her apartment, and when she did, she looked very vulnerable.The old neighbors were played by some good actors. Their behavior was very stereotype. But I can appreciate it. It was fun to compare them to my own grandparents. The little quarrels they had and the habit of giving a lot of food to people and visitors.The plot was well thought of! It was always a bit mysterious and there was that certain tension that you get when watching horror movies. You can feel that Polanski, who made the film, has a dark kind of humor. There is a lot of cynicism in the movie and also paranoia is a very important aspect. Not that it would be wrong to be paranoid in Rosemary's situation.The movie gives a good view of the lessening popularity of the church during the sixties. Not much people really believed in the church. Rosemary was one of the few people who kept loyal to the church and to God. This makes a big contrast with her husband and the neighbors, who make jokes about the pope.At first I thought the movie was non-fiction. I thought that the neighbors were just part of a sect that believed in Satan. I was really surprised that it was fiction after all. Especially at the very end. But even then, in a certain way you can still look at it as non-fiction.The scenes in the movie were chosen very well. There was variation in locations, different kinds of light, and movie techniques&#x85; This makes everything a lot more interesting. Also the music suited the movie, which is very important, especially for horror and mystery. Music or the absence of it makes a big difference in the atmosphere.I can conclude that this movie is worth to be seen. Even if this genre is not your style. It is definitely a 'must see' for cultural enrichment. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 May 2011","score":"","review":" Rosemary's baby is definitely a movie that fits in my list of 'good movies'.

This is my personal opinion, of course. Her way of communicating with others is so childlike. But I guess that was the role she played. She was a fragile woman. She almost never left her apartment, and when she did, she looked very vulnerable.The old neighbors were played by some good actors. Their behavior was very stereotype. But I can appreciate it. It was fun to compare them to my own grandparents. The little quarrels they had and the habit of giving a lot of food to people and visitors.The plot was well thought of! It was always a bit mysterious and there was that certain tension that you get when watching horror movies. You can feel that Polanski, who made the film, has a dark kind of humor. There is a lot of cynicism in the movie and also paranoia is a very important aspect. Not that it would be wrong to be paranoid in Rosemary's situation.The movie gives a good view of the lessening popularity of the church during the sixties. Not much people really believed in the church. Rosemary was one of the few people who kept loyal to the church and to God. This makes a big contrast with her husband and the neighbors, who make jokes about the pope.At first I thought the movie was non-fiction. I thought that the neighbors were just part of a sect that believed in Satan. I was really surprised that it was fiction after all. Especially at the very end. But even then, in a certain way you can still look at it as non-fiction.The scenes in the movie were chosen very well. There was variation in locations, different kinds of light, and movie techniques&#x85; This makes everything a lot more interesting. Also the music suited the movie, which is very important, especially for horror and mystery. Music or the absence of it makes a big difference in the atmosphere.I can conclude that this movie is worth to be seen. Even if this genre is not your style. It is definitely a 'must see' for cultural enrichment.
