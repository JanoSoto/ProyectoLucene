[{"date":"26 April 2000","score":"","review":"  This film is an endearing look at a baseball player who might be pitching his last game after 19 years with the same team. After such films as Bull Durham and Field Of Dreams baseball seems to follow Kevin Costner as he returns to the diamond once again in For Love Of The Game. I enjoyed this film immensely not only because Costner is my favorite actor, but because he brings firey attitude to his character Billy Chapel. Costner is known for this as he brings it to every film he has been in.Sam Raimi brings a fresh attitude and look to the silver screen as the director of this movie. Raimi did a brilliant job unveiling the sequences as he did as the plot surrounded one game with flashbacks to Billy's on again, off again romance with Jane, played by the beautiful Kelly Preston.In addition, John C. Reilly who played Gus Sinski was a pleasant addition and surprise as he brought an excellent balance of calm and support to Billy. The best thing about this film was the monologue Billy carries with himself throughout on the mound. The only complaint I may have about this film would be the length; I think some scenes could have been edited out or cut down a little because the film shouldn't have lasted as long as it did. It was an excellent for what it was, which is a sweet, lighted hearted romantic drama.

The acting was great, Edward Norton reached the usual high standards that he has set from other fine performances.

Now that that's been settled, I must confess that I'm at something of a loss as to what to say about this film that hasn't already been said about five times. Here goes...The Humphrey Bogart we all came to know and love first appeared in this crown jewel of Hollywood's Golden Era. Virtually everything we ever associated with a Bogart character (cynicism, romanticism, disrespect for unjust authority, doing the right thing in spite of himself) came from this film. My favorite scene of his has to be when he refuses to let the German banker into the gambling actionYour money's good at the bar.Do you know who I am?!I do! You're lucky the bar's open to you!Ingrid Bergman has never been so lovely. The charming lilt in her voice never ceases to be music to my ears every time I hear it. I'D fall for her, no doubt about it. Peter Lorre's role is small, but vital to the plot. Let's face it, nobody ever played a spineless, underhanded wimp better than Lorre. Dooley Wilson will forever stay etched in my mind for As Time Goes By so long as I live. Claude Rains, the only person in the entire cast to show off more cynicism than Bogie, is an utter delight, doesn't care one way or another until that last moment at the airport. Paul Henreid, one of the most underrated actors of the '40s (check him out in Now, Voyager), is superbly sublime as the principled, eloquent Resistance fighter. Contrary to some reports, he's not a sap who has no idea what's going on between Bergman and Bogie. My suspicion has always been that he knew a lot more than he ever let on. Finally we have Conrad Veidt, the very epitome of the sadistic Nazi commader. Veidt had inpeccable credentials for such a role he'd been imprisoned by the Nazis during the 1930's. Plenty of opportunity to study the real thing up close and personal, one would agree.Lest I forget, I feel a special mention should go to director Michael Curtiz, who keeps the plot rolling along at the pace of a bullet train. Anyone who likes this one should check out his other great classics with Errol Flynn, Captain Blood and The Adventures of Robin Hood. A director of good taste and great skill, he should be remembered as well as anyone else for his contribution to this cinematic masterpiece.

My best friends and I speak a language all our own, a mad, hilarious jargon comprised of life-long inside-joke fragments and punchlines, inexplicable nicknames, and, most of all, QUOTES! We'll quote damn near anyone or anything, but most of all we quote our favorite movies. Drugstore Cowboy is an absolute goldmine of exquisite quotable material. Immortalized on my yearbook senior page is Nadine, what are you talking about? C'mon honey, you're with me! I'm not gonna leave you anywhere! My best friend's little cousins, ages 3, 5, and 7, at the time, used to chant this quote in unison, suddenly and frequently, because they heard us all say it so many friggin' times. Drugstore Cowboy is a classic through and through. I will never forget a frame of it. I will never forget any of the dialogue, as long as I don't develop any sizeable deposits of aluminum in my brain, that is. We've been calling anyone and everyone Bob and Nadine for years, and our favorite way of pronouncing the word lighter comes from this flick. Dillon and especially LeGros have vast amounts of instant classic lines that have been oft-quoted for ages. And that is the greatest recommendation I could ever give for any movie. If we've been quoting it for years, it's because it's head, shoulders, and usually torso above all the rest. D.C. never becomes obnoxiously moralistic or unhealthily worshipful about its subject matter. It's often as hilarious and endearing as it is unflinching, it offers a message of hope and optimism, but doesn't sugar-coat anything, which strengthens that message. I know from personal experience that the compulsion to use drugs can be treated and arrested, as long as the addict wants to bad enough. I also know that this is an extremely difficult and scary thing to do. The flick conveys both realities equally well. Every actor is in top form here, and the movie is a triumph of ATMOSPHERE. Gus Van Sant creates a Pacific Northwestern environment that is unmistakable; I've never physically been anywhere near the Pacific Northwest, but I already know what it feels like cold and damp(For some more excellent Oregon\/Northern Cali atmosphere, check out Tim Hunter's River's Edge, another all-time great)! Bottom line, not one second of this movie has EVER bored me or found me disinterested in its world. I think that's probably the best thing I could say about any film. It makes me part of its world and I enjoy the visit immensely, every single time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ","genre":null},{"date":"26 April 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Whoa, I have long lost count of how many times I've seen this movie.

Even the title p***es me off..the messenger. And all through the movie she's whining, I'm only the messenger.  I really don't think that was how it happened, Joan of Arc had to have had a very strong personality, not a childish one or noone would have listened to her!2. The lines were so bad.......hello, since when did they use American slang in the 1400's in France?  Yargh, it was so stuuuupid!3. Gross.  The rape scene was unrealistic and disgusting, it turned my stomach.  I didn't feel comfortable watching the rest of the movie after that.  Since when does someone die immediately after being stabbed in the stomach?  And do you really think he would rape her while she was pinned through the stomach to a wooden door and dead?  Nice touch...NOT!Seems like someone making this movie really got a kick out of it though...that's the really gross part.4. I didn't buy John Malkovich as the King, I didn't buy Faye Dunaway as Yolande D'Aragon these actors were miscast.  They both are so overused in movies and it's like, Oh, here's John M. playing Charles II  Instead of, Charles the II was played by John M..  Yawn.  John M. is so over exposed and so predictable, I knew exactly how he would act and he did...  Also wasn't John M. a bit old to play the part????5. Slowness....I didn't even watch the whole thing, it made me tired watching Milli trying to act like an actress, so I turned it off and went to bed.Hey, Dustin Hoffman was pretty good though!  But that's no surprise.Don't rent this dog, and if someone gives it to you free I wouldn't even bother watching it, it belongs in the garbage.  I'm just sorry that Milla Jovonich didn't do better, I think she should take acting classes or something.

The film is definitely worth seeing in any version, but I love it so much anything less than Kubrick's unmasked version will not do for me.

There are two main elements of the movie that make it both endearing and unforgettable the characters and the music.Director Paul T. Anderson brought together a highly eclectic and talented cast of actors to portray the abundance of characters.  The three most notably stand-out performances definitely belonged to Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds.  They kept the movie together even during some of the more weaker plot areas around the falling out of Diggler and Horner.  They brought highly believeable characters on-screen.  One of the most telling talents of any actor is to show a very distinct difference between acting and acting as though you were acting.  See the line drawn in the first movie Eddie films as Dirk Diggler.  Wahlberg and Moore show how natural they are before the filming and then show cardboard cut-outs of themselves in front of the camera.  Anyone who has ever seen a porn film from this era can see how true to character they portrayed the filming. If the plot and the characters weren't enough to keep you hooked , Anderson adds music from the era that gives it the right feeling for the times.  He also knows what songs to play during certain plot points.  Notice how all the songs played from the pool party through Dirk Diggler's initial success as a porn star are all upbeat, while the later scenes where he is in a downward spiral are all ominous and foreboding.It took a couple of viewings to fully appreciate the brilliance in Anderson's dialogue and camera angles.  I loved that scene where he follows the girl into the pool underwater and right into Dirk and Reed on the other side.  It was fluid and highly unorthodox.  Another brilliant stroke were the scenes near the end where he expertly showed Jack, Dirk and Buck have interesting experiences on the same night and all within a few blocks of each other without ever running into each other.  This film is definitely a must see.  Though the main plot point was about a young man becoming a porn star, it had very little nudity and even fewer sexual situations.  The drug scene that was definitely rampant in the 70s and early 80s is much more noticeable.  Anderson obviously has the makings of a Scorcese or a Tarantino, and this movie will be the one people will remember as the first of many brilliant movies.

Raymond Chandler may be more renowned, but Dashiell Hammet (hailed by no less a personage than lawyer\/child activist\/neo-noir writer Andrew Vachss as True father of the Black Mask Boys) put the gritty realism in the detective genre and very little, if any, of that grit is lost in this superb debut by one of Hollywood's finest craftsmen, John Huston. I first watched this when I was about 13 and though my recollection of the film has since proved to be hazy, I never did forget the feel of the film. It was like being slammed up against a wall by a sledgehammer. My subsequent reading of the novel itself was far from disappointing; I could virtually replay entire scenes of the film just by reading Hammet's spare but vivid descriptions.Entertainment Weekly described this film as Bogie the Legend Pt. 1. Not quite true. Bogie's Sam Spade has a lot more rough edges than his subsequent roles in such films as Across the Pacific and Casablanca. Bogie's frequently underrated skill as an actor makes Spade believable throughout. He has an iron-clad code of ethics that put him at odds with his rogue's gallery of deceivers (who only seem to believe in money), but he has no trouble whatsoever knocking Peter Lorre senseless or taking away Elisha Cook's guns as casually as a pickpocket would lift a wallet (though, to be fair, Spade is a lot more violent in his methods). Therefore, I think of Sam Spade as a borderline character, the one that stands between Bogie's earlier gangsters and his later burnt romantics. The final metamorphisis would not be complete until Casablanca came along.The rest of the cast is top of the line. Peter Lorre makes Joel Cairo out to be a slightly sinister, slightly spineless henchman. Mary Astor's Bridgit O'Shaugnessy set the model of the femme fatale that all such successors would follow. Elisha Cook as the hair-trigger Wilmer is a study in mindless viciousness. Finally, Sydney Greenstreet begins to carve out his own unique, oversized niche as the charming, polite, but ultimately slimy and loathsome crime boss that is Kasper Gutman. Say what you will about this movie's successors; ultimately, they're all just faded photocopies of The Maltese Falcon. The stuff dreams are made of, indeed.

That's one of the few saving graces of my watching this film.  It was worse than even I expected and I tried very hard to watch this with an open mind.  First of all, the sappy dialogue I just could not believe the dead seriousness in which it was delivered or the sugary violins surging in the background.  My brother forwarded liberally through parts like these (and there are a lot of them) and instead of objecting, as I would usually do, I secretly thanked him.  One might think you can't judge a film if you miss parts of it but I just couldn't bear watching scenes like this.  The scenes between the father (played by Hugh Laurie) and the son (played by an inanimate wooden puppet...I mean that kid from Jerry McGuire) were the worst.  I half-expected someone to say `Where's the Beav?'.  My dark fantasy for this movie was to have Rowan Atkinson playing his character from Black Adder enter the movie and rip Hugh Laurie to shreds.  Then there's Stuart himself.  He seemed to me more cutesy than cute (i.e. the filmmakers were practically banging me over the head with his cuteness).Anyway, back to the movie itself.  The one other saving grace of this movie, may have been the cats who managed to elicit a few chuckles (though not hearty guffaws).  Plus I just like cats, even though in SL they were portrayed as toned-down gangsters (villains, again while the mice, which in reality spread filth and disease and leave little turds all over the foodstuffs, are the good guys - oh well, at least one of the cats redeemed himself) and had that silly computer animation messing up their faces.  The little fat mouse (voiced by Bruno Kirby who sounds an awful lot like Joe Pesci) was somewhat amusing as well.  Oh yeah, the effects were OK, too.Other than that, this movie eats.  To use the cat Snowbell's words `Excuse me while I cough up a hairball.'  I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade but I just found this an insipid, cloying mess.  I just couldn't get into it at all.

Nevertheless, not to take too much away from the movie, it still deserves a 3.5\/5.

I know people have been questioning its authenticity, and I think it should be. This story sells on basis that it is a true story, so if the script is in fact somewhat removed from the truth, then this movie is essentially fiction. One of the things I disliked was how clear cut the heroes and villains were portrayed. Surely Dan Hedaya's character could not have been that bad, and those Canadians were just a little too nice- we had no idea what they did or who they were either.

Halloween is about a little boy who kills his sister then some 15 years later in a hospital he escapes to do so again. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the head role in her film debut and Donald Pleasnce plays the quite doctor. The film is released in two versions- It's Orginial version and another with new footage. The film dose not have much gore but is very scary. It inculdes some of the strange killings- Strangualtion, Knife stabbing and Thorat slashing. Followed by 5 sequles and one sequel in production Halloween 8! and Halloween 3 has nothing to do with it. It was also made with 2 clones- Terror Train and He Knows You're Alone. Terror Train also inculed Jamie Lee Curtis and a strange rip-off friday The 13th I am tired of Jason Michael Myers the killer of Halloween I think is the best killer I have ever seen. Watch this not alone especially on Halloween. Rated R For Violence, Language, Sexual Content,and Nudity. Directed by John Carpenter.

While Mo' Better Blues is not as wonderful as Do the Right Thing or Malcolm X, it still deserves considerable recognition as one of his more solid efforts. The story is a bit uneven, but the acting and the music more than make up for it.Denzel Washington plays Bleek Gilliam, a NYC trumpet player who fronts his own jazz quintet to sell-out crowds at a local club. He's managed by Giant (played by Lee), an irresponsible compulsive gambler who is only Bleek's manager because they're childhood friends. Meanwhile, Bleek is seeing two different women (played by Joie Lee Spike's real-life sister and Cynda Williams), and is torn between his passion for music and his inability to control his relationships. Things go haywire when Bleek's sax player, Shadow (Wesley Snipes), vies for the affections of one of Bleek's women, promising her fortune and fame as a jazz singer since Bleek only cares about himself anyway.Giant's gambling problems, Bleek's convictions as a serious musician, and the tightrope one walks between love and professional dedication are themes all visited in this exciting, vibrant film. Besides the wonderful performances (by Washington, Snipes, and the always-underrated Lee standby Giancarlo Esposito, among others), Ernest Dicekrson's cinematography is stunning, and the music -- performed in real life by Branford Marsalis, who has a cameo in the film -- is dazzling. The way the band mimes the performances is thoroughlly convincing (although it must be noted that Bleek's drummer is played by Jeff Tain Watts, a real jazz drummer who actually performs on the tracks themselves).If you're a jazz lover and a lover of Spike Lee's movies, check this out -- you'll be glad you did.

All I can say is FINALLY something comes out of England that's not some Tarantino wannabe flick with guns and stuff.  This is a great film, with a lot of comedy, drugs, raves and all the stuff that you really never picture the Brits doing.Justin Kerrigan did a great job with a story that was all about a group of friends who go out raveing every weekend to get away from their pretty horrible weekday life.  The story isn't really focussed on one guy in particular, although there is a main character, Jip, who I think is mostly there to tie things together.  Instead, the different members of the groups of friends all have their individualities as part of this group, and it's a great ensemble acting piece.My favorite character was Koop, a guy who works in a record store and is totally jealous of his girlfriend, Nina.  He is so cool - and really hot! - and has the coolest job of them all, even though he too wishes he was something else, like a DJ.Speaking of music - I am going out to get the soundtrack to this film.  It ROCKS!  The music that they picked had the audience rocking to the beat, it was so pumpin!  In Koop's introductory scene, where they show him selling stuff like jungle, gangsta rap and the like to customers who bring new meaning to the word poser, well, let me just say, even if the customers weren't the real thing, the music was.The only thing I really didn't like was the beginning, where they just have everyone talking to the camera.  Thankfully, it wasn't that long, and the rest of the film wasn't like it at all.This was a great film and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes cool music, comedy and British accents!
