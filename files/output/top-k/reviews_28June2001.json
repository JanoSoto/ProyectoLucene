Jaws 2 maybe more than any sequel in the summer blockbuster era (that began with Jaws in 1975) seems to really badly suffer from peoples' need to have the same thrills that they did in the first film. We as human beings 'expect' things from everyone in life. Expectations lead to disappointment. Fans of the first Jaws always say Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are sorely missed in this sequel, but consider this - Shaw's character is dead and Dreyfuss' character does not live anywhere close to Amity, not to mention why would he come back to hunt down a shark again when that is not even his job. It is much more realistic for the town of Amity to have to deal with the shark on its' own. And they don't even know for sure that it is a shark until the latter part of the film. Also, neither Jaws nor Jaws 2 is a realistic story. A shark would not continually terrorize a town so much as the sharks do in both films. However, if it happens once in nature, it can happen again - lightning does strike twice and therefore the premise for Jaws 2 is plausible.Jaws 2 is an excellent sequel, and it can proudly stand along side the original, unlike the other two horrible sequels. It has a verrrrry underrated John Williams score, many of the townspeople from the original film have better, larger roles, it has great shark scenes, solid direction, Roy Scheider, and the outstanding Producer team of Zanuck and Brown. Those guys were old pros and knew how to deliver a different story that also still builds on what the original created. Had they had a chance to produce another Jaws sequel, then maybe the series wouldn't be so malignly regarded as it is now. Even the Superman series with the horrible 3 and 4, just got a boxed set release on DVD. Back to the Future and Indiana Jones and Star Wars certainly will too. So out of the great blockbuster series of the late 70s thru the 80s, only Jaws has not been released as a set. It certainly is not because of Jaws 2, which is one of the great surprises of DVD this year. Universal was not stupid. They realized this was the last good Jaws film, and that they could still make money off of it. They treated the film with respect. The bonus materials are amazing!!!!Jaws 2 is a terrific movie for those of you who are willing to give up your expectations and let the film guide you to its' entertainment and satisfaction.

Having seen so many movies, I was actually ignorant enough to think that nothing could shock or disturb me anymore.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  Horror is my favorite genre and while this isn't a horror flick it is still pretty damn horrifying.  Two things drew me to this movie.  Billy Bob Thornton was the first.  I have followed his career steadily since he gained recognition with Sling Blade and the man has not let me down.  Second reason, Sam Raimi.  He is an icon among horror film buffs and up and coming film students.  The Evil Dead trilogy showcased his talents with the brilliant camera work and his somewhat warped sense of vision.  A Simple Plan tells the story of three regular guys who find a suitcase full of money in a downed airplane.  Assuming the money is drug money, they figure that no one will notice if they keep it.  The plan does start off simple.  Hank (Bill Paxton), his brother Jacob (Billy Bob), and Jacob's idiot, loser, drunk friend Lou (Brent Briscoe) decide that to hang on to the money for six months.  If it's not missed by Spring, they will split the cash between them and go their seperate ways.  Things seem fine at first, with Hank as the natural leader, but soon all goes to hell once greed sets in and morals start to fly out the window.  It's all down hill from here.While the plot may be simple, what really makes this thing work is the characters.  All three of the leads are totally believable in their roles.  Hank could be easily be a friend of yours, Jacob could be the guy behind you in the checkout line at the grocery store, and Lou could be the town drunk you see walking on the side of the road.  This is a character movie.  Simple story, complex characters and their reaction to a seemingly easy situation.  Billy Bob Thornton became so devoted to playing his role, he shed 30lbs to play Jacob.  You can tell that a lot of the pain you see in Jacob's eyes is not just acting.  The actor has truly felt this guy's pain.  Playing this role was NOT easy on the guy and (in my opinion) he should have gotten that Oscar.Bill Paxton is wonderful as Hank.  He has the look and feel of that guy (every town in America has at least one)  who had so much potential, but never left his home town.  He is the brains and the moral center of the three.  Brent Briscoe (Scooter Hodges from Sling Blade) plays the part of Lou.  Lou is the best friend of Jacob and the town drunk.   Although many would argue that it is Jacob's fault, much of the trouble that comes their way is brought on by Lou's ignorance.  He is a thoroughly annoying and disgusting character and Briscoe did a fine job with the part considering how likeable he was in Sling Blade.I'm not going to give away any more of what happens.  Earlier I described this movie as horrifying.  It is.  Why?  The characters are all people we could actually know.  No, this isn't a horror flick, but decent, ordinary people can turn into monsters at the drop of a hat.  Disregard Leonard Maltin's review (with all do respect) where he says that the transformation of the characters simply does not ring true. It does and I've seen it happen.  The movie is, in no way, as harsh and cold as the book but the point is still made.   9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 June 2001","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I thought that I was desensitized.

I immediately thought of John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation, and saw a parallel philosophy with Magnolia.As far as the frog scene goes, I know it must have something to do with the eighth chapter of Exodus; the whole, Let My People Go, proclamation. In that chapter, everything is infested by a plague of frogs because the Pharaoh wouldn't release the people.  I suppose there is a connection of the freeing of all those hurt souls in the climax of Magnolia, but, remember, the Biblical plague was executed as punishment because the people WEREN'T liberated.  So that kind of counteracts any sense of resolution...Another possibility involves this Southern urban legend about vanishing ponds.  I'm not a meterologist and never will be, but I AM Southern and that's enough for me to perpetuate fantastical folklore. The legend is that, with the extreme weather changes in the South, (weather that is loyal to NO season) there have been environmental conditions---that have oscillated so wildly from dry and sunny to humid and cloudy---that water evaporates alarmingly quickly. So quickly, that fish & frogs have been dragged into cloudwater and have fallen from the sky. Or something like that.  It IS fantastical, but it's supposedly happened.  (And in Shreveport, Louisiana in the 50s, there was a thing about peaches falling from the sky that everybody's grandparents remembers and talks about ad nauseum. I am not making this up.)The whole idea of water makes sense too, as there were a lot of water images in the movie.  The weather, for one.  They keep giving us written forecasts and then it rains---and it rarely ever rains in Southern California---so that might have been a harbinger of the folklore.  Also, water is the most profound expression of life beyond, of course, the voice.  We use water as an expression for many things the little boy peeing under stress as the host of the show, Jimmy Gator, is crying after drinking too much (again with the water) and the whole time everybody's sweating (water), and then they're giving Jimmy Gator water----replacing water with water---when they're trying to sober him up...And then there's release\/anger with Tom Cruise's tears at the bedside of his father, there's poor Claudia who has tears in her eyes the WHOLE movie, rain and water and tears and everything it represents plays a huge role in illustrating emotion.Okay, now for the magnolia.

If that's unsuccessful (which it was, as I don't remember any profound magnolia stories in the Bible), I go for World mythology.  And I don't remember anything in it, either. Frustrating, because the image HAS to have been important---I mean, it's the $#%^& title of the entire movie.Therefore, I figured that the magnolia (a tree exclusive to North America and particularly seen in the South) starts out with pure-white petals cast wide, kind of like we all start out innocent and opened.  Pure.  But, if you've ever touched a magnolia, you know that the petal you touched turns brown and withers.  I suppose this has something to do with being hurt by other people throughout life and experiencing things that take our innocence.  Reminds me of Gerard Manly Hopkins' poem, Spring and Fall.

I first heard about A.I. about ten years ago on a radio talk show when a caller ask the host on what was Stanley Kubrick up to.  Then hearing that Steven Spielberg was going to take over, I felt that Stanley's wife Christina, wanted Spielberg to take over the project since Steven and Stanely were both good friends.  I was then very pleased to hear that Stanley's original intentions were to have Speilberg direct, and Stanley would design and the have the credits read A Stanley Kubrick Productions of a Steven Spielberg Film. Now that time of waiting for about ten years has come, I heard more rumors and anticipation with A.I. than I did with STAR WARS EPISODE I. And viewing A.I. had transported me into another world........... A.I. tells a classic tale of a very human like robot named David (Haley Joel Osment) who is taken in by a grieving couple, Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O' Connor & Sam Robards) to replace their son, Martin, who is lying in a coma after a terrible accident.  Monica is angry at David and doesn't want anything to replace Martin, especially a machine.  But Henry warns Monica that if they send David back to the factory, he'll be destroyed. Monica has a hard time trying to cope with David, and after a while, Monica begins to accept David as a new son.  When Martin (Jake Thomas) wakes up from his coma, he sees David as a threat to his parents love.  Martin pulls cruel tricks and pranks on David that causes Henry to hate David and Monica worried about the robot.  It isn't until a birthday party accident that Henry orders Monica to take David back to be destroyed.  Monica gets second thoughts about this, she still loves David like a son, but she knows that he's not welcomed back.  So she drops David off in the forrest with his friend\/toy Teddy (voiced by Jack Angel).  Monica warns David to stay away from humans and only be with robots.  David is heartbroken by his abondenment from Monica that he thinks that he's not loved because he's a robot.  He feels that if he finds the blue fairy that was talked about in the story Pinocchio, that maybe David could also be a real boy.  Thus begins the journey of David, the search of becoming a real boy.  Along the way he meets a sexual pleasure robot named Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who is wrongfully accused of one of his female customer's murder. Lord Johnson Johnson (Brenden Gleason) a cruel robot hunter who destroys robots in a arena for entertainment value. And also Professor Hobby (William Hurt) the man who designed the robot to not only make it able to learn, but also to have feelings and love. After this summer crop of bad films and disappointments (PEARL HARBOR, A KNIGHT'S TALE, MUMMY RETURNS, TOMB RAIDER, etc.) Leave it to Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick to make not only the most pleasing film of the summer, but the most enjoyable film of the year.  A.I. is short for Artificial Intelligence, it should be Absoultly Incredible! This was the movie that I was looking forward to the most this year(more than PEARL HARBOR and PLANET OF THE APES) and I am pleased to say that it met more than my expectations which makes it so far my favorite film of this year. What makes this a fantasitc film?  First the acting is very well done.  Haley Joel Osment proves that he is no ordinary child actor, but the Jodie Foster of his generation.  Osment gives another outstanding performance as the robot David.  He can act very much like a robot and a young curious and frighten child.  I am expecting to see Osment get another Oscar nomination for this film.  But I also like to recognize Jude Law and Frances O' Connor for their wonderful protrayl of the sex pleasure robot, and the mother who is depressed to let her newly arrived son released on his own. Then there is the set designs and costumes.  I found out yesterday while watching the documentary STANLEY KUBRICK A LIFE IN PICTURES that Kubrick designed most of the sets and costumes for A.I. (he had to, he faxed over 500 drawings to Spielberg over the last year's of his life).  The look of A.I. is a very fascinating mixture of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, BRAZIL, BLADE RUNNER, and WATERWORLD.  With the future not looking bright and cheerful how it is protrayed in BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 and the STAR TREK movies, but dark, devistating, and apocylptic.  The futurisic world of Mechna City where there is holograms displaying entertainment everywhere, to the ruins of Manhattan, where only the tops of the skyscrapers and torch of Lady Liberty stand above water.  Then the costumes of the futurstic look are also great.  The style that Gigolo Joe is wearing to impress the ladies with his looks, to the very scary look of the robot hunters who's outfits look like the characters from TRON. And the story most of all has great meaning to it.  One would figure that it's a typical Spielberg story with as much corn as in the state of Iowa in it.  But it does have a very deep and intellectual meaning behind it.  The tale of a robot who thinks he's a boy that he is willing to do anything to try to become a real boy just to win back the love of his mom, Monica.  Like UNBREAKABLE, it takes a while to digest it, but after digesting it, you would like more of it and begin to really appreciate it. Finally the directing style of Spielberg, where he does familar scenes from both his films and Kubrick's as well.  The popluar Monkey See, Monkey Do scene from JAWS where Chief Brody makes movements as his son Sean imitates his every move.  The isolation in the forrest in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is similar to when Monica takes David out to the forrest.  And the horrific scenes in SCHINDLER'S LIST with what the Nazis did to the prisoners also are seen in A.I. with the abuse to what the humans do to destroy the robots, and make a show out of it. The irony is intresting, the most popular film of Stanley Kubrick's is 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Now that 2001 has arrived, the most entertaining film of 2001 is the film that Kubrick started to create.  Maybe Kubrick was telling us something back in 1968 about what we could expect in the year 2001, not with the story but with the meaning.  That something wonderful was yet to come, and that something is the film, A.I.  It just would have been creepy to see a copy of A.I. sitting on the record shelf next to 2001 in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or having one of the female teens ask Alex about the group, Artificial Intelligence.  People have always said that Stanley Kubrick was ahead of our time, and again, after passing away over two years ago, Kubrick is still years ahead of us.

This was the time for De Palma, cast and company to just have fun with the proceedings and it shows; without the accessibility of more material by populist authors like King and Farris, it would be years before he would have another hit on this scale.

For many years I had read about Akira Kuwosawa as a director, with nothing but praise heaped upon him and his individualistic style. However the opportunity to watch one of his films had never arisen, so I remained blissfully unaware of his cultured delights. One day in my college library I was browsing the video section when I happened upon a copy of Seven Samurai. I had a free evening so I took the movie out. After noting the particularly lengthy viewing time, I settled down to watch the movie hailed as 'the purest action film ever made'.Having seen the film, I can honestly tell you Seven Samurai is so much more than that.The first thing of note is the beauty of Kurosawa's direction and Asakazu Nakai's cinematography. Every frame is like an exquisite photograph, with the lush environments captured perfectly in black and white. It is generally presumed that a film shot in monochrome is old. Not so with Seven Samurai. Rather, I don't think I have ever seen a film so ahead of it's time, yet rooted in classic Japanese tradition (if that makes sense!!!).Of course a film wouldn't be very good if it was simply beautiful (see The Cell for evidence of this), so it's just as well Seven Samurai has one of the finest casts ever assembled. The highlights for me were Takashi Shimura's old and wisened Kambei, as well as Toshiro Mifune's standout performance as Kikuchiyo. The sheer range of emotions he displays as an actor, from courage to despair, are displayed with vivid and realistic detail which helps the performance stick in the mind. Not that the rest of the cast are far behind, with Seiji Miyaguchi's supercool Kzuyo and Isao Kimura's naive Katsushiro also taking the honours.The story itself (beautifully constructed by Shinobu Hashimoto and Kurosawa himself) is superbly paced, with a relaxed attitude to the early scenes leading into taut and tense direction towards the end of the movie. It explores and deals with themes of loyalty, friendship, youth and compassion, all of which blend seamlessly into the admittedly basic story. Seven Samurai however, scores in its simplicity. In keeping the story fairly straightforward, Kurosawa allows himself the room to develop his characters and their lives in exquisite and intricate detail.Suffice to say the running time of Seven Samurai should really be four hours as a pose to three, because after viewing this cinematic masterpiece you will need at least an hour to reflect on what you have experienced. This is how cinema was meant to be raw, unflinching and yet unashamedly beautiful.A true masterpiece.

The first time watching 2001, The Shining or Full Metal Jacket I left puzzled.  The more I see these movies, the more they resonate.  I think that in a Kubrick movie, the journey is more important than the destination.  They don't have powerhouse climaxes.  They don't end on a big emotional climax.  They continue in the mind of the audience beyond the confines of the movie theater.Steven Spielberg's movies are a different matter.  They are wonderful, manipulative and more than fulfill the first viewing's expectations.  The best Spielberg movies are great the first time and every other time because they seem fresh each time you watch them.  Jaws, Raiders and Jurassic Park each can thrill me with the same visceral energy I felt the first time I watched them.  These films aren't deep. Hidden meanings aren't revealed. The lesser films in the Spielberg catalog, The Color Purple, Always and Hook lose that freshness with repeated viewings.  They sometimes make me wonder why I liked them when I originally saw in them when I watch them again. The lone exception, in my mind, is Empire of the Sun, a subtle movie that reaches for more emotional resonance than the typical Spielberg film and which has grown on me through the power of its story and visual eloquence.So AI a strange hybrid.  The performances are wonderful.  The story is beautiful.  The images are astounding.  With a single viewing, I felt that Speilberg tried too hard to explain things that Kubrick would have left to be pondered on future viewings.  It's not over the top explaining (my favorite example of over explaining is the end of Mission to Mars, which is like 2001 for Dummies) but there were times when my personal experience was interrupted by narration.  I felt that each time my mind started to be intellectually curious, the narration would drown out my thoughts with overly simplistic words.But, that may have been the point of some of it.  There is a strong fairytale theme.  I suppose I will have to see it again to make sure.  I'm looking forward to that.  AI is a hard movie to pin down, and these days, that's got to be a good thing.
