Better still maybe it should have been left alone.In a nutshell Gillian Anderson plays a young socialite of low means who is trying to marry rich but is frustrated by her love of a young man who is carrying on an affair with a married friend. Her character is so tragically in love with this man she sacrifices everything by accepting a scandalous disgrace rather than reveal the proof she has of the affair.While it's nice to see a film that does not unrealistically portray the position of women in the past and chooses instead to show the genuine struggles women went through this film doesn't do it in an engaging way. The main character is so weepy and spineless while all those around her take horrible advantage of her its hard to care. The dialogue occasionally shines when one can clearly recognize the clever line lifted directly from the original work; it is flat most of the rest of the time. It's hard to assess the acting when the rolls seem so unappealing. Anthony Lapagia is the only person to stand out both for acting and playing a character with some real sense. The chemistry between Anderson and Eric Stolz as her love interest is so lacking it is impossible to understand why this love is worth sacrificing a cab ride let alone one's entire life. Oh and after only a few days ago commenting on the refreshing turn Dan Ackoyd's career had taken with him playing a wealthy sex-obsessed sleazeball in Stardom I was astonished to see him playing an almost identical roll here!Perhaps worst of all the film rarely allows any moments of candor. The beauty of Dangerous Liasons was the shift between polite conversation and brutal honesty. Here honesty is all but totally lacking and film is poorer for it. Perhaps in 1905 these conversations were scandalously candid, now they are a yawn.I found myself checking my watch constantly and, after 2 hours and 15 increasingly excruciating minutes, I was `forced' to leave the theatre in time to make it to my next screening. I cannot even comment on whether the ending satisfactorily redeemed the movie.

I love it for many reasons. The main one is, I think, the most common I like to feel scared. It's a strange feeling, delightful, almost sadomasochist. But it is great! Of course there is a huge number of contrivances that makes the audience feel scared (chilling score, dark rooms, people coming from behind), but it's worth of it. Films like THE SHINING, THE EXORCIST, SCREAM, HALLOWEEN make me feel proud of watching them. So I was anxiously expecting the new horror movie to come WHAT LIES BENEATH. After two box-office hits last year (a great one that is THE SIXTH SENSE and an awful one THE BLAIR WITH PROJECT) and the end of SCREAM trilogy, there had to be something good on the genre. And WHAT LIES BENEATH covered all my expectations.The reaction of the critics was not very good, so I was a little worried about it, but I didn't care much about that and wanted to see the movie with my own eyes. What I saw was a film which only big flaw was the lack of originality. The story and some scenes use stale elements from THE SIXTH SENSE, REAR WINDOW, FATAL ATTRACTION and STIR OF ECHOES. It's difficult to make a totally original film in Hollywood nowadays, but Zemeckis should have been more audacious. Taking that, WHAT LIES BENEATH is a joy to watch. Some of the elements it borrows from other films are like homages, especially to the master Alfred Hitchcock. And when it wants to be scary, it is. There are a lot of jumpy scenes, a thing I love, even if they are kind of predictable. There is a chilling atmosphere and a very well crafted story. Some people complain about the screenplay, but I think it's one of the best things. It's well written and at the end you will see that the things fit each other.The first half is terrific, similar to Hitchcock films driving you slowly into the characters and the situations. The second half is more like a modern horror scary, twisted, more violent and fast-paced. The last 20 minutes, which have been very criticized, are sometimes unbelievable, but it's edge-of-your-seat suspense, like a roller coast, especially the bathtub scene, with delightful references to PSYCHO and the French classic LES DIABOLIQUES. Behind all that there is the hand of Robert Zemeckis, who won an Oscar and knows what he is doing. If he doesn't have a very original story in hands, he makes that into a film that is scarier and more intriguing than others. What also helps is the acting. I don't even need to talk about the central couple. Harrison Ford redeemed himself of RANDOM HEARTS and Michelle Pfeiffer... She is terrific! Her expressions of horror are amazing (inspired by Drew Barrymore in SCREAM!), and her performance is worth of recognition. Not to say that she is totally gorgeous at 43 and... Well, she is a joy to watch!One of the biggest complaints of the critics was about the trailer. They said it trashed all the twists and surprises of the film, so I decided to shut my eyes and my ears when they showed the trailer before other film I saw. I think the trailer shows scenes of the second half, when Claire already knows about the affair between Norman and the girl. If they really show this, it's shameful.Despite its minor flaws, WHAT LIES BENEATH didn't deserve to be so criticized. It's a well crafted, well acted, well directed, spooky, suspenseful and scary piece of modern horror. It's a delight for horror\/suspense fans.

She tears at the scenery, she tears at the script, and brother I feel sorry for her co-stars, because even though they are also a talented group, they of course don't stand a chance when Crawford's on the screen, which is basically every scene. Although her character doesn't appear right away, it's still obvious from the very start that this is a very, very Crawford movie. The film just instantaneously gives off that omen. The gist of the story is this Crawford is a glamorous socialite who dominates her Southern family and takes great pride in doing so. Yes, we've seen Crawford play this type of role before(HARRIETT CRAIG), but I personally never tire of seeing Crawford getting the upper hand. Though they didn't get along too well in real life, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis had much in common when it came to choice of movie scripts. They both specialized in playing catty, indomitable females, and they both clearly relished doing so. Crawford is at her best in this one. Sure, the script isn't the greatest she's been given, and frankly it's pretty sleazy stuff, but Crawford does wonders with it and manages to turn in her finest performance. She clearly works at the part and isn't simply clawing and nailing at everyone around her. Even though her character is an absolute horror of a human being, Crawford does her best to make her a sympathetic one, and she just about pulls it off!

Her timid interplay with Faguendes (Pedro Paul) was sweet and touching. I enjoyed watching their love story unfold. Faguendes is obviously a well-known, beloved actor in his home country. It's the first time I've seen his work and I can see why he's so popular.But there's plenty more to take note of. Watching Faguendes' family ties nearly unravel is almost heartbreaking at times. To see three generations is almost unheard of in today's movies. I was pleased to see it.The other subplots are equally fun. The soon-to-be exported Brazilian soccer player's quest to learn how to curse in English is hilarious. And watching the girl dream of her online boyfriend is something many of us can relate to. Not to mention the soulful longing of the young man (Pedro Paul's son)who wants her but isn't brave enough to state his case.All this plays out against an almost idyllic backdrop of sand dunes, towering mountains, charming cafes and crashing surf. Sure, it may not be the entire face of Rio but would you want to see the sewers in New York City? I doubt it.

To make sure, I watched two other Chan movies later - I don't and don't want to remember their titles - and those were just as bad. Chan cannot act, cannot even *appear* to act, cannot speak (he never *speaks*, he *always* shouts!), cannot choose actors (or maybe he deliberately wants all of them to act even more wooden than he does, even though it might seem an impossible task!) and obviously cannot spend more than five seconds thinking of the plot of his movies. Wait, did I call them movies? I take it back - that would be an insult to all REAL movies. Ed Wood made Oscar-deserving movies compared to Mr Chan's creations. Those aren't even flicks. They are just an incoherent mess with no script, no directing and no acting - only some idiotic stunts that Mr Chan reportedly does himself (as if I cared), such as an incredible task of jumping four stairs down, with a team of paramedics on guard. Are stunts all that his audience asks for? It would seem so. As for me, I'll remain with the old-fashioned idea of a movie script first, directing second, acting third. Effects and stunts - last.

An elderly woman was dying of cancer, and she proclaimed that she wished to see her son one last time.  What makes the story eerie is that her son disappeared from the Fort Lauderdale area in 1978, just like David Scott Freeman in Flight of the Navigator.  On the morning of July 5, 1978, Helen and Bill Freeman (Veronica Cartwright and Cliff DeYoung) awoke to learn that their son David (Joey Cramer) was missing.  Eight years later, in 1986, he returned, not having aged a minute.  Meanwhile, a flying saucer from the planet Phelan has landed on earth.  It was later determined that all of its starcharts and artificial intelligence have escaped into David's brain.  A team of NASA scientists led by Dr. Faraday (Howard Hesseman) is determined to research the connection between the alien ship and the time travelling David.  Will David remain a lab rat for the rest of his life, or will he escape to freedom?  There's only one way to find out, and that is by watching the movie.  Perhaps there are several themes to this movie.  Many families have lived with the tragedy of missing their children, and retrieving them is an arduous and time consuming task that often goes unfulfilled.  It can also be seen as a story of alienation someone mired in 1978 may face if he were to suddenly awake in 1986.  During those eight years, as David learned, his family moved and aged, Jimmy Carter was voted out of office, Starsky and Hutch went off the air, four new kinds of Coca-Cola hit the shelves, some girls began to dye their hair purple, and an all-male group named Twisted Sister replaced the Bee Gees as the most popular band of the time.  Take note of the cameo appearances of Sarah Jessica Parker as NASA assistant Carolyn McAdams, and of Paul Reubens as the voice of Max.  To answer your question, Chad Perman, Joey Cramer is alive and well and living in Vancouver.  Having visited South Florida several times, I can add one last message of the movie.

The best bond film to me is GoldenEye, then Live and Let Die, then Dimonds are Forever, then For Your Eyes Only, and then The World is Not Enough. I give TND ** out of 10 stars.
