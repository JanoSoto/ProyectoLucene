The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film.  It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.Writer\/director\/composer Alejandro Amenabar creates a dark, dark atmosphere, in which you feel like you can't trust anyone.  Nicole Kidman, in her brilliant performance as Grace, is supposedly the heroine of the film, but as I watched the movie I found myself more frightened of her than rooting for her; steely and overbearing, with a hint of psychotic hysteria in her icy eyes.  And then the children, (held their own and even stole a few scenes from the more experienced players) were just hellishly creepy.  The little girl was one of the most ominous characters I have ever seen in a film.  And the servants (who were also finely played) will keep you guessing the whole way through.  Every time you think you have it figured out, some of the household help will pop up and throw the whole framework off-kilter.The real attraction in this film is Nicole Kidman, following up her bravura performance as Satine in Moulin Rouge with a woman teetering between insanity and iron control.  Grace has so many layers, and Kidman reveals almost all of them through her face.  The film is anchored by her presence, and she plays off the other actors extremely well -- note the tense relationship she has with Anne, her daughter.  When the two lock eyes, it's like watching two trains crash head-first into one another.The only disappointment in this movie is the ending, which is slightly anti-climactic.  When you get to it, you'll be satisfied, and it ties up everything that's happened in the movie up to that point quite well.  But it seemed almost anti-climactic, and I was left feeling a little bit let down.Overall, I gave The Others a 9\/10.

In the first film, the revelation of the killers was a great twist. Here the murderers are two side characters that you never gave a damn about in the first place. The F13 reference was nice, but could've been far better done. Also, the movie is bogged down by rather pointless scenes, a somewhat slow pace, and a disappointing final confrontation. On the plus side, I liked how the characters progressed from the first film and it's nice that they didn't rethread the first movie's plot. I also really dig it when a main character is unexpectantly killed halfway through the movie.ACTING Neve Campell is good as usual, though I liked her better in the first film. Courtney Cox gets to expand her character beyond just being a bitch. I actually liked David Arrquette in this movie. So sue me. Jerry O'Conell bored the hell out of me. Timmy Olyphant was good, but more of him would've been nice. Jada Pinkett is annoying. Scary Movie was able to capitalize on that when it parodied this movie's openner.

I was terrified for a long time after that . It wasnt until years later when it was released on home video that I could see just how much I had missed that night. Robert Shaw was absolutely riveting and to me extremely sexy. What a shame his character had to die at the end even though it was his idea to change the ending ,in Benchleys book Quint drowns.Evidently Shaw didnt like that and Benchley wasnt thrilled with Shaws ending and was thrown off the set. You do get to see Becnhley in a cameo as a news reporter on the beach in once scene. Roy Scheider is a great actor as is Richard Dreyfuss.This movie put Dreyfuss on the map and he won an oscar for the Goodbye Girl a few years later. Also a shame he has not been given any good movies to do lately.I hear hes going to tv now .Roy Scheider hasn't aged too well ,about 70 i think now and doesnt do much acting work . Most of the main characters are either dead or out of the business. Robert Shaw sadly died a few years later after doing the Sting another great movie and a few lame ones after that . A shame because he was such a talent and you know rumor has it that Sterling Holloway was supposed to be Quint but had problems with the IRS .Shaw didnt wanna do the movie ,thought is was silly , supposedly his wife had a hand at the time to urge him on . Boy was he happy when it was a hit .I am somewhat surprised that he wasnt even nominated for an oscar that year or for any other award. The indianapolis speech alone should have one him that .I figure its because it was a horror movie and most actors guild members didnt support it .It was nominated for best picture but obviously didnt win. On a somber note are the sequels . Jaws 2 was ok at best but without a Quint character or a Hooper and only Brody's character returning it sinks. I wont even mention 3 or 4 except to say please dont make any more sequels to this movie . Its 26 yrs old now and enough is enough,each sequel ruined it. But i hear rumor has it they actually have a script to do another sequel which actually might be a prequel involving Quints days in the military. That could be interesting if done right and with a good director ,top notch acting and directing.This movie is and always will be a classic .The only horror movie to me which worked better when the monster couldnt be seen . To the person who made the comment why didnt they show more of the shark at the beginning ,i think it made it more scary to not now what it looked like .Sure we all knew it was a shark but how big or how scary we didnt know \/ FAct is that made movie better and in real life the modem shark that was used kept breaking down and they got it too work so rarely so they had to work around it. This to me was a great suspense and audiences loved it ..  I dont care how old or tired the special effects get . There will never be another movie like it .

Darren Aronofsky first came to attention with the Sundance hit Pi (1998), but with Requiem for a Dream he pulls out all the stops.

I don't want to say too much about the plot, because I think there has already been so much written about it, I would like to say that I admired the use of each season the film used represented the feelings of the characters e.g. Summer &#150; Warm optimism, Fall &#150; The beginning of the fall of the characters, and Winter &#150; Cold and detached. Another reason I haven't mentioned the plot is because too many people are hailing this picture as a drug film.

Way too many people dismiss Requiem for a Dream as depressing or disgusting (Hey life is not pleasant people), and those who call Aronofsky a glorified MTV director basically are to shallow to take the time that is needed to fully take in the impact of this remarkable film.9\/10 maybe 10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 August 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILER WARNINGWhen I first saw Requiem for a Dream on the cinema, I gave it a 9 rating, having since bought it on DVD I am not sure weather I should change it to a 10.

I now feel like I've seen a complete movie and for the first time it made sense to me.  I actually got the gist of what Kurtz was about and why they wanted him terminated.

I've read that Coppola and Murch didn't just drop in the additional footage, that they re-edited the entire film and I can believe it.

Far from making the film messier, the additional footage made the film tighter for me, as I could really appreciate the orchestration of themes not to mention the sheer orchestration of materials to carry out the big set pieces (like Kilgore's raid).  Also, seeing it on a big screen definitely helped.  Especially in those parts where the added detail let you see pertinent details.  For instance when Willard is reading Kurtz's dossier you can actually comprehend glimpses of the text and it's all very important (there's a reference in Kurtz's CV to his writing a thesis on the Philippines Insurrection -- a precursor to Vietnam).

But I think the consensus now is that AN has stood up better than Platoon, because of it's more overarching approach.

If the film was a re-working or, as in Planet of the Apes, a re-imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it's own right, only referencing the original. Imagine it this way, if someone took the model in the 'Mona Lisa', posed her in a different way, and painted her you could only compare the framing,concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally.That said this film doesn't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly, like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made, the shower scene will never be forgotten, the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work.The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent, Norman didn't really understand sex, he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he doesn't really understand sex and his attraction to her,this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti-hero, you are on his side because he doesn't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his 'Mother'. In the remake that whole dynamic is gone, I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that, Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding 'her' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like, who you feel absolutely no sympathy for, they further destroy Norman's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room. It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for, it's like re-making 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character a pimp, totally degrading.The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's workmate. In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line 'he must have noticed my wedding ring' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself, when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really isn't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her.I'll admit that I am very biased, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite film of all time, had the film been a reworking, with a different angle, then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable.Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de-sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour. (n.b before people think 'he can't spell' remember I'm from England and we spell it colour)A remake should be just that, re made, this is a forgery, a complete copy and a very bad one at that.

Now I have to say, it still uses the same formula as American Pie (otherwise it wouldn't be called American Pie) but it manages to do something more sequels should do.It extends the characters.  That is, it takes the first movie and goes forward, showing how the kids lives continue.  I'll admit it doesn't change their character drastically, and they're still the same people in similar situations even after the movie ends.  But it remains a true continuation nonetheless.Too many sequels try to be more extreme and than the original and put all their eggs (or jokes) in one basket.  Examples of this are Wayne's World 2, Ace Ventura 2, and Austin Powers 2.  All of these tried to outdo the original so much, to the point of nearly raping the original's character, and leave little room for continuation once everything has been done already.AP2 does try to go further with its moments, but it still leaves the original intact, and in fact complements the original.  The above mentioned movies don't.  The only real negatives are that many scenes are spent trying to be cool or teeny, and seem to take up time simply for the sake of showing young people dance around and act cool.  There are times when the main characters hover just over the underdog status they maintained in the first movie, but in a way this could be seen as a good change.  Still, the characters remain true to themselves, which leaves it with the fact that this is still American Pie.  If you didn't like the first, you probably won't like this one.  Many scenes refer to or parallel the original movie, which may tire some viewers, but the basic point of the movie is to show the same characters as they were before, only continuing their lives.  This is what a sequel should be- no replacing cast members or dropping others with no explanation.  We get to see what happens to all the important players in the first movie. It also feels complete as a second movie.  Questions unanswered after the first American Pie are answered and expanded on here, and there's still enough to continue on to another movie.  It didn't have any real lose ends or unresolved conflicts that made it beg for a sequel, but a sequel would still work without harming this film (assuming it was done right).So as a study on how to do a sequel correctly, AP2 would be a good choice.  Its only downfall is that its still similar to the first movie, and doesn't try anything drastically different.  But like I said, it wouldn't be American Pie if its was a completely different movie.

The above mentioned movies don't.  The only real negatives are that many scenes are spent trying to be cool or teeny, and seem to take up time simply for the sake of showing young people dance around and act cool.  There are times when the main characters hover just over the underdog status they maintained in the first movie, but in a way this could be seen as a good change.  Still, the characters remain true to themselves, which leaves it with the fact that this is still American Pie.  If you didn't like the first, you probably won't like this one.  Many scenes refer to or parallel the original movie, which may tire some viewers, but the basic point of the movie is to show the same characters as they were before, only continuing their lives.  This is what a sequel should be- no replacing cast members or dropping others with no explanation.  We get to see what happens to all the important players in the first movie. It also feels complete as a second movie.  Questions unanswered after the first American Pie are answered and expanded on here, and there's still enough to continue on to another movie.  It didn't have any real lose ends or unresolved conflicts that made it beg for a sequel, but a sequel would still work without harming this film (assuming it was done right).So as a study on how to do a sequel correctly, AP2 would be a good choice.

Now I have to say, it still uses the same formula as American Pie (otherwise it wouldn't be called American Pie) but it manages to do something more sequels should do.It extends the characters.  That is, it takes the first movie and goes forward, showing how the kids lives continue.  I'll admit it doesn't change their character drastically, and they're still the same people in similar situations even after the movie ends.

You have to have all the leftover humor but not forgetting a good screenplay.  Saving Silverman, starring Jason Biggs and Amanda Peet, was a physical comedy about first impression, and the people who aren't good at them.Wayne (Steve Zahn) tells the story about Darren Silverman (Biggs), a guy who has always been very gullable with the ladies.  When Judith (Amanda Peet) comes along, Darren falls for her and ends up moving in with her.  Now, Wayne and J.D. (Jack Black) have always been Darren's best friends, and they have always tried to follow Neil Diamond's footsteps.  When it comes the time for Judith to meet the boys, the day is ruined because they spill almost every liquid on her.  After a while, Judith asks Darren to marry her, so the marriage is on.  But Wayne and J.D. kidnap Judith and fake her death.  So what will happen?  Watch it to find out.The whole idea, like every great comedy, is awesome.  The film itself is awesome.  Not only is Judith's response to the kidnap funny, but so is Darren's.  Jason Biggs is not as funny as his other movies, but that's probably because his character is not meant to be such a goof-off.  Jack Black and Steve Zahn, on the other hand, lead the movie with much elegance, delivering laugh after laugh from the deeps of your belly.  Amanda Peet, rumored to be a fearless actress (even though I think Sandra Bullock could have done a better job), is more than perfect as a strict and nasty Judith.Physical humor plays a major part here.  That's probably the kind of humor that makes the most of the people laugh, unlike crude and sexual humor like in Scary Movie.  Yes, before you ask, there are some crude and sexual jokes, but physical humor is the major kind of humor.  These very funny physical gags are made more by the two leading men Zahn and Black.  They are perfect as the two leading men also.  Need people tripping, being attacked by nasty racoons or shooting themselves in the leg by tranquilizer guns, see Saving Silverman.This comedy, like Sugar & Spice, was very underrated by major critics.  This is also a diamond, like other achievement comedies  Meet the Parents, Miss Congeniality, Sugar & Spice, Dumb and Dumber...I can't think of any more, but the point is that Saving Silverman belongs in this list of diamond comedies.  Like I said before, comedies are hard to make.Some people laugh at drug jokes, even though they are clearly unfunny (but delivered greatly in my all-time favorite movie Go), and others laugh at sexual jokes.  Err....scratch that.  No one laughs at sexual jokes, every since seeing Scary Movie.  But I prefer laughing at physical jokes like in Saving Silverman, the first real great comedy of the year 2001.Without further adieu, I say that Saving Silverman was a major cool, awesome physical-flick, deserving every inch of critic respect it probably got (or didn't).

I would definitely rank this as one of the best film ever made, it certainly takes multiple viewing for the full power of the film to be revealed, to break deep into the meanings and issues the film explores, way too much to even begin to touch upon here.
