Cool looking cityscapes especially for 1927. The Machine Man (Woman). Watching the workers go to work and run the machines under the Metropolis. Seeing the machines being destroyed. I thought the best actor was the city's main designer, Frederson I think. His acting for the most part was reserved and dignified. Ummmm...thats about it. Like i said not for everyone. The Negatives  Bigtime overacting (I understand it was a silent film and that was the style back then but still...less is more sometimes). I guess I was expecting more. Not more special effects but a better story or something. It was all stuff we've seen again and again. Nothing really surprised me. Some of the scenes, where Im assuming we are supposed to be seeing over the top behavior by society, just seemed a little corny to me. Again, I understand that was the style for the time, just not for me.Final Thoughts Im sure most people (mostly hard core film buffs) will not agree with this review. But for the average movie-goer, in today's world and time(2011), I would say you will be disappointed. Maybe watch it just so you can say you did but in the end nothing will wow you. Maybe I've been desensitized and seen or read about 100's of floods, explosions and futuristic type governments and societies. Chances of watching it again are 0%. I give it a below average score of 4 out of 10.
