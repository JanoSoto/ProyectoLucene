[{"date":"8 March 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rushmore is a rare type of film. It's life affirming, but it's almost complete lack of sentiment ensures that it always gives the impression that it doesn't know it's life affirming, and is also the film's biggest asset. There's nothing worse than a drama that's saturated in sentiment, and I'm pleased to report that Rushmore isn't. The film is a coming of age story and a tale of friendship and romance, but beneath that is the real substance, and Rushmore is ultimately a film about life and, more to the point, contentment. The film follows a fifteen-year-old pupil at Rushmore private school, Max Fisher. Not content with just doing what the school has to offer, Max takes part in any number of extra curricular activities; at the expense of his studies, which has landed him on academic probation within the school that he loves. His world is turned on it's head one day when he meets the beautiful teacher with 'something you cant quite put your finger on', Mrs Cross.Rushmore is one of those films that allows you to forget whatever is bothering you at the time of viewing and just completely lose yourself in it. Wes Anderson injects his usual swinging style, but for a change - it actually works! The film gives off a sense of fun in every frame, and this is one of those films where you can smile at any time and have something to smile about. The film is really funny also, and so it succeeds in being both deep and hilarious; something that not too many films before it had done. The cast excel on every level, but the standout is Jason Schwartzman as the central character. We see him here on his debut, and it has to be said that his portrayal of Max Fisher is absolutely faultless. Olivia Williams really beautiful, and the way she is portrayed on screen aptly portrays what Wes Anderson is obviously trying to achieve with her character. Bill Murray does well also, and delivers what is one of his all time best performances. Wes Anderson's direction is another star of the show, and the way that he weaves the various emotions into every scene is simply sublime, and some of the sequences in the movie have a real substance underneath the surface, and we can feel what the characters in the story are feeling. Rushmore epitomises every reason why I watch movies; and I can do nothing but treat it with the utmost admiration and respect. One of the best movies ever made.
