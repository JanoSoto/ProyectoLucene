This movie stars Elisabeth Shue, we all remember her from The Karate Kid and Back to the Future IIand III. Elisabeth has a starring role in this film because in the Back to the Future films, her character was always unconscious.She was a really good looking teenager back in these days. Now, she's all grown-up. There's also Keth Coogan, grandson of Jackie Coogan fromThe Addams Family. Anthony Rapp, who looks like the guy from Pete & Pete. Maia Brewton, she was in the first Back to the Future.          When Chris Parker (Shue) is dropped by her boyfriend, she agrees to babysit for the Andersons. There's Brad (Coogan) and Sara(Brewton). The evening looks boring, until Chris' friend, Brenda, calls from the bus station and says she ran away from home and is terrorized by weirdos at the station so Chris is asked to go into downtown Chicago and rescue her. Only problem What to do with the kids?        So they jump in the Parker family's station wagon when Brad's friend, Daryl (Rapp) pops up. So they take him too. Daryl brought along a Playboy magazine and one of the centerfold girls looks like Chris! Brad tosses the magazine out the window.          En route to town, the tire blows out and there's no spare. Also, Chris forgot her purse. Soon a tow truck stops and who comes to the aide of the kids but Handsome John Pruitt! He's got a friendly face and a hook on his right hand.

So Chris, Brad, Sara, and Daryl hide in some guy's car, which was being comendeered by a car theif! His name is Joe Gipp. Joe takes them to a warehouse where something big and unlawful is going on. The kids escape, by walking across the rafters over ameeting but before so, Daryl snatched a Play Boy from the office desk. The crooks soon find out and they chase the kids. They run into a blue's club and, well according to Albert Collins, Nobody leaves withoutsinging the blues, so Chris takes the microphone and sings the ultimate song Babysittin' Blues; Chris laughs when Brad says he's attracted to her. They race onto a subway, and a chain of events leads to Brad getting a switchblade in the foot. Daryl said they must take care of it immediately or he'd get Lockjaw, rabies, scabies,emphysema.

And when she uses the phone booth, someone complains that she's in their house.        The kids followed Daryl into a college frat party where Chris meets a handsome new beau; Then they go to Dawson's Garage. Sara claims that Dawson looks like The Mighty Thor! They get the station wagon back and en route to home, Chris finds her boyfriend's car at the restaurant they WERE going to eat at that night, only her boyfriend claimed his sister was sick and he had to stay home and help out. So while Chris, Brad and Daryl go in the restaurant, Sara runs to look in a toy store, but get's chased by the crooks (the rightful owners of the Play Boy Daryl had stolen and put in Sara's backpack).

While the cast may be youthful, the characters and story set this film way above teen slasher or horror flicks.  Mainly, because this is really a mystery in the vein of Ten Little Indians. It's a good thing I saw this film in a theatre when it was first released in 1986 -- because the VHS cover has something on it that would have kept me AWAY if I had not seen the film already It's just what you'd expect from the producer who brought you Friday the 13th -- Parts Two, Three, Four, and Five.  You just can't put April Fool's Day in the same category as those films! This is far superior in story and intelligence.  It's clever, well-written, and has great characters that you like even if they are not so nice!  These days it seems it's more important to find the most popular actors, and that is usually distracting and doesn't guarantee a good  film. April Fool's Day had lesser known stars for that time (Deborah Foreman, Amy Steel, Clayton Rohner, Griffin O'Neal) and that worked as an advantage. The basic premise of a group of college students stuck on an island in a big house and one by one they disappear, yes, it's been done in many variations before.  But the clever execution of the story, red herrings, and the underrated Deborah Foreman's delightful portrayal of Muffy\/Buffy all make for a really fun viewing experience. Foreman has just the right amount of sweetness and can go right into being just plain quirky with such ease. The touch of having dolls on the dinner table, sort of like name tags, will bring a giggle and a smile for sure! One plus for this film is the fact that it didn't sink into the tiring T & A route.  Sure, a few of the characters have sex on the brain but their actions and dialogue never really wander off into the gratuitous area. Guys, if you really want lots of breasts than just go ahead and get some porn or a Playboy video, okay?  Let the rest of us enjoy a good story once in a while! After the body count rises and things escalate into a tense and frenzied chase through the house, you'll be surprised at what happens next.  April Fool's Day is one of the few films of this kind that actually had a very surprising reveal and I was even caught off guard, left with my jaw agape at what the whole deal was about. The BIG surprise just happens so...abruptly, that you feel just like the character that runs into the room -- just stuck for a second! After about 90 minutes of mystery, the payoff BETTER be good, and sure enough,  this one doesn't disappoint! I'm especially thrilled to have picked up the eerie soundtrack by Charles Bernstein on vinyl when it first came out, and to this day love to give it a spin on the turntable. Paramount has a vast library of films that just NEED to be given great treatment on DVD, and I'm crossing my fingers that films like April Fool's Day, Let's Scare Jessica To Death, and Polanski's film The Tenant will be given their glory.  >  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 November 2001","score":"31 out of 36 people found the following review useful","review":"  April Fool's Day has just the right smarts about it that it holds up extremely well, even all these years later.

His method is simple and consistent explore the ambiguity between a reality and a presentation of that reality, and to do so through the fine, immediate granularity of dialog rather than character or plot.His past films have been various takes on this same issue, only the outer form changing, from a multilevel 42nd Vanya to an extended cover for a lie (Winslow) to a film about making a film (State). Here the device is an old one the scam. In the convention, the smart guy (and we know immediately who he is) has everything figured out. Such stories are a sort of reverse mystery -- the hero has already understood events and the viewer experiences the extended revelation.In this convention, the genius of the hero in anticipating events is sacrosanct. And because we are seeing the mystery in expositional form, the camera must remain stationary and remote as if it were a theater patron. And that's where Mamet turns everything on its head. Anyone who thinks this movie is anything at all like `the Score' or `Entrapment' should have their license to watch films revoked.The first reverse is mechanical. Until now, Mamet's work has been strikingly conventional so far as the stance of the camera. All his prior stuff has placed the viewer squarely in his or her theater seat. But here, where the form demands just that approach, he decides to make his camera dance. He grabs P T Anderson's camera guy and makes the camera a character. It's not fully masterful, but it is very clever sometimes we are `gathered' with one group of conspirators, sometimes with another. Mamet's intent throughout is to not only shift the truth, but shift the perspective of the truth as well.The second way he messes with the form is that the plan falls apart at every turn. The hero hasn't scoped out everything, he's just agile enough to have lots of backups. But this guy hardly wins, which is what the form usually demands. He gets shot. His friend gets killed. He loses his lovely young sexy wife, even his boat. This is unlike the `Spanish Prisoner' which was a sterile scam that unfurled according to plan.. This one is fraught with chance, error and human unpredictability.

This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy Return of the Jedi.  Often derided for its overly 'cute' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect The Empire Strikes Back.  Indeed the 'cute' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series.  Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities?  Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga.  Following on from the conclusion of The Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts.Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben 'Obi Wan' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire.

Lucas' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone.The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga.  Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda's distinct lack of screentime.

The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader.

Hopefully as more people see the woeful 'Zoolander', 'The Cable Guy's reputation will soar. Because comparing the two movies makes it bloody OBVIOUS which one is the real turkey!Look, Stiller is a funny guy, but any comedian is only as good as his material, and 'Zoolander's lame jokes just aren't enough to sustain a whole movie. The initial premise (a brainless super-model is turned into a political assassin) is silly, but that wouldn't matter a jot if it was fleshed out with strong comic situations and witty one-liners. Sadly it just isn't. All we get are running gags about Derek's range of expressions, and his sheer stupidity which are repeated ad nauseam until the humour is lost and it simply becomes irritating.Owen Wilson almost steals the movie as rival model Hansel. Wilson has been an actor to watch ever since Wes Anderson's debut 'Bottle Rocket'. He has appeared in several movies where he out-classes the material. Once again it happens here. The rest of the supporting cast range from passable to poor. The latter especially regarding Will Ferrell, as arch-villain Mugatu, who is excruciatingly unfunny. He manages to drag down every scene he appears in. Milla Jovovich tries hard with a boring femme fatale role. Christine Taylor is lovely to look at, but is saddled with an under-written character, like most of the actors in this movie. Jerry Stiller who is usually fabulous in anything he does, has one or two funny bits of schtick, but once again you have to blame the mediocre script. And much has been made of the countless guest appearances, but very few are noteworthy. Billy Zane's cameo is one of the few that are worthwhile, and one of the rare genuinely inspired moments in this sorry mess. The most frustrating thing is that going by 'The Cable Guy', or Stiller's first rate comic appearances in movies like 'There's Something About Mary, 'Flirting With Disaster' or 'Mystery Men', or even watching old episodes of 'The Mr Show', (who's David Cross and Bob Odenkirk started as writers for Stiller), you realize that 'Zoolander' could have easily rivaled Mike Myers' Austin Powers for belly laughs.

A more imperfect example of linear storytelling probably cannot be found, yet it remains compelling and fascinating. By the film's end, however, the resolution to the fantastically surreal visions we have witnessed seems contrived and something of a cop-out.Beginning with what seems to be a scene from a completely different film (wholesome teenagers doing the jitterbug), Mulholland Drive establishes its clarity-be-damned style from the get-go. We are then introduced to a sultry brunette riding in the back seat of a stretch limousine. The ride abruptly ends when the gun-toting chauffeur seems about to perform a hit...but those plans are foiled by a head-on collision with joy-riding teens.Escaping with a nasty gash on her head, the brunette staggers her way to Sunset Blvd., hooks up with perky blonde Betty (an aspiring actress) and attempts to unravel the mystery of her amnesia. Taking the name Rita from a movie poster of Rita Hayworth as Gilda, the mystery brunette gives us a not-so-subtle clue that she just might be a femme fatale. Along the way, we are treated to a dizzying array of images and seemingly disconnected scenes--all of which make sense once you see the denouement.POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO FOLLOW!Although the ending tied up most of the loose ends, that's precisely why it strikes such a false note for 90% of the film, Lynch creates a world of beautiful, baffling images...to have them tidily explained away is akin to being told there is no Santa Claus. Leaving us dangling would have been deliciously frustrating; instead, the ending left me incredibly dissatisfied.That aside, the first 2 hours of the film are worth the ticket price.

Justin Theroux is dry, funny and thoroughly engaging as a likably self-absorped film director whose sudden plunge into a nightmarish dreamscape of strange mobsters, double-crossing wives and philosophical cowboys may or may not be connected to the Betty\/Rita plotline.There are also wonderfully weird cameos by the likes of Ann Miller, Lee Grant, Chad Everett and Billy Ray Cyrus, adding to the carnival-like atmosphere.

We see how fitting Angelina Jolie is to play Lara Croft. We learn that she trained 6 days a week, for 3 months, to get in shape and learn to credibly perform the skills required during the filming. She did almost all her own stunts, much like Tom Cruise did for MI2. They actually went to Cambodia for part of the filming. And, to approximate Siberia, they went to Iceland and filmed on a glacier the size of Wales. We also see how the various action sequences and special effects are done.

This DVD is one example where the extras are actually more interesting, overall, than the film itself.

Lantana does both to a far greater degree than anything I have seen this year, or for quite a few years I think.Lantana's greatest power resonates within its performances, usually in a relatively good film you will see that a headline actor will maybe do a really good job in a film, taking the character, taking the words written on the page of a script and making them his own. In Lantana, every single actor goes above and beyond that which usually constitutes a 'good' job, taking their words and crafting a performance from them to a degree such that they aren't on the screen creating a character, they are up there creating a person. Each individual performance by each individual actor, coupled with exceptional writing adn direction, extends this film into greatness.Anthony LaPaglia (Leon Zat) plays as the centrepiece character of this film, and it is a magnificent performance, but his power as this character only exists because of the way that it is countered by each of the others he shares the screen with. I particularly liked a character played by Glenn Robins (Pete O'May) who operates as a walking intertextual reference, his character isn't in the least bit funny, he is in fact rather tragic, but Robins' previous work exclusively in comedy carries that humor into Pete's character. I believe that most actors would see that as a flaw in the performance but in this case Robins' amusing innocence aids the character immensely, as it does the film, because Lantana is so otherwise devoid of humor, the slight undertone of comedy Robins brings to his scenes acts as an attractive balance to the fairly heavy dramatic tone of the rest of the film.I was also intrigued by Geoffrey Rush as John Knox an academic mourning the loss of his murdered daughter as well as the dissappearance of his wife, in actuality Rush is most usually intriguing. Upon saying that I have to reflect that every character in this film is intriguing, that is its strength. They are so intriguing because these people aren't particularly good, but they aren't particularly bad either, they are people. These characters allow us to become so enveloped in their world because they honestly don't seem like characters, they seem like people, like you and I. In 121 minutes they and director Ray Lawrence build a world, not limited by a story, not limited by character events, which is remarkably similar to our own.There are needy characters, there are dissatisfied characters. There is an interesting quirk in the narrative that both Zat's wife (Kerry Armstrong) and the woman he is sleeping with (Rachael Blake) are so similar, so starved of passion in their lives that they all wind up in the same Latin dance class. All these character, with the equally attractive, distractive and repugnant sides of their personalities, extract a response from us, the audience, because they are so like those characters we know in our lives. In truth I don't really 'like' some of my greatest friends, I don't feel bad about that, that is just the way that it is, but I still stick around because these people are interesting and they are a part of my life. The people, the characters of Lantana, for a short while at least will become a part of your life too. It is a testament to the power of the performances of this film that when the screen went black I wanted to stick with them too, they aren't all great people, in fact none of them are, but I still like them, and I still want to know them because in reality I guess they're a lot like me. It's not a bad thing, and it's not even a sad thing, it's just the way that it is.I can't help but describe Lantana as anything less than great, or spectacular would be more accurate maybe, though it is a spectacle of psychological drama. It made me think about my life, I suspect it will make you think about yours, and for the entire stretch I was engaged completely in what was going on. As an Australian film student Lantana makes me very, very excited; excited with the anticipation that one day I may be able to work in a film industry that could produce something of this quality, something this grand. I can't help but think that the greatest thing that a film can ever hope to do is make it's audience feel something, anything. Lantana will.

Lantana does both to a far greater degree than anything I have seen this year, or for quite a few years I think.Lantana's greatest power resonates within its performances, usually in a relatively good film you will see that a headline actor will maybe do a really good job in a film, taking the character, taking the words written on the page of a script and making them his own. In Lantana, every single actor goes above and beyond that which usually constitutes a 'good' job, taking their words and crafting a performance from them to a degree such that they aren't on the screen creating a character, they are up there creating a person. Each individual performance by each individual actor, coupled with exceptional writing adn direction, extends this film into greatness.Anthony LaPaglia (Leon Zat) plays as the centrepiece character of this film, and it is a magnificent performance, but his power as this character only exists because of the way that it is countered by each of the others he shares the screen with. I particularly liked a character played by Glenn Robins (Pete O'May) who operates as a walking intertextual reference, his character isn't in the least bit funny, he is in fact rather tragic, but Robins' previous work exclusively in comedy carries that humor into Pete's character. I believe that most actors would see that as a flaw in the performance but in this case Robins' amusing innocence aids the character immensely, as it does the film, because Lantana is so otherwise devoid of humor, the slight undertone of comedy Robins brings to his scenes acts as an attractive balance to the fairly heavy dramatic tone of the rest of the film.I was also intrigued by Geoffrey Rush as John Knox an academic mourning the loss of his murdered daughter as well as the dissappearance of his wife, in actuality Rush is most usually intriguing. Upon saying that I have to reflect that every character in this film is intriguing, that is its strength. They are so intriguing because these people aren't particularly good, but they aren't particularly bad either, they are people. These characters allow us to become so enveloped in their world because they honestly don't seem like characters, they seem like people, like you and I.

Anyway,  I'm sure that most everyone bothering to read this knows the basic plot of this brilliant action movie (a rare breed) but I'm gonna do a quick rundown without spoiling anything.  Rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is starting his first day on the job with leather-clad, veteran, city-reknowned all around badass Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).  Things start off uneasy and the director does one hell of a job at making you feel the rookie's nervousness.  In fact, you're sitting there wondering why in the hell this baby-faced nice guy wants to be a narc so bad.  It's really simple;  he wants to protect and serve and be one of the good guys.  That's all.  Needless to say, throughout the course of the day, Mr. Hoyt may very well decide that being a narc just isn't his cup of tea.  But things aren't going to be that simple.You see, Hoyt is about to get way more than he bargained for.  Alonzo Harris is one badass, crooked, filthy and downright mean guy, but yet he has an irresistable charm that makes you want to like him. Through him, we learn along with Hoyt, that everything he previously learned about being a cop is wrong and to catch the wolf, you must become the wolf.  This is one of those parts that I SWEAR had to have been written with just one actor in mind.  I say this because I can't think of anyone else who could've pulled the part off, except maybe for Samuel L. Jackson.  This is, in my mind, the best and most challenging role that Ethan Hawke has ever played.  He does a damn fine job at showing all the right emotions and the transformation from vulnerable do-gooder, to hardened-vet over the course of 24 hours (!) is made wholly believable.  Denzel Washington plays TOTALLY against type and gives one hell of a knockout performance as the ruthless badass who may have once been a good cop.  (I know I keep using that word a lot to describe him, just see the movie.)  I really loved the wolf-metaphor that he kept using it was perfect.  I give Training Day A perfect 10 here and I will be getting the DVD.  Let's see Mr. Washington in more roles like this.  One more thing. I was really glad to see Scott Glenn.  He's highly underrated.

(I know I keep using that word a lot to describe him, just see the movie.)  I really loved the wolf-metaphor that he kept using it was perfect.  I give Training Day A perfect 10 here and I will be getting the DVD.  Let's see Mr. Washington in more roles like this.  One more thing. I was really glad to see Scott Glenn.  He's highly underrated.

Before viewing this motion picture, I had really no idea what this movie would deliver.  I read some reviews and most of them didn't explain any of the plot at all...  If you are into Classic Ghost Stories (the original The Haunting, Lady in White), this movie is right down your alley.  This movie is great, and if it comes to St. Louis during its regular run, I will pay 7.50 again.  This movie really centers around a young boy, whose father is killed on the front of the Spanish Civil War.  He is brought to an orphanage and starts a fight with a boy named Jamie.  I really don't want to give that much away however.  This movie has Laughs, Scares, and character development.  This film is awesome!  I wish America could dish out horror movies like this.  Then again I wouldn't call it horror.  It has really gory parts for the gorefreaks.  This is a wonderful movie, even my girlfriend (who isn't a fan of subtitles) liked this movie. This movie will be in DVD collection when it comes out.  If this motion picture stops by your local Film Festival, see it!

Little Natalie Wood thinks he is, though, and that's all that matters. This movie, written by Valentine Davies, has become, along with It's a Wonderful Life, a Christmas classic, and deservedly so. It is not, I imagine, in the same league as the Capra film (what is?), but it's an awfully good little movie in its own right; and while it presents its characters and issues pleasingly it does not push the envelope too much in any one direction, as one can respond to its whimsical little story any way one pleases.Like so many films of the immediate postwar period it stresses the faith and wisdom of small children (as,--literally--opposed to adults); and its message is that children are perhaps wiser than we think. Considering the mess that grownups had made of the world in the previous two decades it must have been difficult for movie audiences of the time to disagree. Indeed, much of the mood of the postwar era was based at least partly on this premise, as children became central to our culture as never before. Their whims and wishes became paramount. Perhaps, in the end, too much so. One can see the start of all this in Miracle On 34th Street, whose gentle message still rings true today, every year, in the waning days of December.

I was amazed at Samir's knowledge of the human brain and it's tendencies, especialy among mental patients.  Samir must have gone to Med school after getting fired from Innotech.  This just makes me wonder more what Michael Bolton is up to these days.  Did he go to med school with Samir?  perhaps law school?  We all know that Peter from Office Space decided to travel back in time and fight in WW2, a poor choice compared to Samir, especially considering that Peter is fighting along the lines of super P-bomb Ross from Friends.  Anyway, another thing about the shotty mental hospital was that The Big Lebowski played the psychiatrist.  Where was goodman?  So you have Samir, a former computer nerd and Dude from Lebowski handeling the sick minds of the mentally ill in NYC? Crazy, just crazy.  What's next, LaVorgna from 7th heaven as chief cardiologist.  Spacey was good, although it was way too obvious that he was indeed an alien.  They should have left some guesswork at the end.  It was like they tried to do that but just failed.  Perhaps they left some people guessing, but if you have even an ounce of common sense or Hollywood knowledge you know Spacey was from K-PAX.  I heard that they initially planned on using Richard Simmons and calling the movie GAY-PAX, but decided against it because it tested as too gay with preliminary survey groups. I'd see K-PAX just because of Samir.  The man really got his life in order after leaving Innotech and you gotta hand it to the guy.  My only beef with the movie was that there was no flashy breakdance scene like Samir pulled in Office Space.
