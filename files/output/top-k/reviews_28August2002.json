Knight Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense, and his latest film, Signs, have both done very well at the box office, not to mention gaining some critical acclaim.  He brings a wonderful sense of mood to the screen, portrays human emotion effectively, uses dialog well, and his slow, determined pacing takes the audience through wonderful psychological distresses. He also presents interesting and compelling supernatural ideas for a premise to get us to wonder and imagine other-worldly situations. Mixed in with that, his surprise endings successfully leave the audience feeling duped, but happy.  We were into looking one way, while the magician skillfully removes our wristwatch without our noticing. What a clever skill, right?Well, the problem is that his technique for getting us to look the other direction is, frankly, done on the cheap. To illustrate the point, understand that supernatural\/sci-fi films require at least two storytelling elements suspension of disbelief and staying within the circle of plausible possibilities. That is, suspension of disbelief is where an impossible premise is used as the framework for a story. For example, we can believe in aliens, or that a child can see dead people, because we can imagine a fantasy world where that may take place in our mind's eye. Because we know it's not a true story, which we would disbelieve, we instead suspend that disbelief in order to keep the fantasy going. And, as long as everything that happens  that story makes sense, we're willing to continue playing the game. This is the circle of plausible possibilities. If the boy who can see dead people suddenly becomes an award-winning chef and gets a TV cooking show, we don't like it because it distracts from where the story was going. If the story and the characters don't remain consistent with the premise, we are left unfulfilled.Let's address how these take place in two of Shyamalan's films, The Sixth Sense, and Signs.In Signs, Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, an ex-priest who lost his faith after his wife died in a freak auto accident. When crop circles suddenly appear around the world, followed by a hostile invasion of aliens, he begins to wonder about his own faith in God and the meaning of life. Challenged to face his own demise (and that of his family), he desperately searches for true signs, purposes to life, anything to help him come to terms with his situation, and the ultimate meaning of life. Yet, during the struggle for survival, he pieces together what had appeared to be unrelated statements or events from his past, enabling him to save his family and regain his faith in God.Here, the suspension of disbelief is aliens attack from outer space. The circle of plausible possibilities include ways he deals with that, and his personal search for the meaning of life. Whether he actually saves his family, or how, is not really important. The  story, and the one the audience is really watching -- is the development of his character. How does  come to terms with his own loss of faith? How does he reconcile the struggle between logic and faith, the two classic opposites that challenge most people in their quest for belief in higher powers? These are universal themes, and we're given a story that promises to tell us something new.  What we are looking for is something that brings him around to whatever conclusion he's going to come to.  Yet, when we are given the surprise at the end, which suggests that there are no coincidences, and that everything happens for a reason, and God has a reason for everything, this premise is presented so unambiguously, so far-fetched, that it falls outside of the circle of possibilities for this story line. It's not that it  be the case, but it detracts from the story we were being told. All of Hess' objectives are gone. It's as though God himself spoke to him and said, it's like this. All you can say now is, oh, ok. What happened to the story we were being told?In The Sixth Sense, the same thing happens the suspension of disbelief involves a boy that can see dead people. The other story involves two characters with personal struggles the aforementioned boy and his relationship with his mother and others in his environment; and a child psychologist who has to deal with his own inner demons and his failing relationship with his wife and search for personal meaning.  The circle of possibilities includes all the ways that these people have to face and deal with these problems. Whatever happens to help them come to terms psychologically with their searches is fine--as long as they come to discover something about what they're looking for. However, the surprise ending shows us that none of these issues are even relevant anymore, so we can toss out all the invested emotions we put into them. Their stories no longer matter.In each movie, the endings are surprises because they addressed a simple fact of the backdrop -- how it is the boy saw the psychologist, or how god now unambiguously exists. We were surprised not because we didn't see it coming (even though we didn't), we were surprised because we didn't NEED to see those stories solved. Sure, it's fun that we did see them solved, but the movie isn't over till the character's stories are concluded too. It doesn't matter that we can't predict the ending; what's important is that all endings tie together.Compare either of these films with Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho. Here, we are lead to believe that Norman Bates and his mother live in a hotel and are killing people, and the surprise at the end shows us that it wasn't quite what we thought. Yet, the  was his psychological profile why he did what he did, and how other characters were affected by it. This is  addressed the characters' issues; we weren't left hanging.Granted, complete filmmaking is harder, since tying things together effectively requires an extra level of ingenuity that only a true master of storytelling can accomplish.  Shyamala's skill is his portrayal of the human spirit and character. He gives us three-dimension people, not just kids in a summer camp about to be murdered. These people have motivations, ambitions, goals, or losses that they need to come to terms with. He just needs to learn how to incorporate their issues with his surprise endings, so that all holes are filled.  What makes a story compelling, is the characters discovering things for themselves, through their own interpretations of events, and have the conclusion - surprise or not - come from the results of those learned lessons. Otherwise, we lose the bonding that we feel for them. Shyamalan's films are good, but not nearly worth the critical acclaim they are getting.

Ok here we goI understood this movie completely in one scene, where Jacob tells Louis that he looks like an angel, an overgrown cherub. Don't ask why, but I just did. The way I look at at the whole thing is, Jacob was accidentally killed in a fire-fight gone bad and he's feebly trying to hold on to the memories that are keeping him in limbo, so to speak. Little by little his grasp is pulled away until he is able to die with a clear conscience. It happens in screwed up ways but sometimes you need to be harsh to get through to someone, especially when that person is being stubborn.The reason that his other Vietnam buddies are there in his nightmare as well could be this since they all died at pretty much the same time, under the same circumstances, it could be that they are all in the same stage of limbo, trying to figure out what happened. I think the same can be said for the chemist who appears at various points in the film. It may be that he is there to exorcise his own personal demons before he himself moves on. It is very easy to imagine that character getting killed off in some way, the most probable cause being his involvement in something that went so horribly wrong. I doubt, as someone pointed out earlier, that the firefight never happened. It would've had to have been reality for Jacob to accept his fate.I'm not going to try to explain any more of this movie because I think it's too large to cover in so many words.

Certain scenes, especially the bathtub scene with the ice, still manage to get me every time I see them. There are scenes in this that play like the worst of nightmares.

Wow, I honestly have a lot to say about the movie but I won't be able to get it all out, I think. I'll make it simple. I saw the movie like about two years ago. I went out and bought the DVD the next day because I liked it that much. Watch this only if you are open minded. This film is pretty much different from the normal movie experience.

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"28 August 2002","score":"","review":"  ***SPOILERS AHEAD, SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION***Still with me? Ok here we goI understood this movie completely in one scene, where Jacob tells Louis that he looks like an angel, an overgrown cherub. Don't ask why, but I just did. The way I look at at the whole thing is, Jacob was accidentally killed in a fire-fight gone bad and he's feebly trying to hold on to the memories that are keeping him in limbo, so to speak. Little by little his grasp is pulled away until he is able to die with a clear conscience. It happens in screwed up ways but sometimes you need to be harsh to get through to someone, especially when that person is being stubborn.The reason that his other Vietnam buddies are there in his nightmare as well could be this since they all died at pretty much the same time, under the same circumstances, it could be that they are all in the same stage of limbo, trying to figure out what happened. I think the same can be said for the chemist who appears at various points in the film. It may be that he is there to exorcise his own personal demons before he himself moves on. It is very easy to imagine that character getting killed off in some way, the most probable cause being his involvement in something that went so horribly wrong. I doubt, as someone pointed out earlier, that the firefight never happened. It would've had to have been reality for Jacob to accept his fate.I'm not going to try to explain any more of this movie because I think it's too large to cover in so many words. If you're interested in hearing my answers to questions you may have, you can contact me at the email address above. Or even better, watch the making-of documentary on the DVD. I think it might clear up a lot of the questions you may have.As for the movie, there are parts that kind of move a little too slowly but this can honestly be one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. Certain scenes, especially the bathtub scene with the ice, still manage to get me every time I see them. There are scenes in this that play like the worst of nightmares. The performances are great, Tim Robbins especially, and Adrian Lyne manages to craft an excellent film simply by not showing us too much. It's clear upon seeing the film that he really wanted to get every single detail of not just the script but the overall idea of the story up on the screen and that may be where the movie's biggest flaw is. I agree with the conspiracy subplot really not leading to anything as someone else mentioned.

I laughed during the first 30 minutes. The gags are all cheap, juvenile and forced, but I was willing to let that slide.  When Selma Blair gets her skirt dry-cleaned (to get rid of a certain stain) and tons of people pour into the shop including her former grade school teacher, a field trip of little kiddies and even her priest, I still laughed.  This is the kind of far-fetched material that you often see in sitcoms, but it's supposed to be a goofy farce.  But then we get to the restaurant scene.  The girls ask Selma Blair how big her boyfriend's you-know-what is, and suddenly they bust into a musical number entitled, You're too big to fit in me, set to the rhythm of Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy.  That's when I rolled my eyes and screamed....WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???!!!!!  Even sitting alone in my room watching this scene, I felt humiliated.  I understand this movie was written by a female screenwriter, who was desperate to see females take a crack at the gross-out\/sex comedy sub-genre, since we're used to movies like American Pie and Animal House, which are told through a guy's point of view.  Yes, I understand women can have filthy minds too.  As a matter of fact, most of my female friends have mouths 10 times filthier than those of my guy friends.  You think what the women in this movie say is shocking?  I've heard worse! That doesn't mean I enjoy hearing that crap.  Sure, it's funny at first, but then you just tell 'em to shut up and bring up the sarcastic Yeah...and us guys have filthy minds.  Tasteless sex jokes (from men or women) can be funny, but after a while they can run dry.  The American Pie movies were funny, because the gross-out gags were delivered in an intelligent, witty fashion. There's nothing wrong with dirty jokes; you just gotta learn how to deliver them.  It's all in the delivery and timing.  The girls singing, You're Too Big To Fit in Me is not funny; it's simply a cheap attempt for women to use a thousand penis euphamisms and get the women in the audience to applaud. If women are trying to even the scale when it comes to gross-out sex comedy, then name a movie where a bunch of guys bust into a musical number about vaginas!  If I saw that, I'd be rolling my eyes too!  I'm not being a sexist.If there's anything I have to say, the cast is full of energy and seems to be having a lot of fun.  But...maybe a little too much fun.  Slapstick comedy is tricky.  If not handled right, the movie can transform into a big old mess.  If you want an example of good slapstick comedy, watch Aresenic Old Lace and watch Cary Grant's performance.  The way the movie is written, the characters are thrown into wacky situations through natural causes. And Cary Grant plays the role of Mortimer Brewster completely straight, like he's dead serious about everything he's saying and doing, and not like he's in on the joke.  In this movie, the characters are thrown into wacky situations through ridiculous causes (What the hell kind of woman would walk into a cruddy men's bathroom, go into a men's stall and look through a mysterious hole?) and actors are virtually laughing at themselves!  Just acknowlege the scene in which Diaz appears to be giving Applegate oral sex and a greasy biker passes.  Now that's funny!  Leave the joke alone!  But then Applegate realizes that the biker thinks Diaz is giving her oral sex, and starts making cheesy moans and wagging her tongue.  The joke's not funny anymore!  The movie plays out like a home video in which everybody in front of the camera is having fun and they'll have fun watching it, but anybody who's not in the film is totally out of the fun.  There's even a gag reel at the end, proving my point.  It's like watching some stranger's home videos. There's even some totally pointless scenes, including one in which Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate do a montage, marching out dressed as characters from various popular films.Looking to see a cute romantic comedy?  Do not see this film!  The comedy is there, but the romance is virtually non-existent.  Only the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes fixates on Diaz's pursuit of her handsome Prince Charming.  Diaz and her love interest have good chemistry when they're on screen.  The problem is...they share very little screen time!  And we (the audience) don't understand a damn reason why she's pursuing this guy so adamantly.  They meet each other in a club, he's hot, she's hot, she buys him a drink, they hate each other at first, they sorta like each other the next minute, they have a little small talk.  OK, road trip!  I'm going after this b**tard!The movie wears out its welcome after the first 30 minutes.  The Sweetest Thing is not unbearable to watch, and worthy of some cheap laughs, but it has no cohesive structure.  I was surprised to find out Roger Kumble directed it.  Not that he's a great director, along the lines of Stanley Kubrick, but he directed Cruel Intentions, which was well-made.  It's delightful to see Cameron Diaz in a skimpy bikini, and it's delightful to see the beautiful Selma Blair.  Unfortunately, Christina Applegate stopped being hot (and stopped being funny) after Married with Children. Matthew Perry's Dad, John Bennett Perry, has some funny moments as the foul-mouthed father of the groom.  Is it the worst movie of the year?  Far from it. But it's nothing above average, never becoming any more than a throwaway comedy. Just when you think the grossness is over, another gratuitous gag comes along.  Towards the end, we have another pointless, unfunny gag involving Selma in a sticky situation involving a certain body part being stuck to a certain body part from her boyfriend.

They have an illogical hatred of the mutants simply because of how they were born.In a way, the X-Men is indicative of the world we live in where people kill each other on a daily basis simply because the other person has a different colour skin or follows a different faith. There are people out there who do judge other people on skin colour or religious faith and form an illogical hatred of said people without thinking that each person is different, that each person has their own dreams and ambitions and hopes and fears.This is what I believe the X-Men teaches us. But all things aside, the X-Men is an action packed movie that did well and gave the studios the green light to make more superhero movies.

He was presumed dead but has in fact been alive, although not entirely well, for the last five years. Castle is a vigilante on a long lasting mission for revenge, as yet he hasn't reached his limit. Castle lives underground with barely any contact with human life, he is emotionally retarded, a tortured soul, who looks to god for help but as yet receives no answer.This is a B-movie, so high production values and top script is not exactly expected. This is however an enjoyable comic book action film. Its dark and moody and is perfect for the lead character. Dolph Lundgren is good as the Punisher, he has the right look and his voice is excellent in the role. This is a character who holds in his emotions and you would perhaps say it is an ideal character for an action star to play. But Dolph adds something extra, he really comes across as if he is a man suffering, you can see it in his eyes, he is really into his role but being a character with few emotions Dolph gets little credit, the same could be said for Arnold in the Terminator. They both get more credit for the look and actions of their characters instead of nicely played performances, in roles that need to be underplayed, you could almost call it being wooden because of a need to be wooden. The script gives Castle some depth but we never really get to delve to deep into his life before he became the Punisher, and there could have been some more scenes to show Castle on his own, to see more of his actions away from other people. Around others he is unable to act like a normal human being because of his solitude and emotional anguish.The script may have flaws and the film seems fairly cheap, but it has class in other areas. The film is very dark, and it has an almost eerie atmosphere that is key for a comic book film like this. It is nicely shot in that respect, they steer clear of to much colour, they take you into Castles dark, dank world. The action is also good, fast paced with some imaginative moments, nothing amazing because the likes of Woo and the Wachowskis have helped the Hollywood action scene evolve in style since the year this was made, but as far as 80's action goes this is quite stylish.The support cast range from average to just plain awful. The exceptions here are Oscar winner Louis Gossett Junior and Oscar nominee Jeroen Krabbe. They are both in scene stealing form. They have a great scene together at the beginning and also Gossett has a standout scene when he is with the Punisher in a police cell, that was an excellent scene. Krabbe is the show stealer by a whisker though, he is good and his character as a mob boss is more well written than your stereotypical mob boss in most action flicks. Also excellent is Kim Myori, she is delightfully nasty as the head of a Yakuza family looking to take over the business operations of the main mob families. Other than her the rest are not great and some of the henchman are just plain bad. The kid who plays Tommy is good though, he has a good scene with the Punisher right at the end. The rest of the kids in the movie are bad and some are obviously dubbed over by adults putting on child like voices.Anyway this is by no means a classic, it needed adding to some aspects of the story and character, but it had some surprisingly good scenes in which the Oscar Winner and Nominee both excelled, although they had roles they could do in their sleep. This was Dolphs first real step forward as an actor, he is good here, at times doing very well. He has improved immensely since. The film is enjoyable, its a solid comic book movie and while it can't considered a fun and joyous comic book film like Batman or Spiderman, because of its dark characters, it is still worth a watch and is one of Dolphs best. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2002","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Frank Castle is the Punisher, a former cop whose family was killed by mobsters.

They complain that summer blockbusters use noise and explosions in lieu of plot and are rarely thoughtful.  Signs is an extremely thoughtful summer blockbuster, and one that relies on mood and indirection, the way Spielberg built Jaws, or they way Hitchcock constructed his suspense movies.  The problem?  Well, the thoughtfulness of Signs takes a different direction than critics like.Father Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is having a crisis of faith after the accidental death of his wife.  He's living on a farm in Pennsylvania with his children, as if hiding from the world and the eye of God.  He's angry at God, and won't even allow prayer in his house.  A set-up shot shows a spot on the wall where a cross or crucifix once hung.  Because of his crisis he's run away from his congregation and hidden himself away from humanity, with whom he either feels or wants to feel no connection.  His brother (Joaquin Phoenix) also lives with him.Bizarre things begin happening on the Hess farm.  Crop circles.  The family dog attacks the children.  Odd persons are seen indistinctly in the darkness outside.  At first he thinks he's the victim of hoaxers and vandals. Slowly, and with some hair-raising scenes, Father Hess grows aware of the possibility of an alien invasion of earth -- and one of the signs seems to be in his own cornfield.  But are the aliens (if there are aliens) vegetarians come to be friends;  or have they come to destroy, and enslave humanity?  The movie takes the latter course, and after one of the best gradual set-ups in movie history (or at least since the death of Hitchcock) the Hess family finds themselves locked in a cellar with really mean aliens running through the house and trying to get in to do them some harm. These aren't your wussy Spielberg phone-homers.  These are the the sort who are probably kin to the aliens that burst out of John Hurt's chest.Despite the excellence of the movie's unfolding, many viewers have fundamental misunderstandings of the way the movie works.  The movie is the story of a man's crisis of faith set during the time of an alien invasion of the earth.  Most critics (professional and amateur) seem to think Father Graham Hess has _lost_ his faith.  In fact, he hasn't.  This is clarified later, when his son seems ready to die of an asthmatic seizure.  It's clear at that point that Father Hess has never lost his belief in God's existence, but he has lost his sense that God is beneficent, and he certainly doesn't like the way God sometime works (all believers have this problem, quick to ask God where God was in bad times but rarely acknowledging his presence during fat times).  All believers in any religious, philosophical, social or political doctrine) should at some point reconsider the very foundations of their belief  do they hold a social, scientific, political, or religious hypothesis because that's how they were broght up?  Have they let others (parents, peers, teachers) impose beliefs on them?  Did they have individual enlightenment?  Do they really understand what they believe in any of the above contexts?Father Graham was having a crisis of faith, which every believer in anything should have if he's a healthy thinker;  he hasn't lost a belief in God, but he has had the foundations of what he thought God was undermined.  This is a healthy thing in Christianity or Judaism, since in these traditions one accepts God for what God is, rather than attempting to impose one's own personality on the Creator.As for the vapid criticisms that a man's faith in traditional faiths should be undermined by extraterrestrials, the argument is extraordinarily shallow and shows a lack of understanding, certainly of Bible based faith, Jewish or Christian, and not only in their theology but their history.  In fact, there has been long and fascinating debate a long time about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  There are many strands of Christian thought dating even from the middle ages (and no, no one ever was burned for suggesting such a thing, it's not a heresy).  The strand of thought most intriguing to me suggests that God alone is unique and Satan is not; therefore the drama of fall and redemption happens throughout the universe. If one reads the Bible it says, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth . . .  That humble sentence covers hundreds of thousands of years in the age of the universe.  But the Bible is a book about God's realtionship to intelligent carbon-based life forms on the planet Earth, and the second sentence focuses on the Earth.  There are suggestions through Scripture that there are other worlds, but until the time of Canon Copernicus it was little understood what forms these worlds might take.  But it was never a part of Christian doctrine that man was unique -- or alone -- in the universe (though he may yet prove to be).The ending is invariably misunderstood, and is set up by an earlier scene involving Father Hess' brother.It's not clear what happened to the alien invaders at the end.  Did they have a strategic withdrawal?  Will they be back?  Possibly.  This is the purpose of the last scene  Just as in an earlier scene Father Hess' brother went into an army recruiting station, probably toying with the idea of enlisting in case the earth was under attack, so Father Hess has enlisted to fight the invaders the best way he knows how.  Some people go into war to fight to defend their country (or planet) but others have to clean up medics, preachers and priests, and people just to carry stretchers or wash up.  Father Hess has re-enlisted in God's service to give spiritual aid and comfort while his brother may enlist in the armed forces to fight the earth's enemy physically.  Even if the aliens don't return, it is clear there is much misery, death, and broken-heartedness among the survivors, and Father Hess, having been through his own crisis, is well equipped to help people understand their own loss;  he's as much a healer, at the end, as a doctor, and as much a fighter as his brother may be as a soldier.  Others will be better for his suffering and doubt.Anyone hoping for a trick ending is disappointed (as Father Hess tried to impose himself on God, so too many critics and viewers have tried to impose themselves on the movie, refusing to accept it as it was and therefore rejecting it out of hand), but anyone who has given the movie thought will understand why the ending is perfect, and why the movie is therefore a masterpiece  Father Hess has not out of the blue regained lost faith; he's come to better understand a God he never doubted, and because of the uncertainty of the alien situation, he has to serve both God and his fellow men the best way he knows how.  He's lost the love of his life (his wife) but he has too much love to give, both for God and mankind, to hide himself in a cornfield when people need him.  It's a courageous ending, a thoughtful ending, well set up, and most professional critics hate it because they hate Christianity and the fact that it is portrayed in a not unpleasant light. But anti-Christians can take heart  there is only one scene of unmitigated theological discussion, and it undercuts the idea of comfort in religion alone.  If you're hiding in your own cornfield from the possibilty of a God, so much that you can't even bear the mention of one in a pluralistic society but must see them silenced, you won't be offended.  The movie is anything but preachy  I don't recall the name of Christ actually mentioned, though it may have been;  and it certainly has no such heavy preachy theological mumbo-jumbo as we get in George Lucas' movies about The Force.Ultimately, the movie does consider free will vs predestination.  Which gets the upper hand?  Both.  While the movie is full of unexplained and unexplainable little oddities that gradually converge, Father Hess himself must tie the (seeming) coincidences together.  God gives signs, but Hess must pick up on them.  And this, too, is sound theology.  It's not the signs themselves, though, that ultimately lead to Father Hess' conversion to God (he reminds me of John Wesley, who was a fairly poor preacher for many years before he actually had a conversion and a sense of the reality of the Redemptive power of Jesus Christ).The movie, while thoughtful and largely quiet (not full of explosions), contains many scenes of suspese that will become classic  the Hesses climbing up on the family car to pick up alien signals on a baby monitor, for instance;  nd the momentarily glimpse of a green leg disappearing in the corn (and it ain't the jolly green giant).  The suspense is relieved by moments of comedy, most involving Phoenix but also in the David Lynchean parade of local townspeople.

These are the the sort who are probably kin to the aliens that burst out of John Hurt's chest.Despite the excellence of the movie's unfolding, many viewers have fundamental misunderstandings of the way the movie works.  The movie is the story of a man's crisis of faith set during the time of an alien invasion of the earth.  Most critics (professional and amateur) seem to think Father Graham Hess has _lost_ his faith.  In fact, he hasn't.  This is clarified later, when his son seems ready to die of an asthmatic seizure.  It's clear at that point that Father Hess has never lost his belief in God's existence, but he has lost his sense that God is beneficent, and he certainly doesn't like the way God sometime works (all believers have this problem, quick to ask God where God was in bad times but rarely acknowledging his presence during fat times).  All believers in any religious, philosophical, social or political doctrine) should at some point reconsider the very foundations of their belief  do they hold a social, scientific, political, or religious hypothesis because that's how they were broght up?  Have they let others (parents, peers, teachers) impose beliefs on them?  Did they have individual enlightenment?  Do they really understand what they believe in any of the above contexts?Father Graham was having a crisis of faith, which every believer in anything should have if he's a healthy thinker;  he hasn't lost a belief in God, but he has had the foundations of what he thought God was undermined.  This is a healthy thing in Christianity or Judaism, since in these traditions one accepts God for what God is, rather than attempting to impose one's own personality on the Creator.As for the vapid criticisms that a man's faith in traditional faiths should be undermined by extraterrestrials, the argument is extraordinarily shallow and shows a lack of understanding, certainly of Bible based faith, Jewish or Christian, and not only in their theology but their history.  In fact, there has been long and fascinating debate a long time about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  There are many strands of Christian thought dating even from the middle ages (and no, no one ever was burned for suggesting such a thing, it's not a heresy).  The strand of thought most intriguing to me suggests that God alone is unique and Satan is not; therefore the drama of fall and redemption happens throughout the universe. If one reads the Bible it says, In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth . . .  That humble sentence covers hundreds of thousands of years in the age of the universe.  But the Bible is a book about God's realtionship to intelligent carbon-based life forms on the planet Earth, and the second sentence focuses on the Earth.  There are suggestions through Scripture that there are other worlds, but until the time of Canon Copernicus it was little understood what forms these worlds might take.  But it was never a part of Christian doctrine that man was unique -- or alone -- in the universe (though he may yet prove to be).The ending is invariably misunderstood, and is set up by an earlier scene involving Father Hess' brother.It's not clear what happened to the alien invaders at the end.  Did they have a strategic withdrawal?  Will they be back?  Possibly.  This is the purpose of the last scene  Just as in an earlier scene Father Hess' brother went into an army recruiting station, probably toying with the idea of enlisting in case the earth was under attack, so Father Hess has enlisted to fight the invaders the best way he knows how.  Some people go into war to fight to defend their country (or planet) but others have to clean up medics, preachers and priests, and people just to carry stretchers or wash up.  Father Hess has re-enlisted in God's service to give spiritual aid and comfort while his brother may enlist in the armed forces to fight the earth's enemy physically.  Even if the aliens don't return, it is clear there is much misery, death, and broken-heartedness among the survivors, and Father Hess, having been through his own crisis, is well equipped to help people understand their own loss;  he's as much a healer, at the end, as a doctor, and as much a fighter as his brother may be as a soldier.  Others will be better for his suffering and doubt.Anyone hoping for a trick ending is disappointed (as Father Hess tried to impose himself on God, so too many critics and viewers have tried to impose themselves on the movie, refusing to accept it as it was and therefore rejecting it out of hand), but anyone who has given the movie thought will understand why the ending is perfect, and why the movie is therefore a masterpiece  Father Hess has not out of the blue regained lost faith; he's come to better understand a God he never doubted, and because of the uncertainty of the alien situation, he has to serve both God and his fellow men the best way he knows how.  He's lost the love of his life (his wife) but he has too much love to give, both for God and mankind, to hide himself in a cornfield when people need him.  It's a courageous ending, a thoughtful ending, well set up, and most professional critics hate it because they hate Christianity and the fact that it is portrayed in a not unpleasant light. But anti-Christians can take heart  there is only one scene of unmitigated theological discussion, and it undercuts the idea of comfort in religion alone.  If you're hiding in your own cornfield from the possibilty of a God, so much that you can't even bear the mention of one in a pluralistic society but must see them silenced, you won't be offended.  The movie is anything but preachy  I don't recall the name of Christ actually mentioned, though it may have been;  and it certainly has no such heavy preachy theological mumbo-jumbo as we get in George Lucas' movies about The Force.Ultimately, the movie does consider free will vs predestination.  Which gets the upper hand?  Both.  While the movie is full of unexplained and unexplainable little oddities that gradually converge, Father Hess himself must tie the (seeming) coincidences together.  God gives signs, but Hess must pick up on them.  And this, too, is sound theology.  It's not the signs themselves, though, that ultimately lead to Father Hess' conversion to God (he reminds me of John Wesley, who was a fairly poor preacher for many years before he actually had a conversion and a sense of the reality of the Redemptive power of Jesus Christ).The movie, while thoughtful and largely quiet (not full of explosions), contains many scenes of suspese that will become classic  the Hesses climbing up on the family car to pick up alien signals on a baby monitor, for instance;  nd the momentarily glimpse of a green leg disappearing in the corn (and it ain't the jolly green giant).  The suspense is relieved by moments of comedy, most involving Phoenix but also in the David Lynchean parade of local townspeople.

It is a story about what should have been a simple family feud, but because of the position of the family in question in the Japanese hierarchy many thousands of people have to die senseless deaths.  It's especially significant to note that, like in almost every war in human history, the leaders who were responsible for the carnage do not die until the very end.

Mostly it did, although it wasn't quite as awful as I was led to believe..For some reason this movie has the Mystery Inc. crew splitting up in the beginning. This isn't really like the cartoon at all. it's a cheap device to allow the characters to reunite at some point and discover each other's worth. As character development goes it's a very forced concept and is one of the movie's big flaws. The split-up gang are trying to solve a mystery. but you could have guessed that. The actual mystery isn't really quite in the flavour of the show, seeing as it's a bit too scary. It's saved a bit by the identity of the villain, which I found amusing (for it's pastiche value).Acting? Okay someone explain how Freddie Prinze Jr. has a career? He's Fred in this and he makes a cardboard cartoon character seem like Oscar Wilde. He's a dreadful actor with zero talent who does not even look that good. His version of Fred doesn't resemble the intelligent jock type I knew from the cartoons. He's almost goofy. Is this the script mildy parodying the original, as it does in places? Or is Prinze just bad? You decide. Velma is played with the irritating `pretty girl plained down' approach. She's purposely monotone and awkward, as shown by Linda Cardellini's performace. but it's just grating. Go away please. Sarah Michelle-Geller tries but is let down a script, which sees her character, Daphne, be pretty and dumb. There's not meant to be depth, I admit, but her performance is still under whelming.. Scooby Doo himself is poorly animated. His integration with real life scenes is grand but he's too cartoonish. Yes, the film has a cartoonish feel but not to the level that Scooby is drawn at. Still the mannerisms are generally good (particularly when he's in cowardly mode) and the voice acting is quite decent. The real revelation here is Matthew Lillard. He is in fact the saving grace of the movie. His performance of Shaggy is perfect. He captures all the mannerisms and the voice amazingly well. Just as Ian McKellen is now, and forever, the epitome of Gandalf, Lillard has become Shaggy for me. His obvious talent is nearly too good for this movie, but he really helps recreate the sense of the cartoon when he's on screen with Scooby - and their partnership is far better than the rest of the Mystery Inc. crew.The humour in the movie is. hard to place. Sometimes it's deliberately puerile - oh a farting contest. How un-amusing. Other times its deliberately making the movie a pastiche - check out the drug references regarding Shaggy and, of course, the mocking of one of the show's regulars. It's a bit of an unsettling mix, as if the movie isn't quite sure what it wants to be. And other times the jokes are just plain awful..The slightly cartoon look to the movie - bright colours and so forth - is generally grand, and helps give a feel to the movie. The somewhat weak editing creates a bit of a rambling structure to the movie and certain characters - such as the voodoo guy - seem pointless additions (and not what they are intended to be). The musical style used is a bit too variable - rap, pop, hard rock. it fails to have a distinct style but the movie has many a bigger flaw.`Scooby Doo' isn't absolutely dreadful although it's certainly not good either. It can't quite decide if it's a homage or a parody and fails to convincingly portray most of the gang. The humour can be weak and the storyline not all that strong. In fact if it weren't for Lillard the movie would be a wreck. Lillard really makes Shaggy come alive, and brightens up all his scenes with the potential the series could have if it was given much more of a focus. Wait for the TV showing and see what you think - by then the sequel should be out and the jury finally in on how bad (or good) this movie is. 3\/10.

He sees her as the only sign of purity in New York, but Travis' inability to properly communicate with others lead to the relationship being terminated.

Travis' downward spiral erupts in explosive violence.      Director Martin Scorsese has created a film that blends together so well, that the term ''endlessly watchable'' was probably invented for this film.

Jodie Foster, although in a small part, shows us the raw talentthat eventually matured into two Oscar wins. Shepherd is understated, yet sympathetic. De Niro what can I say?
