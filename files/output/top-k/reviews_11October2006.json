It won loads of awards, including seven Academy Awards. Despite the fact that it is not quite an epic with its relatively low budget, it justifies its existence with great acting, directing, a very well-written script, rich characters, and authenticity that no other film has yet equalled. But unfortunately, it is marred with a slow pace, some pointless scenes, extremely unnecessary sex scenes and nudity and the lack of any real originality in the acting. No acting awards were won, but the most memorable performance was hammered home by Ralph Fiennes, who played Amon Goeth. His real villainy and spite made the film even colder. This film not only hammered home the true horrors of Nazi regime, it also shows that there are good people in even the most villainous clans, and those good people end up being remembered for what they did.This is not a gory action flick like Saving Private Ryan - there are only a few shootings in the whole three hours. But there is lots of blood when there is a death, and the complete unfairness of the killings make this film even more shocking and powerful. But the main problem of this film is that none of the characters really change. Goeth does learn a lesson from Schindler, who gives some wise words, but he is still a Nazi through and through. Schindler does get some inspiration on and off, but he never really deteriorates, and Liam Neeson really does not own the role 100%. The last minutes of black and white are reminiscent of many Western films (you see my point - man rides into a village on horseback to liberate people, a huge crowd of people come over the horizon of a desert), and John Williams' score is not used enough. However, Mr. Williams actually put some care and thought into his music, unlike in the Jurassic Park score of the same year, which was just full-on Hollywood ham. On the whole, all of the characters in Schindler's List do deliver good performances, unlike Aeon Flux in which every character was flat and dull.To mouth off about Schindler's List is wrong - there is nothing duff about this film, and every second comes from the heart. Though it isn't gripping, it will fascinate, and will take you back 60 years with ease. However, it is not quite perfect, and perhaps a teensy bit overrated. I may need to watch it again. But on the whole, Schindler's List engaged, and worked perfectly as a film. However, I am still more with Saving Private Ryan as Spielberg's best war film. But may I make this clear - this is the most authentic film ever made, and must be seen.

That's probably so because the dialog between the two stars of the picture - Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert - is just great. Those two make this fun to watch. I enjoyed it, however, much more on the first viewing than subsequent ones. It lost some of its zip after I knew what to expect. The ending, too, was very weak. Over the last 20 minutes, the two stars go their separate ways (until the very end) and the story gets very stupid.The nice romance that had developed between the two seemed to have disintegrated when Gable left one early morning (for good intentions) but didn't tell Colbert. The latter thought Gable ran out on her. Hollywood, in films of the 1930s and 1940s, loved to have romances in which confusion abounded and everything was misinterpreted for the worst....until the happy ending when the truth somehow would surface. That same theme was in here, along with yet another trivialization of marriage, another common theme during the classic era. Colbert says it herself in one line, mentioning she doesn't care for this other guy, but what the heck, might as well get married, what's the difference?

Once more Indiana Jones is searching for an holy artifact (the holy grail) and is traveling around the world and once more he is being chased by the Nazi's.Entertainment really doesn't become any better than this. Never ever has there been another more entertaining and solid movie serial based around one central heroic character. Indiana Jones is an heroic adventurous person that we all admire and would love to be like. It's one of the key elements that makes the Indiana Jones movies so popular and entertaining to watch, all over the world. East or West, poor or rich, everyone loves to watch an Indiana Jones movie.This third establishment of the Indiana Jones trilogy is in my opinion the best. Raiders of the Lost Ark might be more entertaining but Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has more than enough things in it that makes this movie such a classic and perfect one to watch.One thing is of course the perfect imaginative story, with locations set all over the world. The story takes us to some of the wonderful places of this planet and does this in a good and consistent pace. The one moment the Jones' are in Venice the next in Germany but this doesn't work distracting at all. This is thanks to the very well flowing story. But also the story itself is very imaginative and great. It has all the elements a adventurous movie needs, chases, lot's of action, a heroic main character and some stereotype evil villains. Perhaps only thing this movie misses is a good love story.This movie is probably also the most personal of the series. It begins with young Indy's first adventure (River Phoenix) and it introduces Indy's father (Sean Connery). It gives the movie some room for a more dramatic undertone about family, a returning element in many Spielberg and Lucas movies. But don't worry, it isn't an overly present element in the movie. The movie really lies its emphasis and its entertainment and adventurous action. Still its an element that enriches the movie and makes it so much more than just another mindless entertaining-flick.The movie also brings some characters back that were severely missing in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Marcus Brody is back and this time, unlike his Raiders of the Lost Ark role, serves as the comic relief of the movie. It works extremely effective for the movie and it's one of the reasons why his character has grown out into a classic movie character. This is of course also thanks to Denholm Elliott's perfect portrayal of the character. Another returning character is Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who in this movie is perhaps even more entertaining than he was in Raiders of the Lost Ark.One of the things that makes this movie better and lets it distinct itself from the other Indiana Jones movies is the presence of Sean Connery as Indiana Jones his father. He and Harrison Ford have an amazing chemistry together, even though they are only 12 years apart. It gives the movie so much more extra. An old man doesn't seem a likely choice for a spectacular, adventurous action movie but mainly because of that contrast his character works out so well and entertaining in the movie.Also great characters in this movie are the villains. Julian Glover is good as the main villain. He is as British as he can be but he pulls off a, to my ears, convincing American accent. Michael Byrne is really memorable as the Nazi colonel Vogel. He perhaps plays the most stereotypical memorable Nazi out of cinematic history.The action is truly superb and very well directed. It provides the movie with some memorable sequences and spectacular moments.The John Williams musical score is the icing on the cake. It's spectacular, sweeping and matches perfectly with everything happening on the screen. Also the cinematography is quite superb. It's a perfect ending for Douglas Slocombe's career, who is still alive but is retired.Sure, Indiana Jones 4 (if it ever gets made, still have my doubts if it will) will most probably be good and at least entertaining to watch but fact remains that this movie forms a perfect ending for the series.

Once more Indiana Jones is searching for an holy artifact (the holy grail) and is traveling around the world and once more he is being chased by the Nazi's.Entertainment really doesn't become any better than this. Never ever has there been another more entertaining and solid movie serial based around one central heroic character. Indiana Jones is an heroic adventurous person that we all admire and would love to be like. It's one of the key elements that makes the Indiana Jones movies so popular and entertaining to watch, all over the world. East or West, poor or rich, everyone loves to watch an Indiana Jones movie.This third establishment of the Indiana Jones trilogy is in my opinion the best. Raiders of the Lost Ark might be more entertaining but Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has more than enough things in it that makes this movie such a classic and perfect one to watch.One thing is of course the perfect imaginative story, with locations set all over the world. The story takes us to some of the wonderful places of this planet and does this in a good and consistent pace. The one moment the Jones' are in Venice the next in Germany but this doesn't work distracting at all. This is thanks to the very well flowing story. But also the story itself is very imaginative and great. It has all the elements a adventurous movie needs, chases, lot's of action, a heroic main character and some stereotype evil villains. Perhaps only thing this movie misses is a good love story.This movie is probably also the most personal of the series. It begins with young Indy's first adventure (River Phoenix) and it introduces Indy's father (Sean Connery). It gives the movie some room for a more dramatic undertone about family, a returning element in many Spielberg and Lucas movies. But don't worry, it isn't an overly present element in the movie. The movie really lies its emphasis and its entertainment and adventurous action. Still its an element that enriches the movie and makes it so much more than just another mindless entertaining-flick.The movie also brings some characters back that were severely missing in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Marcus Brody is back and this time, unlike his Raiders of the Lost Ark role, serves as the comic relief of the movie. It works extremely effective for the movie and it's one of the reasons why his character has grown out into a classic movie character. This is of course also thanks to Denholm Elliott's perfect portrayal of the character. Another returning character is Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who in this movie is perhaps even more entertaining than he was in Raiders of the Lost Ark.One of the things that makes this movie better and lets it distinct itself from the other Indiana Jones movies is the presence of Sean Connery as Indiana Jones his father. He and Harrison Ford have an amazing chemistry together, even though they are only 12 years apart. It gives the movie so much more extra. An old man doesn't seem a likely choice for a spectacular, adventurous action movie but mainly because of that contrast his character works out so well and entertaining in the movie.Also great characters in this movie are the villains. Julian Glover is good as the main villain. He is as British as he can be but he pulls off a, to my ears, convincing American accent. Michael Byrne is really memorable as the Nazi colonel Vogel. He perhaps plays the most stereotypical memorable Nazi out of cinematic history.The action is truly superb and very well directed.

I'm in. True, the man has done little worth one's time past the 80's, but he's fun to watch with only a few exceptions. The plot and writing in general is cliché-ridden... the best way to enjoy the film is really to avoid thinking about it, and just going with it. The action scenes are fairly well-done, and the cinematography is decent enough. Whether or not you enjoy the frequent jokes appearing early on regarding one particular characters identity is difficult to say... personally, I found them to be somewhat cute. The humor in general is fair. The dialog is okay, but not terribly memorable. The plot progression is good enough. The action isn't breaking any new ground, but it manages to be exciting and intense, and fairly well-edited, as well. The finale is quite good, very good tension. The acting is good... Rapaport and Murphy work well together, and Wincott makes a good villain(as Alien Resurrection will tell you, he makes an awesome bad guy, criminal type). The romantic interest of Murphy works well... they've got good on-screen chemistry, and their scenes together are credible.

Henry isn't a supernatural being, such as Freddy Kruger or Pinhead. He's an ordinary blue collar Joe, just like those you see on the street everyday. He just happens to kill people, not out of revenge or anger, just as a way to kill time. In here lies the film's power - Henry could be anyone you run into on a day to day basis. Reality is always more horrifying and unnerving than dreams. Anyone who claims this to be tasteless exploitation obviously doesn't get the point. Roman Polanski once said that, You have to show violence the way it is. If you don't show it realistically, then that's immoral and harmful. If you don't upset people, then that's obscenity. Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer is a perfect case point. It was absolutely necessary to show the video of Henry and Otis rampaging the house and massacring the family. It is key to the visceral power of how depraved humanity can become.The film works well because of its characters, and how it causes you to question your reactions to what you see. People wouldn't have been as disturbed by certain sequences if they were merely suggested. Also, the development of the characters (or lack of) is key. Henry appears to be an inhuman and emotionless monster. He seems to show no signs or disgust or enjoyment out of the killings, but is indifferent about the matters all the same. Otis, Henry's accomplice, is among the sleaziest and most unlikable characters ever featured in a film. The audience grows to hate him more than Henry, despite the fact his actions are less disgusting than Henry's. Henry shows no emotion, Otis comes across as being a giggling creep. His main goal throughout the film is to see his sister naked. Becky, Otis' sister, is attracted to Henry and the fact he killed his mother. The audience knows she is destined for nothing good while she is oblivious of all the danger. Her naivety causes the audience to hate her also.The plot summery seems like the ingredients for a ripe exploitation feature with a few quick thrills. Henry is anything but. If the filmmakers were satisfied with a quick exploiter, why would they seem to be so interested in plunging the darker areas of the human psyche? Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street aren't true horror movies - this is a horror movie in every sense of the word.

This time there's a bit of a twist in the initial narrative as the gangster anti-hero is attempting to 're-rise' the hierarchy, albeit briefly for cash purposes, upon being released form prison.I really and genuinely liked Carlito's Way. I thought it was funny, well paced, contained likable\/dislikeable characters to whom you could really get stuck into as a viewer and just generally held its own for two hours. What I really liked about the film was the use of mise-en-scene; particularly the use of setting and lighting. It seemed that different shades and tones were used for different scenes and moods. The colour red was used to distinguish danger and warnings where as other, lighter colours acted as relief. Examples can be when the colour red was used in the club scenes. Confrontation is always a possibility with eventual party-pooper 'Benny from the Bronx' when the club is the setting and this continuous threat acted nicely with the lighting, just as the red lighting in the strip club when Carlito sees his love interest working there, it has a sort of 'shock factor' to it as he feels confrontation with his own emotions and probably a little bit of a heart broken feeling, also.Whenever this red light crops up in the film, Carlito is facing danger and\/or conflict with himself or others and it is threatening his American dream of moving to the Caribbean. Thus, the lighting signals where and when he'll have is conflicts along his journey to a retirement of some sort.The feel the film has to it is also very realistic. When Carlito is involved in an early shoot out in a bar, he is taking cover in the toilets and is genuinely concerned about the dangers that lie in the bar area waiting for him and although he doesn't realise he's already done the business, he treats the situation like it's critical; issuing threats, buying time and trying to think up a plan of escape even though there's no need.Al Pacino really pushes home his character in this film. We see the two sides of Carlito at numerous, well paced times and it's a real treat. The reformed, kind hearted Carlito is blended in very well with the once violent, ruthless, professional Carlito that ultimately got him into prison in the first place. This reminds us that there are two sides to him and alters our opinion on him throughout. The violent distractions that frustratingly pop up for Carlito act as a mental subplot in the film and they really add to the character and to the experience of the film.This is well directed, well thought out and well acted.

Anyway, what the film is saying, if we take our violence into the planetary system, we will eventually be destroyed, but if we learn the value of love and peaceful living - the Universe is ours!

As the credits start, the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot, into the roller rink, past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check. It's a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate. It cuts to Buddy Holly's bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio. A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is key. He has to somehow show the passion that Holly had for his music to make the film work. This is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey. This isn't about a man with several women to choose between in a sex scandalized, brood abandoned lusty tragedy. This is a film about a nice Texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds that spark and ignites it, his passion is clear and infectious. He really plays the guitar in the film and sings, its not overdubbed with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young guy in Hollywood in the seventies, a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well. Thus, he gives a great performance, because although he isn't Buddy Holly, he's in a similar situation. His first song is the old Les Paul classic, Mockingbird Hill and he has the country twang to nail it. Next a kid calls out for some bop, and against his two band mates (in reality the Crickets were 3 guys, but the down-sizing works fine for the film's limited narrative)he leads them wailing into Rocking with Ollie Vee. The kids love it and the parents hate it. The DJ at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in New York without Buddy Holly even knowing it was ever recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments. An amped-up disc jockey from Buffalo calls up Buddy at home. The DJ has been playing That'll be the Day for 12 hours and is going for 24. The cops are banging on the station's barricaded door. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is quite thrilled. He tells the boys, and their meteoric rise begins. Dan Stroud as the drummer and Charles Martin Smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other. There are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock (all?) biopics. The movie doesn't manipulate you either. Your emotions soar, but they're not manipulated. When the Crickets step onto the Apollo stage in Harlem, the first white group ever to play there, then rip into an electrically charged performance of Oh Boy and win the audience over, my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried. Next, Busey and the boys make It's so Easy sound funkier and more soulful than I would have believed possible. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper way too young. We, as the audience know that, yet the movie is so well written, directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately. The movie isn't about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. The film ends with his last performance and it's a good fifteen minutes of Busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was happy to hear him end it on Not Fade Away, my favorite of his songs. The film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash, but I hardly noticed it.

Remember when animated films were unabashedly charming and big hearted before becoming obnoxiously glib, crude, and cynical (Shrek, Chicken Little)? And remember when just the right actors were carefully chosen to give voices to the animated characters before every animated film became a hollow, guess the celebrity game (Robots, Shark Tale)? B&tB is filled with emotion, heart, and spirit. The biggest star in the movie was Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), yet B&tB will remain a classic long after Madagascar and Open Season are forgotten. Not to mention that it has the most engaging and likable of the Disney Princesses. Belle isn't a passive ninny like Snow White, a pushover like Cinderella, dull like Aurora, or a reckless fool like Ariel. She's smart, kind, assertive, brave, and resourceful. She owns up to her mistakes, looks out for others, and knows her own mind. You all know the story Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) is the daughter of the eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart). Her love of books causes her to be labeled as strange by the narrow-minded citizens of the tiny French village in which she lives. Belle is understandably lonely and bored with her provincial life. It doesn't help that she's pursued by town celebrity Gaston (Richard White), an insufferably pompous, trigger-happy, chauvinistic nitwit and his ankle-biting sidekick LeFou (Jessi Corti). Gaston has the classic, sexist mentality that no means yes, and that Belle will marry him without so much as courtship or a proposal, leading to a hilarious scene where Belle gives Gaston the humiliating rejection he so richly deserves. One day Maurice disappears on his way to an inventor's fair, and when Belle goes out to search for him, she discovers he's being held prisoner in an enchanted castle ruled by a horrifying Beast (Robby Benson). Belle nobly takes her father's place as prisoner, at first devastated at losing her freedom, but is soon comforted by the palace's delightful residents Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), a maternal teapot; Lumiere (dynamically voiced by Jerry Orbach), an amorous candlestick; and Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), an anal retentive clock. What Belle doesn't realize is that the Beast was once a human prince whose cruelty to an enchantress in disguise caused him to be transformed into a monster as punishment (and everyone else in the palace suffered the consequences as well, becoming household objects). And the Beast now must earn someone's love before an enchanted rose loses its final petal (what is it with Disney and deadlines?). There is friction between Belle and the Beast at first (she thinks he's heartless, he thinks she's difficult). But when Beast saves Belle from wolves after she attempts to escape, a bond forms between them. Beast, tired of being a monstrous animal, begins to soften under Belle's kindly influence. Love starts to blossom, but when Belle is forced to leave when Maurice falls ill, it seems Beast's hopes of regaining his humanity are dashed. And it doesn't help that Belle's feelings for the Beast awaken the green-eyed monster in Gaston. A happy ending almost doesn't seem possible...It's easy to buy into all the Beauty and the Beast parodies, but when you look past all the Disney trappings, there is something so much deeper. We see a romance develop not due to physical attraction or plot requirement, but because of, well, development. Belle and the Beast spend time together, get to know each other, and share each other's interests. Beast really becomes a terrific guy he gives bookworm Belle his massive library as a gift, learns to control his temper, and even learns proper table manners (Beast must have earned hundreds of wistful sighs from female audience members). It's a film about transformation in general. We don't have some vacuous Prince Charming, but a complex, anguished male protagonist who could easily be labeled as a villain in the beginning (he does throw poor old Maurice into the dungeon for no good reason). Once the Beast learns to let go of his self-pity and rage can he become more human. Gaston is a creep from beginning to end, but he is loved by all because of his looks. We see him as a harmless jerk, until his jealousy of the Beast winning Belle's love changes him from dumb jock to a murderous bastard. Even dopey Lefou undergoes a transformation, from token goofy sidekick to a demonic little creep capable of doing much damage. And how about that music? Not one song feels gratuitous, and every one is blessed with clever, poetic lyrics (sadly, the brilliant lyricist Howard Ashman died shortly before Beauty and the Beast was released). Belle is one of the best character songs ever written, and Be Our Guest is a lyrical and visual extravaganza, as well as a reminder of what a hell of a singer Jerry Orbach was. The ballroom scene is a masterpiece of cinema magic. With sweeping camera movements, glowing lights, and spellbinding special effects, it's truly a visual stunner. Enough of my hyperbole. You owe it to yourselves to see this tale as old as time...

She owns up to her mistakes, looks out for others, and knows her own mind. You all know the story Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) is the daughter of the eccentric inventor Maurice (Rex Everhart). Her love of books causes her to be labeled as strange by the narrow-minded citizens of the tiny French village in which she lives. Belle is understandably lonely and bored with her provincial life. It doesn't help that she's pursued by town celebrity Gaston (Richard White), an insufferably pompous, trigger-happy, chauvinistic nitwit and his ankle-biting sidekick LeFou (Jessi Corti). Gaston has the classic, sexist mentality that no means yes, and that Belle will marry him without so much as courtship or a proposal, leading to a hilarious scene where Belle gives Gaston the humiliating rejection he so richly deserves. One day Maurice disappears on his way to an inventor's fair, and when Belle goes out to search for him, she discovers he's being held prisoner in an enchanted castle ruled by a horrifying Beast (Robby Benson). Belle nobly takes her father's place as prisoner, at first devastated at losing her freedom, but is soon comforted by the palace's delightful residents Mrs. Potts (Lansbury), a maternal teapot; Lumiere (dynamically voiced by Jerry Orbach), an amorous candlestick; and Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), an anal retentive clock. What Belle doesn't realize is that the Beast was once a human prince whose cruelty to an enchantress in disguise caused him to be transformed into a monster as punishment (and everyone else in the palace suffered the consequences as well, becoming household objects). And the Beast now must earn someone's love before an enchanted rose loses its final petal (what is it with Disney and deadlines?). There is friction between Belle and the Beast at first (she thinks he's heartless, he thinks she's difficult). But when Beast saves Belle from wolves after she attempts to escape, a bond forms between them. Beast, tired of being a monstrous animal, begins to soften under Belle's kindly influence. Love starts to blossom, but when Belle is forced to leave when Maurice falls ill, it seems Beast's hopes of regaining his humanity are dashed. And it doesn't help that Belle's feelings for the Beast awaken the green-eyed monster in Gaston. A happy ending almost doesn't seem possible...It's easy to buy into all the Beauty and the Beast parodies, but when you look past all the Disney trappings, there is something so much deeper. We see a romance develop not due to physical attraction or plot requirement, but because of, well, development. Belle and the Beast spend time together, get to know each other, and share each other's interests. Beast really becomes a terrific guy he gives bookworm Belle his massive library as a gift, learns to control his temper, and even learns proper table manners (Beast must have earned hundreds of wistful sighs from female audience members). It's a film about transformation in general. We don't have some vacuous Prince Charming, but a complex, anguished male protagonist who could easily be labeled as a villain in the beginning (he does throw poor old Maurice into the dungeon for no good reason). Once the Beast learns to let go of his self-pity and rage can he become more human. Gaston is a creep from beginning to end, but he is loved by all because of his looks. We see him as a harmless jerk, until his jealousy of the Beast winning Belle's love changes him from dumb jock to a murderous bastard. Even dopey Lefou undergoes a transformation, from token goofy sidekick to a demonic little creep capable of doing much damage. And how about that music? Not one song feels gratuitous, and every one is blessed with clever, poetic lyrics (sadly, the brilliant lyricist Howard Ashman died shortly before Beauty and the Beast was released). Belle is one of the best character songs ever written, and Be Our Guest is a lyrical and visual extravaganza, as well as a reminder of what a hell of a singer Jerry Orbach was. The ballroom scene is a masterpiece of cinema magic. With sweeping camera movements, glowing lights, and spellbinding special effects, it's truly a visual stunner. Enough of my hyperbole.

Remember when animated films were unabashedly charming and big hearted before becoming obnoxiously glib, crude, and cynical (Shrek, Chicken Little)? And remember when just the right actors were carefully chosen to give voices to the animated characters before every animated film became a hollow, guess the celebrity game (Robots, Shark Tale)? B&tB is filled with emotion, heart, and spirit. The biggest star in the movie was Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), yet B&tB will remain a classic long after Madagascar and Open Season are forgotten.

It seems the harsh sentiments still resonate with Barbra Streisand nearly thirty years later in her third directorial effort. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably.At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale.As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in The Prince of Tides. Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves.At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in The Owl and the Pussycat) is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role. As with her previous two films, Streisand imbues her film with lots of background music though this time it feels somewhat more intrusive. What she does achieve is the romanticism in tone and self-image reinforcement she obviously felt a need to convey. The DVD came out only two years later in 1998 and consequently has no extras to offer.
