The action here is a lot of the time just proportionate to how create whatever the T1000 is doing is, with all of his metamorphic features. But there are still enough cool explosions here to satisfy me, too.The Story A quite archetypal (and brilliantly told) tale of warning of apocalypse and action heroics, T2 also possesses an interesting moral qualm partially through involving human life and the intricacy within. T2 packs a little of just about everything, from action to science fiction to romance to drama, and it ties it all together in an explosive package that nobody should miss. There are a lot of cool little themes here too, like how the kid teaches Arnold things - and how the no killing people thing is carried through with such style - or the evolution of Sarah Connor's character from the first movie to this one, and all of this interspersed with the high-octane action makes for a hugely gratifying experience.The epic scope, vision and dynamics of this movie are just incredible.

It's a visually striking, documentary like movie with heart-throbbing pace, and bravura acting with story based on nothing but hard facts. It was striking that polls conducted from 1966 on show that as many as 80% of the American public hold beliefs contrary to the findings of the Warren commission. And how could anybody believe the report that invented a magic bullet theory which supposed to explain how a mixed up character like Lee Harvey Oswald, could have managed to shoot both the president and governor Connally six times, including a fatal frontal shot to John F. Kennedy's head, clearly visible in Zapruder film, firing only three times in 5.6 seconds from up behind the motorcade. The facts of the case show that there had to be another gunman, and if so than we have a conspiracy, and everything that happened later both to principal characters, witnesses and shift in foreign and domestic American politics, only give proof to that conclusion. Oliver Stone waste no time in presenting the case. I've never seen a movie 197 minutes long, that doesn't let your mind wonder for a second. People who testify to various aspects of the assassination are moving in front of your eyes like passing trains and every one of them puts another piece in never completed puzzle of conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination. This film, along with Executive action, filmed only 10 years after, in 1973, show that the plot to kill John Kennedy is worked out and organized in a way that there's no doubt that it leads to the highest ranking government officials and all the industrial and banking tycoons that had everything to loose with JFK's policy of non involvement, racial equality and détente with the USSR. Later assassinations of Martin Luther King, and Robert Kennedy, show that this pattern was used in a same manner, to eliminate most dangerous political threats to the big money and conservative politics. Like Donald Sutherland's X has said in the movie Who benefited?

Not, that the idea\/story behind any fatal attraction plot is anything new, I think 'Attraction' enormously doubled the suspense, realism and believability than 'Misty' could even come close. Sad to say, but I've met people like Close's character Alex on more than one occasion, though not so murderous, but sick nonetheless. Alex is obsessed with honest family man and lawyer Dan (Douglas) after just one weekend fling. Dan's loyal to his wife and daughter, despite his one mistake in committing adultery. And he's paid back tenfold by his incredibly huge error in judgment by selecting Alex. She's a very ill individual. Some say psycho, I say sick. (Much as I agree with the same statement for Norman Bates.) Not being a psychologist, or doctor, I do feel someone acting psycho is making a choice, something they knew they were doing. This is why Close was so good in this role (unlike the unbelievable acting of Walter in 'Misty.') Close showed such depths of someone completely sick and in need of help and yet most people (including Dan) would just brush it off as obsessive behavior. In addition, every actor in 'Attraction' was suburb, including the young daughter. I believed everything in this movie could (and probably does) happen, even the chance encounters, opportunities and down to the emotions the characters felt. It never felt slow, it felt real and that's what scared me the most.Side Note Other than Close's hair, the cord-phones and the shameless I (heart) NY ads, this could have very well been made today.

And what has over-long, pointless dialogue and scenes that don't really leave an impact on you, with few of any merit at all? The Omen III, of course. This movie is just boring, with little that kept me interested after the very first death scene. The characters are flat and unemotional, the plot is vague - did we miss a movie here? - and overall everything is just extraordinarily mediocre.

But let's be serious; as a book-to-movie adaptation this pretty much fails, as it takes an entirely different view of the story as compared to Stephen King's original novel. For the first half hour or forty five minutes of this movie, you will be questioning why certain things were not added, why certain things were changed and why everything else, but by the end you'll be hooked because this movie knows how to pull the scares with efficiency and great measure.The problems are as follows there is barely any tension in the beginning of the film, no descent into madness or inner conflict with the Jack character. Where was that? This movie just skipped all of that and sort of jumped right into things, and while I enjoyed it, it could have been done better than it was. It didn't make any sense the way it was here, and the character development was pretty much a zero for every character. The first half of this film just sort of speeds by without really setting much up &#x96; don't get me wrong, this is great for what it is, but it would have been a real masterpiece if we had been given a slightly altered beginning that showed us more of Jack's normal side, given us a reason to doubt his spiral into madness later on. And I don't think this movie really elaborated on the whole shining concept much, which is silly considering the name of the movie, but whatever.We really do have to work with what we're given, and honestly, this really is a horror classic when you get down to bare bones. I mean, once things really kick off at about the hour and a half mark, the movie takes no prisoners. And by the two hour mark, it doesn't matter whether or not you want to see stuff from the book on the screen, because Stanley f*cking Kubrick is SCARING THE HELL OUT OF YOU. Seriously, the last half hour of this movie rules, everything about it does.Another great thing about this movie? Jack Nicholson. At first I thought he didn't fit the part of Jack Torrance, but really that was just because of the inconsistent pacing I mentioned above. No. Jack Nicholson's tremendous screen presence is one of the best things about this. He's just so entertaining to watch, even when he over-emotes things a bit. He does a really great job, even just playing himself.One thing this whole movie does really well is suspense and tension, with ruthless camera angles creating a horrific portrait that you will not forget. This movie might be lacking as an adaptation, but that's the thing I've been learning lately with these things you can't have a great movie that is also a book adaptation, because they're just two different mediums that require different things in order to be good. Yeah, Kubrick changed a lot here, but what came out in the end was really a very successful and well made horror movie that succeeds at what it is trying to do. The Shining is a blood-soaked horror classic that you won't want to miss if you haven't seen it already.

","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"27 June 2009","score":"","review":" From director Donald Petrie (Mystic Pizza, Miss Congeniality), this is a film that probably got many kids saving their pocket money, I certainly wished I was rich. Basically Richie Rich (Razzie nominated Macaulay Culkin) is the richest kid in the world with unlimited wealth and everything he could ever want. There is one thing thing he doesn't have that he longs for, a normal life with some friends, but one day he sees some kids playing baseball and wants to join them, but they don't want him around. Richie manages to get them to like him however when he invites them to enjoy themselves to his mansion and all its luxuries, including a roller-coaster and a McDonald's restaurant. Meanwhile, Lawrence Van Dough (John Larroquette), the Rich family's executive is planning to kill the family and steal their fortune, so when Richie realises, he with his new friends and trusted English butler Herbert Arthur Runcible Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) plan to stop him. Also starring Edward Herrmann as Richard Rich, Christine Ebersole as Regina Rich, Michael McShane as Professor Keenbean, Chelcie Ross as Ferguson, Mariangela Pino as Diane Pazinski, Stephi Lineburg as Gloria Pazinski, Michael Maccarone as Tony and Claudia Schiffer as Aerobics Instructor. It has its moments of slapstick for the kids, but it is nowhere as entertaining as Home Alone, especially with Culkin reaching the age of 14 and nearly an adolescent. Okay!

Anyway, A Fish Called Wanda was a fantastic comedy written by John Cleese, this follow-up may not be as funny, but it is quite fun to watch. Basically Rollo Lee (Cleese) has become the new director of London's Marwood Zoo to raise more business after being bought by America's Octopus Inc. run by tycoon Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). Rollo says however that they will get rid of all cuddly and gentle animals, and only keep the fierce ones, for more excitement, making the animal keepers including Sydney Lotterby (Robert Lindsay), unendingly talkative Adrian 'Bugsy' Malone (Palin), Reggie Sea Lions (Corbett) and Cub Felines (Licence to Kill's Carey Lowell) very unhappy. Soon enough though the Americans, McCain's son Vince McCain (also Kline) and up-and-coming business executive Willa Weston (Jamie Lee Curtis), come to the zoo to take control, and revoke the fierce animal policy. Vince instead creates a series of vicious schemes to attract customers, such as unauthorised celebrity endorsements, overpriced zoo merchandise, and robotic animals (such as a panda) instead of real ones. Meanwhile, Willa has grown to love both the animals and a reformed Rollo, and with the zoo keepers, they all plan to stop Rod McCain, who knows about Vince stealing from the zoo fund, from turning the zoo into a golf course for the Japanese. It is when Rod is unintentionally shot that Vince has to become him and save the zoo, which he does, and everything is put right in the end, Rollo even bags Willa with her thinking he is a sex mad man. There are some good small jokes, the cast members all get their individual giggles, so there are some things to be liked about it. Worth watching!
