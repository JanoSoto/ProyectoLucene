The whole movie pretty much makes you laugh and the action scenes look spectacular.  One of my favorite 'eye candy' scenes is when shrek breaks a keg and incredibly realistic ale comes out.  I couldnt have asked for a better movie!!!  My whole family loved it, (it is my mom's favorite movie now), ALL of my friends love it and it is just an overall great movie.  I give it 4 out of 4 stars because; Amazingly good story Great Acting (I love Cameron Diaz and Mike Meyers any time on film, and they are great here, and I actually found Eddie Murphy to be hilarious for once. Plus all the voices work great!) Great effects, the whole movie looks amazing The sound effects and the music is great as A Must See Movie-literally!
