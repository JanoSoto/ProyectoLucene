This film which was directed by Jay Roach and starred Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, and Hank Azaria is not all about just playing hockey. The movie is about a small town in Alaska where tradition rules and hockey is the name of the game. Russell Crowe plays John Biebe who is not only the town sheriff he is also one of the stars of the Saturday hockey game. The town takes much pride in their Saturday hockey game so much when they want to bring in the young high school player; there is an actual vote on if they should allow him on the team. Burt Reynolds plays Judge Walter Burns who once played in the Saturday game when he was younger. He now has a son who plays in the Saturday game. The entire town revolves around this game and they take pride in their players and their small town. Hank Azaria plays Charles Danner who has moved away from Mystery because he feels the small town is holding him back and he thinks things are much better in the big city. He decides Mystery needs to be put on the map and he arranges a hockey game with a major professional team. Where it all goes from here is very interesting and the outcome is certainly not what you would think. Mystery, Alaska is not just a movie about hockey, it is also a movie about the relationships we have with our family and our friends.

The movie A League of Their Own is about the first professional women's baseball league. It is also about the empowerment of women. While the men are at war the baseball league is in jeopardy of being shut down. Mr. Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall), a wealthy business man decides to create a women's baseball league to keep it running until the men return from war. The women are recruited by Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz). He travels throughout the United States searching for women while providing humor. On his journey he recruits Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and her kid sister Kit Keller (Lori Petty). After watching a game Ernie Capadino decides he wants Dottie and not Kit. She is more attractive and better at baseball. After Dottie turns him down, Kit tells him she's ready to join. Mr. Capadino states I don't want you; I want the one who hit the ball. Kit eventually talks him into allowing her to come to tryouts if she can get Dottie to go too. Ultimately Dottie decides to attend for her little sister. While traveling back to Chicago they make a pit stop and recruit Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanaugh). During tryouts the girls encounter May Mordabito (Madonna) and Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell). This is one of my favorite scenes. The lighting of this scene is very bright with sunlight. May and Doris decide to test the other three ladies and tell them not everyone is going to make the teams. While walking away Doris throws the baseball at them to prove a point but Dottie catches it with her bare hand. The sound it makes when she catches the ball makes it seem like it should really hurt but she didn't even flinch. Needless to say, all of these women make the Rockford Peaches team together. Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) is hired to coach the Rockford Peaches. At first he treats the team as a joke until he sees the talent these women have. In the beginning the league attracts very little attention. The women are seen as a joke until a reporter and photographer attend a game. Mr. Lowenstein (David Straithairn) asked the girls to give them something special and focuses on Dottie. He calls her The Queen of Diamonds. During the game a foul bowl is hit and Dottie catches it while doing the splits. The photographer snaps a picture of this and when the article is published in the newspaper the league becomes more popular. While the girls are working their way to the championship a rivalry is brewing between Dottie and her sister Kit. Kit feels that she is being overshadowed by Dottie and wants some of the attention. The tension between the sisters becomes too much and Kit is traded to Racine Belles. In the end Kit gets the best of her sister and wins the game for her team. The rivalry is sad because deep down Dottie only wants the best for her sister and is proud of what she accomplished. While the movie is about women playing baseball the underlining of this movie is about female empowerment. While the men are home women are expected to be in the kitchen. When the men are away at war they are told it's their duty to get out of the kitchen. These women are asked to keep the league alive but at the same time forced to endure being degraded for being women playing the sport. They are forced to wear skirts as uniforms and are criticized by the fans. During the first game for the Rockford Peaches a man in the stands screams girls can't play ball and proceeds to make fun of the team. I love this scene because Ellen Sue throws the ball at the man to shut him up. No matter how much they went through and how many people doubted them they won the hearts of everyone in the end. The league continued on for many years. A League of Their Own reminds me of the movie Mystery, Alaska. Even though this film is not about women; it is about a hockey team in Alaska that is fighting to be recognized and accepted for who they are. Both films show the teams being criticized and ridiculed but in the end they all persevere and get the respect they deserve.

It used to be. I think it might have been in the top 10 a few years ago. Now it's gone. With all due respect to IMDb and its posters, there's something wrong here.I wouldn't say Field of Dreams is No. 1, but it certainly is in my top 20, along with Harvey, Ground Hog Day and Being John Malkovich, all highly creative movies. Did I mention The Shawshank Redemption is No. 1? A good film, (with a gaping hole in its plot), but how many times can you watch it, after knowing the ending? Are most of the IMDb reviewers cons in the pen yearning to be free? Field of Dreams is a classic that has become part of our culture, part of our language. It is a movie you can watch again and again, and it still works, it still generates the same emotions, it still inspires you to dream.One of the most amazing elements of the film is that there really was a Moonlight Doc Graham. The yellowed obituary that the newspaper editor reads from was his actual obituary. His brother was the U.S. Senator and Governor of North Carolina, as I recall, but Moonlight gave up his family advantages to be a small town doctor.The scene of Burt Lancaster fading into the cornfield, his swansong on film, always brings tears to my eyes.It's hard to imagine how this film could be more perfect. If Field of Dreams is not a 10, what is? Well, Field of Dreams is 22 years old now, made before some IMDb reviewers were born. It's a very American film, and I notice the growing hatred of America in the world is, sadly, rubbing off on American cinema, kind of like people who hate Wagner's music because they don't like his politics (what they've been told are his politics).Anyone who refuses to watch great American films like Field of Dreams is the loser. I have lived abroad; I gave a copy of Field of Dreams to a co-worker, and in the entire year I was there, she absolutely refused to watch more than five minutes of it, and then said now she had watched it.This movie is threatening to people in some more traditional countries because it is about individualism, of being a non-conformist even when people might think you are crazy and stop talking to you. It is the antithesis of the Confucian group think of countries like Japan, Korea and China, and who knows what other countries.In America, individualism and non-conformity are held up as a high ideal to strive for. That's what this movie is about. Field of Dreams is the epitome of this theme that appears over and over in American cinema, in great movies like Harvey and High Noon. But in most countries in the world non-conformity is viewed as a bad thing, and so this movie might make adults feel uncomfortable.There's also the problem of a number of cultural references that might be meaningless to foreign viewers, like the Sixties, not to mention baseball, itself. The commentary track is one of the most interesting, but perhaps there needs to be another track for foreign audiences? I'll let you in on a little secret I showed this movie to a class of foreign school kids, with appropriate subtitles, as a last minute bonus. I think they got it.When you think of it, Field of Dreams is a radical movie, radical in the Sixties sense. Adults might not like it, but it could inspire young people in other countries that there are possibilities to make wonderful changes in the world and in yourselves far beyond what your elders can imagine, if only you dare to dream and stick to your dreams, regardless of what others might say.

The commentary track is one of the most interesting, but perhaps there needs to be another track for foreign audiences? I'll let you in on a little secret I showed this movie to a class of foreign school kids, with appropriate subtitles, as a last minute bonus. I think they got it.When you think of it, Field of Dreams is a radical movie, radical in the Sixties sense. Adults might not like it, but it could inspire young people in other countries that there are possibilities to make wonderful changes in the world and in yourselves far beyond what your elders can imagine, if only you dare to dream and stick to your dreams, regardless of what others might say.

As a new police chief in a small beach town he quickly is informed that a local woman has been killed by a shark. With the 4th of July holiday approaching the chief knows the beaches will be packed as well as the water. He tries to talk Mayor Vaughn played by Murray Hamilton into shutting down the beaches, but the Mayor has not intentions of doing such a thing. The Mayor's main concern is the amount of money the town is going to make over the weekend and doesn't want to scare any of that money away. The Mayor refuses to shut down the beach even though Chief Brody and a scientist who studies sharks Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) beg him to.The 4th of July weekend approaches and the town has all heard of the shark who has killed a local woman and no one is in the water. Mayor Vaughn encourages the people to get in the water, and they do. This ended up being a bad idea. Shortly after the people began playing and swimming in the water the shark appears, and ends up killing a local man. The Mayor then realizes something has to been done, especially with the thought that his children were in the water that day as well. So the Mayor agrees to pay a local fisherman he request amount to kill the shark, and the Chief as well as the scientist Hooper join him. This local fisherman named Sam Quint, played by Robert Shaw, seems to have a great deal of experience with sharks and definitely views them as something to be feared.This trip out to sea ends up being a shocker to them all. The first time you really get to see the shark is when Chief Brody is throwing chum in the water and the shark sneaks up and then pops out of the water. Chief Brody is in such amazement all he says is we are going to need a bigger boat. Up to this point in the movie you really don't realize how big the shark is, the buildup of size in the beginning of the film you understand the shark is larger than normal, but the first time you see it you are amazed by its size. At this point the battle is on against the shark. Along this trip you learn a lot about the people aboard the boat. One of the greatest moments of the film is when Quint gives his story about being aboard the SS Indianapolis and you learn why he has the feelings he has about sharks. The movie Jaws was released in June of 1975, which was the year I was born, but has always been one of my all time favorites. Jaws was one the first horror movies I ever saw and it really scared me. I still do not like to go into the ocean to this day because of this movie. There are several parts of the movie which give you the view of the person being attacked and puts you in their place, which is frightening. The most memorable items of the film is the music. That music is universal for a shark. When you start to hear the dun dun&#x85;..dun dun&#x85;.dumb dumb dumb, it just sends a feeling of fear all though your body.

Sleepwalkers has no time for sadness though, once it ditches the interest inherent in its plot it simply makes a gleeful dive for the pools of absurdity, ending up a pleasingly ludicrous romp if you don't take it remotely seriously, or have some booze on the go. The plot sees teen Charles Brady trying to make his way in a new town, with the hots for lovely classmate Tanya. However there's the small matter that he also has something hot going with his gorgeous mom Mary. And both Charles and Mary are immortal lifeforce draining shapeshifters with a thirst for blood and a mortal fear of cats (their only weakness). In the hands of a decent writer and a director with a flair for the erotic this could have been wonderful stuff, but instead this was the first Stephen King project written wholly for the screen and it isn't one of his better efforts. King seems always to have had problems with letting stories lurch out of control and this one does so around about the halfway mark, maybe earlier. Its a shame as the opening discovery of a derelict house replete with cat traps and a body in a cupboard suggest some measure of menacing potential but once the slaying starts and the film lays on the full range of Charles and Mary's abilities it gets very silly very quickly. Not that I minded too much, as as far as silly films go its done with a good deal of gusto. The leads are fortunately game, Brian Krause has a good youthful mix of the awkward, arrogant and aggressive whilst Madchen Amick does a good job of frightenedly reacting to situations as Tanya. Alice Krige is the standout as Mary though, radiant with dreamlike seductive elegance she is a treat for eyes and ears and really throws herself into the part, making for some good chuckles at the increasingly idiotic dialogue she spouts (seriously, one or two of her one liners are horrific). There are also for no good reason a rash of blink or you'll miss 'em cameos for various horror luminaries such as Tobe Hooper and Clive Barker, I guess they were all in on the joke. The pace is smart too, and once the film builds to a head it sustains a sense of lunatic fun till the end, with a bit of good time bloodshed, some nicely shonky visual effects and even a cool monster. All in all this isn't a terribly good film, as many others have noted. I enjoyed it though, I guess I'm more disposed to this era of junk than most. Not especially recommended unless this sort of thing is really up your street, but a fair 6\/10 from me.

There is a whole secret network of witches and warlocks conspiring against the marital fate of Stewart. Now, this movie is a comedy. And it is, of course, make believe. There is no such thing as witches or magic. Except in Wasilla, Alaska, where Sarah Palin attended her local church to be blessed by a genuine African witch doctor to prevent any witches from casting spells on her, and to make sure she got plenty of money. It's all on youtube. I don't know about the first part, but she has done pretty well on the second. I doubt if Hollywood would dare make this movie today with all the religious wingnuts who actually think it is their god-given duty to protect everyone else in America from being tempted by the devil. They would probably picket every showing of the movie. And then there was Damn Yankees, about an old guy who sells his soul to play professional baseball. Boy, they wouldn't even have to watch that movie, the title's bad enough. It's Hollywood.

I assume it is a real building, but I'm not sure. The area with Novak's shop looks like a set seen many times before, including in some Twilight Zone episodes.

Now, if you don't think this movie is perfect, erase all of the thoughts you had about this movie before reading this, or else you'll probably disagree with many of the things I say.This is my favourite film of all time. I love Tom Hanks, I love the location, I love the story, I love the camera-work, I love every aspect. I'll start off with Tom Hanks himself. Well, he sure says a lot without saying much. The emotions on his face are unbelievable realistic. Every breakdown Hank's character has seems real. He can also make the audience emotionally invested in a volleyball, now THAT'S good acting.The camera-work is astounding. There are many shots that last much longer than the average take in a movie. At first they annoyed me, but now I love them. The pans that can take a minute long really add to the realism, and just lets you take in the situation the main character is in. The effects are pretty good too, sometimes the porta-potty sail looks kinda iffy, but for the most part it's solid. Zemeckis nailed it with how this film was put together, and the camera crew did amazing too. The story comes off outlandish, but in the end seems realistic. I found that the chances of Noland actually surviving a plane crash and then stumbling upon an unoccupied island slim to none. But hey, at least it's not like Lost, where not only to they crash onto an island, but like 20 or so people survive. I absolutely adore the ending. It shows that the movie will take risks, and that it's willing to vary from the crowd. Some people might say this movie is depressing, but for me, it's a perfect balance. We see a whole bunch of sad and dramatic stuff, so when the happy, funny moments come around it makes them all the more enjoyable. Finally, I will put all the stupid complaints to rest. A feature length FedEx commercial. Ya, right. Regardless if Zemeckis made a deal with FedEx or not, it makes the movie even more realistic. A real company makes it seem like it really happened or really could happen. Not to mention, why does it bug everyone so much? I didn't even notice how many times the name appears until I read someone complaining about it online. The next thing is the runtime. I'll admit, this movie is a bit long, and is not very convenient. When i saw this for the first time, it bugged me how long the events went on after Chuck is rescued, but now it makes sense to me. More story needed to be told. This wasn't just a survival movie.

My favourite director and my favourite actor come together to make a masterpiece. It's Zemeckis' best movie (Forrest Gump is a close second) and Zemeckis has mastered the art of telling a good story.

At first they annoyed me, but now I love them. The pans that can take a minute long really add to the realism, and just lets you take in the situation the main character is in. The effects are pretty good too, sometimes the porta-potty sail looks kinda iffy, but for the most part it's solid. Zemeckis nailed it with how this film was put together, and the camera crew did amazing too. The story comes off outlandish, but in the end seems realistic. I found that the chances of Noland actually surviving a plane crash and then stumbling upon an unoccupied island slim to none. But hey, at least it's not like Lost, where not only to they crash onto an island, but like 20 or so people survive. I absolutely adore the ending. It shows that the movie will take risks, and that it's willing to vary from the crowd. Some people might say this movie is depressing, but for me, it's a perfect balance. We see a whole bunch of sad and dramatic stuff, so when the happy, funny moments come around it makes them all the more enjoyable. Finally, I will put all the stupid complaints to rest. A feature length FedEx commercial. Ya, right. Regardless if Zemeckis made a deal with FedEx or not, it makes the movie even more realistic. A real company makes it seem like it really happened or really could happen. Not to mention, why does it bug everyone so much? I didn't even notice how many times the name appears until I read someone complaining about it online. The next thing is the runtime. I'll admit, this movie is a bit long, and is not very convenient. When i saw this for the first time, it bugged me how long the events went on after Chuck is rescued, but now it makes sense to me. More story needed to be told. This wasn't just a survival movie. It's supposed to be more than that. A character study, as we look at the lengths someone will go to stay alive, and the effects that being taken away from civilization for a long time can have on a person and the people around him. And for everything else, you don't like Tom Hanks or the story, that's really just personal preference and I probably won't change your mind on that.Well, I think Cast Away will always be my favourite movie, and for me, It's a dream come true. My favourite director and my favourite actor come together to make a masterpiece. It's Zemeckis' best movie (Forrest Gump is a close second) and Zemeckis has mastered the art of telling a good story. But, can you please stop with all those CGI movies? It was cool at first, but now it's getting old. Oh well, we've still got his early work, one of the best films ever made, and my favourite film of all time.Cast Away 10\/10 ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 May 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" South Park; Bigger, Longer and Uncut is classified as an animated comic, musical.

The film Asses of Fire has been rated R by the MPAA. This goes to show you that there are always ways of getting around the established rules in life. The movie is filled with obnoxious farting and swearing set to music so that it can also be considered a musical. As a result of the children seeing the movie, which they consider totally awesome, they themselves immediately begin mimicking what they have just seen by incorporating the foul language into most every conversation from that moment on. Of course they go to school using their new found persona and the parents are notified immediately.

They do not have the right to tell others what to choose. And even if children are underage, if they really want to do something they will find a way to do it. Children usually mimic what they see, especially by their parents.Prejudice against any group of individuals, this film is riddled with the irony of prejudice.

There wasn't any special lighting needed. There are plenty of musical ditties throughout and you really expect it with every changing of scenes, however it never really signified a dramatic change in mood.The content of South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut includes an extreme amount of obscenities, violence, nudity, sexual innuendos of which should shock anyone.

Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that salvation lies within. Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Hope can drive a man insane, Red warns Andy. It's got no use on the inside. Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption, it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film Harvey Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing the guy who can get it for you with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.Shawshank is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that a warm place without memory is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need for such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine and noble as they are here.

Is that so outlandish? Well, yes, I suppose it is. But that's what makes it so funny. This movie fills in the gaps in history (including that famous 18½-minute gap) with lots and lots of laughs. The story is implausible and impossible, a series of contrivances one piled on top of another. But in this bizarre alternate universe, one in which the fate of the free world rests in the hands of a pair of dumb blondes, the story works. The movie is funny, charming and thoroughly enjoyable.Our two ditzes are Betsy and Arlene, played by Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams respectively. They really are a couple of airheads. Arlene is meant to be the more serious-minded of the two. You can tell this because she wears glasses. That's always the way it works in movies, right? Betsy meanwhile is totally out there, a 1970s hippie chick floating on the breeze without a care in the world. Quite by accident Betsy and Arlene lead to the discovery of the Watergate break-in. They're oblivious to this of course. They're oblivious to pretty much everything. But when G. Gordon Liddy, who saw the girls at the Watergate, sees them again as they take a White House tour he's afraid they might know something. Soon the girls are meeting President Nixon himself and they find themselves appointed official White House dog-walkers so that the administration can keep an eye on them. But they end up seeing more things they shouldn't see and hearing more things they shouldn't hear. And ultimately they bring down a presidency. All along the way the laughs come fast and furious.Dumb though they are it's impossible not to love Betsy and Arlene. Dunst is terrific with her portrayal of the bubbly, flighty, relentlessly charming Betsy. Arlene is slightly more grounded than Betsy (everything's relative) so Williams doesn't have as showy a part to play as Dunst does. But she's very good too. All the supporting players are spot-on as they bring real-life Watergate figures to comedic life. Dan Hedaya's a great, funny Nixon.

Is that so outlandish? Well, yes, I suppose it is. But that's what makes it so funny. This movie fills in the gaps in history (including that famous 18½-minute gap) with lots and lots of laughs. The story is implausible and impossible, a series of contrivances one piled on top of another. But in this bizarre alternate universe, one in which the fate of the free world rests in the hands of a pair of dumb blondes, the story works. The movie is funny, charming and thoroughly enjoyable.Our two ditzes are Betsy and Arlene, played by Kirsten Dunst and Michelle Williams respectively. They really are a couple of airheads. Arlene is meant to be the more serious-minded of the two. You can tell this because she wears glasses. That's always the way it works in movies, right? Betsy meanwhile is totally out there, a 1970s hippie chick floating on the breeze without a care in the world. Quite by accident Betsy and Arlene lead to the discovery of the Watergate break-in. They're oblivious to this of course. They're oblivious to pretty much everything. But when G. Gordon Liddy, who saw the girls at the Watergate, sees them again as they take a White House tour he's afraid they might know something. Soon the girls are meeting President Nixon himself and they find themselves appointed official White House dog-walkers so that the administration can keep an eye on them. But they end up seeing more things they shouldn't see and hearing more things they shouldn't hear. And ultimately they bring down a presidency. All along the way the laughs come fast and furious.Dumb though they are it's impossible not to love Betsy and Arlene. Dunst is terrific with her portrayal of the bubbly, flighty, relentlessly charming Betsy. Arlene is slightly more grounded than Betsy (everything's relative) so Williams doesn't have as showy a part to play as Dunst does. But she's very good too. All the supporting players are spot-on as they bring real-life Watergate figures to comedic life. Dan Hedaya's a great, funny Nixon.

The film Miracle on 34th Street (1947) directed by George Seaton and starring Maureen O'Hara as Doris Walker, John Payne as Fred Gailey, Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle, and an innocent nine year old Natalie Wood as Susan Walker, delivers this timeless and poignant message in a holiday film which is relevant 365 days a year. Set in New York City, Doris as the parade manager for the R.H. Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, finds herself in a predicament where she hires a likable old man off the street named Kris Kringle with his white flowing beard to play Santa in the parade and eventually in the toy department of Macy's flagship store. Doris, bitter after being divorced after the birth of Susan, has raised her daughter in a world void of any fairy tales which has stifled Susan's imagination. It is Fred Gailey, an aspiring lawyer, who takes on the responsibility to show both Doris and Susan that they must have conviction and trust in something, for Faith is believing in things when common sense tells you not to. It is Kris, whom breaks down the walls that Doris has built around herself and Susan, and allows them both to see that there are people and things in this world that are deserving of their faith. As in It's A Wonderful Life (1946) the Frank Capra film where George Baily must have faith that he can make the world better than Mr. Potter would have it, Miracle on 34th Street tells us that we are whom we believe we are, and with that belief unlocks a magnificent power within each of us. The movie delivers a powerful message on faith, but also broaches the subject of commercialism, one of the many bad 'ism's in the world today and how it had affected the spirit of the Christmas season even some sixty plus years ago. Miracle on 34th Street is a heartwarming story of faith that is as relevant to viewers in today as it was in 1947 when it was released. Viewers should heed its message that faith empowers us and that it is incumbent upon each of us to make the world in which we live a better place, not just during the Christmas holiday, but each and every day of the year.

It didn't make the cut at all for the original compilation in 1997, so even before seeing the picture, I had to wonder what might have affected movie critics in the intervening decade to reach this conclusion. I usually line up with the majority in most cases, but I have to admit, I don't quite get it with this picture. I found it entertaining enough on occasion, but I never got the sense that it was one of the great comedy classics of all time the way it's heralded on the DVD sleeve. I don't think the Civil War lends itself much to comedy, so right there my expectations were greatly reduced. Keaton's somber demeanor and generally stone faced disposition don't help. On the flip side, I wouldn't have expected slapstick to move the story along either, so at least I wasn't disappointed in that regard.What I DID enjoy were some rather offbeat moments that showed genuine creativity. When Johnnie Gray (Keaton) dejectedly considered his rejection by the Confederate Army, and pondered his situation while sitting on the train's connecting rod, the resulting visual was pure genius. The up and down motion lent a truly surreal juxtaposition to Johnnie's thoughtful reverie, and was one of the highlights of the picture for me.The other significant scene that gave me pause was when The Texas collapsed on the burning Rock River Bridge. For starters, I found it unbelievable that a wooden bridge could possibly be constructed strong enough to support a locomotive. Then I came to learn that the scene was the most expensive ever made for a silent film, and I have to give Keaton credit for going out on that kind of a limb - unbelievable.Oh yes, and I can't forget the sequence where Keaton's marksmanship is dead on when he makes contact with the rail tie blocking the train tracks, flipping it out of the way with a well timed throw of his own. Could that have possibly been done in one take? In a pre-CGI world, it's difficult to imagine how stunts like these could have been performed, particularly by an actor who had no recourse but to do his own. For that, Keaton deserves accolades.In between all this clever film making however, I just wasn't inspired. The central plot element doesn't hold up for me - if Johnnie Gray was rejected as a volunteer, why wasn't he simply told the reason why. One could argue that then, you wouldn't have a picture, but for me it left the story on a shaky footing. If Johnnie was more valuable as a train engineer than a soldier, the picture might have taken a different approach, but the rest of the elements could have remained the same and he still would have come out a hero. Maybe I'm second guessing a master, but that's what I come away with.Conclusion - if this movie didn't make AFI's Top 100 Film List in 1997, I don't understand what might have occurred in the intervening years to suddenly have film critics vault it into the Top 20. At the same time, Chaplin's City Lights, in my estimation a superior silent film, fell OFF the list, while The Gold Rush moved up a few notches.

There's a bit of comedy, horror, thriller, mystery and adventure, all spiced up with surrealism and outstanding cinematography.It's amazing how well the movie builds its (very believable) post- apocalyptic universe, where people are doing everything to survive. Literally everything. Well, except one character! (Watch it to understand!)The actors do they job splendidly, every character is built up flawlessly having their own personalities and features, making all of them extremely interesting, even if some of them are not involved with the main plot. Each of the tenants of Delicatessen have their own very weird quirks that make them stand out on their own, without wasting even one scene with pointless content. The movie is entertaining through every shot.The music is amazing as well, portraying the accordion french music outstandingly which also gives the movie a whole lot of personality and character. It just fits perfectly.Photography is top notch, with the tones of brown \/ yellow and green giving a very weird, often dark, oppressive or just downright surreal feeling.Overall, this is one hell of a movie. Excellent from the beginning to the end. Some of the scenes here are just so memorable you will be wanting to watch them over and over... You'll fall in love with each characters' quirks, and you will laugh, cringe and think throughout the whole experience.Delicatessen should be watched by everyone.Flawless 10 out of 10.

Speaking as a 100 percent Kiwi I like so many thousands of other New Zealanders knew the world stage was beckoning after the release of this classic,in New Zealand we knew this movie simply as Brain Dead although the title was changed for American and overseas audiences I can tell you not many directors say a handful have ever dared to be so graphic on the big screen,yet Peter Jackson did so and the world took notice,read a few of the reviews from people who have seen this movie and you can tell that even now it continues to delight and thrill. In its release the faces of so many well known New Zealand actors,mostly from our television screens showing up to be either torn apart or to have their hearts ripped from their chest was such a hoot,audiences were howling in the theatres plus with a dought 'Brain Dead' contains probably the finest and funniest moment in cinema history of a priest showing what other skills he has apart from being able to hold mass every Sunday,and his now classic line I Kick Arse For The Lord had us all rolling in the isles.

The first killing takes place in Chicago were Bill in a fit of rage accidentally kills his factory foremen. Racing home, Bill, Abby, and Linda, all leave the city on a train headed for Texas. They eventually get a job on a farm, owned by a deathly ill farmer. Bill convinces Abby to marry the farmer, expecting him to die soon, and Abby to inherit everything. Of course nothing goes as planned, the farmer remains stable, and Abby begins to fall in love with him. Though Abby, Bill, and Linda all pretended to be siblings as they traveled to Texas, the obvious more than familial bond between Bill and Abby, have some questioning the exact nature of their bond. As Abby falls deeper and deeper and love with her husband, the gossip of some farm workers has him questioning the strong bond between his wife and her supposed brother, it seems ironic to me that the only time the farmer\/husband sees any damning evidence, with his own eyes, is the night that Abby goes to Bill and tells him she can no longer see him because she is in love with her new husband\/farmer. As the husband goes after Bill with a gun, Bill once again kills a man, whether accident or not is hard to tell. He uproots his sister and former girlfriend as they once more go on the run, for something they cannot control. Though Abby claims to love her new husband, the very fact that she left with Bill before he ever even told Abby why they need to leave, proves that Abby still had feelings for Bill. Abby didn't know when she left that her husband was dead, so if part, she had to choose between her husband and her former lover, and she choose her former lover.
