Die Hard set the bar for all action films made during the last ten years.  The 80's brought us all kinds of invincible action heroes, Rambo, Arnie and Chuck to name a few.  These guys blew everything up and killed small countries worth of stunt men to boot...thus defining 'mindless entertainment'.  Die Hard is just a different type of action film.  The filmmakers were so brilliant, they made this a movie for almost everyone, since it has elements of action, suspense, comic relief, likeable characters and a loved one in danger\/romance.  Also, in my opinion, the thing that makes this movie so awesome is Bruce Willis as John McClane.  John is by no means a superhero, he is an average joe cop, an ordinary man who happens to get himself into an extraordinary situation, and happens to come out on top.  The audience can really relate to him, see his pain, feel his futility and relish in his small victories (pulling the fire alarm, finding the cigarettes, writing that humorous message on the terrorist's body).  The first time I saw Die Hard, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, mainly b\\c anyone could have been in that situation.  In fact, this is one of the few movies that I have seen that I did not know what was going to happen to the main character at the end (of course, the first time I saw it was back in '88 when it was made), it is that suspenseful!  John McTiernan, director of Predator, another fine action flick, makes his finest movie ever.  And Alan Rickman...never have I seen such a PERFECT villan.  You despise Hans throughout the picture, yet, you can't help but love his charisma and charm.  Probably the first time ever, I agree with Roger Ebert in that Hans Gruber is the number one villan of all time in my book too.The action is 99% realistic, which is a rarity in an action flick.  You can almost count the bullets McClane fires as opposed to the bullets McClane has and it's pretty close.  I can't tell you how many movies have such hair ripping out of your skull mistakes with guns firing endless streams of ammo...Die Hard goes for pure realism and succeeds on all levels.  The first 1\\2 of the movie is pure suspense with action in it, then the last 1\\2 of the movie is pure action with suspense.  I just can't go on enough about how this movie makes you feel like you're there with Bruce Willis.  Good stuff, indeed.Why can't all actioners be like Die Hard?  Maybe it set such high standards that it is nigh impossible to top.  Though most didn't I liked Die Hard 2, though it was inferior in comparison to the original, and Die Hard With a Vengeance was good too, but I feel it was just a totally different kind of movie.  Mr. McTiernan, I applaud you for your contribution to the action genre.  Overall, an excellent movie.  Great story, plot and acting (hell, even Carl Winslow from Family Matters was great as Sgt. Al Powell), especially by Bruce Willis.  No wonder he became a huge star after this.  If you are one of the 3 people on this planet that haven't seen this flick yet, check it out, you will not be disapointed!  I give it my rare and coveted 10\/10 stars.

The first one was brilliant with its claustrophobic atmosphere and interesting characters that were very cool and made us feel a slight pang of loss as they got dispatched by the Predator.  The atmosphere was one of the key elements in the first movie, and it also gave Arnie a real challenge for a change (Whose blood didn't get pumping when Arnie pulled his 'Heart of Darkness' boyscout tricks in a all out fight with the Predator?).With all of that said, I'd like to say that I really like this movie.  Though there are some kinks in it as well as some bad dialogue, it is overall a pretty exciting movie.  I think it's safe to say that there is quite a bit more bloodshed this time around, which is good and bad.  It is good b\\c the action scenes are, simply put, awesome.  The war between the cops, the drug dealers and the Predator is always no-holds-barred, and though some of it is definitely Hollywood (I didn't know drug dealers had access to military weaponry?) there are a lot of realistic and also daring scenes (the subway shootout is definitely one of them).  The bad part of the excessive action is that there really isn't as much tension in the stalking process this time around.  Though, the first time I saw this, I was 10 years old and excitedly scared out of my wits by this film (and who wouldn't be?  The Predator is one of the most horrific killers ever to grace the silver screen), it doesn't quite have the build up when Arnie and his troops were being stalked in the jungle.  However, there are still quite a few tense moments as well as good scares in this film especially since the Predator is one frightening looking SOB!The best part that I loved about this movie was the way they portrayed the Predator.  When I was a kid, I just saw him as a mindless killing machine, but this now, after watching it recently, I saw how they portrayed him with an ethical code of honor with whom he kills and how (noone that he considers a real threat).  I notice his favorite method is to methodically kill everyone in a group, by any means necessary and then spare the bravest or toughest opponent for a one-on-one battle.  I think it was genious how the creature stalked Harrigan after witnessing his heroics in the beginning and how the movie never blatantly pointed it out (via someone to explain it all to the audience).  Definitely an interesting idea, which is rare for a sequel. The acting is pretty good, overall.  Danny Glover did a good job with his role as Harrigan as well as Bill Paxton (who, by the way, has one of the coolest pre-death scenes ever).  The dialogue lacks in some areas, but is made up with the solid directing and pulse pounding score by Alan Silvestri.  The script could have used some fine tuning, but the action never lets up and the movie, as a whole, is paced very well.  All in all, this is a worthy sequel to one of Arnie's best.  I don't understand why so many people on this board put up negative reviews for this movie, despite the flaws mentioned above.  I think the filmmakers put a little more thought into the average action film and it shows. Overall, this is an entertaining movie to watch on a quiet Friday night after work, with a nice cold beer and a pack of cigarettes at your disposal.

It keeps itself fresh and fluid, with a healthy dose of quirk to it. But I don't think it knows it's an apocalyptic vision.The film is about James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man from the future who goes back in time to stop the disaster that sent him underground from ever happening. But that's the simple way of describing it. The story is in a constant fight as to where to go with the plot, with probably a dozen sub-ideas that could turn into something. It's twisted and elaborate and almost impossible to explain to someone without them saying what?, but like Memento or The Matrix, when you watch it, it makes sense. But these plot developements are delicious fodder and keep it moving, allowing characters like Brad Pitt's pitch perfect sort-of-insane Jeffrey Bowen to take a bow (deserved that Oscar nod, BTW). The film's eccentricity takes hold of it. From the cinematography, to the accordian theme that playfully plays throughout the film, to the excessive production design that you know was made that way just because they felt like it (though it does help make the film what it is). And more often than not, the miserable conditions of Mr. Willis or whoever else may be feeling miserable at the time come across the screen in an almost tangible way.But behind the running cinematic joke, and the dark atmosphere of the film, it drives itself home where it must, and Bruce Willis, surprisingly, performs in what is probably one of his best roles. There's a frusterating and pitiful scene when he is desperately trying to make psychiatrists in 1990 accept the fact that he's from the future. They don't buy it, and he realizes that on top of his original task, he now has to find some tedious way to make these people believe him. Teamed with the talented Madeleine Stowe, the duo help create a touching relationship that grounds the film, as it turns out, on a deep personal level.The film doesn't necessarily scare you into thinking all this would happen in real life, we've heard it too much before, and I don't think that was the goal of the movie. But by the end of the film you've been given a healthy sense of dread for the poor characters in the film. How often does that happen?

I suppose I wanted to wait out the firestorm to speak. And there's so many wonderful comments here! Guess there's nothing like good old fashioned sex and ultraviolence to bring out the critic in people. Perhaps it's simply the divisive nature of Fight Club that will prove to be its' greatest contribution to the history of cinema.So where to begin? For sure, it's problematic. To use a cliche that just happens to be true for once, Fight Club is a multi-layered film that works on a myriad of different levels. Consequently, this makes it somewhat difficult to encapsulate in just a few sentences, much less pigeonhole into a specific genre. In addition, the film is clearly directed at a rather narrow audience. And by narrow audience, perhaps I should say willfully invisible, at least until recently. See, it's important to realize that despite all the controversy surrounding it, Fight Club, and its' inherent yet hidden messages, appeal mainly to a so-called seething core of young people (blah, blah, blah)that I propose we hereby rename the silent generation. It's a GenX film, kids! High art for latchkeys. And within this restless, hyperaware, unsatisfied group of individuals, there exists wildly divergent opinions about Fight Club. Yet it really only boils down to one central argument you either love it or you don't it. And if you love it, odds are it's because you get it, in one way or another. The film as a statement likely seems fairly obvious to you. But on the other hand, if you don't love this film, it's safe to assume that perhaps you might have missed the delivery of its' central themes. Fight Club is about isolation, desperation, faceless (and helpless) automation, and above all, the endlessly creepy idea of oppressive consumerism as an ideal for living. Truly pathetic. So if this is your kind of movie, it's likely that you not only comprehend it, but you are also luckily in possession of the black, spastic humor often required of one's self to coexist in harmony with today's modern, modern world. You're awake. You're aware. You're coping. Good for you.I love Fight Club, in case you couldn't guess. Not just the finished product, but the entire project. It's a brilliantly open-ended satire, with first-rate performances from all involved. Palahniuk writes like an angel (exterminating), Fincher directs with a keenly evil eye, and Norton's quickly becoming the finest actor of his generation, bar none. Helena Bonham Carter is great here too, deliciously playing it for all it's worth. Even Mr. Pitt-Aniston out does himself here. So is Fight Club all about raging, unchecked egos? Sure. Is it about disillusionment and the disenfranchised? You betcha. Is it about fascism? Misogynism? Deadbeat dads? Rampant closeted homosexuality? Any of the stupid names we call ourselves each night? Well...do you want it to be? Like the film says, you determine your own level of involvement here. Get it? There's more than a few kernels of truth floating around in Fight Club which, as we all know, shall set your a** free.A final note. If you're really into this movie (and you know who you are), I feel confident in saying that you're probably into darker, decidedly more intelligent things as well. You take Fight Club for what it is, a cleverly executed joke. Which makes dissecting it over and over again, especially with the uninitiated, somewhat redundant. So I apologize for this lengthy diatribe. But may I smugly suggest one final rule? The ninth, if you will. The 9th rule of Fight Club is fights will only occur between those evolved enough to handle it. Thank you.We are the dollars and cents.

Perhaps it's simply the divisive nature of Fight Club that will prove to be its' greatest contribution to the history of cinema.So where to begin? For sure, it's problematic. To use a cliche that just happens to be true for once, Fight Club is a multi-layered film that works on a myriad of different levels. Consequently, this makes it somewhat difficult to encapsulate in just a few sentences, much less pigeonhole into a specific genre. In addition, the film is clearly directed at a rather narrow audience. And by narrow audience, perhaps I should say willfully invisible, at least until recently. See, it's important to realize that despite all the controversy surrounding it, Fight Club, and its' inherent yet hidden messages, appeal mainly to a so-called seething core of young people (blah, blah, blah)that I propose we hereby rename the silent generation. It's a GenX film, kids! High art for latchkeys. And within this restless, hyperaware, unsatisfied group of individuals, there exists wildly divergent opinions about Fight Club. Yet it really only boils down to one central argument you either love it or you don't it. And if you love it, odds are it's because you get it, in one way or another. The film as a statement likely seems fairly obvious to you. But on the other hand, if you don't love this film, it's safe to assume that perhaps you might have missed the delivery of its' central themes. Fight Club is about isolation, desperation, faceless (and helpless) automation, and above all, the endlessly creepy idea of oppressive consumerism as an ideal for living. Truly pathetic. So if this is your kind of movie, it's likely that you not only comprehend it, but you are also luckily in possession of the black, spastic humor often required of one's self to coexist in harmony with today's modern, modern world. You're awake. You're aware. You're coping. Good for you.I love Fight Club, in case you couldn't guess. Not just the finished product, but the entire project. It's a brilliantly open-ended satire, with first-rate performances from all involved. Palahniuk writes like an angel (exterminating), Fincher directs with a keenly evil eye, and Norton's quickly becoming the finest actor of his generation, bar none. Helena Bonham Carter is great here too, deliciously playing it for all it's worth. Even Mr. Pitt-Aniston out does himself here. So is Fight Club all about raging, unchecked egos? Sure. Is it about disillusionment and the disenfranchised? You betcha. Is it about fascism? Misogynism? Deadbeat dads? Rampant closeted homosexuality? Any of the stupid names we call ourselves each night? Well...do you want it to be? Like the film says, you determine your own level of involvement here. Get it? There's more than a few kernels of truth floating around in Fight Club which, as we all know, shall set your a** free.A final note. If you're really into this movie (and you know who you are), I feel confident in saying that you're probably into darker, decidedly more intelligent things as well. You take Fight Club for what it is, a cleverly executed joke. Which makes dissecting it over and over again, especially with the uninitiated, somewhat redundant. So I apologize for this lengthy diatribe. But may I smugly suggest one final rule? The ninth, if you will. The 9th rule of Fight Club is fights will only occur between those evolved enough to handle it. Thank you.We are the dollars and cents.

I have three words  for this film, minimal work possible. This contained the exact same stuff, only a little faster. This film had absolutely no need to be updated. Remakes rarely live up to the original. The only thing that would make a movie more modern is that they might do a little swearing, have modern clothes, have modern cars, and show a little nudity. It does not reflect the story. Hitchcock's unique style was copied poorly, some was removed, and other stuff was done to make it look like Hitchcock. Hitchcock's unique style with mirrors was copied poorly. The style with doubles was removed. Hitchcock intended for Sam and Norman to look like twins and to create the confusion, Van Sant got rid of that. He also got rid of Marion and Lila looking alike, which was also intentional of Hitchcock. The suspense style was copied poorly. On the mother's closet, Van Sant added a mirror, that made it look like Hitchcock. . I could say that if Hitchcock ever saw this movie, he would die again. This remake was pointless and an insult to the original. Psycho is the first movie of Hitchcock's bird series, which contains Psycho, The Birds, and Marnie. The original one was a masterpiece of Hitchcock. This one just goes and insults it like anything could be better than the original. Well, Gus Van Sant should stick with what he does best, dramas. Overall, I give this movie a 0 out of ten. This was completely pointless.

Kevin Spirtas should have at least been nominated for best actor, although Dustin Hoffman deserved the Oscar. But Lar Park-Lincoln's performace of Tina Shepard was far superior to that of Jodie Foster's in The Accused. She set the bar for female acting in horror films but comes short in setting it for acting altogether (that title goes to Shannon Koenig in Wash the Spider Out)Also, strong consideration should have been given to nominating this film for best picture. Besides the acting, which has not been topped by any movie before or after (with the exception of Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey), the special effects are fantastic. The special effects were so great I thought that the film could have been mistaken for Star Wars Episode 7! Director John Carl Buechler also gives us some of the greatest camera angles since Citizen Kane. This is a must see film. Rent it...no, BUY IT ON DVD. That is the only way you will see the film as Buechler intended it to be seen. WARNING Watch the first 6 Friday the 13th movies before you see this one. If you don't you may miss or not recognize some subplots from previous movies and at some times you may be completely lost. This movie definitely runs on all cylinders. 10\/10!!!

The main reason the film was made was for Victoria Andrews who unfortunately died before it was released in the cinema.
