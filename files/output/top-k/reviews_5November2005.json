After all, it's far and wide described as one of the best, if not *the* best film ever made. Frankly, I didn't see it.The first problem I had with The Seventh Seal was the acting. The knight, Death, and the squire were highlights, but the rest of the cast had an almost pantomime-like quality that is very, very distracting. In fact, this may not simply be an acting problem - many of the set-ups of the film are pretty pantomime there is a scene with the actors playing out a song involving a cock crowing while, behind the stage, another actor tries to seduce a girl, which is not only sonically grating but completely ludicrous. I tried to work out if it was intended to be satirical but it actually comes off more like the Benny Hill show. In another scene, in which one of the actors is made to dance like a bear on the table in an inn, the camera cuts to reaction shots of the crowd who burst into hysterical laughter in a completely non-spontaneous, false and bizarre manner. It just doesn't work.The second problem I had was the contrived nature of the situations the knight finds himself in at one point self-flaggelists walk into the village in a long procession waving incense and everyone kneels and weeps. This has been set up in advance by an explanation of who these flaggelists are. And, because of the set up, it, again, doesn't work. Similarly, when the troupe are in the woods towards the end of the film, they are faced with a character (who has previously been shown to be a *not very nice man*) with the plague. Why, other than to have the troupe look death in the face and make the terribly unsubtle point about whether forgiveness should be given to those about to die, is he in the woods miles from anywhere? Once again, it doesn't work.Every question the film is trying to pose is given its own scene, so that the whole story plays like a series of distinct vignettes linked only by the knight character and two or three characters who are obviously set up to take a fall later in the film. *However*, Bergman sets up the film as a linear progression between the knight's knowing he is going to die and his ultimate death. You can't have it both ways - you either go down the vignette route or you go the linear route. You can't have the scene in the bar, the flaggelists, the burning of the witch all supposedly happening in a linear fashion, since they are all a little too random to gel together.And, for me at least, the result of all this is that this is not a film that could ever be described as subtle. You see every question coming even before Bergman gives it its ten-minute moment of screen time. The only thought left in your mind is what weird contortion of the plot Bergman is going to put us through to get to that question. And, as a result, the film is very boring to watch. At times I found myself begging that Death would show up just to add a little spice. And that's without even mentioning how *excrutiating* the songs are....All in all, I'd say The Seventh Seal is very disappointing and I couldn't really recommend it. That said, though, any film that is rated so highly by so many people is always going to deserve at least a glance. It's clearly not trash.

Meanwhile, in the wake of a mob boss' mysterious disappearance, a menacing psychopath with a sick sense of humor has taken control of the gangs of Gothom, and he is the Joker (Nicholson). As Batman terrorizes criminals and the Joker terrorizes the public with a deadly laughing gas, photographer Vicki Vale (Basinger) tries to find the reasoning, as well as the identities behind both men. Review While its story could have been improved upon, and certain elements took away from the overall feel, Batman remains a great, imaginative movie that any fan or non-fan will enjoy. It is well done, creative, and most of all entertaining. Looking at the film and its predecessors, as well as the new series reboot Batman Begins, it is obvious that this movie had the perfect cast, the perfect look, the perfect feel, and it came out in the perfect time. Although many complain that this, as well as Batman Returns, are too dark and moody, I believe that it is exactly what Batman needs. Batman is a character driven by revenge and a certain piece of himself that is missing. He is the perfect example of an anti-hero, and his story is not at all campy and light. He is the Dark Knight, and he lives in Gothom City. Tim Burton does a great job at bringing Gothom City to life as well as making Batman a dark, Gothic story that truly has come to define the modern definition of the character and his allies in the comics. Jack Nicholson steals the show as the humorously psychotic Joker, a man who accidentally fell into a toxic chemical bath, coming out barely alive and with bleached skin, green hair, and a permanent grin with a wicked sense of humor to go with it. Even though he is evil, sick, and sadistic, you just have to love and enjoy the character. Nicholson makes a villain that we fear but we also can laugh with him, and that is the best kind of villain there is. Michael Keaton dons the cape and cowl as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and next to Christian Bale he remains the best Batman. His Batman is intimidating and strong, and a real hero who is also a tortured soul. He is constantly haunted, and he can not help but go out and fight crime. However, Keaton does not work as well as billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. He certainly isn't bad at the part, and it is very hard to go from a dark hero dressed as a bat to a billionaire playboy, but something is missing from his Bruce Wayne. That missing link, however, doesn't really effect the movie at all. Kim Basinger is the lead female this time around, and she does a great job in her role. Certainly, Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman in Batman Returns is much more interesting and seductive as a love interest, but Basinger's Vicki Vale is a suitable and likable character, who also shares some strong qualities. Many people complain about little aspects of the film that really don't matter in the overall feel of the film, and actually help this particular film. Many say the Joker's origins should not have been told, or Jack Nicholson wasn't tall enough, or that Batman's parents were killed by someone different, or that Vicki Vale wouldn't be let into the bat-cave, or even that Michael Keaton looks too much like a nerd to be Bruce Wayne, but when you're watching Batman you are brought into a different world where things like those don't really matter, and you are suspended in disbelief and quite entertained. The only problem that is actually noticeable is the fact that Prince performed several songs on soundtrack of the film, and when the Joker dances to them it really just makes you laugh at the movie. It was made in the 80's, I should get over it, but somehow I just don't see Prince fitting into the dark story of Batman. However, the musical score by Danny Elfman is just superb, and to this day his scores in Batman and Batman Returns are some of the most impressive works in a major motion picture, and they are the best the Batman series has to offer overall. If you're looking for a fun time where you can sit back, enjoy a well made movie, and appreciate a different type of superhero, then go watch Batman. Tim Burton and the crew did a magnificent job here, and his first two movies are the best out of the first four Batman films. If you like this movie, you may want to look at Batman Returns which is more a Tim Burton type movie than this but is a great sequel that doesn't rely on the success of this movie. Batman Forever is also good, not as good as the first two films but it explores some of the psychology of Batman\/Bruce Wayne, which is nice to see. Skip Batman & Robin, because if you like the feel of 1989's Batman then you will hate that one. You will also probably enjoy Batman Begins, and even though many say 'You can't like both Batman and Batman Begins' there is no reason not to like them both. They are different, but at the same time they are both great movies. So remember, watch Batman and put a 'smile' on.

However I believe that the philosophic themes in Carnival of Souls make this film the more important of the two. Both Welles and Harvey utilized European techniques and styles and did use some experimentalism. Both films deal with death. Kane starts with death and reviews a man's life. Carnival of Souls starts with death but instead of reviewing the main characters life shows us the psychological struggle during and following the moment of death. Though we do not see Mary Henry's character revealed through her past experiences(like Kane)-we do see her character revealed through the way she deals with her new situation and journey of discovery. This is more difficult to do I believe. While Kane may seem slickly scripted-and the dialog is- a script is also a story and here is where Carnival of Souls truly breaks new ground. There have been screenplays dealing with the afterlife and the discovery of that fact by the story's characters prior to Carnival of Souls. However no other movie had ever presented the the main character as invisible to the world-someone who cannot be seen or heard. The main character is brought out of this state by the sound of nature- a bird singing. This story idea was most recently employed (and employed well) in the film The Sixth Sense. Although the use of the walking dead was not new in 1960( considering all the prior zombie films) this is the first time the walking dead idea has been used in a purely ghostly- haunting fashion. The zombies are imagined (or are they) in this film. They are more symbolic characters than horror types. Lastly this film deals with the subject of human alienation which is rarely dealt with in film. This film takes the alienation perspective to such an degree that is is impossible to think of a film that has ever created the mood, rationale, psychological atmosphere, and physical experiences of human alienation. I have seen interviews with the writer of Carnival of Souls-John Clifford. He states in his interviews that people are constantly asking how he came up with the ideas presented in this movie. He says he can't remember how he came up with these ideas.I first saw this movie in 1969\/1970 on late night TV. The scenes where Mary Henry goes into the changing booth at a department store and then hears the dinging bell of store operations and is then changed and enters another world is a cinematic moment that I was never able to forget. Although I did forget the name of the movie, twenty years later the film was released on video and I remember looking at the video box and thinking that this might be that movie where the woman walks out of the water after a car accident(it is the picture on the cover of the box). I began watching and could see this was the movie I had seen 20 years ago. I watched the entire movie and then began to study it. All aspects of this film are superb-all the actors, the camera operator, the musician, the lighting engineer, the sound engineers(the overdub is perfect for that section of the film-perhaps an accident),sound editors, film editors, the director and producer( Harvey was an industrial filmmaker of merit) and without question the screenwriter (John Clifford). The fact that the style and theme of the film was out of synch for times (early 1960's) only adds to it's worth. The idea was given to Harvey to make this film by the location itself (according to him) and he did his job well in arranging and choosing the proper writer and talents to carry out the project. The feel and mood and atmosphere are rarely seen in films today. The groundbreaking ideas of the film(devoid of socio-political comment) brings the main theme to an incredibly basic level which all persons can appreciate.

I have seen interviews with the writer of Carnival of Souls-John Clifford. He states in his interviews that people are constantly asking how he came up with the ideas presented in this movie. He says he can't remember how he came up with these ideas.I first saw this movie in 1969\/1970 on late night TV. The scenes where Mary Henry goes into the changing booth at a department store and then hears the dinging bell of store operations and is then changed and enters another world is a cinematic moment that I was never able to forget. Although I did forget the name of the movie, twenty years later the film was released on video and I remember looking at the video box and thinking that this might be that movie where the woman walks out of the water after a car accident(it is the picture on the cover of the box). I began watching and could see this was the movie I had seen 20 years ago. I watched the entire movie and then began to study it. All aspects of this film are superb-all the actors, the camera operator, the musician, the lighting engineer, the sound engineers(the overdub is perfect for that section of the film-perhaps an accident),sound editors, film editors, the director and producer( Harvey was an industrial filmmaker of merit) and without question the screenwriter (John Clifford). The fact that the style and theme of the film was out of synch for times (early 1960's) only adds to it's worth. The idea was given to Harvey to make this film by the location itself (according to him) and he did his job well in arranging and choosing the proper writer and talents to carry out the project. The feel and mood and atmosphere are rarely seen in films today. The groundbreaking ideas of the film(devoid of socio-political comment) brings the main theme to an incredibly basic level which all persons can appreciate.

However I believe that the philosophic themes in Carnival of Souls make this film the more important of the two. Both Welles and Harvey utilized European techniques and styles and did use some experimentalism. Both films deal with death. Kane starts with death and reviews a man's life. Carnival of Souls starts with death but instead of reviewing the main characters life shows us the psychological struggle during and following the moment of death. Though we do not see Mary Henry's character revealed through her past experiences(like Kane)-we do see her character revealed through the way she deals with her new situation and journey of discovery. This is more difficult to do I believe. While Kane may seem slickly scripted-and the dialog is- a script is also a story and here is where Carnival of Souls truly breaks new ground. There have been screenplays dealing with the afterlife and the discovery of that fact by the story's characters prior to Carnival of Souls. However no other movie had ever presented the the main character as invisible to the world-someone who cannot be seen or heard. The main character is brought out of this state by the sound of nature- a bird singing. This story idea was most recently employed (and employed well) in the film The Sixth Sense. Although the use of the walking dead was not new in 1960( considering all the prior zombie films) this is the first time the walking dead idea has been used in a purely ghostly- haunting fashion. The zombies are imagined (or are they) in this film. They are more symbolic characters than horror types.

I finally saw it on American Movie Classics last night, so I could judge it for myself. I have to make allowances for possible censorship and being chopped up so they could stick in commercials, but in the end I have to agree that this movie is phenomenally bad. What makes it worse is that here and there are some pretty effective individual film special effects, sound effects, bits of stage business and delivered lines that DO hit the mark, and these glints of potential hint at a really unsettling and creepy apocalyptic thriller that could have left the viewer shaken and afraid. But someone - Boorman the director, or the writer, or someone - couldn't keep control of the material, or make the script work the way it was supposed to, and the film will veer from brain-numbingly stupid to jolting and unnerving and back to stupid and overblown several times in a given scene. That's even more exhausting and irritating than if the movie just sucks. Burton is simultaneously the best and worst thing in this film. He's the best thing because he IS Richard Burton, and even his hammiest, most scene-chewing performances are worth watching in any film he happens to be in. In this case, Burton works overtime to give his character all the gravitas and portent he needs to carry the film. But he's the worst thing in the film because, well, the lines he has to deliver and the scenes he has to participate in are just plain ludicrous. It hurts me to see Burton like this...I hope he managed to pay off his condominium (or whatever financial need he had for this paycheck), because it's pretty obvious that he despises what he is doing in this film. As for the other principle, Linda Blair...well, it's almost impossible to be fair to Blair regarding this movie. She can't really act, but the camera lends a certain hypnotic quality to her face in this movie, and Boorman exploits it for all he can. I think she tried hard to give Boorman what he wanted, but unfortunately what he wanted was for her to alternate Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm with Pea Soup Vomiting Biker Slut From Hell, and the results are basically unwatchable. I mean, we are talking Hayden-in-Attack-Of-the-Clones unwatchable. Blair was far better suited as a post-pubescent actress to the kind of Roller Boogie\/Women in Cages things she did later,or as walk-on roles as herself, and I can only hope she eventually found happiness and contentment on the fringes of fame and celebrity. This is said to be one of the most expensive films ever made for its time, and in E2Heretic's defense, most of the money is there on the screen. The African scenes are photographed and lit perfectly, detailed, and obsessively put together... they must have been murder to stage and shoot. The apocalyptic scenes (locust attacks, etc) are not especially convincing (especially to modern eyes accustomed to millions of dollars in CGI eye-candy) but there are plenty of them and the soundtrack and sound design work strenuously to convince the viewer that Nasty Things are going on here. In fact, I'd argue that the sound design is possibly the best thing about Heretic, and if it hadn't been so meticulous and suitable, the movie would have been even less watchable than it is now. Heretic is a mess, no doubt about it, in the way that only a great director working from a horrible script (and with his head jammed firmly up his own rectum ) can make it. It's worth seeing once for Burton and Blair, and a weird role by James Earl Jones. But don't go out of your way to see it and DON'T, under any circumstance pay more than $5 to purchase, and then only on DVD with all the trimmings and extras.

The acting was especially shocking and horrific, Jeremy Irons's acting was very bad, from this film alone you'd think he was an amateur and had never made a good film in his life but the truth is, aside of this farce he's a great actor, which is why it was really shocking to see him camp it up as the way over the top villain. Anyone who praises this rubbish as a good film needs their head examined, and I personally thought even the plethora of cgi effects were pretty lame!

Taking place at a restaurant in which Albert and Georgina Spica (expertly played by Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren) dine day in, day out, always accompanied by Spica's entourage of yes-men (among them a young Tim Roth), Albert indulges in the excesses of food and berates everyone around him, including his mutely suffering wife.The first scene -- as a matter of fact -- establishes the entire mood of the film. Albert Spica is seen outrageously humiliating a naked man outside the restaurant as the overwhelming stench of decay and the presence of wild dogs linger on. Employees from the restaurant shortly come and hose the man from the excrement he has been slathered in. What it is saying is, we are entering a world of moral and spiritual decay in which Those In Power abuse their positions to the extreme, as the observers only stand by and go on with their business.These bystanders are the people who work at the restaurant. Among them is the Cook, played by Richard Bohringer, who faithfully serves Spica and his yes-men meal after meal and makes no opinion as they loudly banter about the difference between this dish and that dish -- essentially saying nothing worthwhile --, while all the time Georgina silently eats on, almost like a non-entity. That is, until she notices a quiet, intellectual-looking man, reading a book. This man is Michael, the Lover, played by Alan Howard, a man who does not talk but oozes intelligence. And it's this element which attracts Georgina's eye... and then more.It's clear where Peter Greenaway is going to take us, the viewer. The scenes involving the urgent, dangerous lovemaking between Michael and Georgina are unspeakably intense, even in later scenes when they meet in the kitchen among the ever-present cooks and are getting more comfortable with themselves. Greenway's Spica becomes so completely menacing his presence overflows the screen. He commits acts of intolerable cruelty against anyone who stands in his way -- he is the Terror during the French Revolution, the Dictator from every country who has had one who will torture those who give of even a slight resistance. And once Georgina's and Michael's clandestine affair is brought to light, needless to say, all hell breaks loose and Greenway sets the stage for his horrific, stomach-turning denouement.In Georgina, Helen Mirren has created a character that is deeply suffering, infinitely patient... and that makes her the more dangerous. That she has to go through so much pain and humiliation to make a 180 degree turn to cold, ruthless avenger makes her the ultimate heroine. Her foil to Albert -- an essentially one-note role -- also serves his undoing. Alan Howard communicates so much as well in his almost silent role, and in a revelatory note, I'll say this their nude scene is one that is rife in sensuality and proves that one doesn't need Hollywood hard-bodies to make an erotic scene work.THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER is not a movie for all tastes -- pun intended. However, it's one of the most avant-garde, intelligent stories that demands to be seen numerous times. I admire the lavish scenery Greenaway created for each area of the restaurant because it gives this extremely modern film a Renaissance feel and elevates its inherent symbolism.

Guy Pearce was nailed for his American accent but I don't know why. He comes across as somebody whose regional dialect was subject to some New York City gestation. Let's give him some credit. The Brits used to stick to Southern accents (viz., Scarlett O'Hara, Blanche DuBois) but have lately become more discriminating (viz., Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York). It's a big improvement over the generic American dialect that Russel Crowe and Charlize Theron come up with.Where was I? Oh, yes. The combat scenes are well done. They owe a great deal to Saving Private Ryan of course. Every combat scene in every movie for the next decade or so will owe a lot to Private Ryan, in particular the abundance of bloody wounds and the sound of bullets clanking off metal surfaces.The locations are well chosen and the photography is up to professional par.If there is a weakness it's in the script. The Tommy Lee Jones character is presented to us as a drunk or a former drunk, but nothing comes of it. By the end he seems to have found the kind of redemption that all drunks find at the end of uplifting movies, except for Paul Newman in The Verdict, who loses faith in friendship even as he finds redemption in good deeds. And he sensibly keeps on drinking.There's a fight between the two macho Marines -- Jones and Jackson -- the point of which eludes me. We really don't need a brawl between two middle-aged men to pump up the middle section of the film.The courtroom scene reeks of drama largely because the director has decided it should. People stand up in the witness box and shout angrily at the pesky prosecutor and admit things they shouldn't just because they're enraged. And there is a touching scene at the end, in which Jackson and a former enemy exchange salutes, but it's corny and there is triumphant music swelling in the background, all by the numbers.I should mention something else that became more clear on second viewing. At the beginning of The Green Berets -- an atrocious John Wayne movie about Vietnam -- a civilian reporter seems to accuse Col. Wayne of militarism. You been in Vietnam?, asks Wayne. No. Ah-HUH, comments Wayne dismissively. A sharp contrast is thereby drawn between the characters we are to meet -- those who have been there and those who have not. A similar distinction is made in this movie, and in the most simple-minded way. There are three strata. From the top downward (1) the heroic men who have been in combat; (2) the well-meaning Marines who haven't; and (3) the lying, perjuring, evidence-destroying suits who have no principles and are out only to further their own careers. Yet, it's a thought-provoking mature movie in a way that, say, A Few Good Men was simply not. I would give Saving Private Ryan a higher rank because of its originality. Nothing in The Rules of Engagement is particularly clear cut. Jackson's character does order his men to fire on civilians, including women and kids, who are firing at him, and the firing from the crowd is covered up by the politicians who want to bury the guy so that the good old USA doesn't have to take the blame for all those deaths. But Jackson is given a good line. That's not murder. It's COMBAT. Sometimes these days it gets a little difficult to distinguish combat from murder, and one of the reasons this movie may irritate some viewers is that the military comes off as both brave and honorable, if not exactly flawless. These Marines are gung ho, reasonably intelligent, and capable of remorse. I would guess there are many people who prefer the kind of idiot played by Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, a sadistic, perjuring, stupid, male chauvinist pig. A Few Good Men is a more satisfying movie if you're into self righteousness and anti-militarism.Marines and military people in general tend towards a certain set of common attitudes but there is as much diversity among them as in any other subculture, except maybe devotees of panjandrums of the more extreme stripe. The Marines whom I taught at Camp Lejeune were as bright, curious, and industrious as any students at the nearby University of North Carolina.We all know what we would have done if we'd been Jack Nicholson. We wouldn't have done what he did. We'd have been legal and moral. But this movie asks a different question. What would we have done if we'd been in Jackson's boots? No easy answers there, though the ending kind of betrays the message that the movie itself carries.I should add that it seems to be rare to hang anybody out to dry for making mistakes in combat. A week before this note was entered, Doctors Without Borders accused US forces of deliberately attacking its hospital in Afghanistan, as a top US commander said the deadly air strikes were a mistake. The hospital, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, claims its medical facility in Kunduz was deliberately bombed three days ago, killing at least 22 people. General John Campbell said he could not provide more details about what happened, including who may have failed to follow procedures for avoiding attacks on hospitals. He said he must await the outcome of multiple investigations. Await the outcome of multiple investigation.

The story of Jason James Richter's character trying to escape from a life of crime and missing prospects is way beyond the average. The growing affection for Willy is not even stereotyped or clichéd. It's a genuine bond that focuses on two outcast characters who slowly but surely come to experience true friendship and the value of trust. Jason's performance really appealed to me when I saw this movie as a kid. It is a sincere depiction of friendship, of a way out, of fighting for your values against all odds and of never giving up. Right, I'm grown up now, but this is one of the movies of my childhood I'd like to watch again, and I'm sure I'd enjoy it almost as much as back then. Jason James had very few acting appearances, but the Free Willy series assured him his place in movie history. His entire performance in here is sincere and straight, he doesn't laugh nor smile if it wasn't just natural in the specific sequences. His facial expressions and body language fit into the total frame as well. The story has some profoundly human themes to it. I can't help it, I think this one is both entertaining and deep, dealing with emotions and prospects of life, with integrity and courage in the face of danger.

I loved The Wolf Man when I watched it, and when I finally saw An American Werewolf in London in fourth grade, it became one of my favorite films. There was only one werewolf movie I'd never seen The Howling.I could have watched it, mind you. But I put it off. Because although I am fascinated with the werewolf legend, it just so happens that the animal I fear the most ... is wolves. I thought The Howling looked extremely scary, so I put off watching - until this Halloween, when I received it for a gift. So, at last, I sat down and watched the last major werewolf film I needed to see.The film stars Dee Wallace as a popular Los Angeles newswoman who is involved in a near-fatal incident with a serial killer (Robert Picardo). A respected psychiatrist (Robert Macnee) sends her to a rehabilitation center called The Colony, located in the Californian forest. Wallace believes there's something weird about the place as soon as she arrives - but once she begins to hear the howling, she believes there may be something deadly lurking in the forest ...The only Joe Dante films I'd seen before watching this were Gremlins and Gremlins 2 The New Batch, both of which I enjoyed very much. Dante directs this film with an obvious love of the genre and of the classic horror films. It really enhances the movie. The cast is good, but the only two performances which really stuck out to me were that of Patrick Macnee and particularly John Carradine. I thought it would've been nice to see Carradine's part expanded. I also thought it was good to see Dick Miller, though I couldn't place what else I'd seen him in at first.I thought that half of the time, Pino Donaggio's soundtrack was good, and the other half of the time I thought they made the film seem hokey. I loved the film's ending tune, though.The highlight of the film is indisputably the spectacular special effects by Rob Bottin. The scene where Robert Picardo transforms into a werewolf has been rivaled only by the transformation in An American Werewolf in London, and The Howling's transformation may be even better. The effects really made the film for me.The film's script was nothing really original, and the movie was at times quite clichéd. But that's part of the fun of it. All in all, The Howling was not as scary as I expected it to be, but I enjoyed it very much and would gladly watch it again, if only for the special effects. Werewolf aficionados and horror movie lovers will have a howlin' good time.

Charles Boyer is effective as the vile husband. Bergman looks best in the beginning of he film with her hair down and smiling a lot. After that, it's the opposite. The last part of the movie, when Cotten starts to investigate, is very good and saves the film somewhat. My only question - concerning the story - is why the maids aren't found guilty of conspiring with Boyer since it appears they do so, especially in Angela Lansbury's case.Overall, too depressing to watch more than once.
