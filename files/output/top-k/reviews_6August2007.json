When these items were combined with truly excellent performances, such as Cage and Shue in Leaving Las Vegas, Figgis' has managed to produce a legitimately good movie. None of the above is true for TLoSI.First off, Mike Figgis might think his life is interesting, and perhaps it is, but his own telling of his sex life is dreadfully boring. At least he certainly makes it out to be that way. Sex is almost always a great topic for a movie (even when you show absolutely nothing graphic) because it is such an integral component of the human condition. And yet, in this movie, with all its handsome players, it's mind numbingly dull and extremely anti-erotic.I think possibly the biggest problem that plagues this movie is Figgis' own inability to identify or empathize with other people. This is noticeable in his writing and direction in other movies, but in those cases it appears intentional and provided an unflinching look at disturbing subject matter. This movie actually seems to shed some distressing light on his earlier work as it appears that his detached style of storytelling is, in fact, a flaw. In scene after scene, we treated to imagery that is supposed to evoke emotional understanding, yet the scenes are comprised simply of clichéd approximations of legitimately provoking imagery. It is not unlike watching a sociopath feign remorse or guilt; they might say all the right things and perform all the right actions, but it still comes across hollow and insincere.Now, take all the above and combine it with editing that is full of self aggrandizing nonsense. Soaring music lingers over a minute of watching an Alitalia jet on approach. A series of ridiculous Adam & Eve sequences that culminates in one of the few unintentionally hilarious moments where there is actual filmed urination and, in just one of a hundred disjointed scenes, a totally untalented Julian Sands spewing standard Hollywood token eco-nonsense. And yet, none of what I have written can convey just how awful this movie really is; avoid it at all costs.

In the narrative arts, they have inspired all kinds of stories, as their cosmology is so complex that can be used in almost everything, from moral fables to epic tales. Obviously, they have also inspired many horror stories, mainly because the three have a definitive personification of evil in the figure of the Devil, which makes an excellent villainous character due to its many different traits. Naturally, the Devil and its followers have been villains in horror films since almost the beginnings of cinema, however, it was during the decades of the 60s and 70s when three of the most influential horror movies about the Devil were made Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen.The Omen begins in Rome on June 6, 1966, when American ambassador Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) receives the news that his new son has been stillborn. Devastated by the news, Thorn worries about how will this affect his wife Katherine (Lee Remick), so when he is offered the chance to adopt a newborn baby whose mother died giving birth to him, he accepts and decides not to tell a word to his wife. Years go by and everything seems happy for the Thorn family, with Robert quickly ascending in the political arena while his son, named Damien (Harvey Stephens) grows up apparently normally. However, on Damien's fifth birthday, his young Nanny (Holly Palance) hangs herself mysteriously in front of everyone. This will be only the first of many strange events surrounding Damien, making Robert begin to suspect that there's something unnatural in his son.Written by David Seltzer, The Omen mixes drama, horror and suspense by mixing cleverly an apocalyptic theme with a concept that was very popular in horror stories during the 60s and the 70s the evil child. While obviously inspired by the success of The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby, Seltzer gives to his story a new angle closer in spirit to movies like Village of the Damned, as in The Omen, the kid is not a victim or a tool of the supernatural evil, but truly the embodiment of evil. Due to this, Seltzer wisely bases most of the movie's drama around the dilemma that consumes Damien's father, who can't help but see innocence in his beloved son, as well as in the consequences of his doubts and his search for answers. This serious approach, together with strong character development, give the film a powerful sense of realism, which in turn truly makes it a haunting experience.With The Omen, director Richard Donner had the first major success of his career, and it's not difficult to see why, as while Seltzer's script is truly inspired, credit should go to Donner as the man responsible for The Omen's overall style. Knowing that the strength of the script lays in the realism of its human drama, Donner keeps a restrained style in The Omen, and handles the supernatural themes with a subtle elegance that helps to create a haunting atmosphere of dread that fits nicely within the apocalyptic theme of the film. While all we see is a little child, Donner skillful use of Gilbert Taylor's cinematography and the eerie score by Jerry Goldsmith, makes it seem as if it was truly the beginning of the end of the world. Donner's directing of his cast also plays an instrumental role in this, as he brings out strong and realistic performances out of them.Leading the cast is Gregory Peck, delivering a terrific performance as U.S. ambassador Robert Thorn, the unsuspecting adoptive father of the Antichrist. As usual, Peck gives his character a lot of humanity, as well as his commanding presence. While Peck is initially a bit wooden in his performance, this kind of fits nicely in his role as an upcoming politician who must take the most difficult decision a father has to face. As Thorne's wife Katherine, Lee Remick is equally as effective as Peck, playing Damien's troubled mother with great realism. However, it is Billie Whitelaw who steals the movie as the sinister Mrs. Baylock, Damien's new nanny who is completely willing to do whatever is necessary to help Damien to rule the world. Whitelaw's performance is truly haunting, and while a bit over-the-top at times, she portrays one of the best horror villains of the 70s.It's pretty easy to criticize the many inconsistencies between the movie and the biblical sources that inspired its main plot, however, to label the film as pretentious or inaccurate in its portrayal of Christian imagery would be pretty ignorant and ultimately pointless, as The Omen never intends to be a representation of any biblical story or theological prophecy, as it's only a fictional tale of horror and suspense inspired by them. What truly can be criticized about the film are the small but numerous plot holes that appear from time to time through the film, certainly minor yet noticeable problems that could had been easily avoided with a bit more of care in the development of the script. The movie's extremely slow pace doesn't help in this, as while it allows Donner more development for his characters, it also makes the movie be a bit boring at times.It's difficult not to compare this movie to Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist, as the fact that The Omen was obviously inspired by those two masterpieces of horror is hard to ignore. But even when it may come as inferior when compared to those classics, The Omen still is one of the best horror films produced by a major studio during the 70s, thanks in part to the classy style Donner added to the film. It's true that The Omen hasn't aged well, but more than 30 years after its release, it remains a powerful and haunting experience. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" As the dominant faiths of the Western hemisphere, the Abrahamic religions (mainly Christianity and Judaism) have played an important role as source of inspiration for many art forms through the centuries.

How is it different from the run-of-the-mill action films? I don't think you'll find another action film, let alone action series that is as story driven as The Bourne films and in particular The Bourne Identity. A mystery begins to unfold right from the first scene and you're caught up in this world of Jason Bourne and you're discovering everything as he is discovering everything making you feel like you're right there with him and feeling empathy for his character while being shocked and riveted by his realization of what he is. The Bourne Identity is exotic and brilliantly filmed in such incredible European locations as France, Spain, Czech Republic, and Italy and if you think that doesn't make a difference...watch The Bourne Identity because the locations are something that really makes The Bourne Identity what it is. Add all this espionage and action together and they still find time to establish a meaningful and very powerful romance between Bourne and a woman he randomly meets and it's a relationship so significant that it remains a driving force in Bourne's life right up through the trilogy.Matt Damon has had some good roles, and has proved himself a very versatile actor but his role as Jason Bourne may stick with him forever because he does an incredible job capturing this cold blooded assassin with actual empathy and this strong, silent, deadly, and yet compassionate person. His performance is amazing and Bourne is movie history. Franka Potente plays the girl in the wrong place at the wrong time Marie Kreutz, who becomes romantically involved with Bourne. I don't find Potente beautiful in the typical Hollywood sense and in fact she's almost kind of plain compared to some starlets and yet that's what makes her and Damon have incredible chemistry and a very real romance together. She also blends in with her surroundings and has this very unique and exotic European look (she is German by heritage.) Chris Cooper is brilliant as the angry, and forceful C.I.A. villain Alexander Conklin who is desperate to get rid of Bourne before it uncovers his involvement with an undercover assassin project. Equally as brilliant is Brian Cox as Conklin's co-conspirator. Julia Stiles makes a small cameo entrance into the series as Logistics expert Nicky and although she doesn't have a big role, she becomes significant to the cast and is often tied to the series. Also watch for Clive Owen in a small role as assassin sent to kill Bourne in the English Country side.The Bourne Identity tells it's story and doesn't apologize for not being the typical blow everything up, non stop action type of film but it certainly has it's share of action and some incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Damon's Bourne is a far more brilliant hero and doesn't resort to simply using a gun but rather is always a step or two or five ahead of his foes and is so well trained it's just thrilling to watch him get out of every situation. When it comes down to it he can kick some serious ass and the fight scenes are incredible and his abilities are unparalleled making this just an incredible action, spy thriller with an intense story that starts a great mystery that spans three films. With each installment of The Bourne films they get better and better but this is where it all starts and it's a stone cold classic and a must see for anyone who thinks they know the spy genre because this revolutionized it. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Bourne Identity in many ways revolutionized the expectations of people that love spy films.

A mystery begins to unfold right from the first scene and you're caught up in this world of Jason Bourne and you're discovering everything as he is discovering everything making you feel like you're right there with him and feeling empathy for his character while being shocked and riveted by his realization of what he is. The Bourne Identity is exotic and brilliantly filmed in such incredible European locations as France, Spain, Czech Republic, and Italy and if you think that doesn't make a difference...watch The Bourne Identity because the locations are something that really makes The Bourne Identity what it is. Add all this espionage and action together and they still find time to establish a meaningful and very powerful romance between Bourne and a woman he randomly meets and it's a relationship so significant that it remains a driving force in Bourne's life right up through the trilogy.Matt Damon has had some good roles, and has proved himself a very versatile actor but his role as Jason Bourne may stick with him forever because he does an incredible job capturing this cold blooded assassin with actual empathy and this strong, silent, deadly, and yet compassionate person. His performance is amazing and Bourne is movie history. Franka Potente plays the girl in the wrong place at the wrong time Marie Kreutz, who becomes romantically involved with Bourne. I don't find Potente beautiful in the typical Hollywood sense and in fact she's almost kind of plain compared to some starlets and yet that's what makes her and Damon have incredible chemistry and a very real romance together. She also blends in with her surroundings and has this very unique and exotic European look (she is German by heritage.) Chris Cooper is brilliant as the angry, and forceful C.I.A. villain Alexander Conklin who is desperate to get rid of Bourne before it uncovers his involvement with an undercover assassin project. Equally as brilliant is Brian Cox as Conklin's co-conspirator. Julia Stiles makes a small cameo entrance into the series as Logistics expert Nicky and although she doesn't have a big role, she becomes significant to the cast and is often tied to the series. Also watch for Clive Owen in a small role as assassin sent to kill Bourne in the English Country side.The Bourne Identity tells it's story and doesn't apologize for not being the typical blow everything up, non stop action type of film but it certainly has it's share of action and some incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Damon's Bourne is a far more brilliant hero and doesn't resort to simply using a gun but rather is always a step or two or five ahead of his foes and is so well trained it's just thrilling to watch him get out of every situation. When it comes down to it he can kick some serious ass and the fight scenes are incredible and his abilities are unparalleled making this just an incredible action, spy thriller with an intense story that starts a great mystery that spans three films. With each installment of The Bourne films they get better and better but this is where it all starts and it's a stone cold classic and a must see for anyone who thinks they know the spy genre because this revolutionized it. 8.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"6 August 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Bourne Identity in many ways revolutionized the expectations of people that love spy films.

As long as you can get past the dated hairstyles and garish fashions you will find a really entertaining film about big business. The type of film Wall Street wanted to be but wasn't. Where that film had Michael Douglas playing an absurd caricature for a villain, Working Girl not only has a more realistic villain, but a sympathetic figure at the centre that you really want to see get ahead.Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith) is a put-upon secretary with business sense, but she's surrounded by (male) colleagues that don't take her seriously. Working for men gets Tess nowhere, so she tries her luck with a woman instead. Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) is the department head of a Wall Street mergers & acquisitions firm. And she assures Tess its a two-way street on her team. Katharine can help Tess climb the ladder of success.Tess may be 30 years old, but with her airy voice, clanking bracelets and scary looking hair, she often gives the impression of being a little girl trying to play in an adult's world. Also it doesn't occur to her that Katharine may not be looking out for Tess's best interests.When Tess brings a lucrative idea to Katharine, she's crushed when she discovers that Katharine has no intention of letting a lowly secretary profit from it. She steals the idea, but before she can act upon it she breaks her leg in a skiing accident. Tess takes her absence as an opportunity to get ahead by claiming she is the head of her department, and tries to get her idea up and ready to fly.Working Girl works because its not just aimed squarely at the level of a comedy. There are plenty of laughs to be had. But there is a serious, dramatic thrust that helps the film get its points across. Because its quite a dangerous charade Tess is playing. And you know, that at any moment she could get caught. The fact you don't want that to happen is proof the film is working.Tess McGill is arguably the best character Melanie Griffith has ever played. She's never been this good in any other film. Her acting is perfectly paced and beautifully delivered. She goes from a naive, pathetic trusting fool (her words) to a committed, astute and assured businesswoman with total conviction. Her change in hairstyles is striking too. But convincing!There's a fine ensemble cast too. Sigourney Weaver gives one of her finest performances to date. Her role as the bitchy, power-hungry Katharine is really quite wonderful, even though she spends half the film laid up with broken bones (her words). She can act all angelic and turn cold-hearted and cruel at the drop of a hat. She gets the lions share of all the best lines tooWe're in the same city now. I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer. I've cleared the month of June...and I am, after all, me.Sigourney Weaver is always interesting when she plays the part of a bitch, because she never has to try hard to convince us. Her monotone voice is dripping with arch, disguised intentions, and you just know she's got something perfectly despicable bubbling away in her head. I wish Weaver would play the part of the villain(ess) more often.Harrison Ford plays Jack Trainer, the man Tess approaches to put her business deal together. It becomes something more when they fall in love, and something more personal when it turns out Jack is involved with Katharine. He just hasn't broken it off yet. Ford is OK in the role. He brings his usual, likable presence to the proceedings. And the scene where he tells Tess the (true) story of how he got a scar is sweet. But Working Girl belongs to the women.Another standout is the absolutely superb Joan Cusack as Tess's best friend Cyn. No matter what film she's in, she always turns in stellar support. And she can often steal scenes right out from under the main players. I'm especially partial to the scene when she's watching a descending chandelier in Katharine's home Why is it doing that?Director Mike Nichols' direction is breezy, keeping the comedy, romance and drama all perfectly balanced. He never puts a foot wrong, and gives Kevin Wade's witty screenplay plenty of room to breathe.As things come to a head, we know inevitably that things will turn out well for Tess. But not before some solid suspense and an initially disheartening finale. But things turn around. Katharine's comeuppance is wonderful. Tess gets her job. And her man. As well as a happy ending. And she truly deserves it too.The closing shot, accompanied to Carly Simon's wonderfully uplifting Let The River Run is the perfect cap on events, and leaves you beaming all the way through to the end credits. Great little speech from Tess at the end too. A quite poetic account of a girl's place in a man's world.

He's a wholesome small-town guy in a wholesome small-town &#150; until he happens upon a grotesque discovery that hurtles him into the midst of a decidedly unwholesome series of events, and a spooky cast of characters populating the town's underside.As Jeffrey's increasing curiosity drags him further into a disturbing and potentially dangerous world, Lynch peppers us with contradictory images &#150; those of blissfully innocent Americana right adjacent to some of the more disturbed sexual and moral conceptions you're going to find anywhere on screen. As the sweet Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) says as she considers Jeffrey's actions, I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. Just as MacLachlan's character is symbolic in nature (as well as serving an essential narrative role as the catalyst for unearthing all this darkness), so are many of the others we meet &#150; wholesomeness is represented by Sandy, a local cop's daughter; perversion is represented by Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), in one of Hopper's classic maniac roles; and lost innocence is represented by Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) &#150; a tragic and tragically untalented lounge singer whose fate becomes Jeffrey's obsession.What is so stunning about Blue Velvet is that its so refreshing and creates a completely new touch on thrillers. The film is jarring, to be sure, and packed with symbolism that might perplex viewers accustomed to Hollywood's more common fare that is painfully straightforward and absolutely literal. But there is a story that can be followed quite easily, there are several likable characters that Lynch has left reasonably understandable, and a beginning, middle and end to the proceedings.The film is a stunning exploration into the dark and fierce that lies beneath all of us, no matter who deep down it is actual hidden.

Kassovitz rightfully won the Best Director award at the Cannes festival for his film that had and still has a huge impact on French society. La Haine mixes ethnics to emphasise the overriding importance of solidarity against the police. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A cinematic phenomenon so close to my heart.It is the day after the riots on an underclass French estate (the film opens with real footage of riots with the suitable soundtrack of Bob Marley's Burnin' and Lootin'). A youth named Abdel had been caught and beaten by the police and is now in critical condition. One of his very best friends, Vinz (Jewish), had found a cop's weapon. He swears that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop. The majority of the film revolves around Vinz and his two other friends Hubert (Afro-Caribbean) and Saïd (North African) roaming around their ghetto and suburbs of Paris. Set just within 24 hours, this is just a glimpse of the chaos.There is an image in La Haine where Vinz (Vincent Cassel) imitates Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) in the mirror; You talking' to me? and then points his fingers like a gun and fires. This is not an action he only does once as he repeats it twice during the film. But why? He has a gun. Is this preparation? Yes. Vinz has to prepare because he is scared. And he has to see what it looks like, to make sure it looks cool, as when he does kill a cop, he will get an undeserved respect by his peers. There is another scene in which Vinz and Hubert bump into a cop while trying to run from this. Vinz' first instinct is to pull the gun on him, this shows that the first instinct has now become violence. The reaction to violence is fear (which is apparent in the cops face until Hubert knocks him out). Fear creates hate; or, the thought and idea of hate. Like the youths feel they are supposed to hate the cops. Vinz is the angriest central character, but when he had his chance, he hesitates; consequences are not forgotten. Cassel performs Vinz with brute force, not failing to portray his character for a second.Hubert (Hubert Koundé), the most subtle character in the film, remains quiet and gentle, although he is a boxer; or a fighter; for the majority of the film. He has a longing to escape. He has no idea who to trust. Everyone is a thug. This is the stereotype that has been created. But not even a thug wants this thought about them. He is always watching the hatred breed around him but never takes part. But when it comes to the cut, the action and reaction is always the same and he proves himself wrong. Koundé put a lot of effort into his role and earns his praise.Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui); possibly the most vibrant character of the three, feels as if he has to be something, he hates change but he follows the crowd, he wants to be accepted. He appears to be everybody's friend as he constantly makes jokes. This is because his family is dead so Vinz and Hubert; and possibly Abdel but we don't know since we only ever hear about Abdel, so they are basically his family. But if they get into trouble they wouldn't hesitate to leave each other. It's every man for himself. Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui work so well together its as if they have known each other for years.The youths are stuck on the idea that the cops are there to stop them, and they refuse the idea that the cops are there in fact to protect them. And the youths express hatred with violence. Sexual intercourse is not an issue in this society as it is too dangerous to have a girlfriend, as it will spawn more violence, thus more hatred. La Haine does not offer solutions to all the racism but in fact, shows you in a detailed and mature manner.Starkly shot in black and white; La Haine has one of my favourite cinematography works. Kassovitz directional style is so inspirational, using rocketing zooms and smooth swerves to get the full view of the destruction. Popular hip hop music is used and heard throughout the film, none of it I would listen to unless I was watching La Haine. The film shows a side of France you can not find on a tourist map. Passion, dedication and effort was well put forward to La Haine. It punches you in the face with its sheer, raw intensity.The films most important quote is the one it opens and shuts with - Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!. This directly reflects the films content, structure and result. La Haine proves that hatred is in fact the strongest emotion. One of the greatest films of the 90s and of all-time; if there was one perfect film; it would be La Haine.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2007","score":"58 out of 106 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1995, Mathieu Kassovitz wrote and directed a film that showed the controversial truth; La Haine, which translates to Hate, a film deemed so important the then-prime minister Alain Juppé arranged a special screening and ordered his entire cabinet to watch the film.

The reaction to violence is fear (which is apparent in the cops face until Hubert knocks him out). Fear creates hate; or, the thought and idea of hate. Like the youths feel they are supposed to hate the cops. Vinz is the angriest central character, but when he had his chance, he hesitates; consequences are not forgotten. Cassel performs Vinz with brute force, not failing to portray his character for a second.Hubert (Hubert Koundé), the most subtle character in the film, remains quiet and gentle, although he is a boxer; or a fighter; for the majority of the film. He has a longing to escape. He has no idea who to trust. Everyone is a thug. This is the stereotype that has been created. But not even a thug wants this thought about them. He is always watching the hatred breed around him but never takes part. But when it comes to the cut, the action and reaction is always the same and he proves himself wrong. Koundé put a lot of effort into his role and earns his praise.Saïd (Saïd Taghmaoui); possibly the most vibrant character of the three, feels as if he has to be something, he hates change but he follows the crowd, he wants to be accepted. He appears to be everybody's friend as he constantly makes jokes. This is because his family is dead so Vinz and Hubert; and possibly Abdel but we don't know since we only ever hear about Abdel, so they are basically his family. But if they get into trouble they wouldn't hesitate to leave each other. It's every man for himself. Cassel, Koundé and Taghmaoui work so well together its as if they have known each other for years.The youths are stuck on the idea that the cops are there to stop them, and they refuse the idea that the cops are there in fact to protect them. And the youths express hatred with violence. Sexual intercourse is not an issue in this society as it is too dangerous to have a girlfriend, as it will spawn more violence, thus more hatred. La Haine does not offer solutions to all the racism but in fact, shows you in a detailed and mature manner.Starkly shot in black and white; La Haine has one of my favourite cinematography works. Kassovitz directional style is so inspirational, using rocketing zooms and smooth swerves to get the full view of the destruction. Popular hip hop music is used and heard throughout the film, none of it I would listen to unless I was watching La Haine. The film shows a side of France you can not find on a tourist map. Passion, dedication and effort was well put forward to La Haine. It punches you in the face with its sheer, raw intensity.The films most important quote is the one it opens and shuts with - Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land!. This directly reflects the films content, structure and result. La Haine proves that hatred is in fact the strongest emotion. One of the greatest films of the 90s and of all-time; if there was one perfect film; it would be La Haine.10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"6 August 2007","score":"58 out of 106 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1995, Mathieu Kassovitz wrote and directed a film that showed the controversial truth; La Haine, which translates to Hate, a film deemed so important the then-prime minister Alain Juppé arranged a special screening and ordered his entire cabinet to watch the film. Kassovitz rightfully won the Best Director award at the Cannes festival for his film that had and still has a huge impact on French society. La Haine mixes ethnics to emphasise the overriding importance of solidarity against the police. In my opinion, the greatest film ever made. A cinematic phenomenon so close to my heart.It is the day after the riots on an underclass French estate (the film opens with real footage of riots with the suitable soundtrack of Bob Marley's Burnin' and Lootin'). A youth named Abdel had been caught and beaten by the police and is now in critical condition. One of his very best friends, Vinz (Jewish), had found a cop's weapon. He swears that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop. The majority of the film revolves around Vinz and his two other friends Hubert (Afro-Caribbean) and Saïd (North African) roaming around their ghetto and suburbs of Paris. Set just within 24 hours, this is just a glimpse of the chaos.There is an image in La Haine where Vinz (Vincent Cassel) imitates Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) in the mirror; You talking' to me? and then points his fingers like a gun and fires. This is not an action he only does once as he repeats it twice during the film. But why? He has a gun. Is this preparation? Yes. Vinz has to prepare because he is scared. And he has to see what it looks like, to make sure it looks cool, as when he does kill a cop, he will get an undeserved respect by his peers. There is another scene in which Vinz and Hubert bump into a cop while trying to run from this. Vinz' first instinct is to pull the gun on him, this shows that the first instinct has now become violence.

The sequel elaborates on this &#150; he has indeed split into two characters, the cenobite and his former self, both more alive than ever.I read in an interview that actor Doug Bradley got offers from female fans to father their children. There's a sex appeal to the character very like Hannibal's, and it must be in Bradley's facial expression or the fact his make-up doesn't really disfigure him (Unluckily for us, the sexual angle in Clive Barler's Book The Hellbound Heart is never explored). Bradley personally thinks it's the way he's filmed in that gorgeous costume. It adorns a plain-looking guy and turns him into the androgynous drag queen from hell.With 15 years distance and the higher resolution of DVD, a lot of the effects and make-up in this enjoyable shocker look ridiculous, which is half-way compensated by the good acting of the main cast. It has a straight-forward story (Pinhead taking over the real world) and some memorable scenes, particularly when he mocks the Christian last supper. It introduces female heroine and news-hound Joey whose dreams of saving her father (Daddy is back &#150; again!) from death in Vietnam lead her to Pinhead's human self, a disillusioned officer in the trenches of the First World War. Joey is partly accompanied by the tramp girl Terri, a lost soul who can't dream or separate good from bad friends. She's an ex-girlfriend of J.P. Monroe, the sadistic grown-up rich kid who lets Pinhead loose upon the real world. They are all flawed, yet somehow sympathetic. The supporting cast ultimately end up in the meat grinder as usual, but Pinhead has to coerce and seduce rather than threaten this time. He has to use all his remaining brain cells &#150; at least in the first half, which leads to his most intelligent lines in the whole series &#150; maybe. I can't tell, because this was the last one I watched.Of the first three, it's the most fun and the most spectacular in terms of explosions and massacre, though not the most shocking &#150; the crown of skin-crawlers goes to its prequels, and among those narrowly to Hellbound Hellraiser II. Pinhead gets to play his favorite game with a club full of people, some of whom can't act even for their lives, but must have had a great time. The weird Boiler Room club setting and constant Heavy Metal music remind me of the Rammstein video Angel (Engel). The lighting unfortunately doesn't work very well for Pinhead at DVD resolution, but the set is spectacular. Bradley's performance as his human side relies too much on screen presence &#150; there's almost no acting to speak of in his scenes with Joey as they wander among the mutilated dead of his past. Just like in the unmasking in Hellraiser II, he remains completely characterless &#150; a cartoon. Maybe that's deliberate to keep him usable in the future, but also a bit disappointing.

The film depicts many gruelling scenes, varying from sexual deprivation, to drug abuse, but none of it is exploitive or inappropriate. When you view the film it is a fact that you will promptly recognise why the film received much controversy on release. If you are easily offended then I would not recommend Bad Lieutenant, but if you are an open-minded individual, who appreciates ultra realistic cinema then Bad Lieutenant is a vital viewing experience.Harvey Keitel stars as The Lieutenant (a name is never given), a cruel and unforgiving man who abuses his law enforcement role to gain easy access to his own dirty habits. He will see prostitutes, snort coke, inject heroin, gamble his life savings and take away stolen money for his own benefit. The Lieutenant is a stomach-turning individual who lives in a hellish world surrounded by grim crime. There is nothing redeeming about the man at all, except that towards the end of the film he starts to seek redemption and goes on a quest to bring justice to a nun who has been raped by two unknown low-lives.Built on Harvey Keitel's electrifying performance of heartbreaking honesty and convincing visceral energy the performance is unforgettable and ranks alongside the greatest acting showcases of the '90s. The performance is the driving force behind the work, how the viewer is able to sympathise (to a certain extent) with Harvey Keitel's character shows remarkable talent. Essentially, it is up to viewer to gather their own opinion on the character, being that there is a considerable amount of thoughtfulness which should be taken into account. Take for example the scene towards the end of the film where Harvey Keitel's has an emotional breakdown of guilt within the confines of a Catholic church. It is a scene of overwhelming authority, carefully dominated by both the allegory of the church and Harvey Keitel's begging for forgiveness, while facing a hallucination of Christ.The raw script is crafted with a howl of merciless rage, providing a film which is not so much narrative driven, but singularly character driven. Abel Ferrara shows a real talent for his documentary technique, naturalistic camera-positioning and extended, up-close-and-personal tracking techniques. The film has a sense of cinéma vérité, echoed within that of the hand-held shooting methods and grainy style the film consistently follows. On my viewing it felt as though the film was not forced in its attempt to be authentic, but exceedingly effortless, while being sincere about its moralistic message. Since, ultimately, Bad Lieutenant is a very spiritual film portraying a despicable man's search for forgiveness and realisation of the inexcusable mistakes he has made.I certainly would not want to watch Bad Lieutenant again, at least not any time soon. It is depressing and fearless in its context, containing scenes which will leave you feeling very uncomfortable. All the same, I strongly recommend the film if you want to watch a film which steps across the boundaries of conveying a tortured soul. Bad Lieutenant is not a sleazy film, but a true eye-opener, which carries a heavy load of appalling actions depicted throughout the entire duration. Nevertheless, it is the thoughtful analysis of a damaged, reviled man which makes it an essential, one-time viewing.

After being rescued by a door to door saleswoman, Edward finds a new home in the city. But can the villagers accept someone so different? I don't know if this is Tim Burton's best film, but it certainly is the most Burtonesque film of his, if that makes sense. We have plenty of the quirky aspects Burton likes (see Pee-Wee's Big Adventure) and, of course, his love of all things goth (see almost all his other films). We also have two of his favorite actors (Depp, who has appeared in countless Burton films, and Winona Ryder, from his Beetlejuice).Visually, this film is stunning. The houses all pastel and in a row look very odd, but make a great statement about the uniformity of communities. The inventor's shop is a perfect Rube Goldberg machine in action. The ice carving scene is beautiful, and the hedges are clipped wonderfully. The only thing in this film I found actually difficult to look at was the contrast between Winona Ryder's hair and her eyebrows. Please, Winona, stay brunette.We have comedy, romance... we have the meanest looking Anthony Michael Hall (what happened to the lovable nerd from Breakfast Club?). You'll love the monster, you'll fear the monster. This modern retelling of Frankenstein, unlike virtually every other retelling, is actually fun for the whole family and beautiful in its own way.And, of course, we have the Danny Elfman soundtrack. I can't think of any good reason not to see this film. At least ,as long as you don't mind the really obvious bait-and-switch of dogs during the grooming scene (watch the breeds change during the snipping). Go ahead and watch this... the fewest words Johnny Depp will probably ever say in a movie, back when he had that baby face.

A cocky and rebellious newspaper man, Clark Gable, decides to tell off boss, and go freelance, all on his own. He does so with a bottle and a telephone. Meanwhile, spoiled daughter (Claudette Colbert) of ultra rich(though sympathetic)father(Walter Connolly)decides to run off from her scheduled marriage, leading father and his army of Private Detectives on a merry cross country chase, from Florida to NYC via a Greyhound-type Bus.Ex-reporter and rich Heiress cross paths, and the fun all begins.

The latest craze, they even have spin-off cartoons and cereal commercials. But lo and behold, Toys R Us charges a bl**dy fortune, so his mum (Catherine Hicks) gets a deal from a homeless guy who has one in his cart. Unbeknowst to mum, this doll has inherited the soul of Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), a psycho who was shot by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon) in a toy store. Charles Lee Ray landed next to a stand of Good Guy dolls, and thru voodoo magic, he impregnated Chucky with his SOUL!!!! Needless to say, Andy and his mum are pretty pleased. But no sooner has Chucky been welcomed into the family, the babysitter turns up dead! And what's more...Det Norris thinks little Andy is to blame! Soon enough though, the mayhem breaks loose (heck, it's only 87 minutes long) and we are treated to a slasher movie with a difference. No more plot spoilers...the rest of the story is pretty easy to figure out.Catherine Hicks plays the stressin' mum really well here, we can tell she's very fond of her kid and doesn't want ol Chucky to make mincemeat of him (even though he is darn good at it), so she begins the track down the origin of the evil so we can destroy it part of the plot.

He was one of the producers so there was no one to slow him down i.e. he was out-of-control and surrounded with yes-men. At times he must have been thinking he was in a Shakespeare play, the way he pronounces certain words and sentences! Watching him play this alien with such reckless abandon, such merciless gusto, such witless panache, it becomes quickly clear that he was\/is an idiot gone berserk with power and delusions of talent; he apparently has no idea how out of place such mugging is in a story like this. (He must have forgotten Rule 127.5D from the Book Of Acting, which states Never mug while in a sci-fi film, especially while you wear tons of make-up and a Rastafarian hair-do.) This movie will also go down in history as an embarrassing failure by the Scientologists to bring the work of the Exalted One, Master of the Universe, Darth Hubbard, to the lowly masses of man-animals.The story is like the brain of a Hollywood Scientologist full of holes. Terl regards the humans as beings incapable of doing almost anything, and yet he is supposed to know a lot about them (and how could he not, given his race has been on Earth for a millennium?). Question if he knows so much about them then how is it that he displays so bafflingly little of that knowledge when he discusses human behaviour with Whitaker? It's absolutely idiotic that Travolta's race has ruled Earth for a 1000 years, yet they seem confused why a dog is more co-operative than a human - yet isn't useful for manual labour. They don't even know what humans like to eat! (There is an utterly pointless, ludicrous segment where Travolta decides to let a group of humans escape so that he can see what their favourite food is, and later use that knowledge as leverage over them!) An alien master race, which has spread all over the galaxy, surely must be intelligent and advanced enough to at least have basic knowledge of their conquered slave races and not underrate anyone; in this movie the superior aliens underestimate humans to the point of mind-boggling silliness - to the point where their home planet gets blown to bits. (I don't think even fire-crackers catch fire this quickly. Terl's planet has evidently been covered with gasoline... Science fiction has never seen such ease in blowing up an entire planet. You see, their atmosphere is highly unstable&#x85; Senator Palpatine could have saved so much money if he had simply nuked the planets he wanted blown up.) The aliens are comic-book arrogant, i.e. not in a quiet, superior way but in a childish, boastful way! Listening to these aliens talk, one would get the impression that they must still be in their equivalent of the Middle Ages, and not a technologically advanced master race, rulers of the galaxy. Hubbard, the moron, hasn't thought this through at all. Also, isn't it a bit too much that a small group of humans - only one of whom has any kind of scientific knowledge - not only beat the aliens but actually even destroy their planet?! For 1000 years Earthlings have been obedient slaves to their alien masters, and suddenly there is an organized revolt, and in no time are the aliens beaten and Planet Psychlo blown to bits! Hey, why didn't we do this earlier?! &#x96; a question no-one asks but should. And how about cave people getting trained within days to fly fighter jets! (Piece o' cake!... Piece o' cake!...; the fact that one of the humans keeps saying it's a piece of cake doesn't make it so, but I guess the cheesy Oprahesque point of the movie is that you can do anything when driven by determination.) Hubbard doesn't even possess basic knowledge of physics - a major embarrassment for any sci-fi writer - which he displays when the character Zete says that he hates puny, undersized planets because their gravities are so different; this implies that planet Psychlo is large - which means its inhabitants should be shorter than humans due to a larger gravity - not three heads taller. And what's this about him hating it because it's so different wouldn't a hot-shot from outer space know the difference between higher and lower gravities?? Of course he would; he should have said I hate these puny planets because their gravities are so much lower (or higher - in Hubbard's universe). But I forget Psychlos are MORON conquerors.The movie would have been somewhat less silly (and yet still unbelievably silly) had all the Psychlos been speaking their language at all times, with English sub-titles below. Instead, Travolta's squeaky voice is in stark contrast to his make-up, costume, and grand physical appearance. Whitaker, on the other hand, has a deep, booming voice which helped him get away from this movie without appearing\/sounding too laughable. (Plus, he is a considerably better actor than Travolta; that's the other reason.) When we laugh at Whitaker it's because his dialog is dumb, but when we laugh at Travolta we laugh at everything about him.Psychlo... What a dumb word. (Based on Hubbard's hatred towards psychiatrists. Naturally, every loon hates shrinks.) We also have gastrones (or gas drones?). Gastrones are the military forces that conquer. So when they talked about sending gastrones, it always sounded to me like Psychlos were sending their food experts to prepare some delicacies for the invaded races. Or how about planet-ship??!!...

The story is very well done, and the action and pacing is incredible, as it moves at breakneck speed. John McTeirnan, the director, not only gives us great action, but he gives us believable characters. Casting Alan Rickman as the lead villain was smart because with a film like Die Hard, you need a villain who is as good as the hero, and Rickman is up to the task with Willis. Between all the gun play and furious battle sequences, we have some minor roles that are also given some time. Reggie Johnson as Sgt.

The terrorists quickly cease control of the Nakatomi Tower where Holly works, and suddenly there is a hostage situation. McClane manages to escape and becomes the only salvation for the hostages and himself in a standoff which pits him alone against all the terrorists. Die Hard is one fantastic action film. The story is very well done, and the action and pacing is incredible, as it moves at breakneck speed. John McTeirnan, the director, not only gives us great action, but he gives us believable characters. Casting Alan Rickman as the lead villain was smart because with a film like Die Hard, you need a villain who is as good as the hero, and Rickman is up to the task with Willis. Between all the gun play and furious battle sequences, we have some minor roles that are also given some time. Reggie Johnson as Sgt. Al Powell is wonderful in a role as the first officer of the law that McClane comes in contact with over the radio. Bonnie Bedalia, as McClane's wife Holly, also plays a good role.In fact just about everything in this movie works until we get to meet Police Chief Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason). His role in this movie should've been cut, since he really has nothing at all to do except be wrong all the time in every situation. He even has a few one-liners which fail miserably because his character is so completely incompetent, you find yourself wondering how he got the job of police chief in the first place. It is because of this one character that Die Hard loses a star.Overall Die Hard was fast, ferocious, fast paced, and offered some great stunt sequences and explosions. It's too bad that we had to have one annoying and useless character as a big flaw in and otherwise superb action thriller.

I really feel sorry for these actors.This movie lacks in plot and characters development as hell. None of the characters is particularly likable so you will never care if someone dies or not.Special FX were OK but that robot seemed taken from Star Wars, or even worse, from a computer game! And those kung-fu poses were just laughable!OK. You want some nudity? Here is Carrie-Anne! But I hated her. Too bossy and mean! Wait. She is the commander, that's why she is bossy. Yes, you can be the commander, but that doesn't mean you have to be a bitch. I wanted her to die! Oh, as for the nudity, it was only a bare back for 3 seconds.I will not say anything about oxygen on Mars but be aware of the implausible science in this movie. Also this film is full of clichés, just to mention one, the overused CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) that Hollywood directors seem to love! and where the patient recovers magically as if he\/she was only sleeping. If you don't know, CPR is not something so easy to do and after that the patience is very weak and even has ribs broken and other complications.With all the high-tech this movie seemed to be very good, but if you don't have a good plot and characters all that high-tech is pointless. Make you a favor, avoid this movie at all costs! ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" What can I say?
