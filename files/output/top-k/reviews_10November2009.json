[{"date":"10 November 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This romantic comedy was apparently a box office success during its theatrical run in 1998, but I was a little over eleven years old at the time, and the movie was rated PG-13. I clearly remember seeing it advertised at a video store that's long gone now, and seeing the cover of it, featuring a picture of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (didn't know who they were at the time), and the tagline, He's gonna party like it's 1985. However, I didn't actually watch The Wedding Singer until 2006, when I saw it on TV, I think just months after it had been adapted to Broadway. It made me laugh the first time, maybe more so than any Adam Sandler movie I had previously seen. A little over three years later, a second viewing didn't hurt.In 1985, Robbie Hart is a failed rock star but a successful wedding singer, living in Ridgefield, New Jersey and singing popular 80's hits with a band at weddings in this town. He meets a waitress named Julia Sullivan, who works at the places where he performs, and befriends her. The singer is engaged to his long-time girlfriend, Linda. Unfortunately, Linda does not show up at their wedding, and later tells Robbie that she has decided she doesn't want to marry a wedding singer. This sends him into depression, and he no longer feels romantic, which negatively affects his performances. Julia is engaged to Glenn Gulia, a rich businessman, and asks Robbie to help her plan the wedding. However, in the process, the local singer learns that Glenn is a cheater, and Robbie and Julia find themselves falling in love with each other.This movie may be a bit more laid back than a number of others starring Sandler, but that doesn't mean it's less funny. It might be funnier than most of his other films! There are so many parts that made me laugh, such as the one with Linda not showing up at the wedding, Linda telling Robbie afterwards why she doesn't want to marry him, the gender bending member of the band, George (based on Boy George), only ever singing Do You Really Want To Hurt Me, Robbie singing Love Stinks at a wedding and the outcome of it, Jon Lovitz playing a rival wedding singer, and too many others to mention! The most hilarious part might be the main character's Somebody Kill Me song! In addition to a lot of good humour, there are also characters to like. The soundtrack features some good 80's music, though if you have the very popular opinion that the 80's were a terrible decade for music, you would obviously disagree.I didn't like absolutely everything about this 1998 romantic comedy. I'm not sure about my first viewing, but the second time, I found that it went downhill slightly, later on in the film. The romance, while I've certainly seen worse, didn't impress me as much as it could have, at least not towards the end of the film. I don't know, maybe some of it is too chick flick-ish for me. Also, the ending could have been more focused and a little less abrupt. Other than that, however, there's not much for me to complain about. I haven't seen every film Adam Sandler has ever starred in, but have seen a bunch of them, some of which are not very good, but The Wedding Singer definitely isn't one of those. In fact, judging by the movies I've seen him in, this one could probably easily be considered a highlight of his career.

This is also one of Hitchcock's great crowd-pleasers - when first released, it played in New York for a year - held over repeatedly due to audience demand - and in England the movie went through the roof, running in London for virtually the length of World War II. It's been playing constantly since then in frequent revivals and television screenings. REBECCA's production was fraught with tension and pain principal photography started only days before the outbreak of WWII, to the great personal distress of the nearly all-English cast and crew; Hitchcock exploited Joan's Fontaine's inexperience by telling her that she was terrible and everyone hated her so as to deliberately keep her in a near-constant state of defensiveness, fear and anxiety which was 100% appropriate for Fontaine's character; and it soon became quite obvious that Selznick and Hitchcock could not stand one another and would be unable to work together in the long run. The resulting motion picture, however, brought nothing but good fortune to everyone connected with it - Laurence Olivier's long-desired Hollywood career finally took off, Hitchcock's reputation in America was secured, Joan Fontaine became an international star overnight, Selznick won his second Best Picture Oscar in a row and dominated world box-office for another year, and Judith Anderson became an icon, just for starters.

The Whole Nine Yards is a great movie to simply sit back and enjoy.Nicholas Oz Ozeransky (Matthew Perry) is a mild-mannered dentist whose stuck with a wife who hates him (Rosanna Arquette in a hilariously over-the-top performance) and a huge debt that his partner (his father-in-law) left him when he kicked the bucket. Then his new neighbor moves in. This neighbor, much to Oz's horror, is none other than Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski (Bruce Willis), the infamous hit-man for the Gogolak gang. Oz's wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a finder's fee. Oz obviously refuses, but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this, she'll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses, new romances, and hamburgers with mayonnaise.The cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panic-mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It's a typecast role, but Willis plays him with a slight tongue-in-cheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs, it also gives him an air of menace, which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy's capacity for violence, but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy's ex-wife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also well-cast as Jimmy's fellow hit-man, Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so over-the-top that their performances must be seen to be believed.But as good as this cast is, and it's great, the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn't just steal her scenes, she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz's ditzy receptionist, who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical; her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod, if not a win.The Whole Nine Yards is a mix of film-noir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre, including mixing and matching the character traits of the femme-fatale and the good girl (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie). What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not over-the-top exaggeration humor (like The Farrelly Brothers). This is more about timing and dialogue; it's like a 1930's screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure, the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre the twisty plot. The Whole Nine Yards boasts plenty of surprises, and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean you can tell where it's going.Mixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not, one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is well-paced, and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no over-the-top visual effects, and that's a good thing.The Whole Nine Yards may not be classic film material, but it's highly entertaining. And with a movie like this, that's just about all that one could ask for.

Oz's wife tells him that they should rat Jimmy out to the Gogolaks to get a finder's fee. Oz obviously refuses, but agrees to go when his wife agrees that if he does this, she'll give him a divorce. Thus begins a hilarious story of double crosses, new romances, and hamburgers with mayonnaise.The cast is first rate. Matthew Perry is in full panic-mode, and his reactions to the situations he finds himself in (and their resulting consequences) are hilarious. Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as Jimmy. It's a typecast role, but Willis plays him with a slight tongue-in-cheek. It works wonderfully. While it allows for plenty of laughs, it also gives him an air of menace, which adds another layer to the humor. We are aware of Jimmy's capacity for violence, but the way Willis plays it results in moments of laughter mixed with suspense. Natasha Henstridge radiates a cool sexuality mixed with vulnerability as Jimmy's ex-wife who falls for Oz. Michael Clarke Duncan is also well-cast as Jimmy's fellow hit-man, Frankie. Kevin Pollack and Rosanna Arquette are so over-the-top that their performances must be seen to be believed.But as good as this cast is, and it's great, the film is stolen from all of them by newcomer Amanda Peet. It takes a great performer to steal scenes with actors at the top of their game. But Peet didn't just steal her scenes, she walked away with the whole movie. Peet is positively delightful as Oz's ditzy receptionist, who has more of a part to play in this than anyone realizes. Peet is hysterical; her performance should have at least gotten her an Oscar nod, if not a win.The Whole Nine Yards is a mix of film-noir and screwball comedy. Director Jonathan Lynn has a lot of fun with the conventions of each genre, including mixing and matching the character traits of the femme-fatale and the good girl (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie). What I really liked is that the humor of the movie is not over-the-top exaggeration humor (like The Farrelly Brothers). This is more about timing and dialogue; it's like a 1930's screwball comedy without the Hays Code. To be sure, the film does not leave out the trademark of the noir genre the twisty plot. The Whole Nine Yards boasts plenty of surprises, and quite a bit of suspense. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean you can tell where it's going.Mixing these two genres would seem impossible because more often than not, one would dilute the other. But Lynn manages to walk the line between the two opposite genres and play them both equally well. The film is well-paced, and the timing on the jokes is perfect. There are no over-the-top visual effects, and that's a good thing.The Whole Nine Yards may not be classic film material, but it's highly entertaining. And with a movie like this, that's just about all that one could ask for.

Within the first 5 minutes of Meryl's performance you can see why she one an Oscar, even having seen most of her films- she had me pretty convinced she was European. Kline's eccentricity and passion works well with Streep's character and the two complement each other throughout. I can only say I've seen Peter MacNicol in 'Bean' before which was released many years later though he tames the fiery nature of the other two by his gentle, Southern approach. For the first hour or so, the film is quite simply fun and you really wish you were one of the three, but at the back of my mind I was trying to work out what Sophie's choice was. The film unravels and pieces together adhesively to where I get to a point where perhaps I don't want to be part of the trio. Unlike Schindler's List, where there is sadness throughout; Sophie's Choice touches upon the Holocaust but with such impact that will stick with me for life. As a story progresses it pieces together so well with a well-deserved, superb finale. It certainly touches upon all sorts of relationships, and cultures that we can all relate to and even as quite a critical person (when it comes to films), I consider this to be a must-see for everybody with possibly one of the best performances I have ever seen!

The script here sticks to the general storyline of the original but changes a lot of the set-pieces to lacklustre effects like the capturing of Joe is changed from Cowboys lassoing him to blokes in jeeps & the fantastic climax set in a nightclub where Joe fights Lions & then saves children in a burning orphanage is replaced with a walk around Hollywood & saving a kid on a burning ferris wheel. While the CGI effects are excellent there's a certain coldness to the action & adventure scenes while the character's are terrible with some annoying comic relief & a really sickening romance between the two leads & lots of moralising about the evils of poaching & the perils of locking animals up in cages rather than letting run free & the parallels that has with our own lives as we too are locked up in cages & it's just that we call them houses.

Having said that it's watchable I suppose & the effects are good.As already mentioned the CGI effects are very good as are the practical effects created by Rick Baker who was along with his team nominated for an Oscar but lost out to What Dreams May Come (1998). This being a squeaky clean Disney family film there's no violence & even the main villain doesn't get much of a send-off. Charlize Theron's attempt to portray a character who has never been to civilisation & spent her entire life in the jungles of Africa is hopeless & she comes across as some ball American blonde anyway.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it & it show's with great effects & ambitious set-pieces although the finished product doesn't come across as exciting on screen due to the awful music & lack of imagination that isn't the fault of the effects work which is impressive. The acting is bland & I usually quite like Bill Paxton but not in a family film such as this.Mighty Joe Young is a remake that isn't as good as the original & comes across as a second rate King Kong, hell even the ridiculous King Kong Lives (1986) is better than this. Basically a King Kong wannabe that doesn't cut the mustard & isn't as good as the original Mighty Joe Young either but is still watchable on a corny level.

It has all the right ingredients with the hunters, the hunted, the unwilling hinted man being chased for his life through the woods...the claustrophobia, the suspense, the psychological element, yeah it had enough in there to maker a really great story. What happened then? First let me point out that I thoroughly enjoyed this film!! I enjoyed it when I realised it was not as professional as I might have thought at first, so I sat back to enjoy a good old action flick in the manner of Schwarzenegger or something and it fitted the bill well. The doc, Gary Busey, was just perfect in his role and I was a bit saddened when his character was no longer. He could have brought more to this movie.I haven't had the 'pleasure' of watching Ice-T in a movie until now.Ice-T is a bad actor! He also had such bad lines that maybe it wasn't exactly his fault. Either way he was quite a part in the downfall of this film. For someone who is a streetwise homeless guy he seemed to lack a bit of judgement and was as gullible as they come.OK OK OK forget all that. If you want to enjoy this film then you must suspend disbelief, don't ask questions about this or that character or why this happened or didn't happen, just get yourself cosy, sit back and have a good night in with this eclectic bunch of weirdo's trying to kill each other in the woods. It is as simple as that. For that it deserves at least 5 stars. Enjoyable but could definitely have been miles better.Oh and remind me not to watch Ice-T again...

He used some interesting point of view shots. The first example of this is the car chase. The scene is filmed from the point of view of a passenger in Octavio's car, making the viewer feel like they are being chased too. Another example is in the initial dog fight scene. This scene is shot from the point of view of a dog being walked into the arena. We see the blood all over the floor, dogs in crates, dogs with blood on them, and a dead dog being dragged away. Yet another example is in El Chivo's bedroom after Cofi has killed all of his dogs. We see him view the picture of his daughter on the wall from his point of view laying on his bed.Innaritu also keeps the viewer engaged through lack of continuity, revealing some pieces of the story and leaving others for later. The lives of the characters are intertwined through the original car crash. There is an overall theme of cruelty and violence. For example El Chivo is a hit man, killing for money. Octavio treats his dog cruelly by fighting him and opening up the possibility of the dog being severely hurt or killed. Greed is another theme portrayed through Daniel and Valeria, and also Octavio. Daniel has everything he could want, a wife and two daughters and a well paying job. That isn't enough for him; he must have the younger more beautiful woman, Valeria and leaves his wife and girls for her. Daniel and Valeria's relationship is full of fighting and conflict due to Valeria being in a wheelchair with a broken leg and losing Richie under the floorboards. Octavio has all the money he needs to go away with Susana and the baby but he can't resist the urge to fight Cofi one last time for a big win. His greed costs him his best friend, his dog, and Susana. In a way El Chivo is greedy too. He had everything he could want as well, a wife and a daughter. As a result he lost his wife and daughter, went to jail for many years and was lonely for the rest of his life.

The Freelings live a normal everyday life, until strange disturbances occur and Carol-Anne begins to make contact with eerie voices in their TV set. Then things get scary when Diane and Steven discover that Carol-Anne has been whisked into another dimension, one of terror, pain, and fear. The Freelings are being terrorized by ghosts, and extremely ferocious ones at that.Poltergeist is one of the most perfect haunted house movies ever made. It's filled with scares, a witty sense of humor, and enough goo for the fans. It gives you a few chances to breath, but when the horror begins, there's no stopping it. And all of this came out of the mind of Steven Spielberg, director of Jaws. One of the reasons Poltergeist works so well is the setting. This family is living in a normal home, lending the viewer the idea that this can happen to anybody. Not until Paranormal Activity have I seen such terrifying supernatural events in a horror film.The movie is plenty creepy. Sometimes, there won't be anything happening during a scene, then Diane will turn around and all the table chairs are stacked up. The movie psychologically plays with you, and only throws in special effects when they're most needed.The acting is stellar. The entire cast comes off as pure and real, especially the Freeling family. JoBeth Williams and Craig T.

Until we hear it from Spielberg and Hooper, we won't know.It's been nearly 30 years, and Poltergeist still has the ability to scare you, to make you jump, to amaze you, and to make you laugh.

Harrison's I'm an Ordinary Man and I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face are brilliant.I really loved the ones done by Stanley Holloway.With a Little Bit of Luck and Get Me to the Church on Time are most catchy.Those songs make this a classic musical.It seems like there will be a remake of this movie coming next year.Obviously musical isn't a dead genre, as it looked like a few years earlier.My Fair Lady is a kind of musical, that should work on all eras.

I personal don't mind him, I have read The Firm and thought it was pretty good. Grisham work has ended up being made into a number of films, such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief, Rainmaker and the Runaway Jury, all looking at the American Legal system. A Time to Kill is one of his favourite novels, and made had an active role in the adaptation's production.Set in rural Mississippi, a 10-year-old girl is brutally raped by two racists when she was walking home. It is a violence crime that unites the community and the two men are quickly arrested. The men confess to their crime, but the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), fears that they would be acquitted. He takes the law in his own hand and kills the two men, and himself gets arrested. A local young lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) takes the cast despite having limited resources because he felt he would have done the same it had happened to his young daughter. There is public sympathy for the case, especially in the black community and Jake even gains the help of Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), a intelligent law student. But Jake's life and his family is put in danger when the Ku Klux Khan role into town, led by the brother of one of the rapists (Kiefer Sutherland). They use threats and violence against Jake, his family and employees to stop him in the case. Jake also has to tackle the talented, but slimy DA Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey) who uses all his influence to get his way.This is clearly a bleak story, and has potential to look at a number of themes, from American law to the still embedded feelings of racism in the American Deep South. The film tries to show all this having a number of sub-plots and looks at a number of characters. They are ideas of racism in the jury, in the police, but also the police having sympathy for the father. I sure a lot of people would feel the same if it happened to a close friend or family member. They is good cast in the film. Samuel L. Jackson was going through his mini-phase of being a militant black man, and was in good form. Kevin Spacey was delightfully slimy, which he is good at, and underused. Kiefer Sutherland offered a similar performance to what he did in another legal thriller, A Few Good Men. Sandra Bullock was okay, but nothing special. Matthew McConaughey too was okay, but I doubt his abilities as a leading man. At times when he was on screen with Sandra Bullock it was a contest on who could offer the most wooden performance.This is also one of Joel Schumacher better films, and shows he can do dark, serious films, and not campy messes like he did with his Batman films. There is violence, some good set pieces and a good handle behind the camera but he was a workman like director with this film. But he and the writer Akiva Goldsman made the film too long with a bit too much fat they should have cut around 10 minutes to give the audience a more tort experience.Akiva Goldsman did offer some weak moments of dialogue, and a bit too much melodrama. He is in advantageous with this film, and sticks to the standard legal thriller formation, lawyer gets cast, lawyer has trouble with cast and thinks he is about to lost, lawyer is offered a small ray of hope. That's what happens in most American legal thrillers and the legal thriller is not a genre with has caught on in other nation's cinema.Despite they are claims of liberalism throughout the film, it also offers a very right-wing message, accepting vigilantism, that it is okay to take the law into your own hands.With a little editing, re-writes and a strong indie mentality this could have been an really brilliant, but ends up being standard Hollywood pulp.

Sandra Bullock was okay, but nothing special. Matthew McConaughey too was okay, but I doubt his abilities as a leading man. At times when he was on screen with Sandra Bullock it was a contest on who could offer the most wooden performance.This is also one of Joel Schumacher better films, and shows he can do dark, serious films, and not campy messes like he did with his Batman films. There is violence, some good set pieces and a good handle behind the camera but he was a workman like director with this film. But he and the writer Akiva Goldsman made the film too long with a bit too much fat they should have cut around 10 minutes to give the audience a more tort experience.Akiva Goldsman did offer some weak moments of dialogue, and a bit too much melodrama. He is in advantageous with this film, and sticks to the standard legal thriller formation, lawyer gets cast, lawyer has trouble with cast and thinks he is about to lost, lawyer is offered a small ray of hope. That's what happens in most American legal thrillers and the legal thriller is not a genre with has caught on in other nation's cinema.Despite they are claims of liberalism throughout the film, it also offers a very right-wing message, accepting vigilantism, that it is okay to take the law into your own hands.With a little editing, re-writes and a strong indie mentality this could have been an really brilliant, but ends up being standard Hollywood pulp.

I personal don't mind him, I have read The Firm and thought it was pretty good. Grisham work has ended up being made into a number of films, such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief, Rainmaker and the Runaway Jury, all looking at the American Legal system. A Time to Kill is one of his favourite novels, and made had an active role in the adaptation's production.Set in rural Mississippi, a 10-year-old girl is brutally raped by two racists when she was walking home. It is a violence crime that unites the community and the two men are quickly arrested. The men confess to their crime, but the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), fears that they would be acquitted. He takes the law in his own hand and kills the two men, and himself gets arrested. A local young lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) takes the cast despite having limited resources because he felt he would have done the same it had happened to his young daughter. There is public sympathy for the case, especially in the black community and Jake even gains the help of Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), a intelligent law student. But Jake's life and his family is put in danger when the Ku Klux Khan role into town, led by the brother of one of the rapists (Kiefer Sutherland). They use threats and violence against Jake, his family and employees to stop him in the case. Jake also has to tackle the talented, but slimy DA Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey) who uses all his influence to get his way.This is clearly a bleak story, and has potential to look at a number of themes, from American law to the still embedded feelings of racism in the American Deep South. The film tries to show all this having a number of sub-plots and looks at a number of characters. They are ideas of racism in the jury, in the police, but also the police having sympathy for the father. I sure a lot of people would feel the same if it happened to a close friend or family member. They is good cast in the film. Samuel L. Jackson was going through his mini-phase of being a militant black man, and was in good form.

A lot of people look at this movie as a step down for the Best of the Best series, but in my opinion, it isn't. If anything, it was a growing step up until Without Warning (the fourth Best of the Best) was created.Picking up from the events of Best of the Best 2, Tommy has left his good friend Alex Grady behind and comes to Liberty to see his sister Karen, brother-in-law Jack (who's the town Sheriff), his nephew Justin and Luther, Justin's friend who's father is a preacher who goes missing earlier in the film. Tommy is glad to see his family and is enjoying the love and warmth that he receives, but when he learns that local supremacists have taken over the town and are responsible for the death of Luther's father, Tommy must decide whether or not to use his lethal skills again in order to help the locals take back their home from predators who use fear as a weapon and violence against the innocent just because they're 'different'.A lot of people think that this Best of the Best just follows a tired old cliché story that people have seen and heard hundreds of times before. Yes, the topic at hand does revolve around racial conflict, but in this story, the victims in this decide to butch up and fight back. Most movies I've seen about 'hate crimes' in the past have the same plot a hate crime is committed, people want to come forward but are too scared for fear of retaliation from the haters, the law does all they can to put a stop to it but are unable to and the people who are victims just try to rely on religion alone to get them through the incident. But how often do we see movies where those who are unjustly persecuted for their race decide to take a stand against that kind of tyranny and terrorism? The movie has many messages mainly about redemption and salvation. Tommy is trying to live a life of peace, but the supremacists make that extremely difficult and force him to use lethal countermeasures to put a stop to their bullying and he hopes and prays that the situation won't result in more death at his hands.Another message in this film is that even if you despise violence, you have to be ready to use it at a moment's notice. Nobody likes violence and would like to resolve conflicts without it...but violence is all some people know in this world. And the enemy won't learn anything about respecting another individual's rights until someone 'teaches' it to them. And rest assured, Phillp Rhee's character has a lot of teaching to do in this film.Basically put, there's plenty of gunfights galore, high-kicking action, explosive pyrotechnics and behind it all, a message about being ready to go to war if you ever want peace on your land. That's the main thing everyone should pay attention to when they watch this film...God knows, it got my attention.
