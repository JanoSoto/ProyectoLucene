I am one of those admirers. Since there are already so many great comments on this film I will concentrate on other things than plot analysis. The critics jumped on Hitchcock from the moment he presented Tippy Hedren in 'The Birds'. That film wasn't perfect either, but could not be blamed on the technical side. Ms. Hedren wasn't great but she was promising enough. The critics had accepted much worse actresses than her. They probably felt insulted to be confronted with a leading lady who never worked as an actress before. After this disappointment he tried to get Grace Kelly out of retirement to star in Marnie. When she declined he returned to Hedren. Not that he was completely wrong. Tippy Hedren could have been the star he wanted her to be. Only he pushed too much and she was not the kind of woman to swallow everything. And when, like in Pygmalion the creator fell in love with his creation, the end of his dream was bitter. Since this happened during the shooting of Marnie we know why the film is such a strange mixture of brilliance and carelessness. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the notorious fox hunt. The whole sequence is a combination of studio and outdoor shots. While the shots with Ms. Hedren are painful to watch because of the bad back projection, the outdoor shots from the helicopter with the stunts look good. The jump over the wall is a good example of how to create something from nothing. Only the editing of this scene creates the accident. The weaker visual things can be easily traced to the final stage of the production, where the matte paintings come in. Albert J. Whitlock has done some great work in many films, why do his paintings show so much in this one? Probably because Hitchcock did not care for a better color and light blending which has to be done with effects like that. The same can be said about the back projection. Someone already pointed out that the unstable quality of the film, although not intentional, reflects the instability of the main character. Looking at the house Marnies mother lives in with the huge (painted) ship behind, one has to admit the scene has a dreamlike quality quite suitable for the memories connected with the place. Hitchcock himself lifted some of his inventions from earlier films to create good effects in this one. One is the revolving background scenery from Vertigo in Marnie's nightmare scene. Or the long shot from a total to end in a close-up of Martin Gabel when he enters the party, which comes all the way from 'Notorious'. And there are completely new things in it too. Never before or again has there been a kiss more involving the audience then the one between Tippy Hedren and Sean Connery in Marnie. Many people rightly call it almost pornographic. Here one can see how important this film has been to Hitchcock in the beginning. We can only be glad for his meticulously planning each scene, otherwise the final product would certainly look much the worse. Or the rape scene done in a way that makes you feel with its victim without showing much violence. Louise Latham leads the list of excellent supporting players. Both Connery and Hedren are great throughout the film, despite or the difficulties there have been. It's a film I never get tired watching!

The truth of the matter is that when I clicked on this movie, I was appalled at the latest review. I do believe it has been a while since I read such ignorance, and I feel that the movie deserves a far better shake than this. First of all, nobody, anywhere, ever, with any intelligence, considers Titus Andronicus as the worst Shakespeare play ever. I have taken many classes on the works of Shakespeare and this play stands out along side Hamlet and A Midsummer Night's Dreams as being on of his most popular works. I have met dozens of professors, actors, and theatre directors that absolutely love this play. If the other review is buried by the time this gets posted, bear with me, somebody made the comment that no one likes this play. That in itself is an absolutely ignorant statement based upon some extremely limited experience. Hollywood adapted this for the same reason they constantly adapt Hamlet, Midsummer, Romeo & Juliet, so on and so forth because it is an amazing play. To say that it is all murder, rape, cannibalism is simply absurd and a sign of either a lack of education, a desire for stupidity or perhaps both. The theorist Peter Brook once made a comment, that at the time I questioned, that if you find a problem with Shakespeare, it is often a problem with you. I thought this was peculiar when I read it, but from reading the review that was posted, I see what he means. To reduce this work to such banalities (not the movie but the play in general in this case) is enormously short sighted and narrow minded to say the least. Now that I am done with my rant, on to the adaptation. It's long if you have a short attention span as many people of my generation do. Not judging, just saying that if you like Armageddon, you probably won't like this. Beyond this, it is a very creative adaptation, visually captivating and the acting was great. Anthony Hopkins was incredible and the man who played the moor was absolutely amazing. The conclusion was well done and Alan Cummings as usual has a terrific performance. If a person says this is the worst adaptation of Shakespeare ever, they obviously have not seen Lurman's Romeo and Juliet.Sweet Jesus it was like watching the cast of Saved by the Bell recite poetry and very poorly. I mention it because Shakespeare is hard to do and the acting is demanding and the actors have to understand very clearly who their character is and why they are talking. Here in Titus it is very well done. Compared to DeCaprio and Danes, the actors here are brilliant. Anyway, enough of my rant.

But then the two seem fairly synonymous, at least if the sheer visceral anger in Tokyo Fist is anything to go by.Those aware of Tsukamoto's feature-length debut Tetsuo (1988) will be familiar with the basic premise in Tokyo Fist; flawed relationship between man and woman is brutally disrupted by an outside element which challenges the protagonist to a potentially lethal, and eventually soul-destroying, duel. Similarly to other pioneers of horror (eg. Cronenberg, Miike), Tsukamoto chooses to use all kinds of repulsive visuals. Just to give you an idea, if a face almost literally falling off after a boxing match is too much for you, it's probably best to stay away from this film.However, the brutal imagery is not completely pointless. Tokyo Fist portrays male anger with such honesty that it is sometimes painful to watch, but that's really the point since violence is not something to be cooed at or to be admired (which is what many Hollywood movies seemingly aim to achieve, witness the way audiences are prompted to cheer for the good guy as he murders the baddie). The violence in Tokyo Fist is allegorical in nature, ie. it stands for something else than just simply fists flying the inability between men and women (and, indeed, men and men) to understand each other ultimately leads to the kind of extreme violence we see on screen. This, ironically, makes Tokyo Fist a part of the great humanist tradition in Japanese cinema, alongside Rashomon and other such movies, because, even though it uses extreme imagery to make a point, it makes the same point all the same if we relish in jealousy, revenge and anger we will only end up destroying each other, and ultimately ourselves. Does Hollywood ever deal with violence this eloquently?Also, as with Tetsuo, the characters in Tokyo Fist seem to live entirely in a world of their own. Many shots frame them either alone, or surrounded by an anonymous mass which fails to notice them or appreciate their presence (even as Tsuda stands in the middle of a shopping mall, his face beaten to a pulp). I can't think of another film-maker who sums up urban alienation as brilliantly as Tsukamoto does; the sheer contradiction of city life, in which a great mass of people are all huddled together at close range, and yet find themselves completely lonely and alienated from one another.For all intents and purposes, Tokyo Fist is a movie which requires a strong stomach and an open mind.

The violence in Tokyo Fist is allegorical in nature, ie. it stands for something else than just simply fists flying the inability between men and women (and, indeed, men and men) to understand each other ultimately leads to the kind of extreme violence we see on screen. This, ironically, makes Tokyo Fist a part of the great humanist tradition in Japanese cinema, alongside Rashomon and other such movies, because, even though it uses extreme imagery to make a point, it makes the same point all the same if we relish in jealousy, revenge and anger we will only end up destroying each other, and ultimately ourselves. Does Hollywood ever deal with violence this eloquently?Also, as with Tetsuo, the characters in Tokyo Fist seem to live entirely in a world of their own. Many shots frame them either alone, or surrounded by an anonymous mass which fails to notice them or appreciate their presence (even as Tsuda stands in the middle of a shopping mall, his face beaten to a pulp). I can't think of another film-maker who sums up urban alienation as brilliantly as Tsukamoto does; the sheer contradiction of city life, in which a great mass of people are all huddled together at close range, and yet find themselves completely lonely and alienated from one another.For all intents and purposes, Tokyo Fist is a movie which requires a strong stomach and an open mind. But it's a great achievement all the same.

In spite of Allen's obsession with prostitutes and porn, he manages to make the lives of his intelligent, but neurotic and dysfunctional characters largely interesting. Here, he takes a common man; a product tester named Fielding Mellish and transforms him into the dictator of a Latin American country. However, the concept turns out funnier than the actual delivery. Before seeing this movie, I thought of films like The Mouse that Roared, The Great Dictator, or Dr. Strangelove, which take the ideas of war, and\/or dictatorships (both normally very serious subjects) and make them hilarious.However, Allen's film never reaches the comedic heights of these other films. First he opens with a confusing scene in which ABC Wide World of Sports covers the assassination of the president of San Marcos. Next we see Fielding at work in a scene that looks like a tribute to Charlie Chaplin's chaotic scene in Modern Times, in which he is made to carry out multiple tasks at the same time, but with less comedic impact than in Chaplin's scene (where Chaplin is even fed while working on an assembly line). Bored and without love in his life, Fielding goes home to his lonely little apartment, and is soon visited by Nancy, an political activist collecting signature for a petition. In order to get her in bed, Fielding convinces Nancy that he agrees with her about her support for the guerrillas fighting the dictatorship of San Marcos, and takes part in a series of demonstrations. After Nancy dumps him because there is something missing in their relationship, Fielding flies to San Marcos, where he fights with the rebels.When the rebels win the war, they name him the new dictator. Fielding then makes a state trip to the U.S. and encounters a smitten Nancy (who not recognizing him, badmouths Fielding). The U.S. Government soon realizes that Fielding is a U.S. citizen, so they put him on trial for trying to sabotage the U.S. Government (or something like that). One of the somewhat humorous moments of the movie is the courtroom scene where Fielding acts both as his own attorney and as a witness for himself. Once that whole nasty treason thing ends, Fielding is free to pursue Nancy again, and the movie ends with yet another ABC Wide World of Sports event. I for one, would have rather watch ABC cover the world of golf than look at this film again. Sorry Woody, but this is not your best effort.

In the end, it's the good acting by the cast that saves it from being a total let down. Holly Hunter shines as a police detective, tough, but still feminine. Aloof, but still accessible to those that take the time. Will Patton starts off good as a detective you like to loath, but then wimps out in the end with some unimaginative epiphany of why Hunter's character loathes him. That could have been avoided.Sigourney Weaver. What can you say about Mrs. Weaver? Another good actress that tends to get lost in roles that fail to accent her acting chops. This role was more suited to her than the likes of Ghostbusters, Alien, and that horrid movie where she was a super hero of sorts. Unfortunately, she's confined to her apartment, so we are forced to focus on her mind and verbal wits only. Dermot Mulroney thankfully has been in better roles than this movie, but he did well as the Detective Cassanova that his role called for. There is a sense that he and Weaver's character had some sort of intimate liason somewhere in the mix, but the film's director got cold feet in 1995 and didn't bother with showing an older woman, younger man romance here. Pity. It might have made things interesting.Harry Connick, Jr. Wow. What a performance! My goodness, I did a triple take on his role as a killer\/stalker\/freak. His voice to me was more frightening than the gotcha moments of the film with the tinkling annoying warning music. The last I have seen of him was Hope Floats and most recently Will and Grace.

It avoids the labored dramatics and contrived resolutions in which so many movies of the genre indulge, and it also declines to shy away from pointing out the more ill-conceived features of the legal system.From his first scene, James Stewart pulls the viewer right into the world of lawyer Paul Biegler. It takes little time before you come to know him and to get a pretty good idea of what his life is like. His scenes with Arthur O'Connell work well in rounding out the picture. The two are neither heroic nor brilliant, but simply sympathetic and believable.Into Biegler's world then come the characters played by Ben Gazzara and Lee Remick, a married couple with more than their share of faults. By making them less than ideal clients, the movie takes a chance on losing the audience's sympathy, but it adds credibility and complexity to the story. Both roles are played well - again, it seems as if you know a lot more about them than is specifically stated.When George C. Scott enters the picture, he adds yet another dimension. His character arrives at just the right time to complicate the plot, and his legal skirmishing with Stewart makes some dry material come to life in an interesting way.

Though his performance in D.A.R.Y.L. is his best, the Bastian role is perhaps the role that made him a cult-figure among NES fans and his own.As for the actors, Tami Stronach was simply remarkable as the Childlike Empress a.k.a.

Under the direction of Wolfgang Petersen, a cast of young talent at the time, and powerful visual effects, this movie will leave you wanting more.*SPOILER*An interesting point because this movie ONLY covers half the book! From my perspective, this movie should have been 3-4 hours long, which should be enough to cover the entire book. Not to mention it would have possibly given the film more of the substance and imagination of the novel. And I must side with Michael Ende, the author, on the fact that the producers used a script that lacked the novel's substance and that the film's technical perfection killed some of the imagination I am craving!Now if the movie had just covered the entire book, we wouldn't have to watch those awful sequels.

This sequel picks right up after Part 3, with Jason being presumed dead, but he isn't of course & this time he's got plenty of victims he can prey on all of whom are staying in two cabins deep in the woods which includes, The Jarvis family & a group of Teenagers, but he also has to deal with a vengeance seeking Hitch Hiker named Rob, who's the brother of one of Jason's previous victims & who must try to protect a young girl named TRISH, her brother TOMMY & whomever else is left alive from winding up on Jason's death list. This Friday has it all, at least all the series trade marks anyways, it's filled with the usual gore, some humour and an overabundance of nudity & violence throughout, in my opinion this sequel is one of the very best in this popular & always fun series, there's plenty of suspense & good acting & directing & the atmosphere & musical score are pretty effective as well. TOM SAVINI returned to do the special effects, while CRISPIN GLOVER & LAWRENCE MONOSON provide the comedy antics (These guy's had great chemistry & were really funny, what a shame they did not do more movies together!) in terms of story the film is none to original, in fact it's really nothing more than a remake of the first film, with the same cardboard characters we usually see in films of this nature, I liked the California shooting sights though, it's much more colourful & livelier looking then the east coast locations from the first three, Director Joseph Zito, although bringing nothing new to the party, does spoof the conventions of the genre, specifically poking fun at & having fun with the sexual starved teen characters all of whom meet their (painful looking) deaths after or during a sexual act, a doctor & nurse making out near Jason's body are killed (his head sawed off) & the Nurse jabbed with a scalpel between the breasts & gutted, an unfaithful boyfriend getting a spear to the groin area & hoisted up in the air, Ted another teen is stabbed in the back of the head through a film projector watching dirty old movies, a virginal teen & his bad girl girlfriend as well as two other virginal teens who decide to give up their much vaunted virginity are killed violently for doing so, a naked girl is impaled with a blade through the boat, the banana eating hitchhiker has a blade driven through her throat, causing her to vomit up the chewed remains of the banana which could be symbolization of Fellating.

Another thing I liked about the film & probably the reason this remains my favourite entry in the series is that the film really did intend to end the series here, however unlike most series ending films, that leave a lot of fans dissatisfied with the final results, THE FINAL CHAPTER is able to hit each nail on the head, it delivers all of it's kills (some of the best special effects & kill scenes TOM SAVINI has ever done!), nudity, suspense, great, fun, memorable characters & the portrayal of Jason (done marvellously by TED WHITE who is definitely the best stunt men to ever don the hockey mask) & Jason's hideous face (one of Savini's best works! Jason's arguably never been so ugly!) when he is finally unmasked in the final scene & his eventual violent demise at the hands of a young TOMMY JARVIS (Played by a young & talent COREY FELDMAN) & attractive cast of hot girls & guys in spades!

Just create a couple of oddballs who have gloriously fractured conversations about any sort of bizarre thing, throw in a bunch of random stuff and an eccentric supporting cast, and don't worry if the plot doesn't actually go anywhere. Think Caddyshack with more cursing, a perfect film for regurgitating around a water cooler rather than watching on screen.Jeff Bridges is the Dude, Jeff Lebowski, who because of some confusion with another Jeff Lebowski whose wife owes money to a sleazy porn merchant, finds himself the target of two toughs who soil his rug. Trouble accumulates as he seeks restitution and is recruited to help rescue the other Lebowski's kidnapped wife. Complications ensue when the other Lebowski's daughter seeks him out for a sperm donation, a gang of nihilists threaten his johnson, a detective trails after him in a blue Beetle, and stuff keeps happening to his car. The worst part is the constant interference from his bowling buddy, Walter (John Goodman), who sees parallels with Vietnam for everything, blows the ransom delivery, and butts heads with a rival bowler with a sex-offender past.I don't know, that doesn't read funny. But the movie is funny, especially when Walter and the Dude bicker. Getting this across from writing dialogue excerpts is not possible, not because of the profanity so much as the delivery, which is how it comes together. If comedic acting got the respect it deserves, Goodman would have been nominated for an Oscar; his Walter is a brilliant contrast of sudden rage and anal nitpicking (The chinaman is not the issue here, dude. I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude. Across this line, you DO NOT... Also, dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please.) Even Goodman's presence, wearing pus-colored sunglasses and a perpetual scowl under a buzzcut, is a marvel.But Goodman's brilliance is in how well he walks the fine line set by the Coen Brothers in a typically challenging film for actors. Bridges is very good, too, but Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro and other good actors are so mannered they become annoying.Also, the story lines just kind of meander with no direction, like the Coens are ridiculing you for attempting to care about how any of it turns out. Did the Dude ever get a new rug? Did he and Walter win the match against Jesus the child molester? What the heck was the point of the cowboy narrator? If you care enough to ask such questions, it's like you are just the butt of the Coens' joke? Who's the %$&@ing nihilists here?The film's weaknesses are evident even in the moments that shine, like a trio of musical comedy numbers done to music by Bob Dylan and Kenny Rogers. They are witty, vibrant set pieces that come in out of nowhere and charge quickly into various cartoony bits, but then meander and drizzle away, lamely explained as acid flashbacks the Dude keeps having when he is knocked out. They don't add anything to the story, but in that sense, at least they are consistent with the rest of what's presented.The Coen Brothers remind me of the '70s jazz popsters Steely Dan, two arch standoffish types who are expert entertainers and creative geniuses but somewhat handicapped by their acerbic pose. They don't like being mistaken for someone who cares. The Coens have made some terrific films, like Raising Arizona and O Brother, Where Art Thou? and some overrated ones like Fargo and this. It's a film designed to make people laugh, and that's nice of them, but when one of the big jokes in the film involves casually killing off one of the good guys, you have to wonder whether the joke is really on you.

So, the journey begins and along this journey, Stiller comes into contact with his mother and father, but they turn out not to be his parents after all. Now, two cops are part of the Stiller's group.Then finally, we meet his real parents, Lily Tomliin and Alan Alda. Now comes one of the best family\/dinner table scenes ever shown in a movie. Alda's character is so funny that I almost died laughing. The acting is superb and the whole family appears to be so normal, until we find out about their acid and LSD problem.Some people probably won't appreciate Russell's humor because his humor isn't for everyone. A lot of the humor is very character based and dry (sort of similar to Wes Anderson's idea of funny).Well, after seeing this movie, people will hopefully appreciate the thought David O.

War is pure hell and Americans had a taste of it in 9\/11. But for Hollywood nothing is sacred, and no theme is sweet enough to satisfy the taste of the public for sugared food.

A cute kid's doll is once again the unlikely home of Charles Lee Ray, notorious serial killer, again feeding off of the surrealism created by seeing a kid's doll screw it's face into expressions of the purest rage and spouting all manner of profanities. By now, Ray is becoming more and more desperate to get out of the body of the doll, because as we were informed in the first film, if he spends too much time in that body he'll gradually become more and more human until one day he'll be stuck in it forever. Needless to say, Ray's a lot more interested in starting life over as a 6-year-old (and who wouldn't?) rather than spending the rest of his life as a plastic doll.Although, given that he becomes more human the longer he is in that body, how human will he eventually become? Will he ever reach full human-hood? My guess is that he'll gradually approach being a real human being in a sort of half life, where he gets closer and closer and closer but never actually gets there, kind of like computer generated actors. There is currently much talk about how close computers can ever get to animating convincingly real people into the movies, and the leading theory seems to be something akin to my theory of Chucky turning human. He'll always get closer but he'll never get all the way there.At any rate, Andy's mother has landed in a mental institution and Andy has been taken in by a foster family with appropriate mental vacuity to be a horror movie surrogate family. When Andy becomes frightened and runs through the house, his foster father grabs him and says, 'Rule #1, no running in the house!' OK, 'dad,' but not even when I open a closet and find myself confronted by the doll that landed my mom in the nuthouse and almost cost me my life and my very soul? My God, man, what the hell is this guy doing with a Good Guys doll in the house in the first place? It's difficult enough trying to figure out why it's even there WITHOUT having to watch this mental giant grab Andy by the arm and ask him what on earth is the matter.There are some funny moments in the film, such as when Chucky smashes the head of the innocent Good Guys doll, buries it, and takes its place in the house, and my favorite, when Chucky is later addressed by a doting adult, Chucky responds by saying in his cute doll voice, 'Hi! I'm&#133;.Tommy!'The stockholders in the Play Pal corporation are distressed over the suffering that the company has endured due to the negative publicity of the events of the first movie provide the premise for the movie's rather impressive finale. In order to generate a more positive image for the company and the doll, they have decided to reintroduce it into the market. The original Chucky doll was collected by the company and examined by toy-makers, who decided that there really was nothing truly wrong with it, it was not really a demon-possessed toy, so they decided to melt it down and remake it. Why they didn't just throw it away I'm not really sure, but who cares. Waste not, want not, I guess.At any rate, Chucky comes back in a fresh plastic body (too bad he can't be transferred to a human as easily as he can be transferred from one doll body to another), and once again resumes his quest for Andy's soul. I've heard complaints about why Chucky had to go after Andy and couldn't just find a bum on the street or something, but you'll remember in the first movie, the conditions of his plastic entrapment stated that he could only transfer into the body of the first person that he revealed his identity to once he was inside the Chucky doll.Jarrett Friend, writing for HorrorWatch, made the above suggestion having forgotten that little stipulation, but also smartly suggested that the plot should have involved a huge number of Chucky dolls, since the original doll was melted down and whose plastic conceivably should have infected much more dolls than just the one that we saw in this movie. This would have made the movie much more interesting and added another level of originality; my guess is they just didn't have the budget for something that big.Nevertheless, even though the first sequel in the Child's play series comes dangerously close to falling into that sophomore sequel chasm of falling flat because of obviously feeding off the success of its predecessor without having much of anything to add to the story, Child's Play 2 escapes into the world of moderately acceptable horror sequels, kind of like Psycho II, which had no hope of matching its predecessor but at least was able to justify its own existence. I think it's easy to be put off by the conclusion of Child's Play 2, but I was pretty impressed with the toy factory setting, if only because it created such a great atmosphere for Chucky to make his hunt and Andy and his foster sister Kyle to try vainly to escape. There was some pretty clever stuff in the final act of the film, not including, however, the scene where Kyle and Andy run around completely lost, making the factory seem like a maze by editing together a lot of clips of them clearly running around the same corner half a dozen times or so. A bit trite, but nothing compared to my biggest gripe of the film, which is the final scene, one of the goofier things that I've seen on an otherwise at least moderately competent horror movie. Odd for a movie to try so hard to live up to its expectations and then belittle itself with something like what I'll just call the air hose scene. I do, however, think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got.

I do, however, think that the movie was successful and good enough to deserve a better DVD than it got. I can't stand it when the only extra features on the DVD for a successful film are nothing but some foreign audio tracks and cast and crew history that is nothing more than a brief biography and a list of film credits. What do you think the IMDb is for? ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"}]
