There's not a doubt in my mind.  I have seen many films in this genre, but none, none come near the brilliance of this one.  I have heard several criticisms over the years and I always find this interesting, because typically the hangups people have about this film are personal hangups, and are shortcomings that stem from the viewer's projection of those hangups on to the film.  That unfortunately is one of the few obstacles that stands in the way of film possessing total universality.  Of course the obvious hangup is people that read the Stephen King novel first and didn't appreciate the fact that the film was a departure from the source.  Well I hate to differ with you, but the film is ten times better than any book Stephen King could ever write.  The simple and undeniable fact is that Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors ever if not the best and the same can certainly not be said for King as a writer.  The changes that Kubrick made to the film gave it a depth in its medium that King's novel seldom exhibited.  Some other examples of hangups would be people who won't watch or disapprove of films like Raging Bull, because they have a strong aversion to violence, or people who think films like The Searchers and Vertigo are overrated because they don't take those genres seriously.  So in order to see this film for what it really is and not be blinded by your prejudices, simply sit down, leave your hangups at the door, and watch your superficiality and pretentiousness melt away in the resplendent light of this radiant film.  The photography by Kubrick's terrific visual collaborator John Alcott is unbelievable.  Kubrick in his youth broke in as a photographer, and the incredible photography of his films are testimonies to that background.  The performance by Jack Nicholson is amazing, maybe the best of his career, certainly the most animated and entertaining.  I know that some will say that it is over the top, but it fits the film perfectly.  The biggest difference between the film and the novel is that in the novel it is purely the hotel that is evil, and in the film Jack is someone looking for an escape, not just to work on his novel, but to escape the failure that his life has become, to be something he could never be in reality, to renounce his responsibility, to renounce his shortcomings and awaken into the person he wants to be.  The hotel provides him with that opportunity, and in the nightmare scene which is a spectacular metaphor Jack's subconscious after a lifetime of social and moral repression is finally awakening.  This accents the relationship between modern man (his relationship\/kinship to the hotel which is obviously intended as a metaphor for escape or retreat) and his carnal need to become something greater than what he is perfectly.  The bottomline is the performances are great, the script is great, the direction is flawless, and the photography as always is unique and interesting.  The splits and doublings have never been as fully accomplished or realized in any other film ever made, and I should mention that though I labeled this a horror film at the beginning of my critique it is so much more.  This film transcends not only the genre, but cinema in general.  Also, not to be ignored is the wonderful symmetry of music and imagery to create intense fear in the audience.  Last but not least the ending is so much more expressive and unique than the typical horror ending that the book had to offer, in seeing it you come to understand that as is so often the case in life there is more than one side to the coin of every entity.  This is an immaculate film made by an immaculate filmmaker and any shortcomings that are perceived exist in the minds of the viewer and not on screen.  The viewers that will be blase, critical, or indifferent in regards to this film are intellectually indolent peasants (lacking vision and imagination) who don't deserve to delight in a film of such nonpareil substance.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 April 2001","score":"9 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers herein.One of the most exciting promises of film is the ability to transport us to different worlds. Because a film carries information about the viewer, a skilled filmmaker can literally turn us into someone different for a while. So one would think that being transported to the rather alien world of Spanish film would be a welcome adventure. But this - at least - disappoints.Latins differ from Northern Europeans and nearly all North Americans in how they deal with abstraction. For Northerners, there is a notion of pure, higher values, apart from life. Stories illustrate great ideas, conflicts, questions, and no matter how realistic the situation shown, we know it is merely representative. This is a cultural convention found even in comedies and `date' movies. Check it out.Latins instead have a notion of a world centered in real people and real events where small acts aggregate. When common themes emerge, they grow out of life, so in art we have abstractions from life rather than life illustrating some invisible clockworks. Consequently, when Pedro tells a story, he becomes obsessed with a culturally rooted notion of honesty. The primary value we are supposed to appreciate here is his honesty, then the honesty of his actresses (the nonwomen men are just buffoons and poltroons), and finally, the honesty of the `real' characters.Then he takes all the self-referential tricks of his northern brethren and grafts them on. So here we have the film portraying a life, portrayed in a play, which references a film. The actors play characters playing actors. Some roles are transplanted from one to another - and just so we will not miss this, our heroine is a transplant facilitator who leaves her job to follow her son's heart.Actually, in another context, this could work well. And in fact there are several even recent films which successfully use much the same devices. But here, the notions of abstraction clash. Pedro wants to pander to Spanish notions of Olympian soap opera, and at the same time be considered a `serious' filmmaker by global viewers (well, forget the viewers to judge from his interviews, it is the critics who are targeted). Sorry, just doesn't mix - doesn't work in either venue.An unrelated complaint is Barcelona. What a wonderful place this city was built for films. Some filmmakers would truly use this opportunity to exploit Gaudi's notions of motion in space what else is film? But here, we have a lost opportunity, save some colored tiles.

The buildings are all really burnt out, the actors are just Bosnians they found in the street, and the Holiday Inn, is the actual Holiday Inn where journalists stayed during the crisis.

The most intelligent film to be made on this subject was Wag the Dog, ironically also starring Deniro... that film didn't make money either.  To create a bigoted, ill-conceived social commentary that can't figure out what it's for or against-- and would rather blow things up for no reason than try to make any useful suggestions-- is such an incredible waste of time, that it makes me even angrier than the Russians in the film.  Unlike them, however, I'm not a fictional character written by a brain-dead film student who does nothing but watch cable TV all day.  The only thing this film might EVER inspire is copycat crimes from people too dumb to realize that this film is even dumber than they are.Oh, and by the way, the movie is poorly paced, scenes take place for no reason, characters exist just so they can shout when the movie gets boring (which is every 2 minutes), and there's not even an ending.  The director just blows everything up and lets you sit back and think about how deep he is.  I've stepped in puddles that were deeper.1\/10, which includes the bonus point for Deniro's acting.

In the book he comes across as a true psychopath highly intelligent and cultured (self-taught), more multifaceted, but narrowly focused,  and with a single but major character flaw, namely the nonchalance with which he not only kills his enemies, but also eats bits of them. In the films he is much more crazed killer than cultured man of the world, his violence more easily triggered whenever he feels trapped. This is not a complaint, it makes the book more readable and the film more watchable, but there is in my view a real distinction between the two Hannibals. The credit for this acceptability is obviously due to Anthony Hopkins who, despite Ridley Scott's best attempts, embues Hannibal with real characterisation. What made me say that? The fact the Scott leaves out the most important background information in the story by far why Hannibal has such (paternal\/fraternal?) feelings for Starling, and what made him the cannibal he is, namely that as a child he witnessed the killing and eating of his little sister by crazed mountain folk, facts of which Starling are not aware, but are his continual obsession. In her mind any empathy comes from her admittance to vulnerability in the original Silence of the Lambs episode. Scott never offers us any kind of background or characterisation, he is just content to make a decent thriller\/horror film by numbers. If Boris Karlof had been alive today he would have used him. He made the same mistake in Gladiator. In fact the staccato pace with which the first half of the film moves along proves my point, that Ridley Scott is anxious to put away all necessary background and get to the horror and gore. OK, there is fine dividing line (not quite successfully drawn in the book) between making Hannibal interesting and making him likeable, and I don't ever want to be faced with Hannibal the Musical with Julia Roberts as Starling and a Sound of Chewing chorus of flesh-eating offspring, but more fleshing out (no pun intended) of their relationship and fascination for each other would have made the film so much more interesting, in fact moved it on to a different level. The lighting effects were borrowed from Bladerunner, and the music from Alien 3, and it was painfully obvious that none of the main actors were ever actually in Florence during the shoot. Compare this with Seven, Copycat or Heat, where a slow but steady build-up and oodles of characterisation made those three films what they are. I could suggest that Ridley Scott was never allowed by Dino de Laurentis (the producer)to include those pauses for breath that make films so much better, and which were so successfully used in Alien and Bladerunner, both five star movies.

We need a competent never-heard-of-before actress, who doesn't even remotely look like Jodi Foster, to play token female, typically competent, bitter, world weary, shafted-by-her-corrupt-superiors FBI agent. Julianne who? How many dollars? OK, we'll take her! She did a highly competent job within the constraints of Scott's directing, I hope we will see more of her work, and I do not agree that she merely attempted to play Foster playing Starling - she was never given the chance.

Perhaps it was more emotional for me than for other people, since my grandfather perished in the siege of Stalingrad.The movie has superb acting as well as few flaws. Jude Law gave wonderful performance, he looked 100% Russian soldier during the siege, thin, dirty, desperate. I liked Joseph Fiennes's Othello like jealosy, when he saw Vassili and Tania together. Rachel Weizs and especially Ed Harris were superb too.  Visuals of battle scenes and pictures of city devastation were stunning, the war was bloody and ugly, like every war really is. I am quite surprised that nobody here mentions the most obvious goof, the fact that Nikita Khruschev NEVER was neither commander in chief, nor major officer of the Stalingrad front. In fact, he was a political officer like Danilov during the war. I am not even sure if he was at Stalingrad at all. It almost escaped my mind, why would screenwriter put him in this position, when I realized that Khruschev is well known in America. He famously gave speech in United Nations and put missiles in Cuba. While the real mastermind behind Russian victory in Stalingrad (as well as the whole WWII victory on Eastern Front in Europe) was general Georgiy Zhukov. But who would know him in America, except for geeks, watching the History Channel? Given the fact that movie slightly exagerrates with painting Russian Army black, perhaps it is not too bad, that Khrushev will take the blame instead of real hero Zhukov. Though Khruschev's son is a history professor and naturalized American citizen now, I think he has a strong case for libel. Anyway, the movie is fiction, not a documentary, at least here Russians won, not somebody else (case in point, U-571). As many people have already pointed, movie also downplays the fact that Russians fought for survival and defended their motherland and did not always have to be motivated with bullets from their own political officers.In spite of these obvious flaws, I still think that this is a great movie. It shows courageous and noble people as well as the scum. And what is the greatest thing, that now Americans will learn that Russians fought in WWII too!

Perhaps it was more emotional for me than for other people, since my grandfather perished in the siege of Stalingrad.The movie has superb acting as well as few flaws. Jude Law gave wonderful performance, he looked 100% Russian soldier during the siege, thin, dirty, desperate. I liked Joseph Fiennes's Othello like jealosy, when he saw Vassili and Tania together. Rachel Weizs and especially Ed Harris were superb too.  Visuals of battle scenes and pictures of city devastation were stunning, the war was bloody and ugly, like every war really is. I am quite surprised that nobody here mentions the most obvious goof, the fact that Nikita Khruschev NEVER was neither commander in chief, nor major officer of the Stalingrad front. In fact, he was a political officer like Danilov during the war. I am not even sure if he was at Stalingrad at all. It almost escaped my mind, why would screenwriter put him in this position, when I realized that Khruschev is well known in America. He famously gave speech in United Nations and put missiles in Cuba. While the real mastermind behind Russian victory in Stalingrad (as well as the whole WWII victory on Eastern Front in Europe) was general Georgiy Zhukov. But who would know him in America, except for geeks, watching the History Channel? Given the fact that movie slightly exagerrates with painting Russian Army black, perhaps it is not too bad, that Khrushev will take the blame instead of real hero Zhukov. Though Khruschev's son is a history professor and naturalized American citizen now, I think he has a strong case for libel. Anyway, the movie is fiction, not a documentary, at least here Russians won, not somebody else (case in point, U-571). As many people have already pointed, movie also downplays the fact that Russians fought for survival and defended their motherland and did not always have to be motivated with bullets from their own political officers.In spite of these obvious flaws, I still think that this is a great movie. It shows courageous and noble people as well as the scum. And what is the greatest thing, that now Americans will learn that Russians fought in WWII too!

What could've gone wrong?An ageing football coach named Tony (Pacino) finds himself struggling with his personal and professional life while trying to hold his team together. A star quarterback has been knocked out of the game and a naive football player replaces him only to become exposed to the world of sports and become a danger to himself and to his players. Meanwhile, the coach finds himself constantly at battle with the team owner's money and power hungry daughter Christine (Cameron Diaz) intent on moving the team out.Any Given Sunday made a decent amount of money at the box office and movie-reviewers enjoyed it. However, if you look at it from a different perspective, Any Given Sunday is too flawed to be enjoyed and has a touch of decency which makes it a film that doesn't deserved to be universally panned. Luckily for the team on-screen and off-screen, this film got hardly any bad ratings, most people rated it as the average mediocre movie. I was one of them, but I found a lot of flaws in the script and timing. The characters weren't developed enough before they started screeching at each other, it's simply too long and I left the cinema with the headache. However, Any Given Sunday is sometimes quite exciting and the cast make it bearable enough for the lazy running time.Since the film is based on American football, it is mainly aimed at an American audience, which is unfortunate for eager New Zealander's like myself. Oliver Stone's decision to go completely technical is sometimes acceptable, but to be honest, he needs to desperately measure up his game some time soon.

Well, washed-up is a little harsh, perhaps, but he's written exactly one book - five years ago. And he's had writer's block ever since. At present, he's a shambling, shifty, scruffy, sloppy, disheveled college professor in the field of creative writing. In the morning, his wife leaves him. I lost a wife today, he later tells his agent Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.). To which Crabtree responds, You'll find another. You always do.Grady has a student living at his house (she was there before the wife left, so yes, it's platonic). Another student, James Lear (the ineffectual Tobey Maguire) is obsessed with death and can recite in alphabetical order the names of famous celebrity suicides. Then there's Grady's mistress, the chancellor of the college (Frances McDormand). Oh, and there's a blind dog who hates Grady, too. And a transvestite. And so it goes.Anyone who's ever written something, whether they've been assigned to do so or just want to do it of their own volition, has at sometime or another had a problem getting started. With this review, in fact, I didn't know where to begin. Once you get started, you're ok. Well, Grady's problem is quite the opposite. He has a different kind of writer's block, you see. He has diarrhea of the mind. He's been working on this book for five years. He has accumulated over 2,000 pages. The ending keeps getting further and further away, he says in voice-over narration. Grady can't seem to finish his novel not because he can't figure out what to write but because he can't stop writing.His agent, Crabtree, is in dire straits. Grady's all he has left, and in New York the other literary agents laugh at him. He comes to Grady's school during Word Week, an English Department-sponsored gathering designed to be a way for some of the brighter writers to sell their works to attending agents. Crabtree is a well-developed figure, too, and it seems to me that Downey Jr. was probably the wisest choice to play him. Downey Jr. turns in a magnificent, understated performance that's the backbone of the film.Maguire, as the critical character James, takes underplaying to a new level. He delivers his line in an almost-catatonic, droll monotone. Granted, there are several scenes in which this makes sense, but not all the time. Maguire's mannerisms are as deep as a puddle, and this is nothing new for the so-called wunderkind. I saw him in Pleasantville and The Cider House Rules, to name a couple, and in neither was he more than mildly interesting. With that in mind, I was not disappointed in his work here.McDormand is excellent in her brief scenes as the chancellor. She's assuredly one of the best actresses working today, as her work here and in Almost Famous attests. She's strong, iron-willed, charming, angry, petulant,and loving. A perfect foil for Douglas' Grady.And Douglas himself is a lot of fun. He's so much the victim in here, but so much is also his own doing. He's not a bad guy, and he tries his hardest to make things right, but as happens so often with guys in movies, what he tries fails, and what he doesn't try haunts him.
