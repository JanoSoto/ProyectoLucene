There were a number of memorable moments in that experience.It was pretty much a guarantee that fully 50% of the audience had bolted by the end of the first reel. The print from New Line was loaded onto 2 oversize reels so it was real easy to take note of this. Curiously enough, most people did not ask for their money back (all of a buck in those days) since the film group I was involved in did show a lot of art films. Either people felt that they had got the idea and\/or they just saw it pointless to go further into it. I have not seen the film in a long time but I think some of the more disquieting things may not have even happened by the midpoint of the picture but oh well. Kinda like Eraserhead in that people bolt, but in that film it is the squab chicken dinner that usually started the exodus, and if you had made it past the beastly baby sequence you were liable to stay until the end. Besides Eraserhead had only a 20-30% bolt rate (mostly women) perhaps in testimony to the budding cult reputation David Lynch was building at the time (1978 or so)...As I recall at one showing one of the reels fell off the projector and the projectionist had to chase it down the aisle of a narrow rectangular room all while the film was running. Classic.While it formally wasn't really one of Herzog's most challenging films (not like watching a plane land over and over as in Fata Morgana) is certainly is the subject matter that really pushes most people to the limit. I agree with most reviewers here in that the anarchy indicates that freedom alone doesn't necessarily lead to liberation. I had forgotten some of the cruel animal things seen in the film - Herzog was known to push the limit but that would not fly so well these days no matter how much one could justify it in terms of artistic expression. Knowing that Crispin Glover is in on the Herzog oeuvre makes perfect sense. I think the ultimate point to be taken from the film is that once you cut people loose from any sort of societal moorings, it is hard to predict what or if there will be any new world order whatsoever. What is the point of being free if you can't drive a car, your own people are liable to exploit you, and you are far away from any relief from this environment? Might as well wreck everything.

It is as soon as they see each other the sparks fly, and within minutes, his psychological issues are revealed for his colleagues and the audience to observe. It's apparent that he's possibly as psychotic as the female patient who declares her hatred for men to Bergman, then flirting with one while scratching their arms with her cat-like nails.Peck immediately displays a hatred to the color white and anything with straight line patterns. It's soon revealed, of course, that he isn't the doctor, but a victim of amnesia who may or may not have killed the real head shrink. Before she can even pack, Bergman goes off on the lamb to help him, which instantly allerts the police to her involvement with him. They elude the police at both Penn Station and Grand Central, and end up at Bergman's mentor's home, where the mystery begins to unfold. A very graphic flashback of Peck's childhood reveals the initial reason for his psychosis, and after very soon, it becomes very clear to Bergman whom the real villain is. Michael Chekhov plays Bergman's mentor, who happened to know the real head shrink, while Leo G. Carroll is the psychiatrist he is replacing. Peck and Bergman are an outstanding pair; I don't know if I'd want someone so quietly troubled as Bergman to analyze me, but for shear performances, this is film acting at its best, with two then captivatingly beautiful people at their height.The finale is as gripping as anything Hitchcock has ever done, with a huge surprise twist that comes totally out of nowhere but makes perfect sense. One of the great things in Hitchcock's films is that his writers didn't write for movie characters-they wrote for real people. The characters in these movies don't talk in those polite classic terms that dominated 95 percent of the movies of this era. They are often confused and awkward in their verbal revelation of their thoughts, just like human beings many times are. There's no predictability in the way the characters communicate. While psychiatry has come along way since 1945, it still gives thought to the wonderment if analysis always works for everybody, and if any human being can really fully understand how the human mind works or if it can ever be totally cured. And with new neurosis being discovered since then (most notably Bi-Polarism), I'll give credit to the person who said they never trust anybody who claims to be sane. So if you want to really dig into your own analysis of the psychiatric profession and the human mind, watch this movie with someone whose opinion on the same subject you are interested in, then discuss. This is one of those rare movies that really can send your brain to work, yet have a lot of fun with at the same time.

This is one of several things which make this film stand out and make it just a little different from other similar movies. For example, the original attackers are never seen again, elevating Paul's subsequent actions from simple revenge to all out war against the criminal underworld of New York, which has the knock on effect of scaring off the other criminals and making the general populace tougher. I especially enjoyed the part where the building foreman says about the mugger he and his crew caught, Well we roughed him up a little, and the news reporter then says, the mugger had two broken arms, a broken leg and cracked ribs or something like that.Also good is how it shows the evolution of Kersey's various reactions to his circumstances from being afraid to hold a sock of coins, to being sick after he shoots his first victim, to actively going out and flashing his money around, attracting potential muggers so he can kill them.Bronson's facial expressions are exceptional, looking genuinely surprised and shocked by his potential muggers while at the same time shooting them, sometimes twice to make sure they are dead.Another point that makes it stand out from the norm is that Paul's getting away with it is not a result of a sympathetic detective telling him he has a five minute head-start or something like that, but is officially sanctioned for reasons that make perfect sense.OK so the rape scene is brutal, but I would say necessary and in the context of this film justified.

A cooked chicken, statues of bats or bird and more. One victim jumps out a window one runs out of church and gets killed by a stage coach and one stabs himself thinking creatures are in his shirt harming him. The special affects in it were amazing. Holmes could not attend the funeral of one of the victims because of his expulsion from Brompton Academy.Watson's experience after being shot with the drug was funny. A grave opened up at the cemetery that had all kinds of pastries on shelves. The pastries started jumping off the shelf,on to the ground & Watson talking to each other. They were all different sizes and shapes with big eyes and some pastries started shoving other pastries in to Watson mouth cherry cream and all. Really humorous.Earlier in the movie Watson finds a dart blowpipe which belongs to an Egyptian cult worshiping Osiris god of the underworld. This cult sacrifices live people in a hot substance. Sherlock finds this temple and stops the sacrifice and escapes. Later he realizes there is a cult operating in this city which is causing the deaths of men that knew each other.Sherlock was in love in this movie which at the end it said the writers did not know what young Sherlock would have been like and that they just respectably put some things in.This film was very violent and tense. It is about 145 minutes long.It was like one of the Indiana Jones movies with the cult members running for their life and the building falling down.This is one movie that did not disappoint me but scared the pastry out of me.

So even if historically inaccurate in detail, it gave some important information about how Cornwallis managed to lose the war.

However, the first film wasn't all that great and this one isn't a complete washout either. The story is modified somewhat from the first episode so that now the source of the poltergeist unrest is attributed to the dead followers of a cult leader, as opposed to the dead disturbed by unscrupulous property developers. The change has really only been made so that they can have a sequel to be perfectly honest, however, it does mean that the series is able to introduce the evil Reverend Kane. Kane is probably the best character in the series and his scene where he confronts the Freeling family on their front porch is the scariest and most well-crafted moment in any of the films. Julien Beck is excellent and unforgettable as the skeletal preacher. The rest of the cast play it strictly by numbers, although once again Heather O'Rourke is fab as the little girl. The other daughter is completely written out of this film with no explanation. Although it's a well documented fact that the actress who played her, Dominique Dunne, was murdered shortly after the first film was released, I still don't think it would have trashed her memory to have explained her absence; quite the opposite in fact.The Poltergeist series was perhaps most famous at the time for its spectacular visual effects and this film is no exception. The demon Kane is a well rendered creation, and there are a number of cool 80's effects throughout. Unfortunately, though, it all ends in a somewhat underwhelming finale where the family enter some vortex or something. I think it would have been better if they had cut back on the special-effects here and simply re-introduced Reverend Kane, as he was much scarier.

The bright colors, and cartoonish performance of Robin Williams & Joan Cusack, while the basic plot, and casting of 'serious' actors like Mr. Gambon, would appeal to the adults. You'd have thought they WOULD have made something...'toy-ish...' But, whenever I saw ANY parts of this film - the sets, the dialogue - any of it always comes across as cold. Remote, and extremely off-putting.Yes - I GET the premise; as toys get more advanced, (and 'remote' pardon the pun), they become closer to weapons. Why, just look at video games (and since this movie was made almost 20 years ago, the technology is ever more closer to 'reality.'But, this whole film is so...cold.

Along with Avatar, Titanic shows me that audiences are less clever than they should be and fall for superficial drivel. The biggest problem about Titanic is that it isn't about Titanic at all. We could just as easily called this sinking ship or it could just as easily have taken place on the Lusitania, and the story would still have ignored the tragedy whether it was an iceberg or a U-Boat that sank the ship.What is most disappointing is the film could have been a wonderful set piece and could have produced compelling drama. For instance, Molly Brown was actually a real leader on the life boats and took care of the sick and injured on the Carpathia, and mail room workers sacrificed their lives to try and save the mail for people back in the States. Granted, these are but a few instances of bravery, and a film needs central characters for a plot, but the story decided to focus on something petty and unrealistic in the face of true drama.The problem with the romance is this it's contrived and it moves WAY too quickly. First, there is the issue that Jack totally takes advantage of Rose. She was about to jump off the Titanic. She clearly has some depression issues, and he thinks it's a good time to woo her? And Rose herself is a contradictory character. She seems to hate the life of a rich woman without independence, but she also looks down at Jack's social status as not being sophisticated enough. Besides, if she hated Cal that much she could just leave. Perhaps you say that Jack had to be the catalyst to that decision. That's fine, but remember that giving advice is one thing, swooping in and starting a tryst is another.And about Jack and Rose's relationship itself, just how prevalent could it have been, even in the 1990's, for a couple to engage in intercourse after knowing each other just two nights? Yes, it happens but not on average, especially between two people from totally different worlds like Jack and Rose and in the 1910's! And just where does anyone think the relationship would have gone after Titanic docked? Does Rose expect Jack, clearly a drifter, to provide for a family? For all of her desire to be independent and taken seriously, I don't think Rose wants to be destitute. I can understand the events if the two grew up together, but relationships that move this fast tend to be based on impulse, not love, and so they end up failing, yet as an audience, we are expected to believe that true love blossomed and died on screen. I felt like I was watching an episode of 90210. I'm sorry, but that is the definition of contrived. I am not saying scrap a love story period, but this relationship became a smokescreen for dividing classes. The movie goes out of its way to say that Jack is Jack because he is poor, and it can't work with Rose if he is rich.I know it may not be fair to bring up Avatar, but it does expose some of Titanic's characterization flaws. Our villains Cal Hockley and Rose's mother, much like the military and the corporation in Avatar are totally evil and Rose and Jack and the Na'Vi are totally good. The first class passengers are totally obnoxious. The third class is totally noble and blameless. So caricatures of people or groups of them constitute good writing? Granted, the struggle for third class to get to the deck for lifeboats was actually somewhat compelling, but it doesn't change the fact that everyone is portrayed at an extreme. The fact that people heralded the film is a sign that the audience accepted those caricatures and extreme portrayals as accurate.I will give the film some merit though. The design of Titanic has stood the test of time. After twelve years and change, it's still a beautiful set to see. Costumes, lighting and the ship itself are appealing and put the viewer directly in the setting. It's really a shame that style over substance has become Cameron's focus. His previous films actually had character studies. Aliens was a piece on Ripley's development and a Vietnam parallel. Can Titanic boast such a comparison? No. Still, it looked as good as the rest of his films.Titanic, for all its popularity, boils down to a superficial 1990's teen drama that targeted girls aged 15-18. That it decided to manifest itself during a tragic calamity is an insult. Why so many people older than 18 couldn't see Titanic for what it really was, is the bigger insult. Perhaps it reminded many of spontaneity long gone and that they wanted it again. Good Burger reminds me that I want a juicy sandwich from In and Out but that doesn't mean Good Burger was a good film.
