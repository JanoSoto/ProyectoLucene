Well the acting is tremendous, let's just get that out of the way right off the bat. Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges are very deserving of their Oscar nominations. However the movie fails because it uses these great actors in what ultimately turns out to be a decent, yet mediocre movie. There was certainly nothing tremendous, or unique about this story. We have seen this all before with our previous president. Sex scandals are condemning, but not enough to keep someone from getting to the position that they want to get to (and keep in mind, they never disclosed to the public that the incident never happened, so in the public's mind, the Allen character was...well guilty for lack of a better word). In fact our past President's story is much more riveting because he was the President when the scandal happened, and it happened in the White House. Now I know this movie tries to put a different spin on this issue by using a woman as the character caught in an alleged sex scandal, and suggesting that because it is a woman it is different. In other words a woman would never get a way with this kind of scandal and a man would. However, if they wanted to feed off of that different spin then they should have provided different results from what occurred in the Clinton scandal. Instead the same results were exhibited. The Democrats said who cares, and the Republicans said hang her. If they wanted to make it so different then everyone would have wanted her out of the picture, period. This movie also got a little caught up in the Democrat good, Republican bad idea. If the story could have been a little more objective, then it would have been a little more powerful. And one more thing, I don't care if it is a woman, a man, a Democrat, or a Republican. If you put someone in the position that the Joan Allen character was in, and they publicly admitted that they did not believe in God, then they would not get confirmed. The bottom line is 90-95% of Americans believe in some sort of higher deity, and they would not want an atheist second-in-command. Overall, a missed the mark movie that could have been so much more. But like I have said before, that's just my opinion.

As a film, it has many flaws.  It's choppy, with many useless scenes (watch for the scene towards the end with Ed Burns and Emil in the warehouse-what's the point?).  It's characters are generally contrived and silly, but are brought to half-life only by the actors behind them. It is original in some spots (one in particular), but mostly runs on tired cliche.  The timing of the humor is very poor, and leads to a general feeling of awkward discomfort in the audience.  Everything about this film, right down to costumes and set decoration, is extremely ugly.  I don't know if that was intended, but it's just plain hard to look at.  The entire film was surrounded by that aura of ugliness- ugliness not only of the sets and costumes, but of the characters and story. And that story involves a cop named Eddie Flemming (Robert DeNiro), an inferior rehash of Kevin Spacey's Jack Vincennes in  L.A. Confidential. Eddie uses the media to make his job easier- and as a result, has become a minor celebrity.  Edward Burns plays Jordi Warsaw, a New York Fire Marshall who joins Eddie on the case to find two Eastern European criminals newly in the US to wreak havoc.  They have learned from watching television that no one in America is responsible for what they do- and that the media run the show.  Murderers become millionaires, and these two know it.  They begin to kill and videotape their killings.  They plan to kill somebody famous and sell it for millions of dollars.  Eddie and Jordi have to stop them.Now you might ask, why is a fireman on the case- The answer is that there is no answer.  They throw in a bit with fire just to bring the Jordi character into it.  All writers in Hollywood like to invent different jobs that allow people to be just like cops- without being cops.  I guess they figure it makes it more exciting because the cop thing has been done so much.  They're wrong.  Making the character a fireman is a distraction, leaving the audience wondering what he's doing there. There is no justification for his presence at the crime scenes.  Just making him DeNiro's character would have allowed the film to run much smoother.  There are lots of scenes, character developments, and even romances in this film that serve absolutely no purpose.  Writer\/Director Herzfeld was filling gaps where they didn't need to be filled.  It shows that he was looking for something to do, that he only really had one idea, and was strained to make a two hour film out of it. I mentioned the film's ugliness- It just leaves you with a sick feeling in your stomach.  This isn't a sign that the material was effective, just horrible.  In a way, the movie  is mean spirited, and that is never a good thing.  The way the humor was added showed absolutely no skill on the part of the filmmaker.  He should have watched his own movie before releasing it, because if he did, he would know how awkward that humour is.So it all sounds pretty bad, I know.  The film's only high points come from generally good performances (DeNiro never fails, even if the script does) and a single point of originality.  The film's message, regarding the injustice of the American system, and its preoccupation with fame, publicity, image and the media that creates it all, are points well taken, but not properly executed. The first hour of the movie is deeply unentertaining and choppy, but the second half, at least, becomes somewhat suspenseful and little bit interesting. Overall, 15 Minutes should be avoided.

In the previous movie a secular saint that was performing abortions was praised. In this movie the subject is about a woman who brings life to a gloomy village using the traditions that she learned from her mother. Her mother was of ancient Mexican (Maya) origin. Chocolate is her weapon and she uses it to transform the villagers lives. Her greater enemy, the mayor of the village becomes friend in the end and together they all celebrate fertility and chocolate. The story was told in a nice manner. However I agree that the script was unfair to Christianity. Surely all religions including the one of Ancient Mayas have their own rules. Let us not forget that some allowed human sacrifices. Catholicism has its own rules as well.

I went into the film with some fairly high expectations of pure summer action\/suspense entertainment because of the mostly positive response it was getting from critics.  Plus, it's been a long time since we've had a fun shark movie so I was ready to embrace this with open arms.Alas, it was not to happen, and I should have known.  After all, even though Renny Harlin can prove himself skillful in directing action sequences, he fails to inject genuine suspense and often goes too far over-the-top in a movie that mostly takes itself seriously.  This is not Lake Placid (which is quite a good thing).  Deep Blue Sea isn't terrible by a long shot, but it's not the breakneck paced thriller I was hoping for.Dr. Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) is in the process of creating a cure for Alzheimer's Disease.  With the help of a crew working in an underwater habitat, they use the brain material of sharks to get this job accomplished. However, the side effect was that the sharks (3 of them) grew smarter as a result of the experimentation, and they break loose, creating hell as they begin to prey on the group of survivors, who are trying to find a way to get topside.Deep Blue Sea is a movie that should have been dripping with suspense and action from every corner.  Instead, what we get is the occasional jump-in-your-seat shark attack that only offers momentary jolts.  Oh, don't get me wrong, there are some exciting moments, but not enough to cover the entire running time of 105 or so minutes.This is director Renny Harlin we're talking about, who's made almost nothing but big-budget duds (Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2). Considering the fact that Deep Blue Sea may very well be his best movie only goes to show he isn't that accomplished a director.  He's all about the action, and there are moments in Deep Blue Sea when it works.  L.L. Cool J.'s encounters with the sharks are often tense and surprisingly humorous, and there is a flooding scene with the characters trying to escape the sharks by climbing a ladder that remains a fairly memorable setpieceHowever, there are plenty of moments that don't work, either.  One of the main characters sudden departure feels quite obvious in the middle of his we will survive if we stay together speech, and the end result is not only bloody, but also quite cheesy.  The over-the-top finale is probably the worst, and the less description about it, the better.The special effects are sometimes effective, just like the action scenes (as I think of it now, a lot of things are sometimes effective and sometimes not).  The animatronic sharks are convincing and realistic, but CGI is far worse-looking than what you may have thought was dated in Jaws.  The sets are appropriately well-fashioned, and the constant scenes of flooding do give the film a little added tension.The performances are also a mixed bag.  Samuel L. Jackson as the man funding the whole operation is very good (as always) and it's a pity he isn't in this film more.  As I think of it, as soon as his presence is gone, that's when the film's true downslide began.  Saffron Burrows is also good as the scientist and heroine of the picture, but a stupid move on the filmmakers' part in the finale ruins any of her development (which isn't a whole lot to begin with, but is significantly more than anyone else).  Also decent are Stellen Skarsgard and Jacqueline Mckenzie.  LL Cool J is fun to watch when he's making fun of his situation, but is a bit irritating when he's preaching (he plays a religious cook, is this a case of miscasting?).The two performers that are not so good are Michael Rappaport and Thomas Jane.  Rappaport often goes so far over-the-top in his role you have to wonder who he thinks he's chewing the scenery from.  Now, as for Thomas Jane as the shark wrangler, did this guy graduate from the school of acting from Christopher Lambert?  For that matter, the two of them look so alike I was wondering if they were related.  But back to his performance; Jane is so wooden it's almost laughable.  There's even a moment when he pops out of the water and starts screaming in such an unconvincing manner, I found myself chuckling.  Jane is perhaps the worst thing about this film and he actually gets the second-most amount of screentime!The script is dumb, no doubt about it, with some cringe-inducing dialogue and laughably bad science.  But, to give all involved in the film credit, everybody seems to know that and doesn't take the story too seriously, which is actually a good balance.  If it had reached the campy levels of Lake Placid, this would have been a disaster so points must be awarded to the fact that the tone does usually maintain the same, that is until the over-the-top finale.There are also some other points in the film that hurt it.  Trevor Rabin's score is a little overwrought and fails to bring about the needed excitement.  There's also a scene that almost plays an ode to Alien, in which Burrows strips down to her underwear to electrocute a shark.  Sure, Burrows is a very good-looking woman, but it's a gratuitous moment.No one ever said Deep Blue Sea had to be masterful, but it's often too goofy, and thus prevents it from being the extremely entertaining action\/thriller it could and should have been.

Cuba Gooding looks and acts more like a Wall Street banker than a psychiatrist.  His acting is far too intense for him to be believable as an inquisitive physician.  His approach to his patient is often inappropriate and ineffective (I'm a physician, and my wife is a psychiatrist).  Did anyone involved in this film's production do their homework here?The movie is completely predictable at every turn.  All the Hollywood stereotypes are used, including the inflexible, aging prison warden, the brutal correction officers, and the wacky yet endearing insane prisoners.  Anthony Hopkins' moments of outburst and violence never surprise.  Even the music is formulaic with its sweeping, dramatic touches.Worst of all, the character development seems to move without logical progression.

Juliette's performance is pure enough to have carried the film without her having a love interest, and while I like Giovanni and his performance was very good, he is not quite the natural that Juliette is. Diane Keaton is every over-protective mother trying to spare her daughter the cruelty of the world, and 'The Other Sister' oddly forebears 'The Virgin Suicides' in the message that parents cannot shield their children from life or death.

One example of what I mean would have to be the influence of Lebbeus Woods' 1987 drawing Neomechanical Tower (Upper) Chamber, which obviously inspired the look of the chair in the year 2035.Now before I actually get to the movie review itself, let me just give credit where credit is due.  First, to Terry Gilliam, director of this semi-sci-fi flick.  I mean, after directing such let downs (to me, anyways) as Brazil and Monty Python, this venture definitely brought you back into a good status quo with me.  Secondly, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Willis, usually a hideous actor (with the exception of two films The Sixth Sense, and well, this one), gave a very unexpected, riveting performance. Pitt, on the other hand, is a great actor, in my opinion (with such movie titles as Se7en, Fight Club, and a movie in which he played himself in, Being John Malkovich, to his credit).  However, this movie, for which he earned a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination, by far, outdid any of those other ones.  So to both of you, congratulations!  And last but not least, credit is also due to screenwriters David Peoples, and his wife, Janet, who took Chris Marker's evocative film and enriched it with their own stirring vision of a future haunted by the past.Now, as for the movie itself, it's interesting to say the least.  The year is 2035. Nearly 40 years earlier, a killer virus spared only 1% of the planet's population.James Cole (Bruce Willis) plays a prison convict\/time traveler from this dystopian future who volunteers to be sent back to 1996 in order to allow his virus-ravaged world to move back to the surface. He cannot change the events of his past.  But rather, all he has to do is bring back a pure sample of the virus so his people can overcome it and become the rulers of the planet.However, time travel in the year 2035 isn't perfect yet (probably because they have ex-insurance agents in charge of it). The first time he is sent back, he ends up in the year 1990, where he is promptly put in an asylum. He then meets two of the people who play key roles in the destruction of the human life on this planet his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) and co-asylum inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).The plot is set up so it looks as though Cole is responsible for Doomsday. His ramblings about the virus influences Goines' plans, once his father (the Nobel Prize-winning virologist whose lab coincidentally keeps an ample stock of the deadly virus at hand) gets him out of the asylum.  Goines then goes on to become the leader of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, who the people in 2035 believe are the ones responsible for unleashing the virus.Meanwhile, the scientists in Cole's future bring him back and have another go at putting him in the right year.  This time, after a couple of bumps (most notably one in WWI where Cole is shot in the leg), he ends up in the right year where he once again ends up with Railly and manages to convince her of his story.  However, Railly's psychiatry and the continuous time travel appears to have taken its toll on Cole, and when he is brought back to 2035 and sent back to 1996 again, he is convinced that he is just a mental patient with delusions about the future.  This time, however, Railly convinces him otherwise and together they try to stop the Army of the 12 Monkeys.History can lie. Cole discovers this (in 1996) and passes this on to the future (2035) and becomes a hero.  At this point, there are numerous options to end the story after tying up the lose ends.  But the story is left very open-ended and the issue of whether there are more loops in the future and the question whether the past can really be changed is left unexplained and unanswered.Viewers of this movie may recall a Star Trek The Next Generation episode where the Enterprise is caught in a time loop of destruction, and each time the crew travels back through time, they experience a deja vu sensation that finally allows them to break out of the destructive loop.  The memory Kathryn Railly experiences, that she has seen James Cole before, could be one such instance.  Thus, viewers who like happy endings may wish to imagine another loop where Railly and Cole actually manage to save the world.  Viewers who like complete endings may wish to imagine that the people in 2035 were eventually able to go back to the surface with Cole's help.  Cynical viewers may opt for an ending where nothing changes and everything the people in 2035 do, ends up being futile.Finally, for those of you who are familiar with the Everett multiverse interpretation of quantum theory, each of the contradictory events in the movie could be happening in a different universe. For example, there may be a universe where Cole survives and lives happily everafter with Railly, one where Cole survives but is too late to stop the virus, and one where Cole is never sent back into time.Moving on... if you pay close attention throughout the entire film, you will notice similarities between the past and future that can't all be explained as mere coincidences.  Examples of this, include (1) James is a prisoner in the past and in the future.  (2) Five scientists sitting behind a long table send Cole off from the future to find the virus, while five psychiatrists sitting behind a long table in the present evaluate Cole's condition.  And finally, (3) the guards from the past (one Negro and one Caucasian) bathe Cole in an eerily similar way to that of the way that the guards bathed him in the future (also one Negro and one Caucasian).What-may-or-may-not-be COLE'S VISION of the future looks flawed and twisted. The technology looks absurd and counter-productive (a metal ball of viewing screens?). The dialog of the scientists is... odd, to say the least.  Also, exotic animals are still alive and they've been roaming the streets of 2035 Philadelphia for the last 38 years.  Pay attention at the beginning and end of the movie and you'll see what I mean.As for James' only dream, during the movie we are repeatedly reverted back to it.  This dream is the soul of the film.  Gilliam returns to it three times, adding more details until the dream links all the pieces in the puzzle, which includes the remarkable David Morse as a researcher with more than a passing interest in Kathryn.  Cole's confusing of illusion and reality screams Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo, in which a mentally unbalanced James Stewart tries to turn Kim Novak into a reincarnation of the woman he loves, who he believes has died.  In the spirit of irony, however, in one scene from 12 Monkeys, Cole and Kathryn hide in a movie-revival house showing this very film.  The 1958 film, now yellowed with age, shows Novak in the Muir Woods using her finger to trace the small space on the rings of a cut redwood that encompasses the years of her life.  Bernard Herrmann's haunting Vertigo score plays over the dialog between Cole and Kathryn as they leave the theater in an attempt to carve out their own small space in life.  Rarely has one film referenced another with such poetic grace.Much like Vertigo, 12 Monkeys rewards multiple viewings. You might say it even demands them.  For all the fun, fright, and hypnotic romance that Gilliam delivers, he digs deepest into fatalistic themes that usually scare away the crowds at the box office. Go with Gilliam anyway. Solving the riddle of 12 Monkeys is an exhilarating challenge.And if after watching it numerous times, you still long for some uniqueness in your life... then check out its soundtrack.  The theme song for the movie is composed solely through the use of an accordion, something not often heard on movie soundtracks.All in all, I would give the movie 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, and a 10 out of 10... thus, equalling a perfect rating.  Great stars + a relatively good director + a compelling story (with depth) + a multi-dimensional ending that can obviously be interpreted in many ways = ONE HELL OF A BLOCKBUSTER NIGHT!Rent it, you won't regret it. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 March 2001","score":"","review":"  Based on Chris Marker's (1962 French) short film La Jetée, a story told through still photos and voice-over narration, 12 Monkeys is a very stylish movie with many artisticly-linked attributes (this not solely referring to the movie itself - which is very artistic in its own modern way, but rather, to objects within the movie).  One example of what I mean would have to be the influence of Lebbeus Woods' 1987 drawing Neomechanical Tower (Upper) Chamber, which obviously inspired the look of the chair in the year 2035.Now before I actually get to the movie review itself, let me just give credit where credit is due.  First, to Terry Gilliam, director of this semi-sci-fi flick.  I mean, after directing such let downs (to me, anyways) as Brazil and Monty Python, this venture definitely brought you back into a good status quo with me.  Secondly, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. Willis, usually a hideous actor (with the exception of two films The Sixth Sense, and well, this one), gave a very unexpected, riveting performance. Pitt, on the other hand, is a great actor, in my opinion (with such movie titles as Se7en, Fight Club, and a movie in which he played himself in, Being John Malkovich, to his credit).  However, this movie, for which he earned a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination, by far, outdid any of those other ones.  So to both of you, congratulations!  And last but not least, credit is also due to screenwriters David Peoples, and his wife, Janet, who took Chris Marker's evocative film and enriched it with their own stirring vision of a future haunted by the past.Now, as for the movie itself, it's interesting to say the least.  The year is 2035. Nearly 40 years earlier, a killer virus spared only 1% of the planet's population.James Cole (Bruce Willis) plays a prison convict\/time traveler from this dystopian future who volunteers to be sent back to 1996 in order to allow his virus-ravaged world to move back to the surface. He cannot change the events of his past.  But rather, all he has to do is bring back a pure sample of the virus so his people can overcome it and become the rulers of the planet.However, time travel in the year 2035 isn't perfect yet (probably because they have ex-insurance agents in charge of it). The first time he is sent back, he ends up in the year 1990, where he is promptly put in an asylum. He then meets two of the people who play key roles in the destruction of the human life on this planet his psychiatrist Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe) and co-asylum inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).The plot is set up so it looks as though Cole is responsible for Doomsday. His ramblings about the virus influences Goines' plans, once his father (the Nobel Prize-winning virologist whose lab coincidentally keeps an ample stock of the deadly virus at hand) gets him out of the asylum.  Goines then goes on to become the leader of the Army of the 12 Monkeys, who the people in 2035 believe are the ones responsible for unleashing the virus.Meanwhile, the scientists in Cole's future bring him back and have another go at putting him in the right year.  This time, after a couple of bumps (most notably one in WWI where Cole is shot in the leg), he ends up in the right year where he once again ends up with Railly and manages to convince her of his story.  However, Railly's psychiatry and the continuous time travel appears to have taken its toll on Cole, and when he is brought back to 2035 and sent back to 1996 again, he is convinced that he is just a mental patient with delusions about the future.  This time, however, Railly convinces him otherwise and together they try to stop the Army of the 12 Monkeys.History can lie. Cole discovers this (in 1996) and passes this on to the future (2035) and becomes a hero.  At this point, there are numerous options to end the story after tying up the lose ends.  But the story is left very open-ended and the issue of whether there are more loops in the future and the question whether the past can really be changed is left unexplained and unanswered.Viewers of this movie may recall a Star Trek The Next Generation episode where the Enterprise is caught in a time loop of destruction, and each time the crew travels back through time, they experience a deja vu sensation that finally allows them to break out of the destructive loop.  The memory Kathryn Railly experiences, that she has seen James Cole before, could be one such instance.  Thus, viewers who like happy endings may wish to imagine another loop where Railly and Cole actually manage to save the world.  Viewers who like complete endings may wish to imagine that the people in 2035 were eventually able to go back to the surface with Cole's help.
