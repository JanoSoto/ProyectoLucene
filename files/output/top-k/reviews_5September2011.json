I loved the three different versions of the film based off of one different decision being made from Lola and Manni. I was also curious how certain situations during the film could not be avoided. For example the Meyers car accident, either Lola or Manni came in contact with the homeless person who found the bag of money on the subway, and the guy attempting to sell the bike. But I also loved the Intermissions of the film. The progress of aggression during the film for Lola was also a great concept. It seemed as if she learned a lesson after every version of the film.During every version of the film Lola came in some kind of contact with the homeless person who found Manni's bag of money he missed placed on the subway. The film immediately explains the big question why Lola was running throughout the film. The films starts off with Lola receiving a call from her boyfriend Manni who has been out into bad situation when he misplaces $100,000 of someones else's money. Lola then tells Manni to wait on her before he makes any further decisions. In the first take of the film Lola arrives too late and Manni robs a grocery. During the robbery Lola arrives and helps finish up the job but soon after wards they are surrounded by the police and she accidentally shot.The second take of the film Lola takes actions into her own hands by going to her fathers bank requesting a loan for the money when he refuses she decides to rob the bank. After retrieving the money and on her way to keep Manni from making a bad decision Manni dies.The third take of the film is in my opinion the best take. Neither Manni or Lola dies based on the better decisions they make during the film. Lola actually goes to the casino and wins $100,000 while at the same time Manni comes in contact with a homeless person who found his misplaced bag of money on a train and trades the homeless person the bag of money for a gun. In the end of this version of the film the money is retrieved and they receive even more money by making better decisions. Manni is then able to give the money back to his boss and keep his life at the same time.During the film out of all three different versions of the film with all of the three different outcomes made the film very interesting and kept me wondering what would happen next. I was mainly curious how one decision could impact the entire films outcome.

And so you should not expect The Man Who Knew Too Much to be a clone of some other Hitchcock movie that you especially liked. Each film should be judged individually. After the very dark Rear Window, Hitchcock had just made To Catch a Thief and The Trouble with Harry, two lighter films, before making this film. The truly scary Psycho was four years in the future. I think The Man Who Knew Too Much was intended to be a bit lighter than some of his thrillers, though still suspenseful. You have a clean cut American family with a young boy on vacation, and I think that was the intended audience families and their children down to about 10 years old. I am not certain now when I first saw this on TV, but I think I was a kid, and enjoyed it. On the other hand, parents in the 1950s probably would not take their children to see a story about a neighbor hacking up his wife and burying her in the garden, namely, Rear Window. This is Hitch lite for the Fifties.The year was 1956, and the baby boom had begun nine months after the end of the war, around 1946. So there would have been millions of families like the McKennas with fathers who had served overseas, and with children around 10 years old. And they wouldn't really want to hire a baby sitter to go to the movies, it would have been easier to take the kids. That's who this movie is aimed at; sometimes I think Hitch really aimed at 10 year old boys, to scare the bejeezus out of them. There is a dreamlike quality to this movie, as though your worst subconscious fears have come to life. Reality isn't what it seems, an old Hitchcock device. As in a dream, the British couple keep morphing, from friends to fiends, from deacons to assassins. The Frenchman turns into a peasant Moroccan and back. You can't go to the police, and when you finally do, they move very slowly, don't quite believe you, and leave. In the seemingly safe world of the Fifties, Hitchcock is saying danger still lurks, especially in the world beyond America's borders. The Man Who Knew Too Much is filled with Hitchcock's iconic imagery, such as the marvelous scene in the taxidermy shop (the main bit of humor) or Jimmy Stewart escaping from church by climbing up the bell rope, and more that might give away the plot. Doris Day certainly had a lovely voice, and the song Que Sera Sera was an enormous hit. I remember my older sister singing it all the time, as though it were some profound philosophical statement. Day fits the role perfectly, as the mother every little boy would love to have, and her dramatic acting is impeccable. This may have been the height of her acting career. She got a raw deal in later roles that left her typecast; she could really act. I heard her interviewed on the radio the other day about a compilation of her recordings that had be re-released, and she didn't sound bitter.Bernard Herrmann, who wrote so much great background music for Hitchcock films, including North by Northwest, and was a respected minor classical composer, was given the opportunity to write a new work for the concert hall scene with orchestra and chorus, certainly a composer's dream. But he chose to re-use the composition by Arthur Benjamin from the 1934 original version, which was the respectful thing to do, especially since Benjamin was still alive (he died in 1960). Having seen this film several times, and listening to the Benjamin composition closely, I can say it is actually a pretty good classical work, worthy of being performed in concert. The words sung by the chorus tie in somewhat with the scene; they also remind me of the forest storm scene in Bambi.The problem with Hitchcock films is you only get to see them the first time once. A review should really be written after that first time, not decades later. As best I can remember, I found it very suspenseful that first viewing. I can still feel some of that suspense when I watch it now, perhaps because the scenes are so skillfully constructed. It is interesting to watch now and then, to examine the fine Hitchcock detail more closely, to enjoy the fine acting. It is not as effective as his masterpieces like North by Northwest of Vertigo on these subsequent viewings. But it is a pleasant, enjoyable film, as long as you don't use a magnifying glass to examine all the lose threads.

I remember how repulsive yet amusing the lunch sequence with the mother was. The zombie priest fondling with the nun was hilarious, and so was the Priest's fight with the no-gooders. It was slapstick, gory and hysterical. It had actors who tried to sound convincing even in the most absurd circumstances, and the writing was crisp and farcical and a plot was at least visible.About 6 years prior to this movie, Sam Raimi came up with the sequel of his 1981 hit Evil Dead. I couldn't find Evil Dead so easily, but got this from my inefficient CD home-delivery service-guy. The runtime was 76 minutes, cutting about 8 minutes from the original cut, but retaining majority of the horror scenes. Also it has an UR (unrated) rating on it, and is prohibited for children.

Below that is a generous summary of the movie which tells that a number of guys are possessed and asks the question with one imaginary raised eyebrow, ' Will Ash be Dead by dawn??'The first scene takes us into a car, with Ash (Bruce) and his girlfriend Linda driving to a remote and dilapidated cabin, as they invade a professor's home to dance and make love; Bruce Campbell tells this in an uncomfortable, overacted manner. Then he discovers a Book of the Dead, and a professor's audio message on the Dictaphone, saying that a spell in the book would release dark, unimaginable forces. When the professor's voice utters the mantras in the book, an execrable force is unleashed which possesses Linda and turns her into a psycho-monster. Ash fights her off and her character is abruptly cut off. Ash now has to fight the remaining ghosts, as he runs, ducks, hides, laughs and battles all the spirits. The moment the morning rays fall on the earth, everything is back to normal. The only difference is that the way to the cabin has been eaten up for the misfortunes who enter it. When Ash realizes this, he howls NOOOOO! like a wolf.His entire body is bruised and lacerated, and he gets perhaps the most serious case of alien hand syndrome as his hand thrashes him with plates and plays hide and seek with him once he does away with it.

The professor's daughter Annie arrives with stone-man with an awkward smile and the two go the the cabin along with a straggly man and his arrogant girlfriend who take their bags. The four too get possessed, and brutally tortured by the creatures, which includes the witch of the professor's wife in the basement.This happens for about half an hour, and characters keep dying, oozing green liquid as they're stabbed. There's some loud, vociferous and obnoxious screeching by the ladies, not to forget continuous and ear-splitting. The professor's daughter companion gets killed quickly, which is the best part of the movie since is acting is embarrassing. The end is predictable- big monster goes for all or nothing, as Annie (Sarah) recites some strange words to get rid of the spirits.

The professor's daughter companion gets killed quickly, which is the best part of the movie since is acting is embarrassing. The end is predictable- big monster goes for all or nothing, as Annie (Sarah) recites some strange words to get rid of the spirits. This leads to Ash being taken to the past, where the soldiers try to kill him but are interrupted by the most fake-looking pterodactyl ever seen, and Ash shoots it with his gun. The soldiers spare him and now worship him as a leader, as Ash screams No! No! No! No! No! No!76 minutes for this drab to be called a masterpiece and Rob Zombie's gore-fest Devil's Rejects getting 53% on RT is a travesty. Okay, the film was made in the late 80s, but to have uninspired humor, cheap references, abysmal acting, lazy gore, poor voice synchronization and a dim-witted plot and then become a 'cult classic' is something I cannot understand. At least something should be good or different- the plot could've had more weight, but even that is wafer-thin. The movie takes us right into action which is a different technique but then there's just no pause. And the little pauses are filled by horrendous, mechanical, lazy, pretentious and amateurish performances. And I hear some critics going 'Oh, the movie succeeds because of Bruce'. Seriously guys, what does he do that's so special from the performances by the actors of some cheap Hollywood movie nowadays?? The jump scenes are so poorly done, without creating any anticipation, excitement or fear. And what's SO funny about the film- the 'swallow this' joke? Okay, Ha Ha.... I can't laugh more than this. Better movies were made before this - Rosemary's Baby, Carrie, Exorcist and better movies are still being made, yet a movie like Evil Dead tops all lists. One word, travesty. And I still don't get the UR rating for this- did the censor board get brain dead watching Evil Dead 2?My rating 1\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"5 September 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" worst movie ever made period. to quote another user here that title his reviews as (film tittle)in a nutshell the only different is that I won't write an essay about it and I will keep it brief, after all is my humble opinion on a movie and not a novel. bad movie..period...everything is just plain awful, the cast, the fx, the script, everything. you couldn't make a worst movie even if you try. the whole batman universe is taken in the wrong context.

It has to be the most small-scale mystery-crime-thriller I've seen, with a total of 3 major characters, but it's quietly brilliant. If it was a normal film, told front to back, it would be above average, but only just. Luckily it's not.The best part of Memento, the thing that makes it stand out, is it's format. When you first watch, it takes a while for anything to start making sense, and it actually hurt my head trying to figure out the timeframe. I won't say how it plays out, but it's outstandingly unique. And for some reason, like the protagonist Leonard, you can't remember what just happened. Even now, I totally forget the beginning- wait the end- no, the beginning of the film. I just can't remember.A special note- the opening credits are the best part of the film. When you catch on to what's happening, you'll gasp. It's explosive and brilliant.The three main characters are excellent. They are layered, well- played, and keep you guessing. Leonard is our protagonist, played by Guy Pearce in a big change from his other major role in L.A. Confidential. He cannot make new memories, which is why the film is presented so uniquely. He is generally disciplined, and conflicted about everything not tattooed to his body or in his photos. Guy Pearce is excellent as this walking uncertainty. His narrations are blank, like his general perception. It helps that he just looks the part. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent as Natalie and Teddy, the support who aren't what they seem to appear to look like. Sound confusing? It is, until we find out more and more about them. Their personalities- or what they look like- are really good.Another note- music is minimal, but great. It really captures the small scope, while being stirring.The plot is good, but is much better because of the presentation and editing that keeps the scenes from looking choppy. There's a neat twist that changes our perspective, and Memento simply has to be seen again or you'll miss out on key things. Also, you'll totally forget your first viewing.One last note- it's really cool when the film changes from black and white to colour.

The case was fascinating, yet baseless as far as legitimate evidence goes and the novel was a huge success. It made the way for this 1979 film that was a box office hit that was ripped apart by critics. It doesn't matter whether or not you believe the story to be true because either way The Amityville Horror can be seen as a great horror film that has a fair few faults that restrict it from achieving the status of being amazing.The story is basic. Ronald DeFeo Jr murders his entire family in the middle of the night and his house is sold off to George and Kathy Lutz and their children a year later. What supposedly goes on during the next thirty days is a series of paranormal occurrences that eventually drive the Lutz family into sheer terror and influence them to abandon their dream home never to return.Maybe it isn't the most original plot ever, but it is efficient for the haunted house genre and the fact that it was based off of supposedly true events makes it more engaging. As a studier on the Amityville case, it was really interesting to see this film brought to life with accuracy to the claims of the real life Lutz family. Seeing what I read about at that time on the TV screen was actually really exciting for me, but as I've grown older and become more critical of films I am able to point out flaws that critics identified. Even though I still like this movie a lot, I can respect critics opinions on it since I see where they are coming from.Firstly, the acting is stiff. Margot Kidder and James Brolin aren't very good actors, and what's worse is that their chemistry is blunt and ineffective. This is sadly accentuated even more by the fact that some of the dialogue for the George and Kathy Lutz characters is cheesy and laughable (You make me feel like a kid in the back seat of a car). The fact that these two are the main characters is really off putting and it just draws your interest towards seeing creepy things happen in the house even more. However, I did quite like Rod Steiger's performance as the priest. I would have loved to see more of him in the movie.Another issue is the fact that the film moves rather slowly, especially in the middle. The film wastes a lot of time on unengaging drama and sometimes forgets that it is trying to be a haunted house movie. Also, at other times the editing came off as being amateurish and even laughable. These are salient flaws.As far as positives go, I'd like to commend the creepy atmosphere present in many scenes. The use of dark lighting in the house alongside the music was really effective and certainly made me fear the house. On top of that, the house looks just like the real house in Amityville. I also really love the fact that the filmmakers really put in the effort to present the Lutz family's claims on the big screen. The walls dripped with ooze, 'Jody' was often mentioned and briefly seen, George woke up at 300 AM all the time, the flies were appearing, supernatural voices were heard etc. It was great to see them make a film adaptation that was accurate to claimed events.Sure, The Amityville Horror isn't the best horror movie ever made, but outside of the glaring faults it can be viewed as the essential haunted house movie.

The film takes you through the lives of four addicts who's addictions eradicate exactly that, their lives. An audience must brace themselves when approaching Requiem as the emotions felt at the end of the film are merely sad, distraught and cold, however, the film itself is one that should be viewed by all, for this heartbreaking roller-coaster ride presents unbelievable craftsmanship and acting which is Oscar-worthy from not only Ellen Burstyn, who was in fact nominated, but the other three stars also ; Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans who's abilities as a serious actor were astounding, ( yes, he was Shorty in Scary Movie).Requiem is one of a few stand alone films of the previous decade, who's motive is not to entertain as such, but to demonstrate a universal message that addiction, no matter what it may be, can take control of an individuals life and ultimately destroy it and those around it. To start it provides hope that things can turn out beautiful, but the further in you get, the more you realise that they are inevitably doomed, this film brings you down with the four protagonists to the bottom, a pit of desperation and despair. As the credits rolled it felt like my breath had been held throughout the final climactic twenty minutes. Requiem is different from other horrifying movies due to its' realism, it makes you feel what they feel, it creates a bond between you and the protagonists as they are in fact likable characters who are however immoral, tainted by their addictions.It is a brutal, honest and harrowing masterpiece, delivered through a medium of beautiful cinematography and fine craftsmanship, backed up with some of the most heartfelt and poignant acting I have seen in cinema.

I skim through the reviews here on IMDb and find several things posted like idealized and dull, Rome Epic Roams Too Much, Unfocused and Simplistic, Overkill, etc. Maybe it's just me, but I can't quite see what these people are talking about. In my mind, Spartacus is one of the grandest and most powerful films in its genre. Perhaps it has moments where it becomes a bit melodramatic, but don't most epics, even the most loved? Didn't The Ten Commandments? Didn't Ben-Hur? While Spartacus can certainly boast of sprawling battle sequences, riveting gladiatorial matches, lavish sets, and all the other things that one might expect from a Hollywood epic, it is the quieter, gentler, and more human moments that make the film more than that &#x96; the scene of the liberated slaves together about the campfire as Tony Curtis' Antoninus amuses them pleasantly with magic tricks, the tender and joyous exchanges between Spartacus and Varinia as they dream hopefully of the future and reflect on their pasts, the shot of an ancient couple dancing blissfully as free people after who knows how many years of slavery&#x85; All these parts listed deeply and compassionately illustrate the lives of ordinary people in a strikingly intimate way, far distanced from an epic motion picture's usual excesses.Of course, the cast is nothing short of stupendous. Kirk Douglas is excellent in the title role. In much of the first part of the film, he bristles with pent-up energy. Grimly mute, the viewer can sense the simmering rage the character has against his captors, a fury just waiting to boil over. Later, as leader of the slave revolt, he exudes a deep love for all his comrades, as well as the painful weight of his responsibility for them, especially when it appears as if their rebellion may fail. Jean Simmons as Varinia is exquisite, not just in terms of her beauty but in her performance. And as Crassus, the great Laurence Olivier creates a multi-layered and intriguing antagonist &#x96; cold and sinister, but with depth and inner turmoil, as can be seen in his scenes with Antoninus and later Varinia.Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as the obsequious head of a gladiatorial school, and it is easy to see why. He clearly relishes the part of this finicky, weaselly, cowardly slave master. Every time he appears, he brightens up the screen. Equally superb is Charles Laughton as the aging Gracchus. He skillfully portrays a bloated old senator with the countenance of a codger but a sharp and conniving mind. Throughout the film, Laughton is witty, amusing, and finally tragic. There is pathos in his last scenes. It is a great part to play that gets many of the best lines. (To paraphrase Privately, I believe in none of the gods. Publicly, I believe in them all.) When Ustinov and Laughton are on screen together to conspire or chat about their vices, the two's perfect chemistry makes those portions perhaps the best in the whole film.Charles McGraw, Herbert Lom, and Woody Strode are also very memorable and deserve a mention.Kubrick famously loathed the film, and everyone often makes a big deal about that, along with the hubris of Douglas that spurred the project to one-up Ben-Hur. So they should; it's a fascinating topic. But while it may not be fully Kubrick's vision, Spartacus remains stunning nonetheless. The acting, as I've noted, is great. The screenplay by the then-blacklisted Dalton Trumbo can be hauntingly poetic. The musical score is splendid. No matter the views of the man credited as the movie's director, I feel that Spartacus, just as it is, is a well-done and resonating piece of work.

Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about.Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure.

Not exactly riveting dialogue.But the reason I gave up on it was more personal. I've lived in Alaska, and this ain't Alaska. Look, Hollywood, Alaska is a pretty amazing place, and if you bothered to learn about it before you made your films, they might be better films. Instead, Hollywood just takes the Alaska name and uses it as an excuse to make up all sorts of fantasies, as though no one besides a half-million Alaskans have ever been there.Insomnia was filmed in Stewart, British Columbia, Canada, which is adjacent to Hyder, Alaska, the southernmost point of the state, which is a largely abandoned gold mining town and unsuited for filming this story. Stewart, on the other hand, is more modern than most small, rural Alaska communities, and doesn't look Alaskan. But more importantly, there is no midnight sun there. Heck, there's no midnight sun in Fairbanks, either; you have to go well above the Arctic Circle for that, and then you are going to find yourself in some really small, off the road communities, often without much in the way of utilities, shall we say. Not anything like Stewart, BC.What you do get in much of Alaska is that it stays light at night for much of the summer, even though the sun is below the horizon. In Fairbanks, it almost seems like daylight around the solstice. You see little kids playing softball at 11 p.m. in the summer. Alaskans love the long summer daylight, and stay up late by choice. It's not a matter of insomnia; you just have more energy with all that light, and figure you will have plenty of time to sleep in the winter.OK, so these cheechako detectives come up to Alaska and they can't sleep. And they keep moaning and groaning about it. Let's see, what oh what can they do?A) Go into your hotel room and pull the curtains, so it is dark in the room, put your head on the pillows and shut your eyes.B) Buy a sleep mask, one of those blindfolds that goes over your eyes while you sleep, which any regular airline traveler should have.C) Take two Benadryl. D) Go to a doctor and ask for a sleeping pill.These guys are detectives and they can't figure out how to cope with a little insomnia? They've never heard of sleeping pills? Sorry, no sale.But the larger problem is movies that don't match the reality of their settings. People tend to get a bit touchy. I saw someone complain that the 1945 version of State Fair didn't look like the real Iowa State Fair. An Indian complained that Dances With Wolves didn't match the look of the authentic tribes involved. Etc. When we see our home locale on the screen, it is easy to nitpick. Even if there are major errors, it depends on the type of movie whether such criticisms are justifiable.What bothers me about grossly inaccurate movies like Insomnia is the provincial stupidity they reveal about their makers, people too lazy to do even the slightest research about what a place like Alaska is really like. Many years ago there was some Italian director filming scenes in the train station in Anchorage with Harvey Keitel, except the movie was set in eastern Canada, and Keitel was supposed to be taking a train to the Canadian Arctic. Huh? Absolutely none of this made any sense, geographically. Train? Try a small plane, buddy. The movie, as far as I could tell, was never released, if it was even completed. Maybe they finally looked at a map. The reality of the far north of Alaska and Canada is much more romantic and interesting and beautiful than most of the idiotic versions produced by Hollywood. That's what also makes me sad about seeing ridiculous films like Insomnia. If they had filmed it in something resembling a real Alaskan bush community in the far north, one with a mile or two of road, 10 bars and two general stores, that would have been a film with character.

If they had filmed it in something resembling a real Alaskan bush community in the far north, one with a mile or two of road, 10 bars and two general stores, that would have been a film with character. ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"5 September 2011","score":"","review":" I tried watching this a while back, but couldn't get past all the moaning and groaning about how they couldn't get any sleep. Not exactly riveting dialogue.But the reason I gave up on it was more personal. I've lived in Alaska, and this ain't Alaska. Look, Hollywood, Alaska is a pretty amazing place, and if you bothered to learn about it before you made your films, they might be better films. Instead, Hollywood just takes the Alaska name and uses it as an excuse to make up all sorts of fantasies, as though no one besides a half-million Alaskans have ever been there.Insomnia was filmed in Stewart, British Columbia, Canada, which is adjacent to Hyder, Alaska, the southernmost point of the state, which is a largely abandoned gold mining town and unsuited for filming this story. Stewart, on the other hand, is more modern than most small, rural Alaska communities, and doesn't look Alaskan. But more importantly, there is no midnight sun there. Heck, there's no midnight sun in Fairbanks, either; you have to go well above the Arctic Circle for that, and then you are going to find yourself in some really small, off the road communities, often without much in the way of utilities, shall we say. Not anything like Stewart, BC.What you do get in much of Alaska is that it stays light at night for much of the summer, even though the sun is below the horizon. In Fairbanks, it almost seems like daylight around the solstice. You see little kids playing softball at 11 p.m. in the summer. Alaskans love the long summer daylight, and stay up late by choice. It's not a matter of insomnia; you just have more energy with all that light, and figure you will have plenty of time to sleep in the winter.OK, so these cheechako detectives come up to Alaska and they can't sleep. And they keep moaning and groaning about it. Let's see, what oh what can they do?A) Go into your hotel room and pull the curtains, so it is dark in the room, put your head on the pillows and shut your eyes.B) Buy a sleep mask, one of those blindfolds that goes over your eyes while you sleep, which any regular airline traveler should have.C) Take two Benadryl. D) Go to a doctor and ask for a sleeping pill.These guys are detectives and they can't figure out how to cope with a little insomnia? They've never heard of sleeping pills? Sorry, no sale.But the larger problem is movies that don't match the reality of their settings. People tend to get a bit touchy. I saw someone complain that the 1945 version of State Fair didn't look like the real Iowa State Fair. An Indian complained that Dances With Wolves didn't match the look of the authentic tribes involved. Etc. When we see our home locale on the screen, it is easy to nitpick. Even if there are major errors, it depends on the type of movie whether such criticisms are justifiable.What bothers me about grossly inaccurate movies like Insomnia is the provincial stupidity they reveal about their makers, people too lazy to do even the slightest research about what a place like Alaska is really like. Many years ago there was some Italian director filming scenes in the train station in Anchorage with Harvey Keitel, except the movie was set in eastern Canada, and Keitel was supposed to be taking a train to the Canadian Arctic. Huh? Absolutely none of this made any sense, geographically. Train? Try a small plane, buddy. The movie, as far as I could tell, was never released, if it was even completed. Maybe they finally looked at a map. The reality of the far north of Alaska and Canada is much more romantic and interesting and beautiful than most of the idiotic versions produced by Hollywood. That's what also makes me sad about seeing ridiculous films like Insomnia. If they had filmed it in something resembling a real Alaskan bush community in the far north, one with a mile or two of road, 10 bars and two general stores, that would have been a film with character.
