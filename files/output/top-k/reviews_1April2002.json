To me, the question is completely irrelevant. I feel you can't appreciate movies without somehow connecting them to your own system of experiences and resulting convictions. Since everyone has different experiences (that goes for the movie viewing experiences as well) we all connect differently to different films. I believe it's impossible to look at a film from an objective perspective external to yourself. Even if you could scale the variables there's no objective way of saying this film has the Best Script, the Best Acting or Directing or whatever. What such judgements frequently represent is some form of idea that objectiveness is attainable. What they really mean is hard to determine. Does this film with its story of a man having every physical possession anyone could ever want, but not that which he truly desires, (still) strike a chord with that many people? Or is it a self-fulfilling prophecy in that when people watch the film known as The Greatest Ever, they will see exactly that?Maybe it's a little bit of both, but a definite and undeniable important factor is how it revolutionized moviemaking. We can in the least and objectively say Orson Welles' debut did that. Everything from its non-linear story structure to its visual ambitions were extremely novel at the time (especially in American cinema), far more so than what we're used to hailing as 'revolutionay' moviemaking nowadays. Cameras that seem more mobile than ever before, extraordinary use of Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography, brilliant make-up and innovative editing (the shot fading into a newspaper picture) are some examples of the film's technical inventiveness.The inventiveness employed in writing Citizen Kane is slightly less impressive if you look at the film retrospectively, as it did not revolutionize moviemaking as much as the film's techniques did. However, the script still stands tall above most others. It paints the life of Charles Foster Kane post-mortem, as a collection of visually-represented memories of him related to an investigating reporter by the people who 'knew' Kane best. In this manner, the movie builds brick upon brick of an idea of who Charles Foster Kane was, but only in our heads. The film continually shows him not from his own perspective but from that of others. This does not necessarily lead to contemplating in how far there still is an 'real' Kane, and in how far he is just the product of the people's subjective memories. But it does lead to starkly contrasting perspectives of the man. A foolish arrogant businessman, a ruthless megalomaniacal man uncapable of love or a enthusiastic young man brought down by his own success? The character of Kane is all and neither and only in our minds do the differing views of him coalesce to an idea of the complete man. Important for forming this idea is the grounding of the story in the newsreel which starts the film. It serves as a media perspective on the man, a perspective created by media he himself helped to create. It's completely over the top with its narration and totally believable as an actual newsreel, and here it serves as a skeleton.Central to the story is its plot of a faceless reporter trying to find the meaning behind Kane's final spoken word 'Rosebud'. When we find out what it means we don't. We find out what if refers too, but are we ever told why is it exactly this word he chose to use as his last one? No, because we're meant to fill it in ourselves. In my mind it refers to the only time in his life where he had but did not consciously acknowledge the one thing he really wanted, namely love. The rest of his life he pursues it but finds he himself has none to give. What he has to give is money, charisma, talent and more money, but as a man he's as emotionally bankrupt as he could be. Therefore he never receives any and dies a bitter man. The most important question this always raises to me is why did Kane have no love to give? For me, the answer lies, at least in part, in the ridiculous ammount of assets entrusted to the man. Kane is a man who, from a certain (early) point in his life was trained to be of of the leading men in the world's economy. But also a man who was given the resources to indulge in anything he might want to do. A product of and for the industrial age if there ever was one. 'Regular' people growing up in 'regular' environments have to develop a capacity for loving other ones, independent of whether or not the are known to them. Kane never has to develop this capacity. To put it in his wordsIf I wouldn't have had so much money, I would've been a great man. Under the circumstances I think I did pretty well.A term like Greatest Film Ever may sound like nonsense to me, but that doesn't mean I have no opinion. There's no doubting Citizen Kane's importance in the history of cinema and there's no doubting how intricate this film is in presenting a picture of a man (who, of course, was to great extent William Randolph Hurst - Orson Welles even uses dialogue that quotes the man!). I enjoyed it tremendously, also not in the least due to the expert performances by Joseph Cotton and Welles himself. And I feel it's techniques are dynamic enough to stand up to most of today's efforts. It did never connect to me in a way that made me think it's the undisputed masterpiece people say it is.

Disney's Beauty and the Beast addresses the contest between two types of masculinity, aggressive and gentle, targeting young boys to socialize into the new sensitive male of the 90s. The representation of femininity plays a minor part in the story.Because Disney films are targeted to a younger audience, the sexual implication of the `Beast' is replaced with a coarse, boorish and unrefined type of masculinity. This film is about the socialization of young boys, and the audience learns through textual analysis what behavior the film deems appropriate. The Beast is 11 when he is put under the spell and 21 by the time it is broken, which covers the formative years of the transition from boyhood to manhood. The most obvious lesson he has to learn is to love, and to be good enough to have that love returned. Heterosexual love sets everything right and is the definition of the manhood he has to attain. The rest of the film reads as a transcript of proper behavior, and Lumiere, the dating etiquette expert, is his teacher. The Beast is expected to find more suitable accommodations than the dungeon, walk Belle to her door, say something to fill the awkward space on the trip to her room, and invite her to dinner. As a man, he is expected to control his temper, eat in a civilized manner, and learn gentleness with the birds. In the scene depicting his table manners, Belle switches from the role of date to that of nurturing, instructive mother. Belle recognizes his effort with the spoon and compromises with him by sipping her broth from the bowl. All of the characters have a part in his instruction. Especially informative is the scene when Belle sings about how he was course and unrefined, and now he is dear to her because he is unsure. It is the self consciousness and insecurity, in eating and getting dressed in bows, that sets the Beast apart from Gaston and makes him the ideal 90s (less masculine) man. In fact he has physical prowess but he represses it, and appeals instead to Belle's mind with the library. The film reassures boys that one can be both gentle and manly. The key to winning the girl lays in his evolution; he overcomes his selfishness. The Disney film leaves no room for competing versions of masculinity. Only one would survive; the bad guy dies.Gaston and the Beast are quite similar rivals, analogous in their social worlds. Either the entire town or all of the appliances cheer their respective protagonist. Gaston is beastly as shown by his shadows, bestial shape, and pride that every last inch of him is `covered in hair.' Their fight in the tower marks the emotional high point of the film and is essentially a rivalry between two types of masculinity. The sensitive male that the audience has witnessed evolving, or the 100% pure testosterone laden Gaston who is aggressive, has a thick neck, eats to excess, is not an intellectual (he knocks over a chess table) and is a model to which all those in the village aspire to. Belle drops out of the equation entirely, as the major lesson of the film is the contest between two versions of manhood, with the sensitive male of the 90s the victor.To a lesser degree, the film is also about the new woman of the 90s. Belle is the new heroine that Disney produced, though she is just as skinny and wide eyed as the heroines before her. She does read books, but they are fairy tales and her idea of `something more than this provincial life' is prince charming. She is really not all that intellectual. She does have two physical saving scenes, when the Beast is attacked by wolves, and before he falls off the tower and she catches him. However, overshadowing Disney's attempt to create a modern, liberated woman, Belle ends up faced with a choice that is really no choice at all. She has to get married in the end whether it is to one man or another.Belle simply settles for the best type of masculinity, what she a `new woman' is looking for in a `new man.' She has little choice, since she doesn't like Gaston and she does want to get married. The lesson is that one type of masculinity not only triumphs and survives, but it also gets the girl. It is surprising that a more recent film, after the women's movement, and one self-consciously trying to create a new heroine, actually takes more power out of the female's hands then older versions of the tale.

The movie is really scary if you take it seriously as in a way it tells you that the fact that sometimes to take a chance on love seems like risking your life, is because it is truly life-threatening. Maybe it's only there to point out how bad rejection and the loss of love can be as someone suggested. Maybe it's an attempt to portray how truly horrible it feels, and how dark and bottomless it feels to be in such pain - I don't know.I give it a 7  ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"1 April 2002","score":"","review":"  Another movie that wasn't well-recieved by the public but still entertains and shows you a good time... while you're puking in the bathroom.

When I heard that 20th Century Fox were making a new version of Planet of the Apes, I admit I felt the same way. But then I heard that Tim Burton was directing, and I was encouraged. And thankfully, he does not disappoint. While comparisons are inevitable with the 1968 original, this is of course not a remake or sequel as such, but a new take on Pierre Boulle's original novel; one that actually manages to be closer to the original source material than Franklin J. Schaffner's classic interpretation. As a result of course, the audience had certain expectations - and they were fulfilled. Linda Harrison (Nova) makes a very brief, and of course silent, cameo; Charlton Heston (Taylor) makes a memorable appearance as Thade's father, his single scene offering one of the turning points of the narrative, as well as a chance for him to once again to utter his most famous line from the 1968 version. With that aside, how does Tim Burton's re-imagining of Planet of the Apes hold up as a movie? Very well, in my opinion. First of all we should mention Rick Baker's excellent ape makeup, which is as much of a quantum leap forward as John Chambers' in the orignal film. Not only does the make up look extremely effective, but the actors can actually express themselves through it, enhancing their performances. Coupled with Colleen Atwood's solid costume designs, their appearance is almost too effective. As for the cast, I thought Mark Wahlberg was a interesting choice as lost astronaut Leo Davidson - one that echoed, at least for me, the controversial casting of Michael Keaton as Batman. Like Keaton, and indeed like Heston, Wahlberg is not a hero-type, all muscles and steely determination; that is what makes his performance all the more realistic. Tim Roth excelled as Thade, a truly great cinematic villain; Michael Clarke Duncan made an extremely convincing performance as Thade's friend, the gorilla Attar;  Helena Bonham-Carter's Ari was a kooky, off-the-wall ape heroine, and didn't waste a moment of screen time. This is more than can be said of Estella Warren as Daena, unfortunately. She may be a champion swimmer and model, but I can't help thinking she was cast more for her stunning beauty than any modicum of acting ability. Watching her performance, and the amount of screen time and dialogue allocated to her, I was left wondering if maybe she had some lines cut. Finally, of course, there is the movie's ending. I thought it was fantastic. I didn't think it was confusing at all, and on a par with that of the original version. Then, there was that single, shocking image, and a chilling realisation. Of course, repeating that would have been pointless here; so now we get a much more controversial conclusion, one that raises a great many questions.

It's about the dangers of homophobia, plain and simple, about being deep in the closet and being angry about it.As such, it's a hit-and-miss film, with good moments and bad.  One of its major drawbacks is a wildly inconsistent tone, a common problem with satire.  But let's look at what so many viewers somehow miss.Start with the trail of bread crumbs that begins with Tyler Durden dressing like he shops for clothes in Ru Paul's trash.  Watch Jack hug a man with enormous breasts and no testicles and hear him say how it's oddly comforting.  Watch him and Tyler 'share' a woman who is, in fact, more masculine than either of them.Watch dozens of men join a secret, no-girls club (an underground social movement) in which they can't keep their shirts on or their hands off of each other.  Watch as this club turns into an adoring cult.  Watch as they scorn women -- especially women who use liposuction to 'artificially' try to be sexy and appealing to men.  Listen to all the dialogue complaining about emasculation, about how the world won't let you just be a man.Yes, very subtle.

Wells' original novella -- or of the 1960 George Pal film -- this is yet another dismal proof of Hollywood's positive genius for sucking every last bit of life and meaning from a classic. Though it repeatedly references the Pal film, in every way this movie fails even to live up to the standard of mediocrity set by that first cinematic attempt. George Pal at least demonstrated some respect for the original material, while Simon Great-Grandson of H.G. Wells apparently couldn't have cared less. First there's the addition of a subplot involving the Time Traveller's murdered fiancé (Spoiler alert) When he completes his time machine and goes back to the past to save her, he succeeds in preventing her death at the hands of a mugger, but then she gets killed by a runaway car, proving of course that It's not nice to fool with the space-time continuum. Grief-stricken, he resolves to travel into the future and find someone who can tell him how to unravel this paradox. (I guess simple curiosity is no longer sufficient motive for a Time Traveller, when you've gutted your story and padding is desperately needed.)The movie then lifts a page from George Pal's film by having humanity almost destroy itself in the near future. In Pal's version it was by nuclear war; here it's a disastrous attempt at excavating luxury colonies on the Moon with thermonuclear devices. The concept is the same, just much, much stupider.When our hero finally arrives in A.D. 800,000+ the movie becomes an exercise in purest gawdawfulness. Wells' story handed filmmakers some of the most haunting images in all of science fiction literature, and this outfit turns one of them into laughable giant Tim-Burtonesque steel cat skulls, then trashes just about everything else. I suppose it was also inevitable that we'd get the chatty holograph played by Orlando Jones, though for whatever it's worth his is undoubtedly the best performance, notwithstanding Jeremy Irons' cameo.For me to describe everything that's so wrongheaded about what this film does with Wells' distant future of the Eloi and Morlocks would take far too long, but here's a couple of quick examples Suspension of disbelief doesn't even begin to describe what you need to swallow the notion that -- nearly a million years in the future -- some of the Eloi learn to speak flawless English from a few surviving street signs and public inscriptions. Then there's Irons' campy, glossy-black-leather Head Morlock costume and albino makeup, which make him look as if he's decided to explore an alternate career path as an Edgar Winter imitator, or lead singer in the Whitesnake Experience (not the real Whitesnake, but an incredible simulation).In addition to his shameless exploitation of his relation to Wells to promote this blandly inept butchery of a classic story, the director also deserves extra smacks upside the head with the 2 X 4 of Justice for blatantly ripping off the famous hunt scene in the original Planet of the Apes. And doing a spectacularly lousy job of it. (Spoiler alert -- though frankly, I don't see how this could be considered a spoiler when the climactic blowing up of the bad guys' stronghold is as essential to hack sf-action-film-making as stink to a skunk, but consider yourself alerted.) After going mano a mano with the Uber-Morlock and rescuing his Eloi chick, the Time Traveller jams the gears of his time machine, conveniently converting it into a Morlock-dissolving mini-nuke, while leaving just enough time for the hero and heroine to escape. Yay! This is the sort of high-Dumbth cinematic sludge that makes you want to lobby for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against source material, aggravated by contempt for the audience. While I am no advocate for slavish adherence to the original story, if a film is going to use the title of a classic it should at least leave its sense and spirit mostly intact. The Time Machine may be the most moving, evocative and finely crafted piece that H. G. Wells ever wrote. It deserves far better treatment than this slick but turgid stew of clichés.

","genre":null},{"date":"1 April 2002","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" If you're a fan of H. G. Wells' original novella -- or of the 1960 George Pal film -- this is yet another dismal proof of Hollywood's positive genius for sucking every last bit of life and meaning from a classic. Though it repeatedly references the Pal film, in every way this movie fails even to live up to the standard of mediocrity set by that first cinematic attempt. George Pal at least demonstrated some respect for the original material, while Simon Great-Grandson of H.G. Wells apparently couldn't have cared less. First there's the addition of a subplot involving the Time Traveller's murdered fiancé (Spoiler alert) When he completes his time machine and goes back to the past to save her, he succeeds in preventing her death at the hands of a mugger, but then she gets killed by a runaway car, proving of course that It's not nice to fool with the space-time continuum. Grief-stricken, he resolves to travel into the future and find someone who can tell him how to unravel this paradox. (I guess simple curiosity is no longer sufficient motive for a Time Traveller, when you've gutted your story and padding is desperately needed.)The movie then lifts a page from George Pal's film by having humanity almost destroy itself in the near future. In Pal's version it was by nuclear war; here it's a disastrous attempt at excavating luxury colonies on the Moon with thermonuclear devices. The concept is the same, just much, much stupider.When our hero finally arrives in A.D. 800,000+ the movie becomes an exercise in purest gawdawfulness. Wells' story handed filmmakers some of the most haunting images in all of science fiction literature, and this outfit turns one of them into laughable giant Tim-Burtonesque steel cat skulls, then trashes just about everything else. I suppose it was also inevitable that we'd get the chatty holograph played by Orlando Jones, though for whatever it's worth his is undoubtedly the best performance, notwithstanding Jeremy Irons' cameo.For me to describe everything that's so wrongheaded about what this film does with Wells' distant future of the Eloi and Morlocks would take far too long, but here's a couple of quick examples Suspension of disbelief doesn't even begin to describe what you need to swallow the notion that -- nearly a million years in the future -- some of the Eloi learn to speak flawless English from a few surviving street signs and public inscriptions. Then there's Irons' campy, glossy-black-leather Head Morlock costume and albino makeup, which make him look as if he's decided to explore an alternate career path as an Edgar Winter imitator, or lead singer in the Whitesnake Experience (not the real Whitesnake, but an incredible simulation).In addition to his shameless exploitation of his relation to Wells to promote this blandly inept butchery of a classic story, the director also deserves extra smacks upside the head with the 2 X 4 of Justice for blatantly ripping off the famous hunt scene in the original Planet of the Apes. And doing a spectacularly lousy job of it. (Spoiler alert -- though frankly, I don't see how this could be considered a spoiler when the climactic blowing up of the bad guys' stronghold is as essential to hack sf-action-film-making as stink to a skunk, but consider yourself alerted.) After going mano a mano with the Uber-Morlock and rescuing his Eloi chick, the Time Traveller jams the gears of his time machine, conveniently converting it into a Morlock-dissolving mini-nuke, while leaving just enough time for the hero and heroine to escape. Yay! This is the sort of high-Dumbth cinematic sludge that makes you want to lobby for an international tribunal to prosecute crimes against source material, aggravated by contempt for the audience. While I am no advocate for slavish adherence to the original story, if a film is going to use the title of a classic it should at least leave its sense and spirit mostly intact. The Time Machine may be the most moving, evocative and finely crafted piece that H. G. Wells ever wrote. It deserves far better treatment than this slick but turgid stew of clichés.

I especially liked how he made the camera fly in and around the house, very nice.

No need to say more here.The screenplay by David Koepp was great. The story has been done before a burglary that turns into a cat-and-mouse game with a twist the use of a panic room. You'd think that with this tried format, the story would be rather boring, but with Hall's camera work, Shore's score (hey that rhymes!) and Koepp's script, this is a VERY intense piece of work. Which brings me to my complaint.The ads for the movie proclaim a movie that will make you jump out of your seat. I did not jump out of my seat; in fact, I didn't even jerk back in my seat. I was hyped for something that wasn't there. Don't get me wrong, the movie\/story is great, but just not scary, and that was what I was looking from this movie to be scared.
