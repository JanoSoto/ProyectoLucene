OK, not everything that I heard about the movie made me look forward to it, but there were some very nice comments as well. In the end I decided that I wanted to see it for myself, in order to form my own opinion about it.Starship Troopers is situated in the future (distant or near I don't know), where high school kids are encouraged to become citizens by joining the military instead of staying inferior civilians. Johnny Rico joins the infantry, not because he fully believes that this is the best thing to do, but because his girlfriend already has enlisted in the army and he doesn't want to leave her behind. Their training is tough, but nothing can prepare them for what they are about to witness a full scale war with gigantic and ferocious aliens that want to destroy the human race...If this movie had been written and\/or directed by a German, everybody would have called him a neo-Nazi or at least a man with fascist believes. Not only does it use the idea of the übermenschen (people who are better persons because they belong to a certain race), the military is also clearly inspired by the German fascist ideology. You can see it in the organization, but also in the uniforms. There can absolutely be no doubt where the idea for those costumes came from as it is close to identical in every detail. But the director is Dutch and the writer is an American, so no-body seems to have a problem with that anymore. Now they say that it is an excellent way of showing a totalitarian, right-wing ideology. Can someone please tell me what the difference with Nazism is then?Another thing that bothered me was that everybody in this movie seemed to be perfect Barbie dolls. Every main character in it could at least apply for the title of 'Miss or Mister Machine Gun' with the perfect toothpaste smile and bright blue eyes. Imperfection doesn't exist, they are all smart and beautiful and eager to kill everything and everybody that doesn't follow the rules of the regime.Still, I must admit that not everything about this movie was bad. The special effects for instance were very nice. I admit that I looked with a lot of interest to all those ants, dun beetles and other alien life forms which didn't have to look human for once. They all looked mean and ferocious and were in my opinion the best thing this movie had to offer. But was that enough to save the movie? Certainly not. A movie with such a bad story and mediocre acting (at best), which so heavily relies on gore and special effects to save it, certainly doesn't deserve to be called a masterpiece. I give it a rating between 4.5\/10 and 5\/10, only because of the magnificent special effects.

And they have more in common with Hollywood as they sometimes would like to believe. When they find a foreign actor who really can act very well, they try to forget as soon as possible that he or she isn't French; chauvinistic as the French are, they prefer their own movies over foreign ones; making movies sometimes seems like mass-production;... Because of this mass-production it's also a fact that not too many movies are excellent (just like in Hollywood), but from time to time something special comes along like this Jean de Florette.The movie has been based on a novel from Marcel Pagnol and tells the story of Jean, son of Florette and a hunch-back, who moves with his family from the city to a small town in the Provence. He has inherited a small farm house with a spring (very precious in a region where there isn't too much water) and a lot of land around it. But an old man and his only remaining relative already were interested in the property themselves. They need the spring water for growing their flowers and when they find out that Jean de Florette will move in, they block up the source. With pleasure they see how Jean gets desperate and how he tries to water his crops with water from wells far afield. The hard labor and the hot summer break Jean's health and the hearts of his wife and daughter, but all the old man and his relative can think about is the cheap land which will soon be available again...I admit that I'm normally not a big fan of French cinema, but when a movie is good, it doesn't matter where it comes from. Thanks to the strong story with its well-developed characters and the very nice acting by Yves Montand, Daniel Auteuil, Elisabeth Depardieu and yes even Gérard Depardieu (I normally don't like him all that much) this movie is much better than the average French cinema. This is a very nice drama that deserves to be seen by a great audience. It is one of the best French movies that I've seen lately. And what more than a nice story, some fine performances and a nice setting (In my opinion the Provence is by far the nicest and prettiest region in France - I wonder why people always think of Paris when they think of France, the country has a lot more and better things to offer) do you need to be convinced?

But the West is changing and is becoming more civilized - too civilized for criminals. When they have robbed a certain train a time too often, a special posse begins trailing them and is always able to stay right behind them, no matter where or how fast they run. When they finally know to escape after a daring act of bravery or foolishness (it just depends on the way you look at it), they come up with another fine plan they will move to Bolivia, the land where life as a criminal is still great...The acting in the movie is nice and I wouldn't be able to choose between Robert Redford and Paul Newman if I had to take one for best performance. Both did a very fine job with this movie, but they had some interesting characters to work with of course. Thanks to the story, which in my opinion can't be seen as a western, but more or less as an adventure movie, this movie is still known and famous. It's original and it was probably a very daring concept in the sixties, when most westerns were still about cowboys and Indians chasing and killing each other.Despite the fact that I'm not too much a fan of westerns, I must say that I liked this one. It will never be my favorite movie, but I admit that I've seen a lot worse in the past. That's why I give this movie a 7\/10. Especially people who love adventure movies will like this classic.

But the man can surprise you. He does not only make movies like Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive, which demand from the viewer that he or she remains focused from the very first second until the last, not for 100% but for 200%. The man is also an excellent story teller, as he proved with the movie The Straight Story and with this The Elephant Man.This movie has been based upon the true story of John Merrick, a man who lived in Victorian England and who suffered from an awful disease which disfigured him completely.

I expected to see a socially engaged drama and that's exactly what I got. This time however, the movie is situated during the time of the Depression and not at the present day. But being very interested in that time period, that was just another fine reason to watch this movie.It tells the story of two young children in Liverpool during the Depression, called Liam and Teresa. When their dad loses his job at the ship yard, their family is facing very difficult times. Blaming the cheap Irish labor and the rich Jewish owners, their dad joins the fascists. In the mean time Liam is about to make his first Holy Communion, which makes it even more difficult for the poor family, because it will cost them too much money on new clothes. Their father, too proud and stubborn to ask for help, hating the church for their immoral behavior (monthly asking for more money, while they already have so much and the family hasn't got anything left) and hating all people who aren't 'English' he decides to go for drastic measures. But just as his hatred reaches its top, it will all explode into his own face...When you aren't able to face criticism on the Catholic church, you better don't even think about watching this movie. You'll find plenty of it from the beginning until the end and I know that not too many people like that or are able to cope with it, believing that it is not true or perhaps exaggerated. But it has to be said that it isn't wrong. Despite what many of you might believe, this was really the way how it all went at that time (My mother told me several times that even in the fifties and sixties this was still common practice). However, when you are able to cope with that anti-religious 'fanatism', you'll see that this is a very good and relevant social drama. The story does a very good job in showing the poverty, the rise of fascism, the desperation and the tough grip that the Catholic church had on the ordinary man and woman. Of course, this story would have been nothing if it hadn't been supported by a fine cast. Especially the young Anthony Borrows did a very nice job, but the other actors like Ian Hart, Claire Hackett, Megan Burns,... sure deserve to be mentioned as well.Overall this is a very nice movie with a very good story, some fine acting and a sober, but powerful message. I really liked what I saw and I consider this as the second hit for Stephen Frears. I give it a 7.5\/10.

Hoping that the second part of the series would be at least as good, I had some very high expectations about this movie. I already saw it a couple of days later and I sure wasn't disappointed by it. But if you haven't seen Jean de Florette yet, than I suggest you don't even bother watching this movie. I'm not saying that it is impossible to watch this movie on its own, but I'm convinced that you will miss a lot of the meaning when you haven't seen what happened to her family in the first movie.Manon des Sources more or less begins where the first movie ended. Many years have gone by since her father died and since Soubeyran and Ugolin bought the farm from her mother. But Manon, who now has grown up into a beautiful young woman, still lives in the hills as a goatherd and comes to realize that not only the two new owners, but the whole village knew of the existence of the spring. Because of a small accident with one of her goats, she finds the source of the spring that not only provides Ugolin, but the entire village of water. She decides to take revenge and does exactly what the two men had done a few years earlier she blocks the water, leaving the entire village without water...What I really liked about this movie - next to the fact that it once more offered some very nice performances, a good story and interesting characters in a beautiful setting - was that it answered some questions that the first movie didn't answer. The open ending of the first movie was OK, but now that I've seen the second movie, I must say that I like it even more. If you liked Jean de Florette, than you certainly will not be disappointed by the sequel, because overall this movie offers more of what you have seen in the first movie. Many of the characters haven't changed, the village still looks the same, the story hasn't changed a lot... The main difference between the two movies is probably the fact that this time the emphasis doesn't lie on the struggle between the two men and Jean on one side and between man and nature on the other side, but more goes for the option of revenge.Many say that Manon des Sources couldn't live up to the high expectations that they had after seeing the first one, but for me personally, this movie was as good as the first one.

Not to mention it's intuition. I often wonder who was sober or not during the whole making of it. The dialogue is so bloody quotable. Good god, the scene where Withnail is hanging out of the car, shouting to people to, kill yourselves, made me lose it. The soundtrack could not be more appropriate. Stevenson's reciting of Shakespeare, I believe Hamlet, in the film's ending comes across with a wallop.

As an adolescent kid you want to know more about love and sex, but the path to adulthood can be a bumpy road. That's also the reason why there have been made so many coming of age-movies. Not all of them were very successful, but some of them sure are worth a watch, like for instance this Skipped Parts.When in 1963, a young woman and her 14-year old son Sam from an unknown man, are expelled from North Carolina by her powerful father who runs for governor, they end up in a small town in Wyoming. Here she continues her irresponsible life of partying and having fun, while her son discovers that the biggest part of his new school is made up by retards who don't seem to know what a book looks like from the inside. There is especially one girl, called Maury, who he can't stand at first, but who he gradually starts to like more and more. When she asks him to help her experiment with sex, they get very close and with the help of his mother they get a pretty good idea of what sex is like. But despite the fact that his mother told them to stop as soon as Maury has had her first period, they are too late and pregnancy is the result. While facing the consequences of their experiments and with grandfather's dictatorial shadow over them, Sam and Maury get help from Hank Elkrunner, a Blackfoot Indian who has become Lydia's newest boyfriend...I guess that it needs some imagination to believe that all what is happening in this movie could actually be true. I'm not saying that it isn't possible, but sometimes it all feels a bit far-fetched. Nevertheless, this is still a very interesting movie and certainly one of the better coming of age-stories that I have ever seen. Especially thanks to the underlying story line of the double moral (sex outside marriage didn't exist, but abortion clinics were available, the totalitarian patriarch who wanted to keep his influence on his family, but didn't want them near him...) and the fine acting in this movie, this is a lot better than average. It's sure worth watching and I gave it a rating of 7\/10 which is far from bad for this kind of movies.
