Eastwood turns in a good performance as Terry McCaleb a retired FBI profiler whose on the search for a serial killed he's been trailing for years. The rest of the cast including Jeff Daniels, Wanda De Jesus, Dylan Walsh, and Angelica Houston in a small role are effective as the supporting characters despite have very limited screen time. The rest of the cast are okay as well. The few violent scenes are well executed but there could have been more of them. This film seemed to be more like a crime drama with some action and thriller elements. The pacing was slow at times making the movie feel longer than it actually is and the ending which reveals the identity of the killer was sort of predictable leaving you feeling a bit disappointed. Despite it flaws though this movie will sure please almost any die hard Clint Eastwood fan. Overall Blood Work is a decent crime drama with some violence, a little suspense, and good performances by the cast but the movie could've been better if it had been faster paced and less predictable.

It's a film, sort of, and in that sense it's the only good thing I can say about it. I've sure that, like a school play or project, family members or close friends of those involved will say Wow, what a great movie, but in all honesty, for people like me and you, no. It's a no. It's all a little too Pugwall for me. Sandler addresses the camera in a soliloquy far too often. This does not bode well for any modern silver screen production.

I had one in mind and got it, and being a bit of a Tom Hanks fan, I happened across this one, and debated on whether or not to get it. Finally, I grabbed it before I changed my mind, and I am so glad I did! I wasn't quite sure what to expect at first, so I sat down to watch this only knowing who was in it and that it was about two lawyers and deals with AIDS. However, by the first fifteen minutes or so of the film, I knew it was going to be a good one. The story is such a powerful one that it shook me, and still has me a bit shaken. The acting in here was brilliant on all sides, and the story is something we can all learn from - everyone is equal. I knew that Tom Hanks had won an Oscar for his role, and after watching this I can totally understand why - one of his best performances I have ever seen.To summarize - brilliant. Brilliant film, brilliant actors, brilliant story, brilliant lesson. Simply brilliant. If you haven't seen it, you certainly should!

By now, if you're reading my review, you already know the players and the plot. I'm not sure if reviews are posted with the most recent first. However, I wanted to add my review because of just how powerful this movie is, even today. As a young girl, I grew up on these types of movies. I watched them and appreciate them, however, not as much as I do today, now that I am a mother of two little girls. I wanted to show them great films, for them to earn an appreciation of 'a feel-good movie' and I started with 'The Song of Bernadette'. My follow up was 'Going My Way' and they loved it -- so did my husband who had never seen it growing up. We're 70s kids, by the way, and 'Going My Way' has timeless relevance. Quite the heady responsibility Fr. O'Malley has of turning things around at St. Dominic's! However, with prayer, faith and determination, it is all possible. Fr. Fitzgibbons is so set in his ways that he's not receptive to Fr. O'Malley (who unfortunately gets off to a bad start). In time, though, their friendship deepens and never once does Fr. O'Malley force his new role on the aging Pastor. The scene where, after visiting the bishop to initially have Fr. O'Malley removed, Fr. Fitzgibbons sits in a chair and tells of how, without needing so many words, he now understands the real reason that Fr. O'Malley was sent is very moving. There's a lot of music in this film (perfectly fine when you have Bing Crosby in it!) and a bit of opera from 'the Met' -- definitely got my kids asking about the particular opera they featured. I hope you will show these types of movies to your children, as I have now begun to. All the pieces come together and you can feel the segue to a 'sequel' in the last ten or fifteen minutes of the film. It personifies what putting the needs of others before your own truly means, and how God works in those ways will cause you to experience a wide range of emotions. Overall, this is a terrific film and tonight, we will watch the 'sequel', The Bells of St. Mary's.
