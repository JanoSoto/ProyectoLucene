Hell, go online and look at the user reviews and see how many people feel about this movie (Or the multiple videos of people running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art). Though I have never been the biggest fan of the franchise, I am for the first time currently watching the movies with a friend who is. Even though I don't adore all these movies like a lot of other people do, I can clearly see why they are so highly regarded.Sylvester Stallone (Who also wrote the script) stars as Rocky Balboa, an underground boxer who consistently wins yet earns little prize money, residing in a rundown Philadelphia town. Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), decides to give one underdog a shot at the title choosing Rocky because of his nickname The Italian Stallion. Rocky is grateful yet refuses the offer, but after a change of heart he later accepts. Training with Paulie (Burt Young), who allows Rocky to train by punching meat in the factory he works at and old boxing coach Mickey (A brilliant performance from Burgess Meredith), who also offers his fighting expertise to Rocky. In his downtime, Balboa also tries to form a relationship with Paulie's shy sister Adrian (Talia Shire). After a couple of training montages here and there, Rocky is ready and does it really matter if he will win? We have gotten to know and love the character so much, either way you'll be cheering his name.Stallone really had a heart for this film, and obviously has done a very good job on making Rocky such an icon over instalments. John G. Avildsen has shot the film very well to capture the Philadelphia street-life, and the boxing match at multiple angles (Though with any simulated sport, some of the hits don't make contact). Bill Conti's music has obviously passed into the stuff of legend, and one thing I love about the Rocky films is that every one of them has a different era and form of music in their soundtracks. Sure you can have Survivor playing, but the first score remains superior and the very well orchestrated pieces give bleak yet optimistic views of inner city life (Listen to Philadelphia Morning, you'll understand what I mean).Final Verdict There's brilliant acting and a bit of a predictable script, but nevertheless it's a film full of heart.

The story was already getting thin with third movie and the forth one is watchable only when you don't take it seriously. This fifth movie reunites Stallone and John Avildsen (The director of original Rocky) together for the first time since 14 years . After the over the top Rocky 4 this one was supposed to be a back to the roots. A serious drama.Unfortunately this movie is a failure. The direction of Avildsen is very cheesy at places (Rocky remembering Mick , the hip hop soundtrack , pathos in the final fight). Most of the problems come from the screenplay. The characters of Rocky , Paulie and Adrian haven't really changed and to watch for the fifth time the same characters acting the same way is just annoying. Not to mention that Stallone . Young and Shire overact in their dramatic scenes here. And Rocky 5 does feel similar at times to Rocky 2 (the money problems , becoming an ordinary person once again).The story on paper looks good , but as a movie it's a cheap morality story about loyalty, greed and father-son relationship. The screenplay isn't subtle with dealing of all those things. It's hard to believe that Rocky would forget about his son so easily and gave everything to Tommy. Sure , I understand why he did it (because he was in that way still fighting on the ring) , but it feels just too convenient. Same goes for his conflict wit Tommy . The whole potential is killed by sappiness and morality preaching. Not to mention the black and white morality. Tommy Gunn is one-dimensional asshole through all the movie . He could be a tragic figure (he's got a troubled past) , but the one dinner talk is just too little . The boxing manager George Duke is also annoyingly one-dimensional villain.The good things are the funny dialogues and as always the music by Bill Conti. Also , the fight scenes are done well and the movie isn't boring. All in all it's just too little to save this unwanted and unnecessary sequel . Thankfully , Rocky Balboa was a great farewell to Rocky. I give it 3\/10.

Not for its chilling tone and graphic scenes, but its documentary-drama vibes and Michael Rooker's colder than ice performance. I have been looking for this film for almost a year, and I finally found it in a cheap record store with a shelf of 500 other DVD's just gathering dust.Essentially the film is based on the infamous real-life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, a man found guilty and convicted of 11 murders but had been both known and rumoured to have killed 600 people between the 1960's and 1980's. Henry for a time, would be killing at least 1 person a week with the help of a drifter and male prostitute Otis Toole. Henry died in prison of heart failure in 2001, at the age of 64.The film is loosely based on those events, but as the opening credits say, it is a Portrait and non-fictitious story of a man named Henry. Otis has been tweaked in as a fellow convict and his niece in real life had been changed to be his sister. As far as the narrative goes, it is literally watching Henry killing prostitute after prostitute, and eventually the meeting of Otis's sister (Who is sweet and naive to Henry's crimes). Both reveal there troubled pasts in the notorious Yeah I killed my Mama speech. Sooner or later, Otis (Who is beyond sicker) joins Henry on his endeavours, and dreadfully re-watches the sadistic attacks on recorded tape.It's 1 hour 20 minutes of brutal killings and character development. But as many critics have realised and shamefully myself too, it is a movie That fuels people's fascination about serial killers. I've seen many a snuff movie with results I cannot fully understand, but Henry does have some harsh pros about it. 1. It's partly true, and 2. The characters are sick enough to actually become interesting. You will not believe how far you'll be willing to watch these portrayals go. Michael Rooker is in his first ever role as Henry, giving us an all to real performance. There are moments where he is surpassed by Tom Towles's performance as Otis, which is so unreal sometimes Henry felt like the anti- hero of the movie (Yezus!). Final Verdict It's sick to which I am all for, but I wished in more meaningful purposes. But nevertheless, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer does have this bizarrely strong appeal, most likely because of its part fact, part true story. I urge you to check it out sometime, BUT BE PREPARED. 8\/10.

Steven Spielberg mentioned that Kubrick was very eager to somewhat change the form of film. When Steven asked Didn't you already do that with 2001?, he said that Kubrick replied A little bit.

Ambitions began by hoping to offer more than the genre previously did such as the large majority of campy fun 1950's Atomic age of American Sci-Fi movies. Teaming up with Sci-Fi author Arthur C. Clarke, they began to write a screenplay adapted from Clarke's short story The Sentinel. The result would be a project that was deliberately meant to be unique for everyone who saw it, and Clarke would somewhat continue 2001 with his version of the narrative in a series of four novels (Whether or not it was canon I do not know). 2001 has many themes present, but in its style and approach of the unknown I will also admit it doesn't really engage fully throughout its running length. Famous Soviet Director Andrei Tarkovsky criticised the film as too enamoured with spectacle, and would go on to create the phenomenal Solaris in 1972 (Which offers far more in existentialism, and definitely worth your time if you enjoyed 2001). It's obvious to say that nothing looked like this before in 1968. Star Trek season 2 was underway, the moon landing was still a year away and no one knew what our planet looked like from up there. The model space station orbiting around the painting of earth is burned into my brain, and perfectly transcends beyond the scope of any average Hollywood movie. The first 20 minutes alone is a silent masterpiece, at a time when the world and medium was growing so rapidly. Time is rewound to reveal something prehistoric, and suddenly the famous match cut shoots us thousands of years into space where it becomes obvious that the visuals are there just to accompany some incredibly large scale music pieces by the likes of Richard Strauss, and Johann Strauss II.To this day, The Monolith is still shrouded in mystery. Does it grant knowledge, or just appear at pivotal events? Regardless, the mystery has endured the objects charm and legacy. Towards the second act, we see how far mankind has come with a certain Artificial Intelligence called the HAL 9000. In a harrowing display of humanity's reliance on computers, cold responses and interactions mean anything could happen when taking the Turing Test of hell. With symmetrical rooms and unnerving silence, all of it eventually builds towards the trippy Jupiter and Beyond sequence.

This film can be analysed to death, but will probably never be fully understood.

This would shackle the viewer to reality, and I don't want this to happen to 2001. Themes of human evolution, technology, and extraterrestrial life are present.

Since that relationship is the heart of the movie, its total lack of believable passion is a very serious flaw.Better casting of either (especially Tom) or both roles could have solved it. (Ruccolo looks too much like Renée Zellweger to be sexy anyway, and his shaved chest is a big turn-off.)Second, when Tom, the self-proclaimed martini expert, makes one for Eli, he uses vodka. Now, I know there are idiots in the world who actually do make a drink with vodka which they call a martini, but that doesn't make it a martini. A martini is made with gin, not vodka. Using vodka to make a martini is like using Crisco to make butter cookies you can call the result butter cookies, but that doesn't make them butter cookies.What this movie has going for it are a mostly entertaining and intelligent screenplay (only occasionally irritating and stupid - like the Gone with the Wind bit on the first date, and a few similar times when an only marginally entertaining joke is dragged out way too long; Tom blowing vermouth fumes into the martini is another clunker); a dynamite comic performance by snarky Adam Goldberg just being snarky Adam Goldberg; a solid performance by Sasha Alexander as the female glue that holds the three male flakes together; and a good enough performance by Bucatinsky to make Eli believable as a person if not as a lover - but even that is more Ruccolo's fault than his.

Since that relationship is the heart of the movie, its total lack of believable passion is a very serious flaw.Better casting of either (especially Tom) or both roles could have solved it. (Ruccolo looks too much like Renée Zellweger to be sexy anyway, and his shaved chest is a big turn-off.)Second, when Tom, the self-proclaimed martini expert, makes one for Eli, he uses vodka. Now, I know there are idiots in the world who actually do make a drink with vodka which they call a martini, but that doesn't make it a martini. A martini is made with gin, not vodka. Using vodka to make a martini is like using Crisco to make butter cookies you can call the result butter cookies, but that doesn't make them butter cookies.What this movie has going for it are a mostly entertaining and intelligent screenplay (only occasionally irritating and stupid - like the Gone with the Wind bit on the first date, and a few similar times when an only marginally entertaining joke is dragged out way too long; Tom blowing vermouth fumes into the martini is another clunker); a dynamite comic performance by snarky Adam Goldberg just being snarky Adam Goldberg; a solid performance by Sasha Alexander as the female glue that holds the three male flakes together; and a good enough performance by Bucatinsky to make Eli believable as a person if not as a lover - but even that is more Ruccolo's fault than his. Brief cameos by Doris Roberts and Lisa Kudrow are bonus treats.

Based on the play made in 1959 by an African-American playwright and painter Lorraine Hansberry. Raisin in the Sun was the first drama written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway. Young Lorraine grew up in a Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood and her own experiences lead to the play's story. She got the title of the play by finding it in a Langston Hughes's poem book 'Harlem' which is quotes in the poem 'A dream deferred'. The title, 'Raisin in the Sun' referred in the original poem about the hundreds of African American slaves that work in the hot sun in the cotton fields whom dream dry up like a raisin. In the play and the movie, its symbolism the frustration of blacks working trying to make a better life for themselves, but in the end, their dream are forgotten or put off due to the mixer of racism and classism. The movie story is about a working-class family called the Youngers. Living in a lousy apartment for decades, they want to and wish to leave the place behind. The central idea of the play is concerned with fighting off the myth of black contentment. It shows the stress of being in poverty when the large family is crammed into a small apartment. The plot get going when the family finds out that Lena AKA Mama (Claudia McNeil) got an insurance check for $10,000. Each members of the family find themselves having their own version of what to do with an insurance check. Walter Lee (Sidney Poitler) a poor chauffeur, dreams of making a fortune by investing the money in a liquor business against the wishes of both his wife and the mother. Sidney Poitler does a great job as Walter. It's one of his best roles in my opinion. You can see the want in his eyes. The pain, he goes through when it doesn't come his way. Powerful. Beneatha (Diana Sands), his flighty college student sister also wants the money so that she can be a doctor and live in Africa with one of her two boyfriends. One is a boy, George Murchison (Louis Gossett), a wealthy Negro concerned with appearances and material, while the second, Joseph Asagai (Ivan Dixon), is a native African that inspires her intellectually and spiritually. Great symbolism with Beneatha's hair in the film. When the movie begins, Beneatha has straightened hair. Midway through the play, after Asagai visits her and questions her hairstyle, she cuts her Caucasian-seeming hair for the new radical afro represents her embracing of her African heritage. Beneatha's cutting of her hair is a very powerful social statement in the 1960's, as she symbolically declares that natural black is beautiful and wouldn't conform to the style society dictates at the time. It's become a symbol of her anti-assimilationist beliefs. The film dealt with the talk about racism, not only with whites and blacks, but also black against black. One of the first major allusions to any sort of racism appears with the character of George Murchison. When the wealthy George enters the picture, the Younger family sees the differences in race and grouped him with snobbish white people. Mama dreams of buying a home in all-white neighborhood with her money, but fears that they would be faced with racist neighbors, and people trying to buy them out to prevent the neighborhood's integration. One such person trying to buy them out is Karl Aka Mark Linder (John Fielder) whom openly states the racism present in the neighborhood that Mama wants to live. While he at first sugarcoats his words, he tells the Youngers that they are not wanted in the neighborhood because they are Negroes. Mama's choice soon become troublesome, as one choice can lead them into deeply poverty or salvation. A Raisin in the Sun is essentially about dreams, as the main characters struggle to deal with the oppressive circumstances that rule their lives, both with happiness and depression. The movie follows a good amount of themes such as the need to fight racial discrimination in a powerfully demonstrates of the family strength. By having a strong family, it shows that the African American community, that the importance of family is key to success. One great thing about the movie is how little, they change from the play. Most of the movie takes place in the home. Was the bar scene really needed? Not really, the producers could had shown Walter's alcoholic nature, just with him coming home with a bottle, and we would get the same results. But by showing the audience how cramped the apartment is, we get how badly they are struggling. Plus, it's nice to see a movie with few cuts scenes. Director Daniel Petrie did a great job. I would had love to see more of Mama's plant. In the play, Mama's plant represents both Mama's care and her dream for her family. Still, the movie does a great job with dealing with other issues, such as abortion, greed, and the lack of religion. The movie follows the play very well. While, 2008's TV movie 'A Raisin in the Sun' does a good job as well. It's doesn't beat this movie by acting standards and scene delivery. While, one might label this as a 'black people' movie, I found its subject matter, universal. I think this film dealt with everything any common folk might have to deal with, and that's why I think the movie is so well-made.

Whilst the original is a classic, I saw the Redux first and was blown away by the new material incorporated (Maybe the French plantation stuff still could've been left out). Obviously any film enthusiast can agree that Apocalypse Now is essentially a film like no other. A tense hallucinogenic, physically exhausting movie which can only be described as part War, and something else entirely towards its conclusion. It is something hard to describe unless you see it, and even then I find the experience hard to put down into words.One thing I love about this movie is the success it had after going against all odds during production. For those who don't know Brando showed up too overweight, was reportedly very hard to work with and would require a body double during day scenes. Harvey Keitel was replaced by Martin Sheen a few weeks into filming, and Sheen had a heart attack at the age of 36 only to return to work a month later. What would be a 16-week shoot, took over 239 days of sweat & torture. Typhoon Olga destroyed many expensive sets, extras & the crew got malaria and many other diseases. Sam Bottoms (The actor who plays Lance), was constantly on drugs while shooting and Martin Sheen's brother did half of the voice-over narrative due to his brother's sickness. The killing of the water buffalo attracted obvious animal protection laws, and the ending was re-written countless times as Coppola had to make a film out of 2300 hours of recorded footage. Of course for obvious reasons, Francis Ford Coppola threatened suicide countless times. That's just a handful of problems and stuff that happened, if you're interested in learning more, I extremely recommend watching Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991). Based on the 1899 classic novel Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. The story revolves around ivory trading, colonialism, cruelty, humanity and obsession. All this seems more than fitting to be adapted into a War tale. Finally beginning the movie, helicopters fly across a burning jungle all while The End by The Doors plays in the background. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is drunk, drugged out and wasting away in a room in Saigon (Anyone anxious to know this was shot on Martin's 36th Birthday, who actually WAS drunk and drugged out when he told Copolla to film what was happening and leave him to it. What happens as you see on screen he actually broke the mirror, bled out then reportedly attacked Francis. The crew were so frightened they wanted to stop yet, he ordered Coppola to continue filming). Being called upon by Generals (Most notably a cameo by Harrison Ford, under the name Lucas), he is ordered to exterminate with extreme prejudice General Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando), A Green Beret who has gone AWOL.What follows is Willard's mission up the Vietnamese river, on the boat he narrates his views on the War and Kurtz in the dossier given to him, questioning his respect for Kurtz as well as his mission. With his crew (Amongst them is Laurence Fishburne in his first role), all of them witness the horrors of the War and the one vital lesson Never get off the boat. On their journey they encounter a kind, yet insane Seargent Kilgore (A manic performance by Robert Duvall, who utters my favourite movie quote I love the smell of napalm in the morning). They also have to contend with fellow soldiers, animals and even Playboy Bunnies (Including real-life playmate of the year Cynthia Wood).Throughout the picture Kurtz is seen as a some what God-like figure to those around him, especially by an all too literal American photographer (An expertly casted Dennis Hopper). Seeing Kurtz for the first time is probably one of the most chilling, tense and surreal moments in motion picture history, and by the end of the movie Willard's goals and possibly your original thoughts are left so askew everything comes to close and certain fates are left unknown. Was the mission a success or what is the unexpected fallout after such events? Will Willard be destined to follow in Kurtz's footsteps?In terms of negativity, I would like to throw in Stanley Kubrick's Interview with Michèle Halberstadt, October 1987. Kubrick I think that Coppola was stuck by the fact that he didn't have anything that resembled a story. So he had to make each scene more spectacular than the one before, to the point of absurdity. The ending is so unreal, and purely spectacular, that it's like a version, much improved, of King Kong (laughs). And Brando is supposed to give an intellectual weight to the whole thing&#x85; I think it just didn't work. But it's terrifically done. And there are some very strong scenes.Final Verdict On the plus side it should be noted that many people who have seen it have declared it accurate to how it was like experiencing Vietnam. On the negative I would also say the films structure is so out of the directors hand given the events that happened behind the camera. What I can declare definitively is that Francis Ford Coppola manage to build something unforgettable with what should have been an absolute disaster. How he did it I don't know, and therefore I would say thank you sir for what was such an astonishing success and failure. 10\/10. I guarantee there's never going to be anything like it again.

Goth-ed out with multiple piercings, tattoos, and dyed hair, she listens to strange music, watches vintage TV, eats primarily chocolate, and self injures. But now high school is over and she needs a job. In an effort to secure employment at the upscale Century City Mall in Los Angeles, Jennifer, a 17-year-old goth-punk, makes a nuisance of herself at a clothing store run by 49-year-old Randall Harris (Brooks), who eventually hires her on a trial basis as a stockroom clerk.

In my analysis, the movie really has two central themes. The first is a grim depiction of the reality that awaits those who come to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune, and how many who go there end up in very bad shape. The second theme revolves around David Lynch's attempt to literally film a dream\/nightmare and contrast it with the reality of Diane's life. Diane Selwyn is the real-life character - a naive Midwestern arrival (who is also lesbian) seeking fame and fortune in Hollywood. In reality, Diane is the waitress at the diner who, between shifts, scurries to and fro doing screen tests, looking for her big break. Diane meets the real Rita during a film shoot and they do some other gigs together and develop a romantic relationship. All hell breaks loose when the real Rita announces her marriage to the director Adam Kesher at a cast party held at Kesher's Mulholland Drive home. Thus begins a downward spiral for Diane, who realizes that her big break (as well as her love life) will vanish once Rita is married. Also at the party, she realizes that Rita has another girlfriend on the side and has moved on. Soon, Diane is hiring hit men to kill Rita, who (I think) end up killing, not Rita, but Rita's new girlfriend who was in the wrong place at the wrong time (I say that because it looks like the dead body in bungalow #12 has blond hair, so it can't be Rita). That is the reality. The dream is Diane's psychotic nightmare after everything goes down and the police want to question her. In Diane's dream\/nightmare, she is innocent Betty who comes to Hollywood and becomes a star. And rather than the reality of trying to murder Rita, she dreams that she is helping an amnesiac Rita remember who she is as they wander through Diane's dreamworld seeking clues. Various characters from Diane's reality, like Kesher's mother Coco, assume different identities and roles in the dream. In Diane's dreams, she was screwed out of fame and fortune by Rita, Kesher and other sinister forces who control the movie industry (Dan Hedaya's movie mafia). Towards the end of the movie, we realize that Diane's life is unraveling. The movie, then, is a glimpse into the mind of a shattered soul who is cornered and hours away from ruin. I won't go any further into the plot, but I marvel at Lynch's attempt to film a dream. The movie is not perfect, but it is a wonderful type of whodunnit that simply cannot be understood in one viewing.

That film which was an anti-racist tract which ended up being racist, a fact which Parker essentially acknowledges on Paradise's DVD commentary track. He then admits he conceived of Paradise as a means of addressing the unfinished business of racism in the United States, and that he applied to the film a level of research he'd never before undertaken, interviewing hundreds of survivors, studying thousands of photographs and painstakingly selecting Japanese background music.You'd think all this research would result in a dispiriting work of social realism, but no, Parker's tone is actually something else. His film is lively, at times comical, and structured as a story recounted to a young child, a technique which allows Parker to get away with a slightly sanitised, playful view history.

Whatever you may think of the movie, and whatever your opinion of Charlton Heston's acting, nothing can be taken away from it's final couple of minutes. The film is worth watching just for that.

As soon as I returned home to Los Angeles, I had to rent the film to see what I hadn't heard, and I was not bored for a minute. To say that Dawn Davenport had a lot of problems is an understatement. I'm sure she was right down the hall from Tracy Turnblad (of Hairspray) as these both took place in Baltimore around the same time, so watch it with that thought in mind.Tracy was sent to detention for a hair don't while Dawn (the over-sized Divine) was expelled after fighting the girl who tattled on her for eating a meatball sandwich in class. Dawn is then furious when on Christmas day, she opens her present to find sensible lady-like shoes while she wanted cha-cha heels. A fight with her father follows and Dawn rushes out into the cold in nothing but a coat and a slinky, too-tight nighty. Then, she is picked up by none other than Divine, in male guise, and ravished by him, leaving her pregnant and alone. You'll be mesmerized as Dawn delivers the baby herself, goes from hash slinger to go-go dancer to a part of a mugging ring.Divine isn't the only gross-out character here; There's the enormous Edith Massey, stuffed into a one-piece leather outfit, as the aunt of the long-haired man Divine becomes lovers with. If the sight of Divine having sex with herself\/himself isn't enough to drop your jaw, try Massey fondling herself topless then strutting around in this leather sausage wrapper as she begs her nephew to convert to homosexuality. The world of heterosexuality is a sick and boring life! she protests, even more aghast by Divine's womanly presence in his life. Daughter Taffy grows up into a Rhoda\/Bad Seed\/Nellie Olsen like brat who rebuffs her daddy then sets off to find her real father, now a disgusting drunk who ends up repulsing her.Their world changes when Massey throws acid in Divine's face, but Divine uses the scars to accentuate what she already feels to be beautiful. I can't really repeat a lot of the dialog here, but even if I could, it would take away the pleasure of hearing some of the most obscene words put together in a reviling type of poetry. The film sort of falls apart when Divine goes on a major crime spree towards the end, but it really is spoofing all of those bad girl 50's and 60's movies, so that's a necessary evil. I can guarantee that while Waters' later films Hairspray and Cry Baby went on to become Broadway musicals, this one will remain where it belongs, as a midnight cult movie where the somewhat tipsy audience members shout out the lines along with the stars.
