[{"date":"12 December 2015","score":"","review":" Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill, Wendy Crewson, Kiersten Warren and Oliver Platt star in Chris Columbus' 1999 sci-fi drama based on the book. This takes place in the future and the late, Williams (Mrs. Doubtfire) plays robot\/android, Andrew who starts out working for Richard Martin (Neill) and his wife, Rachel (Crewson). Soon, Andrew takes interest in humanity and is determined to become part of it. Davidtz (Matilda) plays Richard and Rachel's grown-up daughter, Amanda who befriends Andrew and also plays Amanda's granddaughter, Portia who finds romance with him, Warren (Independence Day) plays robot\/android, Galatea and Platt (Executive Decision) plays scientist, Rupert Burns who helps Andrew. This is a good film, Williams was great in it, he and Davidtz had good chemistry, the rest of the cast is good and the late, James Horner's score is excellent as usual. This is definitely one of Williams' best I recommend.
