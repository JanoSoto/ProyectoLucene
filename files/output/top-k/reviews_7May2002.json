Maybe I do it as therapy. I dunno. Or maybe I'm trying to convince myself that it really is better living in a city that has been known to have blizzards in April. Whatever. But enough about me. This Jack Arnold-directed movie was made for the old Universal-International at a time that studio wasn't nearly the behemoth it is today. But U-I, or rather its management, wanted to be big, and were aiming to grow. Kind of like the eight-legged creature in this film.The movie is set in an Arizona desert town whose handsome young Dr. John Agar is trying to solve the mysterious death of a man from a condition known as acromegaly (or acromegalia, as it's called in the film). His quest takes him to the laboratory of research scientist Leo G. Carroll, who, though outwardly polite, clearly doesn't want to be bothered. He doesn't want his beautiful young assistant, Mara Corday, to be bothered, either, least of all by the romantic Dr. Agar. As luck would have it, Carroll and his former associate and friend,--let's call him the acromegaly man, and leave it at that--were working on a nutrient that they hoped would cure world hunger. To make a long story short, one of the creatures they were experimenting on, a tarantula already the size of a Volkswagon, escaped from the lab when the acromegaly man set it on fire, as he had gone mad. He also injected Dr. Carroll with the formula that would in time give him acromegaly, too. Some friend.In a brief period of time the spider has grown to the size of a house, then an office building. He's either very shrewd or very lucky to avoid being spotted, feasting mostly on ranchers and men in remote areas where he won't be seen by others. Guns are useless against the big guy. Dynamite can't kill him, either. He just ambles on right through it. The Air Force has to be called in. I won't tell you any more because I don't want to spoil the ending for you. As big bug movies go, this one's near the top of my list. It's very well photographed, and the life of the small town is presented with just enough credibility so that even when the story gets a tad weird, the people seem real. I especially liked Nestor Paiva's extremely (to put it mildly) aggressive performance as the sheriff. Forceful as he is, he's never obnoxious, just assertive. Mara Corday doesn't have much to do but look pretty, which she does superbly. The late John Agar is quite good as the town doctor. No, this isn't George C. Scott we're talking about, but Agar is competent. Also, there's something about his looks, the eyes and cheekbones especially, that give him an alien, almost unreal aspect. It's a perfect face for a fifties sci-fi hero. Slightly android. Leo G. Carroll is his usual diffident self, and he does make a convincing scientist. There's something about Carroll's manner and delivery of dialog that makes you want to hear more. I wish he'd have more to say and more to do, and not just in this movie, in all the movies he appeared in. This isn't exactly a star vehicle for him, but his role is substantial, and in a way it's his low-key underacting that keeps the movie anchored in something that resembles reality. Put a more flamboyant type in the part, a Rathbone or a Lugosi, and the film would be over the top.

The movie tries to stay as close as it can to the plot of the story, however it falls short in many areas. For instance it is very hard to portray magical realism in a movie because one of the principles of magical realism is that one forgets about reality and is swept into a land of queer sensual pleasures which are not really possible except in the mind.

The inability to portray mental thought without words is quite hard and it still has not quite been mastered by modern film-makers. However, the movie is still good for what it is, and the acting ranges from intense to silly, with Mama Elena and Chencha at the ends of the spectrum. Tita did a wonderful job as the angered, broken servant who is forced to obey her mother for the rest of her life, and who consequently brakes the tradition. The movie is quite cliche, but the importance of food, or tradition, in the de la Garza family, or any family, is a theme which is quite unique, mainly because the book itself is unique. Food plays an important role in the story because it links senses with past emotions, rooting the story to the past and to tradition.

This film proves that by combining enough talent to make a decent film, along with an uber-agressive marketing campaign and a character that already has mounds of fans from many different generations, not only can a film be highly successful on opening weekend, but it can continue to do well (as I'm sure it will) because the audience is given just what they want and deserve.This film has been well received by those critics who understand how wide a demographic this film had to please. Therefore, the film had to serve many roles for many people. Firstly, the film couldn't be overly complicated, which is wasn't. This was perfect for the smaller kids, who would love the quick action(which some say were too quick, but I'm sure the producers didn't want to scare children with gratuitous violence) and the borderline cartoony flavor of the film.For teens, there is the ability to identify with Peter Parker's flaws and vicariously delight in his new found superpowers and his overcoming of the school bully. For the girls, there was the romance between Mary Jane and Parker, which was effective.For adults, there is William DaFoe, who gave a SORELY underrated performance. I have heard so many critics say he did a horrible job, and I am so disappointed in this. Would they have rather ARNOLD play the character? Jesus, if anyone else had played the character of Norman Osborn, it would have been a disaster. He played it off so well that he was far more realistic than any other character. They blame DaFoe for the shortcomings of the character, but the character was true to the comic. I have heard critics insulting the insanity scenes where Norman talks to himself in a mirror, but it was supposed to be dramatic, and he did a job that few could match. Hearing him laugh near the ending when his son arrived was hysterical.Older folks taking their grandkids will love Ben and Aunt May, who were a bit hokey, but I'm sure they wouldn't appear that way to loving grandparents.Of course, J.Jonah Jameson was terrific (Mr. Jameson, your wife is on the phone, she wants to know...

Their leader, Frank Miller, will arrive on it and together they will get revenge for Miller's jail time (he was supposed to be hanged). The man who put him in jail is Will Kane (Gary Cooper). He has just been married (to Grace Kelly) and is about to leave town, but he figures he can't while those criminals are there to start trouble. He goes back to raise a posse to take the outlaws before they can do anything. No can do, though. Everyone else is out for him\/herself, and they all either refuse or ignore Kane when he asks them to be deputees.High Noon telegraphs its every move ten minutes in advance. There's nothing special about it, and its themes are rather trite. It would be passable if any of the performers were good. It's actually kind of depressing, considering how good some of them are elsewhere. I loved Gary Cooper in Meet John Doe, but he seems really uncomfortable in High Noon. We never really learn anything much about Kane, and Cooper only helps us know less. Grace Kelly is particularly bad. To tell the truth, she was never a great actress. One year later, in John Ford's Mogambo, she gave an equally neurotic and unbelievable performance. Only in Hitchcock's films, in particular Rear Window, did she shed that nervous quality. Lloyd Bridges - well, maybe it's just me, but I can never find him effective in a drama. He was so much better when he got older and started to do comedy like Airplane. Perhaps the only one on par with the rest of his career is Thomas Doc Washburn Mitchell.The villains are particularly pathetic in High Noon. I know, the real villains are those who refuse to fight, but the film would have been infinitely stronger if Frank Miller and the other three thugs had some personality. When a movie talks about a villain for 3\/4 of its run, and then he appears without any bells or whistles, it's sure to disappoint. When the obligatory gunfight arrives, it's nothing if not boring. I longed for the dramatic effectiveness of the shootout in My Darling Clementine.High Noon is a film made with some skill. The cinematography is good. For some reason, it always got really good when they would cut over to the three outlaws waiting for Frank Miller. Those three actors always seemed to be standing in some clever composition. The only thing about High Noon that I would rate as exceptional would be the music. It's quite good, if a bit overused (especially during the gunfight sequence; again, I think back to the beautiful and harrowing silence of My Darling Clementine). Overall, I don't hate High Noon, but just feel it is weak and definitely overrated. 6\/10.

We never really learn anything much about Kane, and Cooper only helps us know less. Grace Kelly is particularly bad. To tell the truth, she was never a great actress. One year later, in John Ford's Mogambo, she gave an equally neurotic and unbelievable performance. Only in Hitchcock's films, in particular Rear Window, did she shed that nervous quality. Lloyd Bridges - well, maybe it's just me, but I can never find him effective in a drama. He was so much better when he got older and started to do comedy like Airplane. Perhaps the only one on par with the rest of his career is Thomas Doc Washburn Mitchell.The villains are particularly pathetic in High Noon. I know, the real villains are those who refuse to fight, but the film would have been infinitely stronger if Frank Miller and the other three thugs had some personality. When a movie talks about a villain for 3\/4 of its run, and then he appears without any bells or whistles, it's sure to disappoint. When the obligatory gunfight arrives, it's nothing if not boring. I longed for the dramatic effectiveness of the shootout in My Darling Clementine.High Noon is a film made with some skill. The cinematography is good. For some reason, it always got really good when they would cut over to the three outlaws waiting for Frank Miller. Those three actors always seemed to be standing in some clever composition. The only thing about High Noon that I would rate as exceptional would be the music. It's quite good, if a bit overused (especially during the gunfight sequence; again, I think back to the beautiful and harrowing silence of My Darling Clementine).

Their leader, Frank Miller, will arrive on it and together they will get revenge for Miller's jail time (he was supposed to be hanged). The man who put him in jail is Will Kane (Gary Cooper). He has just been married (to Grace Kelly) and is about to leave town, but he figures he can't while those criminals are there to start trouble. He goes back to raise a posse to take the outlaws before they can do anything. No can do, though.

I should have known that the movie would, too, and this is one of those films that I can watch over and over again without tiring.  It seems to be that they really don't make 'em like they used to, and the few years between the late '60s and mid-'70s produced some of the best war-themed (and this would include anti-war) films ever made. Most of them were built around stories that could actually have been told in a similar way in another setting.  This film is an example of that principle, as is Catch 22 and -- though I somehow seem to have managed to miss it thus far, definitely not by design -- M*A*S*H* (Apocalypse Now is a slightly later example, in that it could have been set in any conflict or, as in the novel from which it drew inspiration, in what passes for peacetime). The cast is great and it's probably that as much as anything that has the power to keep me watching this long film to its conclusion even after multiple viewings.  Pretty much everyone's perfectly cast, and all do a great job with balancing the real nastiness of war (that does intrude now and then) with the more comedic elements that really define the film.  For me, the primary attraction of this movie and its most unforgettable character -- is Oddball, the Sherman tank commander played to perfection by Donald Sutherland in all his hippiesque glory.  Every second that Oddball has on screen is classic, his way-out-ness being all the more exaggerated by contrast with Clint Eastwood's generally stony façade and the pragmatism of Telly Savalas' character.  The three primary leads actually make up a pretty good yin-yangish kind of composite person, the tightly reined-in but actually quite visionary cynic in Kelly, the practical and cautioning skeptic in Big Joe, and the free thinking Oddball.  All of the actors, including those in relatively minor roles, are superb, but who could forget Oddball's all knowing facial expressions, as if only he were privy to some private joke, his admonitions that Moriarty quit with the 'negative waves,' his out-of-left-field dog imitations (both of them, including his other dog imitation), his kicking back with some wine and cheese and catching some rays during the final battle, etc, etc, etc.  He's a visionary, too, with his idea of playing music during his attacks  -- did Coppola get the idea for that classic helicopter- gunship Valkyries scene in Apocalypse Now from this movie? Oddball's very existence makes the film somewhat self-aware, but the scene that perhaps brings this home more than any other (and hopefully dispels any viewer's lingering suspicion that this is primarily a 'serious' war movie) is the Tombstone-style 'showdown' with the last operational Tiger tank, complete with dubbed-in jangling spurs as tribute to Clint Eastwood's spaghetti- western legacy.  I could see how some might not like such a movie, but I love it. The producers also did a nice job of keeping things authentic, other than the jarring anachronism that is Oddball and his crew of proto-hippies (though I'm prepared to accept that they anticipated the first wave of the Beat Generation, the likely explanation is that they're a deliberately contrived ironic reference to the period during which the film was made -- a kind of bridge, albeit not burning). The Yugoslavian locations fit the story and are convincing as a stand-in for WWII France.  The US military hardware is accurate as are German uniforms and, as far as I could tell (I wasn't scrutinizing every gun), their hardware.  The SdKfz halftrack that the German patrol at the minefield used may have been a gussied-up US version -- I didn't really stop to look -- but that's no big deal, not particularly obvious in the film, and more than forgivable in that the film's makers put so much thought into mocking up Tiger I tank bodies on what were really Soviet T-34 tanks.  That was a nice touch, especially for a movie that does not take itself particularly seriously, is not a serious study of war (though war forms its background, people die, the pointlessness of war is highlighted, and the enemy's not painted as one-dimensional fiends -- indeed, the movie's real enemies, in some ways, are Allied commanders). I like that the remnants of Kelly's Heroes teamed up with the SS Panzer commander (divisional markings correct for the elite 1st SS Panzer Division 'Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler,' as far as I know) to share the spoils, too, further bolstering the message that it's war itself, rather than people that wear different uniforms, that is the soldier's enemy. My capsule summary, I guess, would be that watching this excellent movie is a very enjoyable way to spend a thoroughly entertaining 2-1\/2 hours.  Woof, woof.  That's my other dog imitation.
