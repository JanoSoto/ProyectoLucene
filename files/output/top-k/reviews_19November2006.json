Indeed the closest thing you can compare it to is Bergman's persona. This film is not only a powerful and impossibly well crafted story, it is a stylistic breakthrough for a cinematic artist who had already taken international cinema by storm. Indeed, here we see emerge the fully mature Scorsese, who couldn't have gone on to make Goodfellas or the Departed without making this film first. While he always had a mastery of subjective photography and slow motion, in Raging Bull his camera is so fluid, so reluctant to stop moving, that you can almost hear Max Olphus weeping for its freedom. One reason Citizen Kane is so amazing is the performance of Wells, who at the age of 25 plays a man who ages from twenty-five years old to an elderly man. Wells as a director used make-up to produce his effect, but Scorsese had a method actor whose commitment to this part led him to stop production for weeks in order for him to put on enough weight to play an aging, fat LaMatta. This effect is rendered in sharp contrast immediately, in the first cut of the film, from 1964 to 1941, where LaMatta is in peak physical condition, as is De Niro, who for these early fight scenes is perfectly chiseled. What Kane did in 1941 was give us a model for the potential of the talkie. What Raging Bull did in 1980 was give filmmakers a new vocabulary for personal film-making. This is not your old school Hollywood drama, like Ordinary People, which beat Raging Bull for the best picture Oscar that year. This is a film that gets into the head of its subject. It manages to present the thoughts, feelings, and actions, of an incredibly complex and insecure character, in a way that lets the audience maintain their own sense of morality and outrage, yet makes the subject more empathetic and consequential. Where most biography films highlight the subjects achievements and gloss over or erase the improprieties and ugly marks, Raging Bull revels in them. Pesci gives a performance that no other actor in history could have gotten right. It's possible to envision this film with someone else playing LaMatta (a young Brando comes to mind), but not Joey. No one could deliver these lines with such conviction and emotional significance. For instance, when Jake asks Joey if he slept with Jake's wife, Joey responds, I'm not gonna answer the question. It's a sick question, you're a sick f***, and I'm not sick enough that I'm going to answer it. What Pesci does with this material is nothing short of remarkable. He is so familiar with his brother's behavior at this point, he is fed up with it, yet he knows he has to select his responses very carefully, or he will only make matters worse. And underneath this is still concern for his brother, to whom he stays loyal despite endless reasons to throw in the towel.This story is presented in an unflinching and entirely naturalistic manner, except for the fight scenes, which abandon any sense of naturalism to produce a surrealistic and completely animal portrayal of combat. The soundtrack is very dense, containing animal noises, lion roars, bird shrieks, screaming audience members, and shattering panes of glass evoked by the bright flash bulbs of the ring side photographers. The camera stays in the ring, like a third fighter, weaving in and out of the fight. Scorsese and his editor Thelma Schoomacher use sophisticated matches on action to produce chaotic movement. One virtuoso shot, perhaps one of the best ever put on film, shows LaMatta breaking away from Sugar Ray Robinson, he backs away from the fight, the shot is consumed by slow motion, a heightening awareness, and then, back to normal speed and the fight resumes.This is a rare film because all the different elements of its production, the writing, acting, photography..etc, fit perfectly together as if they were meant to be as they are. But what puts this film above almost any other ever made, is that it is a beautiful and moving expression of an artistic soul in great turmoil. Scorsese had just endured a complete collapse due to his drug use. This was the first film he made after he recovered, and he has said that at the time he thought it would be the last film he would ever make. So he chose a film that expressed his love and obsession for the cinema as well as one that expressed his great anger, his pride in his heritage, his commentary on the contradictions of the men of the generation before his, and most importantly, where he wanted to go. There is some of this film in every film he's made since, and in some sense he's been remaking the film over and over again. And it ends where it started, with an old, washed up Jake. But at the end, we realize we've never seen him happier. He had achieved, after everything, some strange form of enlightenment. Maybe Scorsese wasn't there when he made the film, but it's where he wanted to end up.

He has wits and guts but the game is bigger than his assumption.The subject of the film is very good but the story line is very trite, banal, old, done a 100 times etc etc. Hope you know what i mean. Engineer falls in love with one girl and a countess fancy him as her next best ticket to court. Movie becomes a yawn because of this 4000000 years old plot and loses its novelty after 20 minutes. Except for a few scenes movie has nothing to offer. Technically even subject is not very original because if you get to see it 'Vanity Fair', 'Shree 420', 'Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman' are based on the same concept but its a period drama and talks directly about cartoons of french courts so its funny. First scene is very powerful. I hope all french people did that on Louis 17th and his maniac wife. Back to film. Film doesn't hold any water. It goes haywire and becomes boring after 20 minutes. I wonder what this hoopla about 2 thumbs up three thumbs? Still!! rent it for the first scene.There are very few international films in which you are distracted by technical mistakes. This is one of those. Editing is very bad. Childish mistakes like a man looking in two directions. Camera work is artsy and very distracting. For example Camera is moving from a man's point of view while he is riding a horse but the swiftness of the camera is of airplane. Its worse than amateurish. I couldn't identify characters even until the end of the film. Prettly lame. All the actors are also just OK. In my opinion its very passable. Rent it watch the first scene and send it back. Don't bother about the rest because you know everything already.By the way why 90% of the poster is Judith Godrèche? I think thats just another inconsistency. Its like putting Karen Alens pic on the raiders of the lost arc poster instead of Ford. 7\/10.

Witnessing the chemistry between Shepherd and Wade, we can't help but speculate that if the real-life Presidency could experience one-millionth of this heady hallucinogen with a woman one-billionth as vivacious and witty as Annette Bening, there would be infinitely less political turmoil in the world.As it is phrased outside Presidential circles Dude, you need to get laid more often.

They are only looking for something simple but their estate agent points them towards a million dollar house going for a snip. It seems the seller is facing extradition and is in a rush, hence the heavily reduced price. They buy it in a hurry but on day one they find minor problems with the structure of the house and the plumbing. These minor problems quickly turn into massive problems and the dream house turns into an endless money pit.Although it is not particularly clever or sharp but this yuppie nightmare comedy is actually quite amusing. It is easy to dismiss it as dumb slapstick but in its defence that is all it really is. The plot has stuff about Anna and Walter's relationship and struggles woven into it but none of this is really convincing and it is clear that the writers themselves are only half interested in it. No, this is all about the regular pratfalls and worsen situation with the house. As such it is pretty good harmless fun. It is quite obvious but director Benjamin and writer Giler keep it slick and brisk and somehow manage to keep it from being silly to the point of being hard to enjoy. Instead the routines are solid and I found myself chuckling here and there even if it wasn't brilliant.It helps that pre-Oscar Hanks is good at such things (or was at least) because he is the one that draws the audience into the slapstick. He is good value and it is just a shame that Long is not as good. Perhaps it is me but I always find her a bit whiney and unnatural. Beyond them there is a role for Godunov who isn't that interesting in the thankless subplot and the only amusement he drew from me was his conducting Beethoven's 9th at the end (which is the running theme of Die Hard).. The rest of the cast has a few good turns from Mantegna, Stapleton, Bosco and others but mainly the film belongs to Hanks and he mugs along like a good 'un.Overall then, not a good film but an amusing one. The plot is weak but the slapstick is good if you can buy into the tone of the whole thing. Not a classic but a distracting comedy that will suit you if you like slapstick.

Joe tries to reach Bly and give him the benefit of his experience off the track as well as his skills on the track. Meanwhile, off the track a tangled web of simmering romances, lost loves, friendships and past conflicts conspire to make the championship about more than the result of twenty races.This film seemed to do almost nothing in the UK cinemas but when it came to TV I caught it. I could vaguely remember a lot of talk about Stallone wanting to make a Formula 1 movie and as a semi-fan of the sport I knew he was often to be found hanging around the pits. This labour of love then, has created a film that is about as generic and obvious as you could want it to be. At the core of the story is a couple of old chestnuts about, well, an old chestnut teaching a rookie the ropes while the rookie undergoes a crisis of confidence. Obviously worried that these clichés wouldn't be enough, the writers load the film with lots of romances, conflicts and so on. Narrative-wise none of them really work since all of them are half-cooked and just designed to fill the time rather than do anything special.The action is what most viewers will be here for and I suppose it is at least noisy and high-octane. Fans of Formula 1 in its pure form will baulk at the overblown races and the absurd car chase and even those who find F1 dull will find themselves snickering at the silliness of the whole thing. With all this happening the cast are stuck in the middle. Stallone is a solid presence but is really just acting for his own sake rather than the film. Pardue is far too bland to care the film and seems to have little or no range to speak of. Schweiger has been told to do a Schumacher and this is all he does. De la Fuente has heard a voice telling him to do a Van Damme so this is what he does while a totally wasted Gershon molls beside him through gritted teeth. Warren is pretty while Reynolds doesn't convince in his scenes and looks like a man who has been pulled and tucked five too many times.Overall then this is movie-by-numbers time. There is nothing specific to watch it for really; the plot is delivered in basic blocks while the action may please some but is generally too overblown and silly to really engage or convince.

Anyway, enough about my aging crisis and more about this film, which is a strange mix of good and bad.

The loss of characters is a good thing but such events are not the same as depth in characters, which sadly is not really evident to the same degree. This makes the story nothing more than a series of events &#150; which is fine for children but left me a bit bored I'm sad to say.The animation is a mix as well. For the majority it is fairly basic and dated however at times there are wonderful moments of imagination and style that stick in the mind. I'm not sure who directed what bit so I can't comment on the direction of the film but for the most part it settles with obvious setup and camera movements. A professional (proper) reviewer said that the voice work was like a radio play and I'm very happy to steal that sentiment and have it echo my own because the voice work is yet again a strange mix.

It is hard to discount the likes of Hurt, Briers, Elliott and others but for all their ability their performances are good despite the film, not with or because of it.

While it's obvious that suspense was his true passion, his taste for comedy produced several atypical films that were grounded entirely in comedy territory. Of course, many of this comedies were done by him in his early days, while his style was still in development, however, the most famous of them, The Trouble With Harry, was done when he was at his peak, right after that long series of successes that were Dial M for Murder, Rear Window and To Catch a Thief.Capt. Albert Wiles (Edmund Gwenn) has a trouble with Harry, a man he just found dead while hunting, as he thinks he accidentally has killed the mysterious stranger. Trying to hide the body in order to avoid being put in jail, Wiles is caught by Miss Ivy Gravely (Mildred Natwick), making his difficulties just a bit bigger. However, his surprise will be enormous as he discovers that he is not the only one in town with a trouble with Harry, as almost everyone thinks that they had something to do with his death. Wiles ask help to his friend, artist Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe), but Sam seems to be more interested in the recently arrived Jennifer Rogers (Shirley MacLaine) than in helping the Capt. with Harry. But soon this will change as Sam discovers that Jennifer too, has a trouble with Harry.Based on a novel by Jack Trevor Story and written by John Michael Hayes (who collaborated with Hitchcock in his previous two films), the story was seen as a departure from the kind of films the Master was doing at the time, but The Trouble With Harry is a movie as Hitchcock as any other of the classics, as it presents together his two favorite themes probably at their purest form Love & Death. Brilliantly written by Hayes, this romantic black comedy of sorts is essentially a character driven tale of how two couples met each other thanks to the death of an unknown man, and the many troubles they have due to the same mysterious Harry. Unlike most of his thrillers, here there is not one main character, but four of them, making the film livelier and fast-packed, although never over the top, as if the energy of love was walking together with the calm of death.Just as the story feels quite atypical for Hitchcock at first sight, the movie too feels oddly different at first, almost as if it were the work of someone else. However, soon one discovers that the Hitchcock feeling is still there, as this charming black comedy seems like and self-parody, where Hitchcock jokes with his own style for suspense and even his own kind of plot devices. With a subtler style of film-making (almost feels as watching a play) and without any suspense gimmicks, Hitchcock lets his actors work and crafts a charming comedy where apparently nothing happens but at the same time, everything does. In short, the film does feel different, but the magic is still the same.Being essentially a character driven movie based mostly on the ensemble cast's actions, The Trouble With Harry owes a lot of its effectiveness to the very selective cast that Hitchcock formed for the film. Leading the cast are Edmund Gwenn and John Forsythe, and both deliver an amazing performance, so believable that it feels as if the two men were really two good old friends. Their counterparts, Mildred Natwick and Shirley MacLaine, give also an equally good job, specially Natwick, who steals every scene she appears, proving her enormous talent on screen and showing her experience. While it was MacLaine's first movie, she comes up very natural and without problem gets the job done despite being a newbie among a cast of reputed and respected actors.As its poor box-office success proved, the main problem of The Trouble With Harry is the fact that it's so atypical that one expecting a typical suspense Hitchcock film will definitely end up quite disappointed. However, this mostly a problem of the way one approaches to the film, than a problem of the movie itself, as The Toruble With Harry, along with Vertigo, is probably one of the most personal films the Master did, as the mix of a macabre tale with a huge dose of Black Comedy was what Hitchcock liked more than anything (this mix would become the basis for his TV series). The Trouble With Harry may not be a masterpiece in the way that other Hitchcock films are, this is not a life changing movie or an influential work, it's more a personal venture where Hitchcock decided he just wanted to have fun making something he loved. This charming little comedy may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those with a taste for the macabre, will certainly end up with a smile on the face. Just like the Master wanted. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Director Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, dedicated almost his entire career to entertaining audiences with his masterful use of suspense in his many famous thrillers, horrors and mystery films; however, comedy was not strange to him, as his black humor was always present in most of his films, often used to break the tension and give some relief to the thrilled audience.

Unlike most of his thrillers, here there is not one main character, but four of them, making the film livelier and fast-packed, although never over the top, as if the energy of love was walking together with the calm of death.Just as the story feels quite atypical for Hitchcock at first sight, the movie too feels oddly different at first, almost as if it were the work of someone else. However, soon one discovers that the Hitchcock feeling is still there, as this charming black comedy seems like and self-parody, where Hitchcock jokes with his own style for suspense and even his own kind of plot devices. With a subtler style of film-making (almost feels as watching a play) and without any suspense gimmicks, Hitchcock lets his actors work and crafts a charming comedy where apparently nothing happens but at the same time, everything does. In short, the film does feel different, but the magic is still the same.Being essentially a character driven movie based mostly on the ensemble cast's actions, The Trouble With Harry owes a lot of its effectiveness to the very selective cast that Hitchcock formed for the film. Leading the cast are Edmund Gwenn and John Forsythe, and both deliver an amazing performance, so believable that it feels as if the two men were really two good old friends. Their counterparts, Mildred Natwick and Shirley MacLaine, give also an equally good job, specially Natwick, who steals every scene she appears, proving her enormous talent on screen and showing her experience. While it was MacLaine's first movie, she comes up very natural and without problem gets the job done despite being a newbie among a cast of reputed and respected actors.As its poor box-office success proved, the main problem of The Trouble With Harry is the fact that it's so atypical that one expecting a typical suspense Hitchcock film will definitely end up quite disappointed. However, this mostly a problem of the way one approaches to the film, than a problem of the movie itself, as The Toruble With Harry, along with Vertigo, is probably one of the most personal films the Master did, as the mix of a macabre tale with a huge dose of Black Comedy was what Hitchcock liked more than anything (this mix would become the basis for his TV series). The Trouble With Harry may not be a masterpiece in the way that other Hitchcock films are, this is not a life changing movie or an influential work, it's more a personal venture where Hitchcock decided he just wanted to have fun making something he loved. This charming little comedy may not be everyone's cup of tea, but those with a taste for the macabre, will certainly end up with a smile on the face. Just like the Master wanted. 8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Mystery"},{"date":"19 November 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Director Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, dedicated almost his entire career to entertaining audiences with his masterful use of suspense in his many famous thrillers, horrors and mystery films; however, comedy was not strange to him, as his black humor was always present in most of his films, often used to break the tension and give some relief to the thrilled audience. While it's obvious that suspense was his true passion, his taste for comedy produced several atypical films that were grounded entirely in comedy territory. Of course, many of this comedies were done by him in his early days, while his style was still in development, however, the most famous of them, The Trouble With Harry, was done when he was at his peak, right after that long series of successes that were Dial M for Murder, Rear Window and To Catch a Thief.Capt. Albert Wiles (Edmund Gwenn) has a trouble with Harry, a man he just found dead while hunting, as he thinks he accidentally has killed the mysterious stranger. Trying to hide the body in order to avoid being put in jail, Wiles is caught by Miss Ivy Gravely (Mildred Natwick), making his difficulties just a bit bigger. However, his surprise will be enormous as he discovers that he is not the only one in town with a trouble with Harry, as almost everyone thinks that they had something to do with his death. Wiles ask help to his friend, artist Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe), but Sam seems to be more interested in the recently arrived Jennifer Rogers (Shirley MacLaine) than in helping the Capt. with Harry. But soon this will change as Sam discovers that Jennifer too, has a trouble with Harry.Based on a novel by Jack Trevor Story and written by John Michael Hayes (who collaborated with Hitchcock in his previous two films), the story was seen as a departure from the kind of films the Master was doing at the time, but The Trouble With Harry is a movie as Hitchcock as any other of the classics, as it presents together his two favorite themes probably at their purest form Love & Death.

Well even though Lord Of The Rings is certainly Peter Jackson's finest achievement, let's not forget his early gore fest Braindead. If you're a fan of Peter Jackson's latter works and want to check out his previous works I think it would be good of me to warm you in advance that Braindead is not everybody's type of film. But if you're a horror fan or a fan of experimental and daring cinema then I urge to watch Braindead.A film such of Braindead is one that has no message, moral and no meaning. And yet even with all that it still remains a breakthrough horror film that really does have style. Some of the most unique scenes in history are filled with hysterical one-liners that become instantly quotable. The script is so downright ridiculous that it's hard to take the film seriously and that's what the film wanted to be. The shock factor is incredible and the focus on all the fine details shows how much time and effort has been put into the film.The start of the film is an obvious reference to one of Peter Jackson's favourite films and that is King Kong (which he would later remake). Right from the opening the gore starts flooding in, at first it comes in small doses and as the film progresses you'll find it piling on. The gore is extremely comic and fake, but that's what makes it so frenzied. The use of slapstick style humour in the fights and the unconventional retro style the film is filmed in. This all helps to make it become an original and offbeat experience.Some of the direction is exceptional, my favourite bit of direction would have to be at the start of the film where you see Lionel's mother holding the knife, purposely flashing it in front of the camera with a odd grimace on her face. Another one would be where you see the Lionel mowing the lawn and there's a shot of the lawn mower blade rotating round. These items will all become main parts of the film as you get further and further to the extreme final 20 minutes.If I was to say what kind of film Braindead is I'd find it very difficult because it's hard to categorise it, but I anything it's a cross between Psycho and Night Of The Living Dead. The countless references to Psycho are blatantly obvious for anybody who knows something about film. The film's use of orchestral music is tremendous and works seamlessly with the zombie killing scenes. Lionel is such a peculiar character and that's what makes him so perfect for the film's goof ball story.A highly unique and hilarious film, but definitely not recommended for the faint hearted.

I don't know what changes were made to Andrew Kevin Walker's script, but if Machete's lines are the same, Walker is brilliant. (Spoilers here!!!) The fact that he does what he does because he likes it made the entire movie worthwhile. I hate when the killer in a film became the person he\/she is because of some past trauma or psychological condition. It can work, but it has been so over done. Here we are presented with a man who kills for the sheer thrill of it. He knows he can get away with it, he knows he is protected, and most of all, he gets paid to do it. He looks nothing like we expect, he lives in a normal, suburban neighborhood (the only cliché was the fact that it was next to a graveyard), and he lives with his mother\/grandmother.That said, the film itself is also very well done. Schumacher almost redeems himself from destroying the Batman franchise in the 90's. The characters are well-rounded, though I would have liked to see a little more of Catherine Keener's character, but she did well with the small part she had. Nicholas cage does an excellent job as the private investigator who gets in too deep, and Joaquin Phoenix was perfect as Max California (I'd hate to see you in a situation where you needed a battery operated vagina and didn't have one).

He's depraved, he's sick, he's a pervert of unimaginable proportions, and he's an artist. He shows no concern for the lives of others and is obviously interested only in making twisted films for good money.All in all, I gave this film an 8 out of 10. Some may consider that a bit high, but I think when you put all the elements of this film together, it adds up pretty well. Yes it is shocking, yes it is dark (in fact, it's one of the darkest films I've seen in a while), but it's a well written, well directed and well acted work. Definitely worth seeing at least once.

And as far as influence is concerned, this movie is the winner. I lost count after 1977, but up to that time there were at least sixty movie spin-offs. How many did GWTW generate? A handful at most. Just about all these movie spin-offs of Frankenstein are direct descendants of the 1823 stage dramatization (in Two Acts) by Richard Brinsley Peake. I looked up Peake's name on IMDb. He has not one single movie credit. Mary Shelley, on the other hand, has over fifty.Peake's adapted his stage play, Presumption or The Fate of Frankenstein, from Mrs Shelley without her knowledge (let alone her collaboration), but ultimately with her full blessing and approval. In fact, she even wrote in her diary Lo and behold, I found myself famous. I was much impressed. The play seemed to excite a breathless eagerness in the audience. Peake's play received unanimous praise. After a most successful season at London's Covent Garden, the whole company travelled to New York for a Broadway presentation in 1825. This also proved a triumph, with both critics and general theatregoers heaping particular praise on Thomas Potter Cooke who virtually stole the show with his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal of the silent monster, which Cooke played 400 times before the play finally closed. And for the next fifty years, Cooke coasted on his fame in numerous similar vehicles. Peake's play itself enjoyed countless revivals with some of the most famous actors of the day like Henry Irving playing the monster. Three of the differences between Shelley and Peake are really major 1. In the novel, the monster not only speaks fluently, but has a most impressive vocabulary and eventually becomes quite verbose. In the play, Peake introduces a silent monster who can do no more than grunt. (Wow! So Thomas Potter Cooke, a well-known villain on the London stage in 1823, accepted a role that had no dialogue, yet played that role with such expertise, such understanding and such sympathy, he achieved instant fame)! 2. Peake gives Frankenstein a loyal, eager but not over-bright assistant named Fritz. In the novel, Frankenstein has no assistant at all. 3. The play, like this movie, features a detailed creation sequence; whereas the novel pays extremely scant attention to the actual creation of the monster. Indeed the whole episode is dismissed in a single vague paragraph! Now here's an interesting point. A friend sent me a photocopy of the theatre program for the 1927 adaptation by Peggy Webling at the Preston Theatre. This program acknowledges that Miss Webling's adaptation was based on both Shelley's 1818 novel and Peake's 1823 stage presentation! Yet, when Universal purchased the Webling play for the movies, somehow the ascription to Richard Brinsley Peake disappeared and has remained so to this very day. Finally, we come to the movie. First off, let me say it holds up remarkably well, particularly in Universal's fine DVD version which renders both Arthur Edeson's wondrous visuals and the movie's superlative sound effects in a manner that really duplicates the stunning impact of the movie's first season way back in 1931. Karloff, of course, is magnificent. His twisted, cruel, vicious portrait of a Monster who is still sympathetic despite it all, can never be dimmed by changes in acting styles or current fashions. (As is well-known, the part was first offered to Bela Lugosi who, having no knowledge of British theatre history, rejected it as soon as he discovered the role carried no dialogue&#151;a mistake that ruined his entire career and sent him quickly to Poverty Row. Karloff, on the other hand, knew of Peake's play, and more importantly he realized the Monster was actually the role of a lifetime. He not only seized it with both hands but, under Whale's gifted tutelage, brought it off superbly).Not to be outdone by the Monster, Whale cleverly cast his friend, Colin Clive, as Frankenstein. I know there are critics who regard Clive's performance as over the top, but I thought he was perfect. Clive rightly plays Frankenstein as a larger-than-life figure who refuses to allow his creation to dominate the action. After all, he is the Creator!Admittedly, John Boles makes a rather staid best friend (but after all, it's perfectly in character) and Mae Clarke could have made her heroine a bit more colorful, but the other support players led by Frederick Kerr (who renders some delightful comic relief in his role as the crotchety baron), Dwight Frye (as the hunchbacked little assistant), Marilyn Harris (as Maria, the charming little girl of the lake), Lionel Belmore (the self-important burgomaster) and of course curtain-raiser\/doctor Edward Van Sloan are wholly endearing.Fortunately for the movie's present popularity, Whale's directorial technique with its meticulous attention to set dressing and special effects, plus its lavish use of dialogue close-ups interspersed with imaginatively shot and staged action material is now right back in fashion. Arthur Edeson's moodily atmospheric cinematography also enhances tension and terror, as do the heightened sound effects of this early (but definitely not dated) talkie. (One of these days, someone is going to write a book about Arthur Edeson. After all, he photographed four of the most popular movies of all time.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"19 November 2006","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" During an Australian Indian summer, a group of students and some staff from Appleyard College go for a daytrip up to Hanging Rock. Four of the girls go off from the group to explore higher up the rock but only one returns, screaming. With one of the teaching staff also missing, the rest of the group returns to the school where the police are immediately involved in an investigation. However it quickly becomes evident that no trace of the girls can be found anywhere on or around Hanging Rock.I had never seen this film despite having heard various good things about it. Without knowing anything about the actual subject of the film I sat to watch it and found it to be a very strange affair that is all about the atmosphere within the mystery rather than the mystery itself. Those looking for an engaging narrative will find it, but those looking for a satisfactory conclusion to the mystery should probably just avoid it because this doesn't seem to be what Weir was that interested in. This is a bit of a criticism and I can understand why many viewers will be narked by the lack of answers. However it does not read from this that the film is no good because answers are only part of the narrative whereas delivery is the all in this case. And the delivery is excellent. Weir has managed to produce a tangible feel of Victorian Australia with all its puritan sensibilities and overlay it with a wonderful sense of sci-fi brooding.Of course some will dismiss this style without substance but the atmosphere here is a big part of the substance and it keeps a lot of the film going. At times it does drag but this is literally once or twice at most. The first half of the film is by far the strongest as it totally gets by on this brooding sense of something but doesn't have to explain anything. The second half of the film is interesting but has to try and do more, not all of which is that strong. The cast didn't have anyone who stood out for me which is understandable since the film is more about feel than acting or characters, however everyone seemed to get the atmosphere and the Victorian setting well into who they were trying to be.Overall then an impressive piece of brooding sci-fi\/horror set in a Victorian world and featuring nothing more sinister than rocks. The lack of answers and explanation will be a problem for some (many?) viewers but the atmosphere is spot on and it easily gets by on this as Weir injects a wonderful sense of foreboding that spooked and engaged me despite me not really knowing why.

The things that immediately appealed to me were the excellent black-and-white cinematography (by RKO's Harry J. Wild) and the imaginative editing techniques (by Joseph Noriega). This is a film-noir that depends more on atmosphere than on plot. It's very well-directed by Edward Dmytryk and it includes an impressive hallucination\/dream sequence that rivals Gregory Peck's dream sequence in SPELLBOUND (1945).To me, the plot seemed relatively simple in places&#151;there were few characters and, despite the puzzling and complex twists and turns throughout the plot, everything made sense at the film's conclusion. Compare this to THE BIG SLEEP, where the average viewer soon gets completely lost in the film's highly improbable plot and never recovers. THE MALTESE FALCON had so much exposition in its conversations that the mystery was still confusing. Here Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) is asked to buy back a jade necklace from a wealthy womanizing client. There's a subplot where Marlowe is also asked to find a hulking client's former girlfriend. These two entirely different situations lead Marlowe to a baffling case that involves phony doctors, being exposed to hallucinogenic drugs, and a young femme fatale (Claire Trevor) who has recently married an old aristocrat (Miles Mander). I think Marlowe's narrating voice-over helped simplify the plot a lot, as well as turning on the closed captioning in order to catch every single word.Personally, I prefer Dick Powell to Humphrey Bogart any day. There's something more natural and convincing in his performance as Philip Marlowe, while Bogart's Marlowe always seemed cold and distant to me in THE BIG SLEEP. Powell proves here that he could play an all-out gritty tough guy and still play a romantic tenor of sappy love songs in movie musicals of the period.My only complaint is this they could've used a more alluring, memorable femme fatale than Claire Trevor&#151;maybe Jane Greer, Hedy Lamarr, or Dorothy Malone could've pulled it off better. Other than that, the film is very entertaining despite a few occasional lulls here and there. Thankfully, the atmosphere really helped make the film fascinating to watch. Watch this at night with the lights off and you'll have the perfect atmosphere for a classic film-noir mystery, originally written by Raymond Chandler and containing an impressive cast and technical achievements.
