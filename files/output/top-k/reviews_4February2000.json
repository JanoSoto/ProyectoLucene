Also, it had a great premise Shakespeare, at the beginning of his career, looking for that first big hit to really establish his name, is at work on his new play Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter. He falls deeply in love\/lust with Viola de Lesseps, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and is motivated to write Romeo and Juliet. As actually executed though, the film is. . . well, ok, but not nearly as good as it could have been and just waaaaaay overrated. First of all, Shakespeare as portrayed here is just a simp, all pointless motion and hot-blooded excitement - seemingly interested in scoring women and very little else. There's no suggestion of the eloquence, the wit, or the sheer patience and craft that he would need if he was going to become what he did. In the role, Joseph Fiennes is a complete blank. This seriously undermines the film from the start we don't have to see the guy being a genius (after all, this IS supposed to be early in his career) but if we don't at least get a glimpse of the potential, we can't really buy it as Shakespeare - and the whole movie simply devolves into Hollywood actors running around with funny costumes on.  (In only about five minutes of screen time, Rupert Everett, as Christopher Marlowe, completely blows Fiennes away in terms of poise, presence and sense of humor - I think he probably would have made a much better Shakespeare.) All the other performances are fairly strong, causing Fiennes to further stick out like a sore thumb. Nowhere is this as true as with Gwyneth Paltrow. Since the Oscars, there's been a big backlash against her and her performance here (especially at this site) but COME ON, people! - this movie is unthinkable without her! I speak as someone who'd never been all that impressed with her (she was pretty enough, I thought, but as an actress a little bland) but after I saw her in this I became a believer. She has such a grace here, a presence that we don't normally associate with actresses anymore - you'd have to go back to the days of Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman to find a proper parallel. Absolutely enchanting - which is essential, because we must buy her as the muse to no less an artist than Shakespeare. I guess what I have to ask is, for all those people who didn't like Paltrow and yet liked the movie - well, what exactly did you LIKE about it?The script, I'm sure they'll say. But if your two lead characters sink like a stone then exactly how good could you consider the script to be? In any case, I think there's been too much said about this damn script - as if the real story wasn't meant to be about Will and Violet (which doesn't play convincingly), but about all those sly little jokes that the writers sneak into the margins of the screen. They're not even that funny. The more Shakespeare you know, of course, the more of them you'll likely get, but that still doesn't mean you'll laugh; I got several of them, and the most that ever happened was, I said Oh yeah, I get that - I understand what they're referencing. It makes you feel intelligent, maybe, but it doesn't give you any enjoyment. The film tries to be too smart when at its heart it's just a dumb love story. Perhaps Stoppard was actually the wrong guy for this project - he's too intelligent (anyone who doesn't agree, just check out any of his wonderful plays - like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Travesties, Arcadia, The Real Inspector Hound or any of over two dozen others). The guys behind Airplane or The Naked Gun would have been a much better choice. If they'd written it, this film might actually have been FUNNY. Dumb, certainly, but funny. As it is, this film walks a tightrope between silliness and profundity, never firmly registering in either, so never being really satisfying on any level. It has its moments, and the radiant Gwyneth of course (as well as Judi Dench as a wonderful Queen Elizabeth; she absolutely stops the film whenever she appears which, alas, is not nearly enough) but it's more of a disappointment than a treat.

As far as I can tell from everything I've read, the powers that be at Mirimax demanded that the film be set in Hollywood, which was not what Williamson originally intended.  (He planned for it to start in Hollywood and then move back to Woodsboro -- hence STAB 3 RETURN TO WOODSBORO.)

When I don't love it, it's among the most disheartening of experiences a moviegoer can have. Such was my experience with Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy, a film that springboards from a wonderful premise, but, in the end, just falls short for me.W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan composed some of the most beloved comic operas of all time, from The Pirates of Penzance to H.M.S. Pinafore, but as this film opens, Sullivan (played with nice dry good nature by Allan Corduner) is at his wit's end.  He's tired of writing trivial souffles, and he wishes to compose serious music.  Gilbert (Jim Broadbent, who seems to be going for the gold medal in stuffiness) is made even more gruff than usual by Sullivan's decision to end the partnership, but a visit to a Japanese art exhibit sparks his flagging creativity, and he comes up with the scenario for The Mikado, a Japanese-themed work that once again excites Sullivan about the partnership.Or at least I think it excites Sullivan.  Sadly, we never really get to see Sullivan's reaction to the concept, or indeed much of the spirit that really goes into putting on a play like this.  There is plenty of time (practically the film's whole middle third) devoted to the nuts and bolts of constructing a show, and it's all done with great verisimilitude and is often quite compelling.  However, there was one crucial thing missing from this whole enterprise  passion.  I never got the sense of men and women in love with the theatre.  I have done plays myself, and I know what grueling, brutal work it can be.  But there's always that passion and respect for the work that keeps one going through the rough patches.  I never felt that during Topsy-Turvy.  Here, I got the sense that most of the actors and actresses were doing this for a living because it was slightly preferable to being fishmongers or prostitutes.Of course, working with W.S. Gilbert probably didn't help their spirits any. If this film is to be believed, Gilbert was a hard-shelled, obtuse, all-but-inflexible and wholly unapproachable character who snaps at everyone at the slightest provocation, takes every compliment with a whole barrel of salt, and even prefers wandering the disease-ridden back alleys of London to attending the premieres of his own works.  Because of this, we can get no real sense of the collaboration that existed between Gilbert and Sullivan; indeed, in their scenes together, Sullivan often seems afraid that Gilbert is going to jump down his throat and pummel him to pieces.  I don't know whether I want to blame this on Broadbent or on Leigh, but someone needed to at least try to make Gilbert someone we would want to watch for three hours.Mike Leigh is a filmmaker I've always admired more in theory than in practice.  His method of creating a script through improvisation with his actors is an interesting and well-intentioned one, but the films that result don't often grab me like the critics tell me they should.  Call me uncultured or base, but I guess I just like my films to feel more like films.  Topsy-Turvy, which would wisely have been handled with a little Gilbert-and-Sullivan color, suffers from this method, with many subplots about the actors in the production and Gilbert's relationship with his wife tossed in like afterthoughts and then undeveloped.  Many of the most important events of the story occur offscreen, and the whole thing is tied up with a musical number that explains nothing.Still, even with all of these problems, there is a lot to recommend here. The physical production itself is always sumptuous and inviting, especially a surprise considering the contemporary realism that has marked Leigh's other works.  Aside from Broadbent (the jury is still out on my opinion of his performance, and will likely stay there), there is great work from Corduner, Kevin McKidd as a vain star of the play, and the fetching Shirley Henderson as a widowed singer doing her best.  The real star here is Carl Davis, the composer who adapted Gilbert and Sullivan's work for the film. Indeed, the musical numbers are really a highlight of the film (I've loved Three Little Maids From School ever since they sang it on The Simpsons), and if all of these actors are doing their own singing, bravo to them. And even though the final song, The Sun Whose Rays, brings the film to an inconclusive end, it's a beautiful tune nonetheless, and Henderson performs it quite touchingly.Anyone who regularly reads my reviews on this site knows that I am always the hardest on the films I have the highest expectations for, even if I liked them.  And I liked Topsy-Turvy.  I honestly did.  But I was ready to love it.  And therein lies the problem.

I enjoyed ENEMY OF THE STATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY and even MEN IN BLACK. So I watched WILD WILD WEST for tradition's sake, I guess you can say. It was 1999's July 4 Will Smith hit. I am positive that this is the worst I have ever seen Will Smith in. I tried to enjoy this movie, and at parts I did, but most of it was lame and not very enjoyable, I'm sorry to say.Dr. Arliss Loveless, (Kenneth Branagh) a confederate rich bad guy is trying to sell parts of the USA to the highest bidding countries, using his giant machines of destruction (walking mechanicals spiders and stuff) to take hostage of President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline). The two best agents the U.S. Government has, James West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (also Kevin Kline) are sent to stop Loveless and save the president, as well as the country. West also has a personal score to settle with Loveless, since he was responsible for the death of his parents. The beautiful Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) tags along to try and save her father, who is also being held hostage by Loveless. She attracts the eye of Gordan and West.The acting jobs in this are fair, but the writing spoils it. The gorgeous Salma Hayek is underplayed, and her character is pretty much pointless except to have a good-looking girl in the movie. Both Will Smith and Kevin Kline do fairly good jobs acting, but the characters are too boring to enjoy. I'm not sure if Kenneth Branagh or the writing is responsible for the incredible stupid and annoying Dr. Loveless.This movie is very similar to Men in Black, only less modern and on a smaller scale. (save the country, not the planet) Another big difference between the two was that Men in Black was more fun, cooler, and had better characters, villains and gadgets (not to mention Tommy Lee Jones). If you are in the movie for a Will Smith movie, go rent ENEMY OF THE STATE. If you're in the movie for a lighter Will Smith movie, go rent MEN IN BLACK.

This is his new movie. But - a killer with healing abilities ? Sounds really idiotic, doesn't it ? On the other hand, reading the list of fabulous actors which are in it might change one's opinion before watching it, and the movie itself has some really seldom qualities which makes it very, very enjoyable.The acting here is simply marvelous. It is emotionally correct. It clearly demonstrates Mr. Hanks' (and many others!) abilities to transport emotions onto the screen. It was very nice to notice these little details - how he talked without words with his friend, how he acted in the different situations. In fact, he doesn't express feelings very often, but he really knows how to make you feel what his character feels. On the other hand, the script is often also very funny, often the people in the cinema laughed long and loud.Well there is not only light. The healing scenes are simply bad, just like the basic script idea. The reasons why the healer got sentenced to death were unrealistic.

I mean, how much further could they go with the one of the most original concepts ever conceived?  To be honest, I was sketchy up until the opening day about this movie, and I'm a huge fan of the Scream Trilogy.  But after seeing just the opening sequence, my worries were put to rest.Scream 3 was very much worthy of bearing the Scream name.  It was as smart as its two predecessors, and sometimes even better.I'm going to skip the pretentious summary and just get on with it.  First of all, it had great scares.  This movie just set up everyone....setting the audience up with false scares, real ones, and the you-think-nothing's-gonna-happen-but-then-it-does-happen scares.  And like the trailers and promos say, the third one breaks the rules, which Scream 3 does with the wide variety of tactics that are used for the elaborate death scenes. It just didn't rely on the stabbing, it used different methods of killing, one of which was completely unexpected.  A great build up of suspense, which was done better in this one than the previous two.  This film only let the audience rest for two minutes before it had us back on the edge of our seats again.  Then, there were the cute cameos, which was a real treat for me because I love little walk on cameos; especially one little cameo that was a bit heart-wrenching for me.The two greatest things I found in this film is how it ties up the two earlier films together.  It makes great and appropriate references from Scream 1 & 2 at the best times and it was very well done.  The next thing was how it harks back to Scream 1 were everybody was a suspect.  Unlike Scream 2 that only had a few red herrings, Scream 3 like Scream 1 pointed the finger at everybody.  It accused everybody in the film.....everyone had a motive to do all the killings....at some points you might even suspect any one of the three survivors of this trilogy.But, because there is no such thing as a perfect movie (well, except Citizen Kane), this movie did have some parts that didn't blend with me.  As someone already pointed out, this movie does take itself too seriously, which is not really what Scream was intended to be.  The Scream movies was almost more like a satirical horror.  Scream pointed out all the cliches of the horror genre and avoided to do those same cliches half of the time, and do them the other half.  Scream 3 was a pure horror movie with some moments of satire.  It was meant to scare you, not make fun of what it is.  I felt that the satirical edge was a missing element of Scream 3.  Then, I felt the ending was a bit cheesy.  I mean, in many ways original, but still a bit cheesy. Although not written by Kevin Williamson, the man behind the idea, it was very much a Scream movie at its core.  Other than the two problems I saw and had, I really like this movie; almost loving it.  Scream 3 is sure to entertain...and scare.

I purposely I had found out next to nothing about it and had expectations neither high nor low. I loved the Star Wars movies as a kid, but they hadn't become a religion to me and it had been years since I had seen them. But I had good memories, you know, and at the beginning of Phantom Menace when the John Williams music started blasting and the Star Wars logo first flashed on screen, I got goosebumps because, amazingly, I was eight years old all over again. It was an awesome experience.Sadly, it was the highlight of watching The Phantom Menace - everything was down hill from there. The movie's not outrageously bad (except for a few key places), just dull. Even the action scenes don't have much kick to them because nothing seems at stake, we don't care about the characters enough for it to matter who wins. Of course, it's the good guys who do win, but unlike the first series, this outcome never seems seriously in doubt. There's no villain here with the strength or authority of Darth Vader to pose a real threat - even Darth Maul, who looks awesome, has a totally cool way with a light saber. . . but someone forgot to write him a part. His lack of authority and screen time was one of the film's biggest disappointments.At the other extreme, too much screen time for Jar Jar Binks. Now, people have been bad-mouthing this character ever since the film came out so I don't feel I need to add too much here - except to wonder, when did comic relief become for George Lucas a prime reason for creating a character? One of the great things about the first trilogy was that, amusing as several of the characters were, there was never one that was thrown in JUST for the purposes of laughs - they all had a function and were all competent within their chosen spheres of activity. Even the dreaded Ewoks from Jedi were preferable to Jar Jar since, as sickeningly cute as they were, they were also fierce fighters and were essential to the rebellion's ability to fight off the Imperial troops. But Jar Jar serves no useful purpose, is actually *inept*, and only remains alive through the whim of the filmmakers. Hopefully, this whim will run its course shortly into the second episode (though I wouldn't count on it).Now, about that pod race. This thing has been getting almost as much positive ink as Jar Jar has negative; even people who pan the movie just love that pod race. I hated it. Several reasons here 1)It had no real reason for being, except to serve as a show-off special effects moment. That is, it's connection to the rest of the plot was skimpy at best (SPOILER what, Lucas wants us to believe that the *only* way two jedis could figure out how to get off Tatooine was betting on the winning of a 9-year old boy? Come on. Even Ben Kenobi didn't ask that much of Luke Skywalker when first taking him under his wing) 2)It was built up too much within the movie itself. One of the great things about the action sequences of the first trilogy is how casually set up they were; before you knew what hit you, the characters were off and running - either pursuing, being pursued by someone, light saber duelling, etc. With the pod race, there's all this talk about it and set up for it first, so that by the time it arrives it's actually anti-climactic. 3)The very notion of a central event like the pod race contradicts what we feel we know about Tatooine - which is that it is a planet of isolated groups and interests, with no central authority (no, not even Jabba) who would be able to set up an event such as this on such a wide scale. Oh well, guess we were wrong.The special effects were impressive, I guess, but they cause the look of the film to veer too closely, I think, to computer animation - to the point where I began to wonder, Hey, why didn't Lucas just hold on to Pixar and make computer animated movies like a Bug's Life and Toy Story. Those films actually have more heart and, yes, humanity in them than this one does - and they don't have to worry about using actors, which from the looks of this movie, Lucas dosn't really know what to do with anyway (all negative comments about Jake Lloyd are completely justified, while Natalie Portman, Ewan MacGregor and Liam Neeson just don't get a chance to do very much).One final note Lucas had defended this movie by saying it was meant primarily for 11-year olds, and not grownups. Hmm. Considering that this whole story arc must necessarily end in tragedy (the central character turns to evil), defeat (of the Republic) and even cruel disfigurement. . . I have to wonder, is that the best target audience? And is that the best way to approach and write such a story? Time will tell, of course, but I don't hold out much hope for the next two films based on this one.

What you see at the beginning sequence sets up the rest of the movie. It's the backbone of the plot. You have to take this film in whole. There are flashbacks. There are video playbacks within the film. They are subtle link backs - rather like navigating on the Web, and this Web is one of Ed Harris' character, who is struggling within himself - his mind, heart and soul, wrestling out of his own doubting web of gray matter.

Before The Third Miracle, I didn't realize there's a whole Roman Catholic Church vocabulary unto its own, e.g., postulator, beatify, canonize, saint - these words were described in the dictionary within the breadth of  Roman Catholic Church.

Whatever and however your feelings are about the subject of this film, it ultimately celebrates life. Miraculously for 1999, DOGMA is an imaginative, creative piece on the Roman Catholic Church. Writer-director Kevin Smith (1994 Clerks, 1996 Chasing Amy) delivered an ensemble cast with Linda Fiorentino (John Dahl's 1994 The Last Seduction) as the virginal divine connection in the center of it all; Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as the pair of angels in distress; Chris Tucker as the thirteenth apostle; and other colorful characters on this blessed adventure of a satirical religious journey. It's fun. You can tell the actors all have an enjoyable time delivering this fantasy piece!Along the lines of miracles and controversies, 1995 GOSPA (means Our Lady in Croatian) is a film about a reportedly true event in Medjugorje, where six children believed they saw the Virgin Mary in 1981, and millions of pilgrims have visited the site since then. It follows the struggle of the parish priest (Martin Sheen) who defended the six children; it becomes more of a political drama with evolving prison and courtroom scenes. Not your usual box office fare.Also remotely reminded me of the Schwarzenegger's 1999 End of days, where explosive devilish special effects treatment were used in the course of the redemption of a young woman (Robin Tunney), while The Third Miracle provides a more thought provoking film in following the course of a young girl's (Maria) salvation, and even a glimpse into what a Vatican tribunal might have been like.

A good Bond girl is, well... not Christmas Jones.  I don't know if it was the character of Christmas or the acting of Denise which sucked.  I doubt it's only her dialogue that blows.  Third, the dialogue\/witty puns\/stupid, stupid jokes.  There were too many to get into... I thought the innuendos in Bond movies were supposed to be intelligent, obscure... not blatantly obvious and focused on like a US spy satelite focuses on Mararet Thatcher naked on a cold day.  They were too obvious, is what I am trying to say... just look at the memorable quotes for this movie and you'll get a sense of what I am talking about...  FOURTH... A WASTE OF ANOTHER FABULOUS VILLAIN AND ACTOR... Robert Carlyle plays Renard, and as the trailer gets us all excited about... he's got a bullet lodged in the part of the brain which, as we learned from The Waterboy, is responsible for our aggressive behavior, and at the same time, Renard can't feel anything.  Now, after watching the trailer, one would expect to see an incredible fight between Bond and Renard, with Bond repeatedly like, stabbing, shooting, punching, crotch-kicking, something... but, we get nothing.  Renard gets some glass stuck in his hand and doesn't realize it...wow.  NEAT.  I could drink a bunch of vodka and do the same damn thing.  This aspect was one of the most disappointing, almost embarrasing... I have never been so upset.     Now, the only saving grace in the movie, beside John Cleese and the farewell to Q, is Sophie Marceau... she's attractive... Yay.  There's at least fifty or so attractive women in the world.  AT LEAST.  Why her?  Oh, she's French.  At least she's not Canadian. Don't see this one.  Rent Goldeneye, or, my personal favorite, Octopussy.

I don't mean entertaining, I don't mean shock, I don't mean thrilling, I mean BEST. I have seen many classic thrillers, but none of them are as beautifully crafted as the Usual Suspects. Without a doubt the best movie of the 90's. The movie starts with a bang--in this first scene, which takes place last night, on a gasoline soaked, dead body-ridden boat which looks like it could go up in flames at any minute. Keaton is lying on the ground smoking a cigarette. A mysterious stranger approaches himKeyzer How ya doing, Keaton? Keaton I can't feel my legs....Keyzer Keyzer You ready? Keaton What time is it? Keyzer It's 1230You hear 2 shots, and the match is lit that sets the boat ablaze. As the mysterious stranger gets off the boat, it blows up. And so the tale begins. A tale of five known criminals; Hockney, McManus, Fenster, Keaton, and Kint, who get set up by the police and end up plotting a scheme together. A tale of a cop, agent Kujan, who is Keaton's arch nemesis, and wants to make sure Keaton is dead. A tale of a petty thug cripple, Kint, who gets pulled in over his head and tells the entire story of what happened after the setup to Kujan. And finally, a tale of the mysterious drug lord Keyzer Soze who no one really knows about, but who seems to be pulling strings for the 5 criminals, for a purpose no one quite knows why.The problem with the public opinion of this movie is that people focus too, too much on the ending, it's faults, it's qualities, etc. The ending, which I will not spoil for you, is great, and puts the finishing touches on one hell of a thriller. But the ending is not what makes the movie great, aside from the way it is handled. What makes the movie great are 1. The performances by Pollack, Palmentieri, Postlethwaite, Baldwin, Del Toro, Byrne, and above all Spacey 2. The incredible twists and turns through the plot 3. The scenes masterfully crafted by rookie director Bryan Singer (which shows us some of the best movie direction since the Kubrick era, especially with the line-up scene)  4. The incredible score, which makes the intensity of the movie rise with every scene. 5. The way the last scene is handled--which is probably one of the 5 best scenes in movie historyThis movie is the best of the 90's--and probably one of the 10 best ever. See it.

This scarily accurate portrayal of the various people who all appear sane on the outside, but inside are all as dysfunctional as each other and joined by the fact that everything about them is a lie, is moving and a powerful tribute to the fact that it is possible to make classic movies in an era where it is one good film per thousand. The cinematography is good, especially with the interaction between normal film and home camcorder, the original score served its dramatic purpose (thanks once again to Thomas Newman) and the casting is inspired. Though the essence of the film is obviously not in its technical side, but in its deliverance of its central message. The narration of Kevin Spacey, who gets better in every movie he is in, carries us along the delusion and degradation of his existence and he wakes up to the fact that he does not like what he has become. His voice merely echoes what most of us either feel or have felt that we do not live up to what we saw for ourselves when we were younger. The harsh reality of it lies in that no matter what we do to try to obtain what it was we lost, we can strive forever but something will always get in the way in the end. Undoubtedly this film will make you want to get up off the sofa, switch off the TV and do something about yourself, and so it should. If we get one thing out of Mr. Mendes' masterpiece, it should be to live for the moment and enjoy your life.
