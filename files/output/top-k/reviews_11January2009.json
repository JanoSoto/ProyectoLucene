I like it how it's all the movies are connected around the certain characters and all have motives interlinked with the storyline behind Cindy's mothers past. I love it, although sometimes the killer does get knocked down a little bit too easily and sometimes seems like it's on a kids TV show, where they're knocked down so easily. However, still good, i wouldn't say this is overly scary, but it's a good one! The third one is a personal fave of mine, although i like the other two. The third has a unique storyline to how everyone's being killedA great movie. If you haven't watched it, go to your local video store and buy all three of them!

There is amazing action, spectacular special effects and some surprisingly emotional scenes for a film of this nature.Right from the opening scene, portraying the nuclear wasteland and the fight against the machines, you get the feeling this is going to be an epic. From the Terminators you get a sense of cold mechanical duty (from both Arnold and Patrick), from John you have the innocence and disbelief; in a way, his character re-introduces us to the Terminator story, in the same way Sarah did in the first film. From Sarah you have desperation and frustration- how would it feel to KNOW, beyond all doubt, that the world faces destruction, yet no one believes you and you can't prove it? Unlike a lot of today's blockbusters, the action sequences fit neatly into the story and even serve to move the story forward in a lot of ways, as opposed to explosions for the sake of it. The narrative is strong and everyone performs their parts to the best of their abilities, inhabiting their characters perfectly. There is unrepentant menace from the T-1000, whilst from Sarah, utter determination to protect her son and save mankind.This film concludes the story from the first film in a very organic and fitting way. In many ways it's a shame they made a third.
