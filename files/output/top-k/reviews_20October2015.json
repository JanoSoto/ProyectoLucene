[{"date":"20 October 2015","score":"","review":" Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson return for the third installment of the slasher horror that pleased critics and horror fans all around the country in the 90s, only this time, lot less fun or exciting than the previous two. Neve Campbell returns as Sidney Prescott who now works as a crisis counselor and is living isolated deep in the woodsy area of California, traumatized by the violent Woodsboro murders from the first two movies. Back in her hometown, Hollywood director Roman Bridger (played by Scott Foley) is working on slasher horror titled 'Stab 3' based on the Woodsboro murders. The production quickly goes awry when Ghostface makes his return and begins murdering the cast one-by-one. Sidney teams up with Gale (played by Courtney Cox) and Dewey Riley (played by David Arquette) to stop Ghostface's murderous onslaught once and for all.As this is the third installment of the series, there is lots of discussion about movie trilogies, and basically what the characters claim is that the third installment in a film series is about going back to the past and learning a shocking truth of what happened in the first film. We are also introduced to a set of new characters, most of which are very one-dimensional other than Parker Posey and Scott Foley's character. Compared to the previous two films, this one marks a low point for the series. The plot is much less clever and less original, and is completely devoid of scares or good humor. While the plot centers on the characters trying to solve the murders of the cast of the (fictional)movie 'Stab 3', the film throws a huge, needless sub plot of detectives trying to solve of Sidney's mother who was murdered which is made the plot so uneven. To make matters worse, Sidney has reduced screen time and appears in no more than half of the scenes, while the film focuses on Gale, Dewey, and these other new characters. The only thing redeeming about this film is the big twist at the end. Other than that, this film lacks the spirit and scares of the previous movies.Scream 3 is definitely my least favorite of the series and one of the most disappointing third installments I have seen. Unless you are a huge fan of the series, this one is probably worth staying away from.
