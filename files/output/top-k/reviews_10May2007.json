But as I feel strongly about what I originally said about this film, I need to make a couple of points about my review First off, I stand by most of my first edition of my comment for this film. Second, I think I have the right to comment on this film and my feelings about it, and my personal beliefs about the legal system, which this film is about.Please consider that in this case that complaint ought to be made to the producers of this film, as this film says basically the same thing I said in my original review about the situation.I Want to Live is certainly an offensive film to certain kinds of people A Lot of people have said that this is a Hollywood Attempt to re-write history, sort of like what Stone did with the film JFK.In my reviews I like to deal with the honesty of films. THIS is an honest film, and is important as making a statement against something that MAY have happened The possibility of the State of California executing an innocent person.Lots of effort went into this film and the telling of this story in this way And we have to ask WHY would Hollywood use such resources to tell such a story, unless someone really believed Barbara Graham had been given the business end? By her alleged accomplices, by her husband, by the press and mostly by the LA Police? This film shows certain methods of how the police elicit confessions- And from experience, I have to say, and still say, regardless of anyone's personal feelings, that this portrayal is SPOT-ON. I say this not to offer offence, but to state that in fact this is what happens in the Legal System, when ethics is not more highly regarded. Perhaps today, Graham would have had a better ability to defend herself. And this is a film chiefly about Ethics. IN THIS FILM the prosecutors are shown to be be quite unethical.The purpose of this comment however, is not to claim that Graham was in fact innocent, but to consider this film.Now I am going to revise this paragraph which I think was taken the wrong way by somebody This film shows the viewer the POSSIBILITY that police departments may have used any dirty trick in any dirty book... Possibly planting Shills in the general population of a Jail just to be able to use duplicity and coercion and other tactics to get someone to admit to a crime. This film causes the viewer to consider In relation to more recent events, were tactics like this attempted to be used in a certain famous trail roughly 10 years ago? People do not realize that at any given time of any given day anything they say WILL be recorded in some way and used against them later, regardless of how intended the speech. And according to this film, Graham was pretty slow on the realisation of this fact. But also, this film accurately depicts the frustration and desperation of a person in such a situation as Graham.Was Barbara Graham badgered into confessing that she was with the men who performed the crime? IN THE FILM, the fact of coercion did not even enter in to it All that mattered is the so-called Confession In that film and in real life, the jury appears to have disregarded the coercion methods used.Susan Hayward in real life had a legal situation that possibly dealt with the same type of duplicity in people, making her the best person to play that part, and she does a swell job of being a Bad Girl, just on the edge of a precipice, that falls in or gets sucked in to circumstances she may have not wanted to be complicit in. It does not matter if this was the case with the real Barbara Graham, it is the case in the FILM- And Hayward makes you believe this, or you walk out of the film... I do know several people who are greatly offended by this film.Robert Wise clearly depicts how nasty people can be, especially the press. Coercion or not, this film shows the foul effect of bad press, which has existed since the day of Christ Another person who 'got the shaft' so to speak. In the film, The woman of the press, who near the end needles Graham about the future of her baby, is as near to a vulture-ess as I can imagine. I actually know people of the press today, and they are not like that, in general, in relation to real newspapers... The Tabloids however, still use those tactics, but they do not have the power of the press that once existed.Wise was wise. He knew situations, he painted a valid picture of basic human nastiness- Lies, deceit, duplicity, and one of the best things in this film is the turnaround of Ed Montgomery played by Si Oakland (General Moore, from T.V.s Black Sheep Squadron).This film tells us just one thing Be smart and do everything you can to AVOID being sucked in the the US Legal System. In other words, don't give them a reason to come after you. Barbara Graham, regardless of guilt or innocence, gave them a trail of bad circumstances about three miles long. Of course, this is not encouragement to go out and do crime.

Two things first, what does that actually mean when you say 'of the century'? The century had only been two years old when The Score was made so in actual fact; it probably was if you only count the heists that had happened between January 2000 and whenever The Score takes place. Secondly, why is it that every time a heist film comes out; it's dubbed as 'the heist of the century'? In recent years; films like Ocean's Eleven, its sequel Ocean's Twelve and the remake of The Italian Job have been made and have achieved success to a degree; these films, I feel, have also got people more into heist films but what they perhaps fail to realise is that The Score was there before most of the examples I gave and thus; shows you don't need to remake a film from the 1960s or indeed make a sequel to a remake from the 1960s. The Score is an energetic, nicely paced, well thought through crime film that combines romance, gives the different audiences something each to map onto and has, what I heard somewhere else, 'the three greatest actors from three different generations' those being Brando, De Niro and Norton.What I found to be distracting for the first twenty or so minutes of The Score was some of these elements mixed in with others. The fact the heist has actually already been planned by a character not yet involved in a major way and the fact nothing much needs to be thought through for the early part (lending more time for the Nick\/Diane love story to progress) was disappointing. Part of the reason I liked Ocean's Eleven was down to the way they planned an announced it to the other members whilst showing us where it was they'd do it. What made it better was the fact it was seemingly impossible. In The Score; the item they're after is merely in a safe, in a basement &#150; nothing too fancy.Also, the point of Marlon Brando's character. The fact the only reason Brando was cast seems solely to be down to nostalgia (as he wasn't getting much screen time round about the time) is odd enough but he really didn't feature too much and a tiny twist that cropped up about half way through didn't seem to have a major affect on what the outcome was going to be. What's more, most of the 'three greatest actors of three different generations' actually just stand around for the early part bickering to one another about the whole thing &#150; hey, you think you've got it tough? Check out those fellas' heist from Ocean's Eleven.What was clever, though and what really involves the audience is giving them different characters to relate to. I was once told that if you don't have characters in the film the target audience can relate to &#150; they'll totally zone out and hate your film. Here, there are two relatable characters one is Nick Wells (De Niro) and the other is Jack Teller (Norton). Nick is the senior, 'been doing it too long', knows all the tricks, just about to retire guy but Jack is the young, up and coming, too smart for his own good, outgoing guy. Let's face it, this is a film aimed at males and males of different ages so each guy can relate to one of these two character in a way that reflects their life at the moment. Are they more elder? Close to retirement? Know all the tricks of their trade? Or are they more younger, more cocky, more outgoing types. Whatever the answer, the tactic on display here works really well in involving the audience.I liked a lot more things about The Score than I disliked and when I did dislike something, I ignored it as it was relatively minor. There is nothing really 'wrong' with the film, it just does what it's supposed to do but is it the heist film of the century and does it present us with the heist of the century within itself?

Don't ask me why but I just can't get into it like The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.I think the casting helps the film because the actors give a convincing performance and it is not easy with some of the dialogue they have to say.I like the fact Princess Leia is a feisty character who can pick up a gun and defend herself without needing to turn to a man to help her. It was also interesting to have a character like Han Solo who was cared more about what he could get out of the situation then how he could help people who needed him but at the end, we see there is a positive side to him because he comes to help Luke when he didn't have to.

Vader is very sinister especially with James Earl Jones voicing him, he gives the character a menacing quality which wouldn't have worked without someone with a powerful voice to portray him.It is shocking when Guinness dies but it was a brilliant idea George Lucas had in keeping the character in the other films by bringing him back as a type of spirit.The music is amazing and just fits with the whole mood of the film.

Well, this is what the trailer of The Negotiator states, but it also states a lot of more things; some which it shouldn't state. So my first recommendation is don't watch the trailer of this film before watching the film itself&#133;It will make it better. Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson) is a successful negotiator and, as it happens in these films, he's getting too close to something and consequences are ahead.That's all you'll hear from me. After this main plot line, The Negotiator becomes a nerve- racking ride; with thrills all the way through and a very intelligent use of the general elements of the crime thriller. See, that's the thing about crime thrillers they are always around the same kind of ideas and stories. I recently watched Edison and I didn't like the way it handled things; because it wanted to give an explanation to a conspiracy that was confusing and difficult to understand, sadly inside of a good script.The Negotiator suffers from the same thing. However, writers James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox make it up with some beautifully written, gripping dialogue in a fantastic achievement; considering that one of them hadn't done anything before and the other had written Jack. The screenplay of The Negotiator is probably what brings the rest to life.It isn't the writers' fault but, although the cameras are well placed and F. Gary Gray's direction is accurate, everything feels a little bit like television (like in SWAT). I'm not saying this is a bad characteristic, because it doesn't make the film less dynamic and because the film is, as I said, intelligent; but it's ultimately disappointing. The music by Graeme Revell is one of the high points, with chilling strings that accentuate the characters' looks in the moments of tension. These moments of tension also look like television, but we forgive it because we get some good intense looks. If The Negotiator is not good for everything else (which is not entirely true), it is good because of the actors (casting by David Rubin). Samuel L. Jackson is full of perfectly managed rage as Danny Roman, achieving a better performance than the ones he got in other movies where he carried guns, like The Long Kiss Goodnight, Rules of Engagement, even Shaft and definitely SWAT. A lot of the actors in the cast come from television or are now still on television (which may help the feeling I was talking about), like Ron Rifkin, John Spencer, Carlos Gomez, Nestor Serrano, Stephen Lee and Doug Spinuzza. They are all great, and so is the late J.T Walsh in a small role. Besides, Regina Taylor is powerful as Jackson the cold David Morse is astounding playing a kind of villain and showing he's one of the best for playing villains today; even in films like Dreamer. Paul Giamatti steals the show as a maniac hostage, which is a nice performance to see Giamatti before becoming the cult performer he is now. He was still good then. Siobhan Fallon is also flawless as a law-abiding secretary. But Jackson is the centre of the movie, alongside the other main character. Chris Sabian appears late in the film, but in the skin of Kevin Spacey he encounters Jackson's craziness and The Negotiator elevates itself into a whole different level. Spacey's facial expression and manner of talking and Jackson's unique eyes movement are just little details of their incredible performances and their chemistry. Wonderful actors pay attention to details in movies. At least just to watch Spacey and Jackson, you can't miss The Negotiator. It has one of the best acting duos I've seen in a long time.

For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day, he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. And not a few phrases either. Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story. Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!).When Marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. Of a cage that is!Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.Jay Mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way.Because he's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes. Only for those promises to be broken time and again.Paulie is admittedly a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie. He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathises with Paulie's situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie.Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking There are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment. And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon, soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film's over.Despite the occasional sad moment, there are plenty of laughs to be had. Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant. The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number. And Paulie even gets to have a romance. Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief (played by Mohr as well). That may be the only complaint I have. As soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the film then moves Paulie on to another.The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing too. I'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film. And Paulie's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible. He's caught in the act, and shipped off to the lab for animal testing, where he's remained ever since.The story finally comes full circle at the lab, where Misha vows to help Paulie. Of course they do find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity, I was left numb for several minutes. Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has, but I believe its an equally brilliant film. The same laughs. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence.A minor gem.

For every wonderful one like Babe, you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential. When I heard about Paulie, the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn't exactly fill me with confidence. But I found the film a pleasant surprise. And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.A Russian janitor, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day, he hears singing coming from the basement. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out. Misha becomes fascinated with the bird, especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing, it can talk. And not a few phrases either. Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.The parrot is called Paulie (voiced by Jay Mohr), and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha. Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement, Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story. Which all began when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five year old girl with a stutter. The two of them became birds of a feather (OK, bad pun!).When Marie's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird, they considered sending him away. And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a diverse number of new owners, flying great distances, and even ending up behind bars. Of a cage that is!Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s. And although it wasn't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of Babe, Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels, and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.Jay Mohr's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie. He never plays the part as too smug, even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way.Because he's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie, when he's taken away, he has to fend for himself for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie, which he believes. Only for those promises to be broken time and again.Paulie is admittedly a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with, and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie. He first winds up in a pawn shop, where he is adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners. She sympathises with Paulie's situation, and drives an RV across America to find Marie.Paulie is an occasionally very touching film. His scenes with Ivy are some of the best. Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers. The way she instills in him the need for hope is great, and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking There are things in life you put off, because you think you're gonna do them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later.The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment.

The idea is very simple. Two brothers inherit a rundown house from their late father. Hoping to renovate it, and auction it off to the highest bidder, they first have to evict a mouse that's made its home there. And what follows is an increasingly hilarious series of outlandish schemes, traps and slapstick.The plot may be wafer-thin, and it is really a one joke film, but I love MouseHunt! It really is that funny. Director Gore Verbinski knows all about cartoon slapstick in live-action. Something that would reach overkill in his Pirates of the Caribbean films. But in MouseHunt, the short running time means that this is a more tightly plotted endeavour, and all the more enjoyable for it.The film uses a combination of animatronics and CGI to create the mouse. And they really are very inventive. They undoubtedly used real mice for some stunts. Like the cute scene of the mouse running on top of a wheel of cheese like a giant hamster wheel. But the more difficult ones, such as swinging from a light-bulb cord, jumping onto a spoon, or hanging on for dear life to avoid being sucked up by a vacuum are all accomplished by some very impressive special effects. They recall the brilliance of the exceptional Roald Dahl film adaptation The Witches.The mouse is the real star of the film, and you can tell Verbinski considers him the hero of the piece. Placing him up against insurmountable odds like an insane cat, fire-hoses and propane explosions, the mouse emerges triumphant every time. There is some wonderful slapstick in these scenes, and they're all perfectly orchestrated. I love the part when cat and mouse are inside a piano, running on the keys, and it sounds like an ominous film score.Providing the human element, the two brothers Ernie and Lars Smuntz (Nathan Lane & Lee Evans) are both on top comic form. Evans gets to sport his usual stand-up shtick, and Lane is on fine form as the scheming older brother. He gets the lions share of all the best lines He's Hitler with a tail. He's The Omen with whiskers. Even Nostradamus didn't see him coming!The two of them take quite a beating over the course of the film. Like when they mousetrap themselves into a corner. Or a marvellously executed sequence that has them sliding down a flight of stairs in a bath, over a hill and onto a frozen lake. Then they go in the lake. It's an energetic piece of inspired lunacy that has you laughing so hard your sides feel like they're going to split open.A lot of people who've reviewed MouseHunt have compared it to Home Alone. And not without reason. The violent slapstick is just about on a par, but believe me, the mouse is much more endearing than Macauley Culkin ever will be.There's also a fine supporting cast. Vicki Lewis is perfectly horrid as Lars' scheming wife. But look out for Christopher Walken's star turn as the slightly mad and very twitchy exterminator Caeser. Like Ahab after Moby Dick, his mouse catching contraptions turn out to be his undoing.Verbinski ensures that things never run out of steam, because wisely, he doesn't allow the mouse-catching to be the sum of the film's parts. MouseHunt avoids a pitfall most other films would have fallen into. He includes interconnecting subplots that form a more substantial backbone. Such as Lars' wife, April agreeing to help them with their financial problems so she can turn a larger profit when the house is sold. As well as the future of the string factory they too inherited from their father, who a couple of heavies are interested in buying. They're weaved into the plot and called upon when required.All the different plot strands converge in the inspired last 15 minutes. The night of the auction. In one long, continuous running joke, the slapstick builds until it reaches critical mass. Its something that wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Frasier.The final scenes are actually quite touching, and I liked the way the mouse proves to be Ernie and Lars' salvation in the end.

I'm not even going to touch on Dux's friendship with fellow fighter and bikie, Ray Jackson(Played by Donald Gibb). WAY bad. I don't mean to sound shallow and or seem like i don't like an engaging plot, but lets be honest, its a poorly scripted, awkwardly acted fight-fest, there's no need for shoddy story lines.Anyway, down to the fighting. It was exceptionally well choreographed, and you can tell that the fighters know what they're doing. Occasionally the punches looked a little soft, and Van Damn's odd wailing gets gets a bit distracting, but it's hard to care much when there's so much fighting going on. The villain was great, but the final confrontation between him and Dux is a tad disappointing.Like i said the acting is downright awkward, especially Van Damn's, he is awful(Though not as awful as the child actor playing his younger self, DAMN!) But then, he's not there for his acting. He's there to look good and fight. On that though, there were a few too many buff shots of Van Damn, his huge muscular body was constantly thrown in your face, as well as a gratuitous shot of Van Damns butt, which made me feel like i was watching gay porn. They could have at least thrown in some breasts, it was the 80's after all! Without giving too much away, for a film called Bloodsport, there just wasn't enough blood. I wanted necks broken and faces crushed. I didn't want half an hour of cheesy music, silly chases, unnecessary love scenes, and male butts shots. But hey, that's just me.Five out of Ten.

The problem is that it could have been great...Starring the indestructible Arnold Schwarzenegger, Predator is an audacious and inventive movie, doing a great mix of action, science fiction, horror and exotic destinations. And that just before the film's director John McTiernan come up with his masterpiece Die Hard.Schwarzenegger plays Dutch, an American military officer dispatched somewhere in Latin America. His crew has to find and rescue a small group of American hostages captured by guerrillas in the jungle. According to Dutch, this mission seems to be only a walk in the park (or in the rain-forest, if you prefer...).In fact, it is. The guerrillas' camp is quickly knocked down by Dutch and his mates and the Latino soldiers of fortune are all eliminated. But neither Dutch, nor anyone of his colleagues could have predicted what would follow...In the way of the Xenomorph in Alien, the soldiers are killed one by one in an horrible and disgusting way by what looks like to be an invisible figure.The Predator, thus we have to name it, is rather an extra-terrestrial whose 'hunting' outfit contains super-powerful weapons, an ultra-perfected camouflage mode, a mask that looks like those from Polynesian people and a rasta 'hairstyle'... By the way, we get to see its true (and very ugly, should I say it) face at the very end of the movie only, simply to imply that the people who are responsible of the presentation do not twist their thumbs...The movie Predator starts pretty well. The three skinned corpses give a gruesome foretaste of things to come and they are even more convincing than those that we would see four years later in the famous Silence of the Lambs.In fact, the soldiers are killed one by one and each one in a different method. So it avoids to give a repetitive mood to the film and it also avoids from giving to the viewer a feeling of non-surprise. On the contrary, horror and gore are always there, victim after victim.But what really draws the attention, it's the Predator itself. Its creation and its movements required the use of very sophisticated special effects for its era and nothing has been left at random in order to make the creature even more frightening and also more exciting to watch.What made the movie famous, it's probably the audacious, ingenious and inventive use of the thermal camera. This method strengthens the existing parallel between Predator and Jaws. Not only that the two main 'antagonists' kill their preys one by one, but we never really see them in the first hour. Instead of that, a special viewing point is taken for each of them. In Jaws, it's the underwater swimmers' legs. In Predator, it's the thermal camera.We must not forget the enemy's 'camouflage' either. Remember the time is 1987. That means no computers. Because today, recreating the curved mirror-like effect would be a child's play. But in the context of the time where the movie was created, it was a prodigious technique. And even today, it still stuns, even if it became easier.The greatest adversary of the Predator is also very good. Schwarzenegger is surprising in this film and his stature of former bodybuilder helps him instead of attracting prejudices, because he's not the only character in this movie who has mountains instead of biceps. In fact, I think that it's his best role (after the Terminator, of course).And to crown everything, the jungle becomes an entity within itself, as in Platoon, thus fueling the thrills that give the Predator hunt.Unfortunately, the movie contains massive mistakes. In fact, Predator is an almost-perfect film for the first hour, or hour and a quarter. It's when there's only Schwarzenegger left to kill that everything changes. The action scenes, which were previously well-orchestrated and rather realistic, suddenly become laughable and ridiculous. Instead of killing Dutch, the alien doesn't seem to notice that he's there at all (problem of vision?) and when it has the possibility to kill him single-handedly, it doesn't. Why? I imagine that it's because the story has to end well and the hero must survive. Dutch also builds traps in order to kill his enemy. But just by watching his actions, I searched in vain, but I couldn't find the instruction manual in the scenery...Fortunately that Predator has a strong start, because the falling in the final act would certainly have annihilated it.

Korngold had already written a great score for Captain Blood, and when it came to writing music for 'Period Movies' Not even Max Steiner could touch him.The Robin Hood tale has been filmed many many times and I've seen most of 'em, but NONE of them hold a candle to this beaut.Kevin Costner, Douglas Fairbanks, and Patrick Bergin, are just footnotes when reviewing the cinematic history of Robin Hood. Errol Flynn to me, is the one and only definitive Screen Robin Hood, and I don't think anyone else will EVER come close.If I were a lifestyle guru, I would give three tips on how to enrich your life, a) get married, b) have children, c) watch The Adventures Of Robin Hood.

Korngold had already written a great score for Captain Blood, and when it came to writing music for 'Period Movies' Not even Max Steiner could touch him.The Robin Hood tale has been filmed many many times and I've seen most of 'em, but NONE of them hold a candle to this beaut.Kevin Costner, Douglas Fairbanks, and Patrick Bergin, are just footnotes when reviewing the cinematic history of Robin Hood. Errol Flynn to me, is the one and only definitive Screen Robin Hood, and I don't think anyone else will EVER come close.If I were a lifestyle guru, I would give three tips on how to enrich your life, a) get married, b) have children, c) watch The Adventures Of Robin Hood.

I too, must share those sentiments Because of this movie, I have no doubt at all, that had Robin Hood actually existed, he would have looked just like Errol Flynn, (minus the sparkling teeth and Californian suntan of course).For a production nearing it's 70th anniversary, I have to say that I can't think of another movie released around the same time that has aged as well. The Technicolor STILL dazzles, the action STILL excites, the music STILL haunts and it can only get better now this perfect movie has received the Digital remastered treatment for it's DVD release.I won't go into the plot here, because unless you're a visitor from another planet, you will already know about the Robin Hood legend.

Ali Macgraw is nice to look at, but after hearing the *exact* same syllables fly out of her mouth countless times, it'll be a brave soul indeed who doesn't feel close to the edge of sanity.Above all, anger at the millions who were naive enough to buy wholesale into this shameless commercial formula and actually believe that the film they were watching invented our noble visions of grand passion. Swathes of cable channels pumped full of mediocre TV drama are their horrifying legacy, and sooner or later someone must snap their fingers so that this false reverie can come to an end.

You know, there's a ready audience to extract admission fees from. Without that, this project had no possibility of being made. There are exactly zero people in the world clamoring for a generously long, depressing movie.This movie really needed an adaptation that found (or manufactured) some engrossing throughline in the episodic material. Making it filmic instead of a slavishly, literal depiction of the books imagery would have been just dandy too. But no. Rabid fans tend not to like that. They want the book filmed as if the imagery they supplied while reading it were merely recorded. This is the limp task we ask of filmed novels in this era. It's not compelling. Rarely does a movie survive a books fan base.They must have devised special life-sucking camera filters to make this. Everything is grey and torpid.
