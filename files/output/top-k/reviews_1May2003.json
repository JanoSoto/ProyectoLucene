It was cute, funny, charming, heart-tugging, warm, everything a good romantic comedy should be. As a guy who has had a string of bad luck myself in the dating field, I could really relate to this movie, especially to the title character.Jessica Stein is a newspaper copy editor in NYC who is 28 and feeling the pressure of still being single, especially when her brother gets engaged. After the obligatory montage of blind dates where Jessica meets up with clod after clod (my favorite is the would-be writer who keeps using the wrong words in his jingo), the sexless single girl happens to spot a personal ad that quotes one of her favorite poems. Which is great, until she spots that the ad is a Women Seeking Women entry. But then, after another disastrous blind date, our heroine decides she has nothing left to lose and arranges to meet with Helen, the girl who placed the ad. An art gallery manager, Helen is not really a lesbian either; it's merely that her relationships with men are primarily sexual, and she wants to get some emotional content in her life.This film is not a belly-laugh comedy (although there were a few lines that had me almost on the floor), but rather a gentle, more subtle type of comedy. Most of the laughs come from Jessica's neuroses as she tries to start a relationship with Helen. Jessica is like a younger, female Woody Allen; only a lot easier to watch. And while the movie is enjoyable from start to finish, the screen just sparkles when Jessica and Helen are together. They are what makes the film. (It doesn't hurt that the actresses playing them had been developing their roles for quite a while in a stage play version of the story.)Yes, there are scenes of Jessica and Helen kissing - but not to fear, ladies. These scenes are not about exploitation or titillation, they are as normal as watching a guy kiss a girl in any other film.(**POSSIBLE SPOILER**) The only real problem with the film is how conveniently everything is wrapped up at the end, but with a feel-good movie like this, well, who wouldn't want a happy ending? (**END SPOILER**)I would recommend this movie to anyone. I'm even thinking about buying it, and I'm very particular about which movies I actually want to own. And, guys, if you're looking for porn, DON'T rent this. Instead, go back to the little closed-off room in the back of the video store.

And how could it be different, when Robert Zemeckis is the director and the main role is in Jodie Foster's hands?Everything starts with a little girl (she has no longer her mother and is very fond of her father, a radio amateur), who really wants to communicate with someone farther away than the other coast of America. Guided by her father, according to whom if we were alone, it would be an awful waste of space, Ellie dreams... It will take her a lifetime and her colleagues'despise to realize her dream and perceive a rhythmic sound coming from deep space... from that moment on her life will never be the same again. Her project will bluntly come on the scene and will be put, more and more, on a political and military plan; her discovery will also bring new troubles in her relationship with a theologian, reverend Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), which always has to bring to account the conflict between religion and science, faith and empirical evidence. While the film was proceeding, I couldn't help thinking that I was having a lot of fun.

Zemeckis'direction is respectful of the novel, intelligent and refined.

Well, Contact's author Carl Sagan did...and this film doesn't betray at all his book's soul. And how could it be different, when Robert Zemeckis is the director and the main role is in Jodie Foster's hands?Everything starts with a little girl (she has no longer her mother and is very fond of her father, a radio amateur), who really wants to communicate with someone farther away than the other coast of America. Guided by her father, according to whom if we were alone, it would be an awful waste of space, Ellie dreams... It will take her a lifetime and her colleagues'despise to realize her dream and perceive a rhythmic sound coming from deep space... from that moment on her life will never be the same again. Her project will bluntly come on the scene and will be put, more and more, on a political and military plan; her discovery will also bring new troubles in her relationship with a theologian, reverend Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), which always has to bring to account the conflict between religion and science, faith and empirical evidence.

When I first heard about the Final Fantasy movie I was initially displeased because of the horrendous history of good games being made into bad movies (Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat for instance). Originally I let the hype sweep over, vowing not to see the movie for fear of being disappointed. However, about two years after the film was released, I managed to get caught up in a animated movie whose title I didn't know on one of those depressing rainy afternoons. The film completely hooked me with it's catchy if a little corny writing and the cool computer generated look. This film really moved me with its beauty and storyline.Reading other comments on here people have been saying that the film is copying other Sci-Fi flicks and that it's terrible, but I disagree. I think the concept of the film is a fairly new idea and that the film has remained faithful to the game series I know and love. The game series had the same sort of airy futurist plots as well and intense moving storylines. I also must commend this movie for the fact that some of its main characters actually die, which is sad yet refreshing.Bottom line, this movie is a bit corny and perhaps a bit to cliché.

But its also one that really doesn't have much to say. Peter Sarsgaard plays Richard who is a man that has a computer business and its on the verge of going public and earning him even more money than he has now. Molly Parker is Florence who is an exotic dancer in a strip club and she meets Richard in a coffee shop. They talk and he finds out where she works. Finally he asks her if she would come to Las Vegas with him for 10,000 dollars. She lays out the ground rules like no sex. But between 10pm and 2am she will do erotic things with him without intercourse. During the stay in Vegas Richard meets her friend Jerri (Carla Gugino) and at one point she says her boyfriend beat her up. Richard gives her money to help her out. One of the questions surrounding the story is if Florence and Jerri were in on it together to get more money out of Richard. Its possible. The center of the film is Parkers performance as Florence. Its the best thing in the film and Parker reminded me of Linda Fiorentino in The Last Seduction. A very smart woman who doesn't compromise and is in control at all times. At one point in the film Florence is masturbating and I think the scene shows that whatever sexual pleasure she receives will be on her terms, when she allows it. *****SPOILER ALERT*****The end of the film has no revelation and the character of Richard is so predictable that one can't help but call him a big fool. Of course he falls for her and thinks that over the course of time she'll change her mind about him. But business is business and Florence tells him that she's here for the money, just as they had agreed on. The irony of the film is that Richard is a very successful man with a computer company making lots of money but when it comes to relationships, he's a failure. Florence is the one that understands what business is. She's a consummate pro! Film is moderately interesting without having any real message or angle to the story. We don't know if Florence and Jerri set up Richard and you can't feel sorry for him. He's portrayed as such a schmuck. We saw his intentions when he first asked Florence to Vegas.

Yojimbo is nothing short of an incredible action movie that never gets boring and never lets up. Some of the parts of this movie compare so well to modern action films that I actually thought this movie ranks in my top 10 action movies of all time.Like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Yojimbo is an opera of cheesiness. The acting is good in a loud way, and there are certain characters that have no place in reality, but a welcome home in the world of movies. (That huge, ugly bastard.) Toshiro Mifune has consistently been a commanding prescence on the screen in every Kurosawa film that I have seen, and each performance I watch makes me love him more and more. In this film, he plays a gruffy old samurai, but with a different edge than that of Sanjuro. In Sanjuro, the lead character is more of an unconventional leader, using cleverness as his main weapon, and the sword only when necessary. This is still the same sort of character that he plays in Yojimbo, however, in this film he has a much more brutal air about him. Sanjuro left you feeling like he was a restrained individual. Yojimbo left you feeling a little awed by the sheer power that he could unleash.As far as the plot goes, this movie is about as perfect as you can get to suit my needs. Basically, a man who calls himself Sanjuro comes into town for a few days. When he leaves, everyone is dead. What's not to love? But seriously... This movie is about a town that is torn by two rival gangs. When the no-named Samurai comes in, he manages to use his skillful swordplay to manipulate the two sides so they destroy each other. And in the end, everyone dies!! Glee! Glee!This film was so thoroughly fun and funny that I was laughing the entire length of the movie. The final showdown was so incredible and different from any sort of action climax I have seen that it made a serious mark in my brain. When I was watching it, I got a vibe that I had seen this level of bad assness in another movie before, but I couldn't really remember where. What made it so good was the entire development of all the characters. I love that feeling where the bad guys are set up so much that you just love to watch them get their asses kicked.Toshirio Mifune's character of the man with no name is definitely the best part of the film. He has the dark humor and stage prescence to really pull this role off and make it work to a maximum. I also found the way that he gets his name to be a wonderful touch to the movie as well. He says his name is Sanjuro, which means he is 30 years old. He then looks out into the distance and sees a mulberry field. Sanjuro Kuwabatake, he says. Kuwabatake means mulberry field in Japanese.There are so many great little touches to this movie that are so classic in and of themselves. In the beginning of the film, Sanjuro throws a stick into the air. The stick points a direction, so, Sanjuro walks that direction. Truly a man with no purpose for living. This, among many other moments, make the movie so fun and fresh that you never get bored while watching.The GOODS Fun, inventive, and downright ass-kicking. I am definitely taking a shine to black and white movies. Since I was raised with color, I used to prefer movies that are in color. After seeing Kurosawa use the black and white as an entirely different medium of putting film onto the screen, utilizing the actual lack of color, I have been gaining an entirely different respect for black and white. Yojimbo is a black and white film, which drains the color from the film and replaces it with a dusty feeling, like a western. I think Yojimbo would not have been the same movie if it had been in color.The BADS Yojimbo, much like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, is filled with cheese. It is a fantastic film in the sense that it is borderline fantasy. I do not really look at this to be a bad thing, but there are cerain audiences who don't enjoy watching cheese on film.The overall story pretty much stands If you like a good adventure story, and you like to be entertained, go see Yojimbo.

This movie is about a town that is torn by two rival gangs. When the no-named Samurai comes in, he manages to use his skillful swordplay to manipulate the two sides so they destroy each other. And in the end, everyone dies!! Glee! Glee!This film was so thoroughly fun and funny that I was laughing the entire length of the movie. The final showdown was so incredible and different from any sort of action climax I have seen that it made a serious mark in my brain. When I was watching it, I got a vibe that I had seen this level of bad assness in another movie before, but I couldn't really remember where. What made it so good was the entire development of all the characters. I love that feeling where the bad guys are set up so much that you just love to watch them get their asses kicked.Toshirio Mifune's character of the man with no name is definitely the best part of the film. He has the dark humor and stage prescence to really pull this role off and make it work to a maximum. I also found the way that he gets his name to be a wonderful touch to the movie as well. He says his name is Sanjuro, which means he is 30 years old. He then looks out into the distance and sees a mulberry field. Sanjuro Kuwabatake, he says. Kuwabatake means mulberry field in Japanese.There are so many great little touches to this movie that are so classic in and of themselves. In the beginning of the film, Sanjuro throws a stick into the air. The stick points a direction, so, Sanjuro walks that direction. Truly a man with no purpose for living. This, among many other moments, make the movie so fun and fresh that you never get bored while watching.The GOODS Fun, inventive, and downright ass-kicking. I am definitely taking a shine to black and white movies. Since I was raised with color, I used to prefer movies that are in color. After seeing Kurosawa use the black and white as an entirely different medium of putting film onto the screen, utilizing the actual lack of color, I have been gaining an entirely different respect for black and white. Yojimbo is a black and white film, which drains the color from the film and replaces it with a dusty feeling, like a western. I think Yojimbo would not have been the same movie if it had been in color.The BADS Yojimbo, much like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, is filled with cheese. It is a fantastic film in the sense that it is borderline fantasy. I do not really look at this to be a bad thing, but there are cerain audiences who don't enjoy watching cheese on film.The overall story pretty much stands If you like a good adventure story, and you like to be entertained, go see Yojimbo. I found it to be engaging and never boring. This movie zoomed to my alltime favorites list, being a perfectly crafted, fast paced, fun adventure that will only leave you feeling giddy and wishing that YOU were a nameless samurai. Hands down 4 stars.

who was visiting the city with his mother, Rachel(The beautiful Kelly McGillis).The young mother was visiting the city with Samuel to pick up supplies for her people in the Amish community.As Book

the Amish way of life while trying to figure out a way to defeat and expose his former allies.Meanwhile it begins to become apparent that strong feelings are also beginning to grow between John and Rachel.Can John have a future with Rachel, woman who comes from a society, miles different from that of John's?Witness isn't as good a film as you would think.Sure the direction by Austrailian film maker Peter Weir is first rate and the detail put into creating the world that the Amish people live is a hundrerd per cent convincing.All round the performances from the ensemble cast is

portrayed the evil bloned haired hench man of Alan Rickman in the orignal Die Hard movie.Here he play's a fellow Amish citizen and friend of the Lapp family.The chemistry between McGillis and Ford is

there is some wisdom in the Amish way of life(Their hatred for guns and the simple life they lead),their is equal naievity.I am not a violent person and abhor violence.But the Amish attitude to not

I know it's considered a classic example of film noir, and it makes me wonder about why film noir is so highly regarded. Greer, of course, is a beautiful woman, which is nice, and as competent a performer as Mitchum. Except that Mitchum couldn't be described as beautiful. The icons are here -- trench coat, speeding cars, florid dialog, short-barreled black revolvers, hotels in the big city, lots of makeup, fedora hats, neon signs. Kirk Douglas is the most interesting actor. He oozes more insincerity than anyone else in the film, which is saying a lot since absolutely nobody is totally believable.But I've seen this movie about three times over the course of the past decade and simply can't get with it. Mitchum seems tough but dumb. Nobody else is sympathetic. The plot line is twisted, hard to follow, and equally hard to believe. I found myself hoping Mitchum would wind up with the nice girl at the end, but didn't really care much. It wasn't really tragic when Mitchum and Greer are speeding along the dark road, Greer sees the roadblock, sneers You dirty stinking rat, and plugs him during the struggle. I kept wondering while watching it, why I found myself comparing it to The Maltese Falcon and finding it wanting. I couldn't figure it out, really. It seemed disjointed and dull. That's not to say it's trash. There is, after all, the photography and the direction, plus Douglas at his phoniest, in only his second movie. And it's also worth seeing for historical reasons. Everybody says it's a classic example of film noir, so see it and make your own judgment.

Early on in the film Trent, as ever, persuades Mike into doing something he doesn't want to do; go to Las Vegas. Through the course of the evening Mike loses his money and struggles with the ladies, but this half hour segment is handled so well that you can laugh and empathise at the same time.Of course eventually things work themselves out for Mike, but its not an easy ride for him, especially the classic mobile phone scene.I could talk about this movie all day, and have seen it so many times that I know all the dialogue, but suffice to say that this is the coolest, funniest, most heartwarming film you will ever see with great acting,amazing direction(on an obviously limited budget) a killer soundtrack and the most refreshingly funny and honest dialogue you could hope to hear. Even though this film is set in  L.A. it really strikes a chord with guys everywhere.Respect to John Favreau, Vince Vaughn and Doug Liman and the rest of the cast and crew for making my favourite movie!(The parody Swingblade on the dvd is quality too)10 out of 10!

Fortunately enough this film is an exception, there's really nothing to make you feel good or comfort you, and yet the engrenage inexorable which catches Jeff (R. Mitchum) can seem less threatening than usual.Of course he's in danger, of course things keep getting worse and worse and yet he seems unshakable, the strong & fragile, stoic Mitchum. This is a great performance by one of the most enigmatic actors of his time. As for the love story, indeed as says James Ellroy cherchez la femme, it's a masterpiece. Jeff is torn appart between magic and intriguing Kathie (Jane Greer) and sweet redemption Ann (Virginia Huston) but the characters although easy to identify are not caricatures . Kathie is wonderful. Jane Greer's incredible style and features make the character irresistible and increase the surprise and disappointment as we discover her dark side. But she's not a vilain, she's better than that she's a human and a woman, ambiguous, selfish but ... There's something about her next to what sweet gentle Ann cannot compare.On the baddies' side there's also Kirk Douglas as chief villain, but classy , rich and not so bad you can't like him. Yes indeed this movie respects every point of a good film noir love, betrayal, hope, redemption, fall from grace, ambiguity, inexorability. The dark ending gives to the whole movie an antic-tragedy style, as states Anouilh the matter with drama is that you cannot help but thinking there's still hope, with tragedy everything's clear, everyone knows what to do and how it's going to end. Even though Jeff isn't Oedipe there's a look in his eyes and a final sacrifice that really make him a tragic hero.Of course Tourneur's images , direction and style are perfect as usual and capture the subtle sensuality between the actors. It's a real moment of pleasure, the story is good, the actors too; more than an excellent film, this is a piece of cinema, and as everyone knows, that's simply art.
