When I saw this, I started off rather impatient for it to speed up and get where it was going at a brisker pace. While the pace never really takes off as much as I would have liked, the story does gain momentum and the characters become more fully realized as you watch. It just takes some time.In terms of my thoughts on this film I will say I didn't love it nor did I dislike it. I was a little let down after as I thought I would have liked a bit more then I did. But it really is the epitome of a movie that grows on you and I will say I was very touched by the end of the film. It's a tough movie to give a rating to because I kind of get the feeling I might like it more if I see it a second time. But I will say what my primary likes and dislikes were.First the dislikes. There was so much that was abstract and so many things that were never explained fully or at all. I had a lot of questions at the end. So did the group of people I saw this with. I wont get into the list of those things as there are a lot and this review would be way to long but suffice to say it was probably more then half a dozen things and these were major plot points. There's a difference between ambiguity and complete vagueness over key plot elements and I felt this movie had more of the latter.Another oddity that I didn't care for was the Strong resemblance between Doug and Jc. Now Crudup and Phoenix do not look much alike in real life but in this movie it seems nearly impossible to tell them apart. Therefore in the beginning when everything was unfolding I could not tell at times which brother was on screen at any given moment. And my friends felt that too. The resemblance between them was to much.Also the narration added to the movie's element of confusion.Key characters didn't get enough screen time. One of my friends had already seen this and shocked me by accidentally revealing in the movie that Jennifer Connoly's character was all but gone after her dad ships her out of town. I had assumed she would be back as a key character. I was very disappointed when this was not the case.Alice gets little to no screen time. Who is she as a person? We are really never told. Pam played by Liv Tyler was supposed to be a sympathetic character but she wound up really annoying me as well as some of my friends. There was so much game playing with her and Joaquin Phoenix the whole movie started to be about them. They sure did have chemistry but that took away from other characters' screen time. And the mother's story was fascinating, she was fascinating and Kathy Baker is my pic for most Oscar caliber performance. We should have seen more of her and her story as well. And there was no confrontation between JC and ....well....anyone. I thought the movie was building toward that but other then the whole Pam drama we really never see much of that on screen. I thought there would be a confrontation between him and the mother. Also I really REALLY wanted a confrontation between the mother and Mr. Abbott as well as someone to tell off Joan, without a doubt one of the most dislike able characters I've seen in awhile. But there isn't anything like that and maybe that's to be expected because the movie is kind of..for lack of a better word..soft spoken.Then there is the predictable element. As soon as Kathy Baker's character had that cough I knew something was gonna happen to her and that scene at the end(writing I love you on the glass) as sweet and poignant as it was, was so sugar sweet and predictable and didn't really go with the movie. And the movie ends kind of abruptly as well.Now for the likes...great acting. In fact the acting was just superb...by everyone. Strong on mood and atmosphere. Good running time(long enough but not to long.) Poignant storyline. Poignant(that word again!), believable characters and a certain bittersweet element that made it very believable as well as tremendous chemistry between Liv and Joaqueen, and in spite of the negatives a really interesting storyline.It is the story that hooks one in and despite all I did not like about it, I still became really engrossed as the movie went on. I think this movie's above average and the cast worked very well together. Everyone was believable in their respective roles.

The pre-credits teaser functions as an epilogue to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Bond hunting his arch-nemesis, Blofeld, in a quick series of scenes throughout the world. The filmmakers tried to recapture the best of Goldfinger in this one, using the same director and singer Bassey on the credits again. Ending up with even a pale imitation of the best Bonder is not such a bad thing, but it also points to the lack of originality besetting the series by this time. This one probably breaks the record for unusual types of killings, mostly courtesy of gay assassins Wint & Kidd, who go through a bunch of victims very quickly early on. The odd flavor and juxtaposition (detail of diamond smuggling over surreal liquidations) is an attempt to make Bond edgy & relevant now that the seventies began. The danger with all the attempts to be unusual, whether in regard to deaths or chases, is that it dips into a cutesy atmosphere a bit too far. Those fans fond of the seriousness in the previous film would probably not be amused, since it comes across as a dark parody of the usual spy stuff. That being said, Wint & Kidd, who represent the worst excesses of this film, end up as the highlights. From their very first scene in the desert, where they seem to draw inspiration from a scorpion, these two oddballs have the audience guessing on what they would do next - they are goofy, yes, but also lethal - interesting because they are somewhat original.Bond's mission, tracking an involved diamond smuggling operation, takes him briefly to Amsterdam, but he ends up in Las Vegas for most of the story. A subplot involves a missing billionaire, obviously patterned after Howard Hughes, who was still living as a recluse at this time. M and, especially Moneypenny, have less screen time in this one, though Q pops up in an amusing scene testing one of his gizmos on some one-armed bandits (Vegas is no match for Q). Though the scenes in Vegas itself are less exotic than those of most Bond films, the film also makes good use of the surrounding desert terrain and there are numerous grand sets, notably a huge futuristic lab building, complete with tests of a fake moon landing, as well as a house built into the rocks. There is a good auto chase on the streets of Vegas, which has the infamous 'two-wheely' by Bond thru an alley. The two weird assassins pop up every now and then; they even have their own theme score, an eerie yet playful little tune. One of them looks very strange (Smith, a jazz musician with no acting experience), while the other (actor Glover, father of Crispin Glover) looks more normal but has very strange inflections to his speech. Every time they show up, a strange tension surfaces for the viewer. Besides Wint & Kidd, other outrageous foes for Bond include Bambi & Thumper, two wild martial arts girls who nearly knock his teeth in. Their scene has a lot of energy and you won't soon forget them. The story is well-paced for the most part, with less of those slow spots that afflicted many of the later Bonders. However, a couple of deleted scenes with the Plenty character makes things a bit confusing for her character arc.Connery is, of course, several years older since his last Bonder, but he looks pretty much the same as he did in You Only Live Twice. There may be a hint of grey around the edges and, in his scenes with M, it no longer comes across as 'the old man and the wiseguy kid' repartee, despite their best efforts. But Bond is still the ideal male here and it's still believable that femme fatale Tiffany falls for him by the end. She's a curious mixture of flaky girl and worldly woman, usually flippant in her approach, sort of reflecting the trivial nature of this Bonder, where nothing happening is really of grave import. That's why, when Blofeld's (him again) real plan is revealed, it's a bit out of left field; all of sudden, we see a super laser detonating missiles around the globe and everything has changed into matters of international import. Blofeld, as played by Gray, is more urbane and effeminate than the previous two versions, more attuned to a villain planning world domination, but he's also too civilized, too polite to Bond in the climactic sequence, diffusing his threatening presence. CIA liaison Leiter recalls the non-descript Leiter of Goldfinger, as well. The climax on that oil rig sea platform in Baja is not very well done, with Blofeld's end especially disappointing (he would not return, except in the teaser of For Your Eyes Only). But, the epilogue is excellent. Bond, but not Connery, would return in Live and Let Die.

Trautman & special ops man Griggs (Kurtwood Smith) ask Rombo to go into Afghanistan & help them take out an evil Russian named Zaysen (Marc De Jonge), Rambo refuses their request. Trautman goes in alone but is captured by Zaysen & tortured, Griggs again turns to Rambo & informs him his friend Trautman has been captured. Rambo decides to go into Afghanistan himself, single handedly rescue Trautman as well as blow lots of things up & kill a few Russians...The third Rambo film this had a few behind the scenes production problems including the original director Russell Mulcahy being fired & replaced by the original 2nd unit director Peter MacDonald, personally I think it's a terrific late 80's testosterone filled overblown big budget Hollywood action flick the likes of which we don't really see anymore. The script by star Sylvetser Stallone & Sheldon Lettich moves like an absolute rocket, it's action packed, it's incredibly violent & brutal, there's plenty of cheesy dialogue & a few amusing one liners, it's just so over-the-top & it even tries to say something poignant about war! Hell, what more do you want? I'm amazed at how low the score for this is on the IMDb as I think it provides fantastic no-brainer entertainment, it's the perfect film for a group of blokes to stick in the DVD player, gets some drinks & crisps & just sit back & enjoy, enjoy & enjoy on a Neanderthal level! The character's are alright, Rambo is totally indestructible while Zaysen is an OK villain. Those who like deep meaningful stories with complex character's & go queasy at the thought of any violent act then this is obviously not the film for you but for sheer fast moving, gun fighting, explosion destroying, helicopter crashing, tank driving, fist fighting mindless action entertainment they don't come come much better than Rambo III & it's as simple & straight forward as that.It's impossible to know just what was shot by who here but the film looks nice enough, the landscapes are a bit barren & bare at times but that's what the desert is like I suppose. The action is top notch, there's loads of explosions, things blowing up, fights, gun battles, all sorts of military weaponry & vehicles as well as a whole army of extras being killed in a variety of violent ways. Apparently the 1990 edition of the Guiness Book of Records had Rambo III listed as the most violent film ever made with 221 acts of violence & at least 108 deaths, amazing eh? To be honest it's hard to disagree as it is one very violent film & it's quite brutal as well, there's lots of gory gunshot wounds & some torture scenes as well. I must admit I didn't like the young boy being involved as much as he was or when he twirled Rambo's huge knife around in a cool almost glamorous way & at the end when he 'became' a fighter & the film almost seemed to condone this young boy fighting in a war, considering the way the world is at this moment in time it just sat uneasily with me that's all.With a budget of around the $65,000,000 mark Rambo III was the most expensive filmed ever made up to the point when it came out, it's well made with high production values & some spectacular action scenes although try to watch the DVD version as it's presented in full 2351 widescreen & believe me that's the way it should be seen so you can see all of the on screen destruction. This won Stallone a Razzie award for worst actor & it was nominated for another four including worst director & worst film which is pure crap as this is a throughly entertaining flick although one must admit Stallone's performance isn't anything to shout about. I thought Kurtwood Smith was underused though.Rambo III may have a unfairly low IMDb rating but I think it's a fantastic big budget popcorn flick that moves like a rocket, has plenty of violent action & I've seen it numerous times with each time being just as enjoyable as the last. Definitely worth a watch for 80's action fans & it hands down beats any of the straight-to-video action crap the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme & Steven Seagal are churning out these days.

It captures the generation and in some small iconic way manages to make bold statements with seemingly 'teen film' type dialect. Anytime anyone hears 'The Breakfast Club' they fondly remember it making this an absolute classic and giving it deeper meaning than what it might appear to have. The Breakfast Club didn't treat teens like kids but rather portrayed them frankly, openly, and unabashedly, . It took stereotypes that are still to this day very existent in any high school, mixed them together and let every single one of those stereotypes have their moment and explain their side. It even went so far as to show the stick togetherness of youth and the eighties theme of wanting more from life and confusion and being young in an adult ruled world. The Breakfast Club is timeless.For all it's simplicity the cast nail every one of their roles and become icons to every teen out there. The story and cast seem to focus on John Bender played with eerie certainty by Judd Nelson. Bender is the bad ass in every sense of the word. He's the kid that skips school, breaks all the rules, does dope, drinks, has the hard home life, the bully, the shop class kid and he manages to incorporate all of this into a character you end up rooting for somehow. Even the other kids in the detention with him despise him and yet seem to look to him for leadership and come out with a better understanding of where he's coming from. He is the rebel to say the least. Nelson's portrayal is one of the movie greats hands down. Emilio Estevez is terrific as the jock Andy Clark who also has the reputation for bully against the kids who aren't as athletic or 'cool' as he is. Estevez has a quiet demeanor in most of the film and yet is very effective in showing a different style of parental control that somehow matches Bender's but is very different. Anthony Michael Hall is just brilliant as the brainy Brian Johnson who is the most down to earth out of all of them and seemingly the one with the most academic potential and yet you feel the most sorry for in the life he leads inside the school walls. He might be the most unfortunate out of the group socially and it's wearing thin on his mental state. He too turns in a brilliantly quiet performance. This might have been the performance of teen queen Molly Ringwald's career as the snobby, popular, and self obsessed Claire Standish who wants nothing more than to break the mold she has made for herself. She longs to rebel. Ringwald is just amazing in her role. Ally Sheedy is also good as the quiet, disturbed, rather odd Allison Reynolds. Honestly I didn't get or appreciate her character or performance as much as some of the other ones but nonetheless I'm sure others consider her performance brilliant and that's what The Breakfast Club is all about....appealing to everyone in a different way. Regardless the core cast of teens in detention are terrific and their firecracker intensity and chemistry is unmistakable whether fighting like mad dogs with each other or covering for one of the others' mistakes. Paul Gleason turns in a memorable and classic performance as Richard Vernon, the tired, and worn out teacher who is left to watch the Saturday Detention kids. He's harsh and abrasive and downright fed up with kids in general it would seem. Basically he appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. As basically the only adult in the film and the only character outside of the core kids group he does a good job.The Breakfast Club is so incredibly basic. A cast of basically six people, all set in a library and briefly in other sections of the school and yet it's like an hour and a half adventure. They learn so much about each other, and themselves and rebellion and life outside of school and it's all just from being with each other who happen to be polar opposites of each other. It's just brilliant. I have no doubt that sometime in the future...probably soon...The Breakfast Club will be remade and it simply will never capture the original magic because I'm not sure they even knew what they were doing. There is just a certain honesty to the characters, a certain brilliance to it's simplicity. It's not perfect, I mean ultimately it is a 'teen flick' and many adults who didn't see it as a kid won't ever understand it. The film is chock full of gratuitous foul language, sexual references, drug use (by the kids) and yet this is life...this is what is dealt with then and today and probably in the future...this is more reality than it is fiction. At the same time the film is darkly hilarious, has some incredible one liners, and manages some romance which for me is where the film hits a stand still. The brief romance between Ringwald and Nelson is perfect for the film because as he points out to her, making out with him and getting even with her parents ...in that capacity, would be outstanding. It's rebellion not romance. But the sudden and forced romance between Andy (the Jock) and Allison (the outcast) is ridiculous and unnecessary but then again it's a very 'eighties' kind of move. All Allison needs is a make over by the popular girl and the popular jock is all over her...it's a dream come true. I think it clashes with the main message of the film. Nonetheless you can't exist until you've seen The Breakfast Club.

Richard Pryor is just plain not funny and I'm not really sure it was his fault. The story just doesn't seem to provide anything comic for him to do despite his ability to usually provide big laughs. The few laughs that there are come from his partner in the movie, John Candy, but those are even few and far between. The story is a remake of an earlier movie and based on a book about a minor league ball player given an inheritance by his uncle on the condition that he's able to spend 30 million dollars in 30 days and not have one asset to his name after those 30 days are up. Pryor's character is given an out clause and would have received 1 million dollars if he didn't take this challenge. If he takes the challenge and succeeds he gets 300 million, but if he loses he gets nothing. Of course, if he chooses the out option, the movies over -- so he doesn't. What then happens is Pryor's character doing a whirlwind of things to spend his money with an accountant close by to keep track of everything so they know when he's hit the magic number. I don't know what else to say about this movie except that there was no magic. The director, Walter Hill, usually is magic with his hard-hitting style, but this movie is just soft all over. I have no answers and apparently nobody else did as this movie was being made, but it definitely is one of the worst movies with some of the most talented people in the business involved. Nuff said -- I guess everyone is entitled a bad year and this one definitely one for Hill and Pryor.

Requiem for a Dream is just as troubling and carries even more critical acclaim, with its powerhouse image of spiralling drug abuse. Commonly referred to as a drug film, Requiem for a Dream does not take the same path as other drug films, instead it is an entirely different way of looking at a harrowing situation. Adapted from Hubert Selby's novel, Requiem for a Dream focuses on four drug abusers, who are all in some related to one-an-other. The film illustrates their decaying lives rapidly turning into both mental and physical turmoil. While the film's main focus is the affect of drug addiction on a person's mind and body, it is also a film studying other forms of addiction and self-denial.Requiem for a Dream is a film which succeeds in being an excellent anti-drug feature, depicting the utmost devastation of drug abuse. Packed to the brim with some of the most innovative film-making in modern cinema it is impossible to deny the film's audacity and glaringly distinct nature. The kinetic, music-video style editing helps to convey a fractured existence, even though at times it is somewhat indulgently overused. The editing, one of the film's most infamous features is undeniably great and is clearly the film's primary technical achievement. Along with the images of the protagonist's dilated pupils the film feels entirely distorted, which is a magnificent method of creating the surreal environment which the film quite literally imposes upon its viewer. Even with its MTV editing the film still does not feel as though it is trivialising its content. The cinematography of Requiem for a Dream has an almost hypnotic feel behind its fierce, polarising images of self-destruction through deprivation, which I believe suits the mood of the piece. With the addition of its haunting score -which certainly feels relevant to the film's environment- Darren Aronofsky succeeds at crafting a film which goes against the generalised mould.Arguably, the film could be interpreted as nihilistic, however I simply see Requiem for a Dream as attempt to express the lack of hope for the character's addictions, and their denial is evidently making their addictions more dangerous. What is special is how the viewer is able to pity and feel empathy for foolish degenerates who have cast themselves into squalor. The performances are painstakingly heartbreaking and horribly honest. Both actors and actresses display their talent in Requiem for a Dream, particularly that of Ellen Burstyn, who gives a nerve-shattering performance of a women who is both addicted to the ideas of fame (the false American dream, something which the film subtly attacks through the subtext of its script), popularity and weight-slimming drugs which give her a reason to get up in the morning. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and even Marlon Wayans (a surprising casting choice) all give the performances of their careers, which emphasise their talent to perform in extremely challenging, sadomasochistic roles.It is a fact that the film takes too long to achieve saying what it wants to say, as the first 30 minutes pontificates, rather than giving the viewer anything to contemplate. Plus, there are some ludicrous moments, such as the mailing scene with the old ladies, which feels highly inappropriate. Nonetheless, along with Trainspotting (which is irrefutably superior) Requiem for a Dream is one of the best anti-drugs films to be released in modern cinema. It is amazing to think that the first drugs film was the exaggeratedly peculiar Reefer Madness from 1936, which is now considered hysterically stupid. How times have changed, along with cinema because it is quite apparent that Requiem for a Dream is, and never will be, a laughing matter.

It's well paced and constructed (except for the tacked on ending), beautifully shot, and extremely lean and economical. There is a ton of tension and dread to be found in all the usual places, of course, but the director also does a great job of building atmosphere and adding telling details that give the film that extra wallop. To me, the mark of the director and screenwriter's real intelligence and plotting savvy can be found when Neill's character is playing the recorded events on the VCR of the sinking boat. It's a brilliant plot device - it lets us know, without exposition or wasted time exactly what happened previously, while simultaneously building a sense of dread, paranoia, claustrophobia, and madness that prefigures an awful fate for his wife in the present. That's really good film making, IMO. I've never been Kidman's biggest fan (though I admit she has done good work in many films); it's not that she isn't good, it's just that she's overrated (ie, at least a dozen other actresses could have done just as well in films like Moulin Rouge and The Others) . But I liked her a lot in Dead Calm; she essentially carried the film - with able assists from Sam Neill and Billy Zane - quite an accomplishment for any young actress. The only real beef I have with the film is the weak ending, which was obviously tacked on to meet audience expectations of how a terror flick is supposed to end. But in spite of its technical excellence, Dead Calm is a very conventional, conservative suspense film - it plays with the rules extremely well, but it doesn't break or extend the boundaries of the genre, so my feeling is that I can live with the ending if that's what it took for the film to make some money.

The special-effects were pretty good, too, especially for a film that really never got a lot of exposure nor, I assume, had a huge budget. Jeffrey Jones and Eugene Levy, two guys who are usually pretty funny, supply some good humor here, too. I looked at this strictly for laughs even though I know the devil is somebody to take seriously, but this film was anything but played for seriousness. As a bonus, we even got a Chuck Jones cartoon in the middle of the story.This is one wacky movie and I'd like to see it on widescreen DVD. I last saw it on tape.

Originally a teen idol with studio heads grooming him to follow in the footsteps of fellow Brat Packers such as Emilio Estevez or Anthony Michael Hall, Slater has instead floundered in a sea of indecision as to which path he is taking since around the time Pump Up The Volume was released. Films that attempt to state the plight of youths living in the time of production are literally a dime a dozen, those that make this their sole focus even more so. When one looks back on the deluge of films in this mould that were made in the 1980s or 1990s, however, one notices a bit of a commonality between the ones that are remembered today. Classics such as Heathers or Repo Man put a spin so unique on the genre that they become almost a genre onto themselves. Pump Up The Volume, however, has a script not even a hundredth as clever as Heathers, and its artistic sensibility is completely flat when measured alongside the total anarchy of Repo Man.In 1990, the idea that school administrations and staff could be so flagrantly abusive and neglecting of students was literally taboo. Going after a teacher for child abuse was the equivalent of running a four-minute mile. Especially if the needs of the student were not already categorised and defined. Needless to say, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of teenagers from the 1990s are now adults with major psychological difficulties that continue to interfere with their ability to fit into society in a productive manner. I say this not because I wish to highlight that what happens in this film happens in real life with even great outrage. More, it is because I wish to point out that treating the subject in such a shallow and childish fashion tends to do much more harm than good. In the time when this film was released, a popular defence teachers put on when confronted with accusations of mistreatment was that the accuser got this idea from films like this. The problem being that such accusers were often making rock-solid accusations.Another problem that severely discredits Pump Up The Volume involves the hero's taking of calls from listeners. Legitimate radio stations do this all the time, of course, but they also screen callers in order to keep their proverbials covered. A talk show programme, when confronted with a caller asking if they should kill themselves, would contact health services in all haste in order to ensure the caller does not successfully go through with it. Not because they wish to save a life, mind you, but because they want to cover themselves in liability terms. I point this out because when Harry attempts to speak with a suicidal teenager on the subject, just about every move he makes is the wrong one, and the film commits a grievous error in attempting to elicit sympathy for his position after the police begin to pursue him for criminal solicitation. Still, if you are curious to learn why your local radio station will not let you on-air as soon as you call them, this is a good place to look.Some occasional performances stand out and give a platform on which to highlight some serious hypocrisies. After the aforementioned suicide, we are told by one FCC man that unregulated radio would result in programming of the lowest common denominator, the rule of the mob. Even way back when I first saw this film, I stood flabbergasted at how anyone could possibly listen to, or say, something like this and believe it. The difference between what he is describing and what we had then is so non-existent that it would have made this part of the film funny, were the matter not so serious. Sadly, the film never goes beyond scratching the surface of this subject, and a retort from Harry that I would have loved just never comes. Still, if you are looking for reasons why the MP3 explosion of the late 1990s all but killed radio as a place to find new music, then this is a good place. But again, instead of digging a little deeper and really blowing the mind of the audience, Pump Up The Volume gives us a display of fashion victims reciting lines.One area where Pump Up The Volume does stand out is that when it calls for moments in which the kind of music people who have commonality with Harry would want to hear is played, they actually get it right. Classics from The Descendants, Was Not Was, and Bad Brains display just how big a gulf there is between what the youth of Western society listens to or makes, and what mainstream media would have you believe the youth of Western society listens to or makes. That is the sole selling point that Pump Up The Volume possesses in spite of its shallow treatment of what has recently been revealed to be a very deep problem in the age of the Nuclear Family. So you can imagine how much of a conflict exists between the part of me that wants to condemn this film and the part of me that wants to praise it. Sadly, if you have seen Repo Man or Heathers, then you really have no compelling reason to even give Pump Up The Volume a second look. A much better, although much more painfully subtle, examination of how clueless society has become in terms of addressing the needs of those in vulnerable places or transitional phases exists elsewhere.Pump Up The Volume is a five out of ten film. It had such great potential but ends up falling so painfully short. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 June 2007","score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Christian Slater has something of an interesting history in Hollywood. Originally a teen idol with studio heads grooming him to follow in the footsteps of fellow Brat Packers such as Emilio Estevez or Anthony Michael Hall, Slater has instead floundered in a sea of indecision as to which path he is taking since around the time Pump Up The Volume was released. Films that attempt to state the plight of youths living in the time of production are literally a dime a dozen, those that make this their sole focus even more so. When one looks back on the deluge of films in this mould that were made in the 1980s or 1990s, however, one notices a bit of a commonality between the ones that are remembered today. Classics such as Heathers or Repo Man put a spin so unique on the genre that they become almost a genre onto themselves. Pump Up The Volume, however, has a script not even a hundredth as clever as Heathers, and its artistic sensibility is completely flat when measured alongside the total anarchy of Repo Man.In 1990, the idea that school administrations and staff could be so flagrantly abusive and neglecting of students was literally taboo. Going after a teacher for child abuse was the equivalent of running a four-minute mile. Especially if the needs of the student were not already categorised and defined. Needless to say, hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions, of teenagers from the 1990s are now adults with major psychological difficulties that continue to interfere with their ability to fit into society in a productive manner. I say this not because I wish to highlight that what happens in this film happens in real life with even great outrage. More, it is because I wish to point out that treating the subject in such a shallow and childish fashion tends to do much more harm than good. In the time when this film was released, a popular defence teachers put on when confronted with accusations of mistreatment was that the accuser got this idea from films like this. The problem being that such accusers were often making rock-solid accusations.Another problem that severely discredits Pump Up The Volume involves the hero's taking of calls from listeners. Legitimate radio stations do this all the time, of course, but they also screen callers in order to keep their proverbials covered. A talk show programme, when confronted with a caller asking if they should kill themselves, would contact health services in all haste in order to ensure the caller does not successfully go through with it. Not because they wish to save a life, mind you, but because they want to cover themselves in liability terms. I point this out because when Harry attempts to speak with a suicidal teenager on the subject, just about every move he makes is the wrong one, and the film commits a grievous error in attempting to elicit sympathy for his position after the police begin to pursue him for criminal solicitation. Still, if you are curious to learn why your local radio station will not let you on-air as soon as you call them, this is a good place to look.Some occasional performances stand out and give a platform on which to highlight some serious hypocrisies. After the aforementioned suicide, we are told by one FCC man that unregulated radio would result in programming of the lowest common denominator, the rule of the mob. Even way back when I first saw this film, I stood flabbergasted at how anyone could possibly listen to, or say, something like this and believe it. The difference between what he is describing and what we had then is so non-existent that it would have made this part of the film funny, were the matter not so serious. Sadly, the film never goes beyond scratching the surface of this subject, and a retort from Harry that I would have loved just never comes.

The film is uniformly and off-puttingly low-lit throughout, presumably a directorial decision but possibly the failure of sufficient electricity or sunlight to reach a positively medieval Keighley.Generally speaking, the decision to cast Josh Hartnett was so ill-advised that watching his performance in this film, and hearing his lamentable Dick-Van-Dyke-style attempts to mimic a Northern accent, is almost enough to cast a shadow over his other work (which has generally been of a high standard).Alan Rickman has no more excuse for his mocked-up accent which is ridiculously exaggerated and spoken with a clichéd hairdresser lisp, the combined effect of which will leave anyone from West Yorkshire either laughing out loud for the full running time or feeling somewhat insulted that this debacle was ever put onto film.Differing opinions over the casting aside, it is unlikely that many will find this movie very funny. This seems absolutely reprehensible in a would-be comedy. Love or hate Beaufoy, 'The Full Monty' was a genuinely funny film with a good selection of big-laughs. However, Blow Dry's humour, where it exists, is facile and normally pokes fun at the supposed oddities of working-class culture. Opportunities for humour are overshadowed by the frequent lurches into confrontational and embittered 'realistic' scenes which play out like poorly scripted 'Eastenders' exchanges.The half-baked hair Dressing theme is actually more-or-less incidental to the contorted but occasionally well-worked plot of former lovers, professional rivalry and long-lost childhood friends, and is nothing like as interesting as the strip-club milieu of The Full Monty. It could, one suspects, easily have been exchanged for countless others without rupturing the proceedings too much. The actual 'competition' scenes are a chore to sit through, consisting of the usual hastily-assembled montage sequences focusing on only one or two competitors. Rickman's credentials as a hairdresser seem less convincing than his accent, if that is possible.Amidst the usual cohort of British actors is Rachel Leigh Cook, who looks quite appropriately lost in the movie, probably wondering, like most of the audience, how Hartnett and she became embroiled in all of this. The only scene of any significant originality in the movie, in fact, is that in which Cook chooses to cut off all of her hair to escape from the whole competition circuit - again quite uncannily mirroring audience psychology.In retrospect, it can be seen that the late 90s and early 00s saw a glut of these 'provincial' comedies that were set in deliberate opposition to the London of Richard Curtis' 'Four Weddings' universe. This had a polarising effect so that mainstream British films, and especially comedies, were either set in working-class locations akin to Royston Vasey or else in an unreal city of Whitehall and Anglo-American relationships. Some such productions, like 'The Full Monty' or 'Brassed Off', were good films, others, like this one or something like 'The One and Only' (which was little more than a promotional film for the North East) were terrible. British comedies have become more sophisticated in recent years, and are no longer satisfied with such stereotypes.
