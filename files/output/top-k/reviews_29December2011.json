[{"date":"29 December 2011","score":"","review":" Run Lola Run could easily have been a complete boring mess, given to the wrong writer or director, but here it takes an interesting concept and runs with it (sorry just had to fit that one in there). Run Lola Run actually turned out to be quite a marvel. It's something completely new and different and unlike anything I've ever seen before. Just in case you didn't know, Run Lola Run is essentially 20 minutes played again 3 times, only slightly different things happen which lead to 3 very similar, yet very different outcomes. It's a really original and interesting idea and Run Lola Run just about pulls it off!The directing is fabulous. It's fast paced with lots of quick cutting and wonderful editing that really captures the rush these characters are going through (well, just Lola really) it's something I've only really seen in Requiem For A Dream where the editing is so brave and frantic, only here it's used for very different reasons. Let's just say thanks to the unusual editing and directing, Run Lola Run never gets boring.The screenplay is very solid and focused, if not a bit far-fetched, would bumping into a woman really mean that she'd end up kidnapping her baby but not bumping into her cause her to win the lottery? No. But this doesn't really matter, the whole point of Run Lola Run is to give you a fin and entertaining experience and it certainly succeeds in doing that. Each scenario has edge-of-your seat moments and should maybe have your heart racing if you're unfit.The music sometimes feels more like a trashy German pop video (which comes as an extra on the DVD wahay!) but luckily for me I quite like that, but it might bug some people. The acting is quite good as well, the poor woman who played Lola must've had a hard time running all that time and having not to appear too much out of breath, I know I would'nt be able to do it.All in all, Run Lola Run is a fun and unusual experience. This type of edgy film-making is very rare and it's obvious to me why this is such a cult classic. It's a little masterpiece that offers more than most big budget American productions. Get a few friends round, open a bottle of Cava and watch Run Lola Run. It's a short, swift thrill ride and you'll be doing the most exercise without ever leaving your seat.

Since then, I've seen him in several films. Some good and some bad! I had no idea he was in 'Jeepers Creepers' so I was pleasantly surprised to see him in an early role as the lead. The film I had avoided for various reasons- particularly because it looked like a cheesy horror movie.Well, it is pretty cheesy. A brother and sister are chased by this Creeper creature for their body parts which are unknown to them which one he is exactly after. Then the plot is slightly propelled by a psychic who feebly attempts to steer them out of harm's way. Plus the duo must run every time they hear the song Jeepers Creepers. Yep, it's fairly cheesy. The Creeper itself looked menacingly enough, but its' motivations seemed a little trite to me.Justin Long is a star for a reason, and it's the acting that he brings that makes this film endurable. Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) and Justin work well together and have some decent banter at the beginning! The overall dialogue was pretty good, but the plot was very flimsy! For instance, Long convincing Gina to return to the potential body-dumping ground was just unrealistic, and simply a plot-device! As well as the use of a psychic from out-of-nowhere, and the legend behind the Creeper's cycle. It just didn't work for me.Some of the cinematography is good! And Victor Salva directs this film reasonably well, displaying the landscape and isolation of the American countryside! I waited for rental 10 years after the film was released; just out of curiosity, and besides seeing Justin Long in an earlier movie, it really wasn't worth the wait! **Â½ out of *****!

Lorenzo Shakes Carcaterra,Thomas Tommy Marcano, Michael Sullivan , and John Reilly are four childhood friends who grew up in Hell's Kitchen, New York City in the mid-1960s. During this time, the local priest, Father Bobby, plays a very important part in their lives and keeps an eye on them. However, early on they start running small errands for a local gangster, King Benny.On a summer day in 1967, their lives take a sharp turn when they almost kill a man after pulling a prank on a hot dog vendor. As punishment, they are all sentenced to serve time at the Wilkinson Home for Boys in upstate New York. There, the boys are systematically beaten, abused, and raped by guards Sean Nokes, Henry Addison, Adam Styler, and Ralph Ferguson. These traumatic events change the boys and their friendship forever.Fourteen years later, John and Tommy, now gangsters, find Sean Nokes in a Hell's Kitchen pub. After reintroducing themselves to Nokes, they both shoot him dead in front of several witnesses. Mike, now an assistant District Attorney, arranges to be assigned to the case, secretly intending to botch the prosecution to use it as a means of getting revenge. Moreover, he and Shakes begin forging a plan to get their revenge on all the guards who abused them. Together with many of their lifelong friends, especially Carol, a social worker, and King Benny, they manage to carry out their revenge using information on all the Wilkinson guards compiled by Mike previously. They hire Danny Snyder, a washed-up, alcoholic lawyer, to defend John and Tommy to make it seem as if the case is hopeless, allowing them to carry out their plan without being watched.However, to clinch the case they need a key witness who can give John and Tommy an alibi. Shakes has a long talk with Father Bobby, and tells him about the abuse they suffered at Wilkinson. After a few days of soul-searching, Father Bobby agrees to lie on the stand about where John and Tommy were on the night of the shooting; the priest swears under oath that they were with him at Madison Square Garden at a New York Knicks basketball game. As a result, they are acquitted, and another one of the guards, Ralph Ferguson, exposes himself and Nokes as abusers when called as a character witness in court. The remaining guards are also punished for their crimes one, Henry Addison, is killed by the drug gang run by the older brother of Rizzo, a boy killed years before in the Wilkinson Home; the other, Adam Styler, a corrupt policeman accused of extorting and killing a drug dealer, is exposed and arrested. After the case is over, Mike quits his job as an attorney and moves to the English countryside where he becomes a carpenter; John drinks himself to death and Tommy is eventually murdered, both within a few years of the acquittal.It is a powerful story of child abuse.Boasting a glorious multi- generational cast, Levinson's tale of sexual abuse and revenge is just a compelling picture despite the fact that there is a lack of dramatic energy as it relies too much on voice-over narration and conventional courtroom procedures.It was skillfully crafted by Levinson which makes it eminently watchable,absorbing and deeply emotional.Although there are questions about the plausibility of the story,the film nevertheless remains entertaining and satisfying.
