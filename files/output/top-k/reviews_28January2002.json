I must admit that at first I thought it was corny, with the illness and the wedding, etc., but I wanted to get the whole story and read the book (a very good and quick read).  After reading the book you really get a better idea about the movie and realize that it is not a typical teen movie.  The story isn't about a puppy-love crush or the big dance.  Admittedly it shares many themes with other terrible teen movies, but that does not link these movies into some cheap genre.  Many of the adaptations for the screen hurt the story, and in that sense help to justify many of the negative reviews.  The best adaptation, and one that I feel really makes this a good movie, is the time frame for the two main characters to fall in love.  The book offers a very real sense of urgency, which is expected because Jamie is going to die very soon.  What happens in only a matter of months in the book translates very well into the time frame of less than two hour movie.  It didn't feel forced or choppy to me, but something that could be completely natural.A word about the acting.  I think that Mandy Moore could have a very promising career as an actor.  After reading the book I think she played the role of Jamie perfectly.  She portrayed that sense of endless exuberance and faith very well.  I also think that Shane West did a fairly good job.  In watching him perform, he seemed portray well the way a guy would act in certain situations, e.g. with his buddies, with Mandy and her father, etc. He acted in a way a real person would act in the same situations, which to me is most important.Bottom line, with this movie and with any movie, if you can take something good out of it, then it was worth it.  A good movie is one that can personally get you involved in it.  Too many people go into a movie with the task of only trying to recognize and point out its faults without actually just watching it.  There are too many cynics out there who can't wait to dump a movie into the teeny-bopper genre just because its actors happen to be teenagers.  Save your reviews for Britney's movie Crossroads.

One might find that they have a lot in common (made upon a best-sold book, full of fantasy and magic, tell about a fight good vs. evil), but yet they are very different. The principal point of difference is the way the authors of the respective books worked on them and what they meant to say.

It also seems to me that writing Harry Potter was more about money-making than a good-book-writing. So, it was quite difficult to make a movie better than a book and it remained on the same or even lower level because of closely following the book's plot.As for The Lord of The Rings, the book itself was great, which allowed to make the movie the same or almost as brilliant.  Sure, the movie had not to follow the book completely (otherwise we could have got something similar to Harry Potter), but I have to admit, that because of inevitable omission of certain parts of the book (otherwise the movie would be too long) one gets the impression of seeing the separate but consequent scenes. To tell the truth, I doubt if it's for the better or for the worse, I'd prefer to leave it just as an observation.In the very end of the movie I was somewhat disappointed by music. The flute melody which started in the final scene reminded too much that of Titanic (and it was the scene with the boat!). Howard Shore should have noticed what his melody was like.In overall, I give it 9 of 10, because if you give all 10, you don't leave any reserve for a bit better movie to see, which might be the case with the parts 2 and 3.

One might find that they have a lot in common (made upon a best-sold book, full of fantasy and magic, tell about a fight good vs. evil), but yet they are very different. The principal point of difference is the way the authors of the respective books worked on them and what they meant to say. To my mind, Tolkien developed the world of Middle-Earth (including the characters and their psychological profiles) much deeper than Rowling did that with Hogwarts and the characters therein. It also seems to me that writing Harry Potter was more about money-making than a good-book-writing.

In fact, the blue box that was open with the blue key was found in the theater call Silencio. That theater was Hollywood, but it was also the place to open up Diane reality, so her shaking. Silencio in Spanish means silence. Then, Hollywood is not only asking for silence to its own tricks, but also for silence to its own decadent reality. But, of course, that is David Lynch opinion.The real mystery of today's world is based on the opposite, namely, giving away a lot, making yourself so transparent that people might not have time to see clearly too much, even because too much is never enough. I actually believe that Hollywood is just that. The more you show the more elusive and path-opener things turn. It is not about getting confuse or silencing, but about a heavy traffic-jam of exposure in its countless variety. So, you can always have the chance of taking Noah Ark to enjoy the flooding in a journey in which you can only get lost if you stop rowing for good. That was Diane case.

It is a great work on dreams and a great subtle and playful accord of sounds, time and camera movements. I have read great deal of reviews going on and on about the nonsense or absence of a real plot. I just came back from the movie and of course the film made me think, but never crossed my mind that the plot was actually nonsense nor that much complicated. The film is an intellectual game of symbols and what there is behind them. I don't think it would be hard to decipher all of them if the film is watched for a second time. That film is a great work on mental masochism and it is full of fanciful tricks for the movie connoisseur.I will explain the way I saw it.--------SPOILER---------Maybe I might also need a bullet shoot in my head to see what was going on, because the only thing that seemed real was Diane shooting herself, even when I knew that reality began when Rita open the blue box and turned into Camilla. From that event to the bullet shot everything was real; the rest was Diane dreaming being Betty. So the film really began with Diane at the limousine, knowing that Camilla was getting married, shutting herself in her room, dreaming the inverted story and killing herself out of frustration.That was the chronological order. Lynch, however, put Diane dream first, but the key to the blue box brought back reality.The mystery of the film is based on the fact of not giving away too much and I don't think the director will either if interviewed.

When i then heard thet it was Peter Jackson that was to direct my worries grew. Even though he has made some quite good movies lately (the Frightners, Heavenly Creatures) He also has made Braindead and Bad Taste. Even though i liked those movies i didnt realy feel he was the man for the job.(Some minor spoilers below) After have seen the movie three times i can say that my worries where uncalled for, the movie is truly a amazing epic adventure.I will start with the actors. All main characters do a good job. Sean Been is perfect as Boromir and i like his character a lot more than the boromir from the books. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf no doubt, he was probably born for this part, at first i was dissapointed that Sean Connory didnt get the part but after having seen McKellen in action i can say that he couldnt have made a better job. Ian Holm is wounderfull as Bilbo, Viggo Mortensen is just as i have imagined Aragorn, Ellijha Wood is good but a litle too young i think. The other Hobbits where good. Legolas and Gimli where good. Sean Been and Ian McKellen both deserves an oscar for there preformance.The scenery was truly amazing and breathtaking, New Zeeland was the perfect choice. The score is one of the best music scores i have heard, Howard Shore truly deserves an Oscar for this masterpiece.Ok now for the spoiler parts. Some things have been changed and i really dont like all of them. The nazguls are a little too violent for my taste. The part where they without any aperent reason kills a man and when they ride down the gates of bree, i thought where a little unnececery.The wizard battle was a lot better than i had thought, i had  a nightmare scenario when Gandalf and Saruman where hurling balls of fire on each other. But i found this battle of the mind terrific.I actually thought the Arwen thing was quite good, that glorfindel was replaced didnt matter at all for me (and it was one name less for the audience) and that arwen where there made sence.

I would have wanted more from Rivendell but hopfully we will get a lot of deleted scenes on the DVD. (Peters first cut was 4,5 hours instead of the 3 we have seen, and he has said that they will be on the DVD) Moria was absolutly breathtaking.Lorien was the first down in the movie. Too much was cut and psycho galadriel was just silly. Please tone down the Special effects there untill the DVD if possible. The tempting of Gandalf in Bag end was much much better.The final scenes where good, and the tempting, fall and redemption of Boromir where much better than in the book.This is truly a masterpice and a modern epic, By far the best fantasy movie and this years best movie. Actully the best movie i have seen in the last years.If this movie dont even get nominated for best picture and Ian for best actor i will lose the last respect for the Academy awards. i lost most of it when Gladiator won last year.

Even though i liked those movies i didnt realy feel he was the man for the job.(Some minor spoilers below) After have seen the movie three times i can say that my worries where uncalled for, the movie is truly a amazing epic adventure.I will start with the actors. All main characters do a good job. Sean Been is perfect as Boromir and i like his character a lot more than the boromir from the books. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf no doubt, he was probably born for this part, at first i was dissapointed that Sean Connory didnt get the part but after having seen McKellen in action i can say that he couldnt have made a better job. Ian Holm is wounderfull as Bilbo, Viggo Mortensen is just as i have imagined Aragorn, Ellijha Wood is good but a litle too young i think. The other Hobbits where good. Legolas and Gimli where good. Sean Been and Ian McKellen both deserves an oscar for there preformance.The scenery was truly amazing and breathtaking, New Zeeland was the perfect choice.

All I knew was, that he is a wizard who goes to a wizard school and has adventures there. I picked that much up from the hype that has become Harry Potter since the first book was published.On to the movie. I must say that despite the many followers of the Harry Potter hype, including the millions that have read the book or seen the film, I kept sceptical about whether I'd like this film. I mean I am almost 21 years old, so maybe it would be too childish for me, who knows? But it was not. It was just as childish as I like it. Christopher Columbus has really outdone himself here. I mean he's made a couple of good films, but this comeback (after the pretty solid Stepmom and the box &#150; office loser Bicentennial Man) really makes this effort stand out so much more.It is however not only Chris Columbus' quality that made this film what it is. Much of the praise has to go to the writer Mrs. Rowling and to the actors and actresses. I could go on and on about the fact that every actor was good, but what really was astonishing in my mind is, that all children actors and actresses were so good. I mean they were GREAT. They are in my mind even better than the grown ups, because this movie is about the kids, not the adults. The four main &#145;wannabe' wizards, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Draco Malfoy (who does not only have a name that reminds one of Count Dracula, but looks like a version of him as well), all give you the feeling that many things are yet to come and that many things will happen between them. I mean I am no psychic, but I'd say that someday that little count Dracula will become Harry Potter's opponent and that maybe one day (if they get old enough in the stories) Mrs. Granger and Mr. Potter might become more than friends although I'm not sure of that. Maybe I've just seen the Star Wars films too often. If I have, it does not matter anyway, for the cast and crew of this film have watched them too often as well. One part of the music clearly is like Star Wars, there is a hat with a Yoda &#150; like speech pattern plus the teachers want to keep Harry Potter away from &#145;the dark side of the force, oh sorry MAGIC!' Come on!!! They've seen Star Wars and learned from it! Not that it bothers me, on the contrary! I am quite pleased to see that people are able to see and pick out something good and insert it into their own work either as an homage or simply because it appeals to them.There were few things bad in this film. Actually it was only one thing. SPECIAL EFFECTS. Where the heck did Warner Bros. get those guys? I mean one time they create world class effects and then the next you can easily spot the blue screen from miles! It was not as bad that it ruined my experience of the film, but be honest, in a film of this magnitude, you can expect good Effects throughout (see The Lord of The Rings The fellowship of the Ring or Artificial Intelligence). The effects really were a let down for me at times, but maybe they just overdid it. There were times, in my opinion, that a blue screen would not have even been necessary. Those were also some of the times you could tell the landscape was projected onto a blue screen. Better luck next time.After the huge success of this film (and even if the success had been more moderate) there will be a number of sequels. Actually two more films are already planned (set for release in 2002 and 2004) and it is believed, that if Mrs. Rowling writes all seven books (as she intended to do), there will be seven films made in total. There are a few things I would like to say to Warner Bros. in regard to those films. First of all, make sure that you will have all original actors necessary for the sequels under contract and if not so persuade them with lots of money. Do not, I repeat DO NOT hire other actors to play characters already portrayed by someone else. Second, hold on to your screenwriter. He has been successful so far in doing what he does. Third, hold on to the man that composed the music. In a franchise you want to keep the music the same throughout all films. If possible even to make the music so memorable, that it makes people say &#145;That the music from Harry Potter.' Fourth and last, hold on to your director (at least for the next one or two sequels, preferably for all if he is up to it).  He has worked with all those kids before and knows how to talk to them and how to make them perform well. Plus this is not some Mission Impossible or James Bond like franchise in which you want every movie to stand on his own. It is supposed to be more of an Indiana Jones kind of franchise. If you do, however change your director, may I suggest that you do is as George Lucas did with the original Star Wars trilogy. Get basically unknown directors, who know their way around a studio and get them to make the film, how you want it to be done. Approaching a director switch like that, will allow all films to fit into the big picture, without inconsistent film styles ruining it.A good film for the whole family, but just as The Lord of the Rings The fellowship of the Ring, it falls short to be best film of the year.8,25 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 January 2002","score":"","review":"  First of all I feel obligated to tell all of you, that I'd never read a book or even heard something of Harry Potter, before I went to see this film.

In 26 years he produced 37 plays, three epic poems, and all those sonnets, on top of which he was an actor and prosperous businessman.  I would be hard put to type everything he wrote in those years using a quill pen and pot of ink.  The haste sometimes shows.  His plots are often weak and derivative and suffer excessively from what Ebert calls the idiot plot syndrome, in which characters do the stupidest things just to keep the story hopping.  When King Lear asks his daughters how much they love him, Cordelia's one-sentence answer is misunderstood and sets the whole tragedy in motion, though the problem could be solved with a few additional words.  Whole chunks of dialogue in Julius Caeser are shamelessly ripped off from Plutarch.  But the poetry is a different matter, resonant, finely constructed, and sometimes ethereal.  Well, this movie is, in short, the story of how WS came to write Romeo and Juliet, chiefly it seems by integrating bits of his personal life into the mosaic of the play.  He overhears someone on the street yelling, A plague on both your houses, and so on.  And the movie is filled with amusing anachronistic expressions.  Actors say break a leg to one another, and they say things like boobies and dip your wick and we'll be put in the clink.  It's not jarring because none of this fairy tale is supposed to be realistic.  Basically there are two ways a movie about a period classic can go.  (1) There is the elegant way.  Everyone wears immaculate clothes and speaks a sort of perfumed English; vide Olivier.  (2)  There is the dirty way, the route this movie takes, in which characters may be sweaty and vulgar, get into slapstick brawls in the mud, use barely interpretable dialects, and bump into things.  The actors here do a nice job along their naturalistic way.  The dialogue is written in such a way as to suggest the author just finished reading the bard's collected works in one sitting.  WS is clean cut and handsome, though he has inky fingernails.  Paltrow, as Viola, uses an irreproachable English accent and impresses with her lanky body and her sharply boned, slightly asymmetrical face, although she too must brush her teeth and spit.  One also looks forward to the appearance of even the most minor supporting players.  And Judy Dench as QE I is a standout, coiffed like an escapee from Coppola's Dracula.If there is a problem it's that it helps to understand the film if you are a fan of Shakespeare.  I don't mean that you necessarily like the film more, just that you understand it better.  Then you know why Marlowe is such a pain as far as WS is concerned, and why Burbage makes such a stir when he enters the theater for the first time, and why the rival theatrical troupes enact so realistically the Donnybrook between the Capulet and the Montague boys.  I could tell there were a lot of allusions that were getting past me.  No matter.  There is verisimilitude enough that you finish viewing the film a more educated person than before.What a place Elizabethan London must have been if you could somehow set aside the plague, the smallpox, the outhouses, the poverty and starvation and odor and other such quibbles.  Along these streets, at the same time, strode people like Queen Elizabeth, Condell, Burbage, Thomas Kyd, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake, Frobisher -- every English-speaking person who was anybody at the time, it seems.

(2)  There is the dirty way, the route this movie takes, in which characters may be sweaty and vulgar, get into slapstick brawls in the mud, use barely interpretable dialects, and bump into things.  The actors here do a nice job along their naturalistic way.  The dialogue is written in such a way as to suggest the author just finished reading the bard's collected works in one sitting.  WS is clean cut and handsome, though he has inky fingernails.  Paltrow, as Viola, uses an irreproachable English accent and impresses with her lanky body and her sharply boned, slightly asymmetrical face, although she too must brush her teeth and spit.  One also looks forward to the appearance of even the most minor supporting players.  And Judy Dench as QE I is a standout, coiffed like an escapee from Coppola's Dracula.If there is a problem it's that it helps to understand the film if you are a fan of Shakespeare.  I don't mean that you necessarily like the film more, just that you understand it better.  Then you know why Marlowe is such a pain as far as WS is concerned, and why Burbage makes such a stir when he enters the theater for the first time, and why the rival theatrical troupes enact so realistically the Donnybrook between the Capulet and the Montague boys.  I could tell there were a lot of allusions that were getting past me.  No matter.  There is verisimilitude enough that you finish viewing the film a more educated person than before.What a place Elizabethan London must have been if you could somehow set aside the plague, the smallpox, the outhouses, the poverty and starvation and odor and other such quibbles.  Along these streets, at the same time, strode people like Queen Elizabeth, Condell, Burbage, Thomas Kyd, Marlowe, Sir Francis Drake, Frobisher -- every English-speaking person who was anybody at the time, it seems.  This film, a mixture of fact and plausible fantasy, is pretty enjoyable.

Akiva Goldsman's excellent screenplay brings out the humanity in mathematics and those of us who pursue its riches and secrets.  As a mathematician myself, I was impressed, not so much by the glimpses of mathematics this film gives the viewer, but in the way the academic culture at the very highest levels is recreated.  Things have not changed that much from John Nash's early days at Princeton to the present time at any major university.But, like Good Will Hunting, this movie ultimately is about much more than mathematics.  The story of John Nash, his brilliance and madness, brought back many memories for me personally.  The consuming fire that goes with mathematical research is wonderfully depicted here.  His illness, paranoid schizophrenia, is so well portrayed by Russell Crowe, that I found myself thinking about my best friend who was driven to suicide by his manic-depressive illness.  I marvel that Dr. Nash's wife endured all the years of loneliness and emotional deprivation, but I understand because I went through much the same myself as my best friend struggled and ultimately lost his own battle.I am not a fan of Ron Howard's films.  They tend to overdramatize the emotional side of any situation he examines, and there are times I think he stoops to cheap sensationalism in order to make a point.  I did not get that impression with this film, however.  Akiva Goldsman's script and Russell Crowe's acting combine to lead the viewer into the wild labyrinth of an unbalanced, albeit brilliant, mind without resorting to cheap tricks to keep the viewer engaged.  The supporting cast sparkles as they make the viewer truly see what Dr. Nash sees, and without their performances, this movie would have been a colossal failure.  This movie is a real keeper.  It will stand up to multiple viewings, and I have recommended it to everyone I know. I can't wait for the DVD to be released, for I will certainly add it to my own collection.

There is a certain kinetic feeling when you see a film, one way or another.  You can see a picture and walk out of it and it will stay with you for days after you leave the theater.  It's brilliance keeps you talking about it and you can't recommend it enough to those that ask your opinion about the latest film you have seen.  Then there is the opposite end of the spectrum, and that is when you know about half-way through the film that you are going to absolutely detest what is on screen.  This is the type of picture that has you checking your watch and shifting in your seat every five minutes.  Unfortunately, this has been what we have been tacitly subjected to over the last few years.  The years 2000 and 2001 have not been years Hollywood can be proud of.  It is quite disturbing that each and every year that passes, Hollywood claims it made more than the previous year.  The bucks keep rolling in which means that the public is paying for the mundane offerings that film makers are marketing for us.  It's strange though, as I said, a film will usually make you feel something one way or another.  And then there is the film The Majestic.  This is a film that made me feel... well it kept me.... okay it was just so.....it was just so..... ah hell, let's be honest, it was just so nebulous and full of the blahs.  I don't know how else to put it.  The Majestic just made me feel nothing.  Nothing at all.  I didn't enjoy the film nor was I particularly angered with it.  I wasn't enlightened by it but it tried its damndest to put me to sleep.  It is just a film that seems to prod along until the end and then it ends.  There is no big revelation, there is no big secret, there is really nothing to get excited about in any way.  I am not sure what the producers of this film were thinking when they green lighted it, but they made a mistake.This is a story about a screenwriter who is blacklisted in Hollywood and decides to take a drive and crashes into the water and turns up in a town with no memory of who he is.  Here he of course meets the fluffy old town folk that welcome him with open arms and do their best to convince him that he is some long lost dead soldier who must have developed amnesia for the last decade.  Here he meets his dad and old girlfriend and then he resurrects an old movie theater and then people find out that he is not really who they think he is and then he has to go back to Hollywood to testify and he becomes a man by telling the truth and not copping out and he makes all the fluffy townsfolk really really proud of him and then he goes back and the entire town is waiting for him and blah blah blah blah blah blah de blah de de de de blah de blah.  So what?  What does all of this mean?  What is the point of it all?  Other reviewers and critics will tell you that this film shows the golden age of movies and draw parallels with Carrey's character and the Majestic, the theater he is trying to refurnish.  I don't buy any of it.  This is a film that may as well be the 600th episode in a T.V show that has been around for 100 episodes too long.  It just doesn't mean anything.  The movie is like one big run on sentence.  Try and figure out what is going to happen three or four scenes later and I'll bet you nine times out of ten that you are right.  And guess how it ends.  Go on, don't be shy, I know it's tough now, but give it a shot.The Majestic is a lazy, fat ass dog, napping under a tree on a scorching summer day.  It doesn't move, it doesn't wake up and if you took a quick glance at it, you would wonder if it were really breathing or not.
