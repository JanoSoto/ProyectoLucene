Although this film never makes any explicit reference of these events, or indeed, any obvious effort to pin the drama to more recognisable or topical concerns, there are still definite elements that suggest these themes in a way that both enriches and adds context to the drama, without ever turning it into a work of agitprop or political polemic. Instead, the themes are used merely to enrich the story and give a sub textual sense of scope and urgency to the plight of our central character, as he attempts, against all odds, to solve the mystery and clear his name.As you can imagine, the film offers a number of scenes of clearly wrought tension and a continually twisting narrative that throws a number of last minute surprises without ever losing sight of the central themes or the plight of the central character. Hitchcock's direction is as fine as you would expect, with the film filled with the usual dark and iconic images, and those wild, over-the-top set pieces; the most famous of which takes place on a giant recreation of the Stature of Liberty and is devoid of any over-score. Although the pace may be considered a little slow for some tastes, the film, for me, is pure entertainment, and certainly rewards repeated viewings with its enthralling plot, likable characters and bold strokes of direction.Although you could probably argue that it lacks the finesse of the previous Rebecca (1940) or the subsequent Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Saboteur (1942) remains one of Hitchcock's most entertaining thrillers; a deft blending of serial adventure and pure pulp fiction, and a definite early precursor to the more successful likes of North by Northwest (1959).

Ryan) has to release him. Grudgingly Ranken does but then sets out to have Manny killed as a sign of his power & authority over his prisoners. After nearly being killed in an attack Manny decides to break out with help from fellow inmate Buck (Eric Roberts), after trudging their way through the sewer system they board a train at a rail depot. At first they think they are on the way to freedom but up front the driver has had a heart attack & died, the throttle is stuck on open & the out of control unmanned train roars along the tracks heading straight for disaster...This American Israeli co-production was directed by Andrei Konchalovsky & was produced by the infamous founders of Cannon & Israeli cousins Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus but I was prepared to give Runaway Train the benefit of the doubt, I am glad I did because while Runaway Train isn't as good as a lot of the glowing IMDb user comments might suggest it's still a fine film. The script by Edward Bunker, Djordje Milicevic & Paul Zindel has a neat premise about an out of control train & feels like a forerunner to Speed (1994) which is about an out of control bus, however while two escaped convicts find themselves on an out of control train but this isn't the action packed thriller that it's plot synopsis or close resemblance to Speed might suggest, no this is a much more character driven film than it would first appear. In fact once Manny & Buck board the train that's where they stay for the rest of the films duration as they generally argue, soul search, blame each other, make guesses, talk about nothing in particular & get to know each other. There are a few things I wasn't too keen on though, for a start some of the characterisations were a little erratic like the way Manny spends the entire film trying to escape, get away & save his own skin but suddenly at the end he decides to become some sort of marter which just comes out of the blue. Then there's Ranken the Warden, the entire film he goes on about killing Manny but then says he can't die because it will cause a riot in his prison but then seems to change his mind yet again at the end & try's to shoot him, if Manny ends up dead he ends up dead no matter how he was killed so what's the difference? Then there's the really frustrating & ambiguous ending which left the film feeling very unfinished & unsatisfactory after I had invested nearly two hours of my life watching it. It's not a bad film by any means, it has some great dialogue, before it starts to contradict itself some of the characterisation had been top drawer & the storyline is quite exciting & gripping but the pace is often slow, it's a little bit repetitive & looking back after watching it I didn't think that much actually happened.Director Konchalovsky does a decent job here, the film is set in the snowy Alaskan wilderness & there's a real sense of bleak isolation. Like a lot of these out of control vehicle films there are endless shots of the train speeding along the track that all look virtually identical, in fact if you were to edit all of these shots out the film would probably be a good twenty five minutes shorter. Runaway Train can be quite a brutal film at times with stabbings & a fair amount of blood. I am not convinced that a train such as this wouldn't have had some sort of remote safety feature just in case such a scenario as in the film happened. Also the film is full of rather large & improbable coincidences, Manny & Buck sure break out of prison easy, then they find a train, then the driver just happens to drop down dead, the brakes just happen to burn off & there just happens to be a female engineer on board when there's not supposed to be one.Technically the film is very good, it's certainly well made with good effects & production design. Japanese director Akira Kurosawa co-wrote the original screenplay & had planned to direct it himself in Upstate New York but the snowstorms were so bad the plan was abandoned. Helicopter pilot Richard Holley was killed in a helicopter crash during filming. The acting is generally superb with Voight on top form while Rebecca De Mornay replaced Karen Allen.Runaway Train is a good solid thriller with great performances & a good storyline which I have to say I thought was somewhat wasted. Most of the comments on the IMDb seem to read so much into so little, maybe we watched different films I don't know but while Runaway Train is good I didn't think it was great.

Upset & worried Alex reassures Annie & then says he has two tickets for a cruise to the Caribbean on board the Seabourn Legend (the TV edit strangely changes the name to the S.S. Legend) where he intends to propose, excited Annie agrees to go on the cruise. However disaster strikes when a bitter computer programmer named John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) decides to hijack the Seabourn using his expert knowledge of the ship's computer systems in order to steal millions of dollars worth of diamonds & then crash it into a huge oil tanker to cover his tracks, that is unless Annie & Alex can stop him...Co-produced & directed by Jan de Bont this was the mega budget sequel to the smash hit action flick Speed which has become regarded as one of the finest action films from the 90's, a general opinion with which I am in agreement with. However conversely Speed 2 Cruise Control has become regarded as one of the very worst action films of the 90's, a general opinion that I am not in agreement with. OK sure Speed 2 Cruise Control isn't any sort of masterpiece or even a good example of the action genre but I thought it was alright & the current IMDb user rating of 3.3 really is too low. The script Randall McCormick & Jeff Nathanson feels like a cross between The Poseidon Adventure (1972) & Die Hard (1988) & was in fact originally intended as the third Die Hard film but luckily the producers of that franchise saw that the script didn't work & went with something else, I suppose with this script lying around Fox decided to turn it into a sequel to Speed but Keanu Reeves didn't want to come back so the main character had to be rewritten & the whole dynamic & familiarity between Reeves & Bullock that could have been explored here is missing. Reeves was replaced by Jason Patric who is a really bland & forgettable actor & the fact that his role is so badly written doesn't help, this is the occasion when we need a Sylvester Stallone or a Bruce Willis or a Keanu Reeves or someone who has on screen presence as an action hero because Patric doesn't have any. The story feels half hearted as well, ironically for a film called Speed it's strangely slow going & lethargic. In the original Speed the action was none stop here it's extremely sporadic & forgettable. I didn't like the villain that much either, he was just one guy, he never kills anyone & he even stops the boat so all the passengers can get off! What kind of a bad guy is that? Having said that he was played by the always watchable Willem Dafoe which helps.Director Jan de Bont turns in a good looking film for sure but the action scenes drag, there's very little threat or menace & there's some irritating comedy relief too. Then there's the subplot about the deaf girl that goes nowhere, the silly scene where Dafoe places leeches on his body & some even sillier scenes bookending the film showing Annie having a driving test. The sequence at the end where the Seabourn crashes into St. Martin & destroys half the town looks visually impressive but isn't exciting in the slightest. The original Speed had an out of control bus careering through Los Angeles while this has a cruise liner sailing through the open sea, the energy & high octane action of the original just isn't here. Also being a PG-13 the violence is really toned down, there's hardly any fights, I can't remember anyone being killed & the language is also squeaky clean which is not what most of us expect from our big budget action flicks.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 Speed 2 Cruise Control should have been better, sure it's well made with that big budget Hollywood polish but it's so lethargic & pedestrian. In an interview Sandra Bullock described Speed 2 Cruise Control as 'the biggest piece of crap ever made', Gary Oldman turned down the role of the villain to do Air Force One (1997) instead (good choice) while Jason Patric has not got a leading role in a Hollywood film since. According to the credits the band UB40 are in here somewhere.Speed 2 Cruise Control (wouldn't it have been great if this had stared Tom Cruise?

Reeves was replaced by Jason Patric who is a really bland & forgettable actor & the fact that his role is so badly written doesn't help, this is the occasion when we need a Sylvester Stallone or a Bruce Willis or a Keanu Reeves or someone who has on screen presence as an action hero because Patric doesn't have any. The story feels half hearted as well, ironically for a film called Speed it's strangely slow going & lethargic. In the original Speed the action was none stop here it's extremely sporadic & forgettable. I didn't like the villain that much either, he was just one guy, he never kills anyone & he even stops the boat so all the passengers can get off! What kind of a bad guy is that? Having said that he was played by the always watchable Willem Dafoe which helps.Director Jan de Bont turns in a good looking film for sure but the action scenes drag, there's very little threat or menace & there's some irritating comedy relief too. Then there's the subplot about the deaf girl that goes nowhere, the silly scene where Dafoe places leeches on his body & some even sillier scenes bookending the film showing Annie having a driving test. The sequence at the end where the Seabourn crashes into St. Martin & destroys half the town looks visually impressive but isn't exciting in the slightest. The original Speed had an out of control bus careering through Los Angeles while this has a cruise liner sailing through the open sea, the energy & high octane action of the original just isn't here. Also being a PG-13 the violence is really toned down, there's hardly any fights, I can't remember anyone being killed & the language is also squeaky clean which is not what most of us expect from our big budget action flicks.With a supposed budget of about $110,000,000 Speed 2 Cruise Control should have been better, sure it's well made with that big budget Hollywood polish but it's so lethargic & pedestrian. In an interview Sandra Bullock described Speed 2 Cruise Control as 'the biggest piece of crap ever made', Gary Oldman turned down the role of the villain to do Air Force One (1997) instead (good choice) while Jason Patric has not got a leading role in a Hollywood film since. According to the credits the band UB40 are in here somewhere.Speed 2 Cruise Control (wouldn't it have been great if this had stared Tom Cruise? You know, because of the title...) is nowhere near as good as the original Speed but isn't as bad as many make out, it passes the time & there are a few big budget spectacular set-piece sequences that are pretty to look at. If you want to see a proper action film set on a big boat watch the Steven Seagal flick Under Siege (1992) instead.

I had never heard of it when a friend popped it into the video player one Sunday afternoon; when I asked what it was about, all he'd say was, just watch. I could see why when it was done. An explanation of the plot does absolutely no good in terms of describing what the movie is like. It's Billy Bob Thornton's creation; he wrote it, directed it, and stars in it. It's not a comedy, though I would say it has more laugh-out-loud moments than most films intended to be funny. It's not a murder mystery or crime thriller, but there are elements of both in it. And it's not a straightforward drama or tragedy and yet 'Sling Blade' packs the same kind of wallop as if it were. Karl Childers, the mentally retarded man portrayed by Thornton, has been compared to Forrest Gump and that's an easy comparison to make. They are both immensely likable and full of homespun common sense that belies their supposed lack of intelligence. But Karl carries with him some dark and terrible secrets. He is a man who committed murder and doesn't understand why circumstances forced him to do so. He accepts that he is guilty of the crimes and carries with him a naive belief and hope that if he lives the rest of his life in a good way, people won't hold that against him. He doesn't hold a grudge against the people, including his mother and father, who took advantage of his nature and in effect had him take the fall for one of them, though he certainly has every right to. Karl is eventually released from the mental hospital and ends up living with a widow, Linda (Natalie Canerday) and her young son Frank (Lucas Black). Karl and the boy strike up a rapport; Frank sees the slow but sincere Karl as a vast improvement over his mother's current boyfriend, the cruel and profane Doyle (Dwight Yoakam). Along the way he also meets Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), a gay friend of Linda's. The performances are uniformly fine; Lucas Black is yet another gifted child actor for whom acting seems to come as second nature. He is absolutely believable throughout, particularly in one scene when he goes off on Doyle, displaying a young boy's protectiveness of his mother, not to mention sheer fury. But the real revelation here is Dwight Yoakam, in an astonishing performance as the abusive boyfriend Doyle. Yoakam has this guy nailed to a T. Everyone has known someone like Doyle at some point in their lives. He is callous, hateful, self-pitying, and downright obnoxious. If you've ever wondered about a woman friend of yours and thought, why on earth does she go out with that guy?, chances are he's a variation on Doyle. There is one scene which pretty much sums up his character; it is both tasteless and hilarious, as he 'apologizes' to Vaughan, Karl and Frank for his behavior by explaining that he doesn't like fags, retards, or kids. His ultimate comeuppance at the hands of Karl is truly justice delayed but not denied. 'Sling Blade' is the kind of movie where it's not so important what happens as the way it happens. Much of Karl's dialogue has entered the public lexicon, from mmm hmmm to his constant yearning for french fried puhtaters.

Otherwise, I would have watched the original film first. What convinced me to watch this one was the cast that included three super-talented actors and the director Christopher Nolan ('loved his 'Memento'). Thus, my comment is pretty much just about the movie rather than how it compares to the original.There's really a lot to like about. This isn't merely a 'catch-the-bad-guy' thriller but a character driven psychological drama. It starts as a who done it, then turns into a how done it to why done it to what are you going to do about it. While it is the complex characters that stand out, the details of the murder case(s) are very well presented and the layered twists add well to the plot. 'Insomnia' is fascinating to look at. The production design is of very high quality and the cinematography is breathtaking. The attention to detail and the emphasis of the visuals that make the viewer experience Dormer's sleep deprived world is stunning. Incidentally, I was watching it very late at night and perhaps that is the best time to watch it.Nolan's style of execution is remarkable. Daylight is used very effectively as a character of its own. In a way, it's the antagonist of the movie that leads to Dormer's mental 'deterioration'. It's a dark movie set in constant daylight. Then there's the clever use of fog and floating logs which in a way act as pathetic fallacies. Blood also plays a symbolic role. The quietness of a cold and gloomy Alaska is both intense and chilling.Al Pacino proves again what an excellent actor he is. It's amazing how he eerily looks the part with bags under his eyes, a clumsy gait, stooped shoulders and a continuous expression of fatigue while he dives into the depth of an extremely complex character. Robin Williams skillfully downplays his part as the latently manipulative Finch as he takes advantage of Dormer's vulnerability. Hillary Swank brings an air of freshness as the rookie detective who also has to make a difficult decision towards the end. Maura Tierney makes very good use of her few scenes.On the flip side, it may seem as though 'Insomnia' loses focus in some scenes as it appears to derail. Of course there are different ways of looking at this. The ending feels rushed and is very predictable. Also Williams's Finch could have been more developed considering the important role he has. Nonetheless, it's a well-made film.

In a way, it's the antagonist of the movie that leads to Dormer's mental 'deterioration'. It's a dark movie set in constant daylight. Then there's the clever use of fog and floating logs which in a way act as pathetic fallacies. Blood also plays a symbolic role. The quietness of a cold and gloomy Alaska is both intense and chilling.Al Pacino proves again what an excellent actor he is. It's amazing how he eerily looks the part with bags under his eyes, a clumsy gait, stooped shoulders and a continuous expression of fatigue while he dives into the depth of an extremely complex character. Robin Williams skillfully downplays his part as the latently manipulative Finch as he takes advantage of Dormer's vulnerability. Hillary Swank brings an air of freshness as the rookie detective who also has to make a difficult decision towards the end. Maura Tierney makes very good use of her few scenes.On the flip side, it may seem as though 'Insomnia' loses focus in some scenes as it appears to derail. Of course there are different ways of looking at this. The ending feels rushed and is very predictable. Also Williams's Finch could have been more developed considering the important role he has. Nonetheless, it's a well-made film. I intend to watch the Norwegian version to see how it compares but on its own, Nolan's 'Insomnia' is a fascinating experience and the cast and crew deserve all the praise for finally putting it all together.

Red tape and pensions be damned, poof! the firefighter is now a policeman again, and for some reason insists that his artist friend who, in an unlikely blending of talents, is also a computer geek becomes a policeman too and he brings his parrot to the precinct, but does the profiler jump right on the case? Does he tell his brother that he's been following the case all these months and has some interesting theories about it? Noooo, he spends precious time trying to get his brother's wife, for whom he has been carrying a torch all this time, back into bed by cooking her a dinner consisting of weird foods because if she eats the food that means she still loves him. But she doesn't like the dinner so the profiler takes the mayor's daughter to bed instead, after he meets her at an ice skating rink about 20 minutes after her best friend's (who was the latest victim of the serial killer) funeral. Why she is at an ice skating rink is a mystery, but I suppose different people handle grief in different ways.Are all the other cops working overtime trying to find the killer? Nooo, the only other cops we see in the precinct are two young kids and they're in no hurry to do much of anything, and when the killer is finally found and they're asked to send backup to the scene they don't move much faster. And when we finally get a brief glimpse of the killer he's in blackface and wearing a fright wig, looking like a minstrel Harpo Marx; now there's a surefire way not to bring attention to yourself when you're skulking through an apartment building. Or maybe the killer was just trying to look like the mayor, who also had a funky hairdo.The profiler takes about a day to figure out the serial killer's M.O., so if he had been called in after, say, the SECOND murder instead of a year later, a lot more lives might have been saved. The police commissioner might have been the dirty cop after all, I'm not quite sure, and in the end the profiler, who has been lusting after his brother's wife for all this time, suddenly decides he doesn't care about her at all.This is all happening in Hazzard County, and the characters are named Bo and Luke, right? Nope, it's New York City and this is supposedly serious business.If, as some other reviewers have mentioned, this movie was more about the quirkiness of the profiler character, or about his relationships with the two women, my thought is that the writers would have been better off to have used a non-violent jewel thief as the focus of the police investigation because strangling women is just too serious a topic to take this lightly.Kevin Kline, as the profiler, alternates between being serious about his job and playing it for laughs he rescues a child from a burning building, gives her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then asks nobody in particular if they can bring him a coffee, preferably an espresso. Harvey Keitel, as the police commissioner, spends the entire film looking embarrassed, and Rod Steiger, the mayor, tries too hard to work cusswords into his every conversation.Susan Sarandon, the adulterous wife\/spurned lover, goes from being a woman who still has soft feelings for Kline to being a bitchy gossip-monger who delights in telling the mayor that his daughter is sleeping with Kline. Alan Rickman's throwaway artist\/computer geek character is apparently included only to supply an excuse for having a nude model, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the 23-year-old mayor's daughter who still lives with her father and seems not to have a job because she's always at Kline's apartment.As for the title, January Man, it doesn't make sense. The killer has had a victim in every month, so why not call him the June Man or the November Man? He uses a blue ribbon to strangle all his victims, so why hasn't he already been nicknamed the Blue Ribbon Killer? And why bother to name the film after the killer anyway, since that whole part of the storyline is more of an afterthought than a driving force? This might have been a fun film when it came out in 1989 but in light of all that has happened since then and how much we now know about serial killers it is embarrassing to watch today. If you're a Kevin Kline fan you might enjoy it for his performance, as silly as it is, but Harvey Keitel fans should rent Smoke instead.

Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more then ten to twenty million killed, tops. Depending on the breaks. is said by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott). Turgidson says this to President Muffley (Peter Sellers- in his first of three supporting roles) in the War Room as Gen. Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has gone psychotic and ordered 34 planes to Nuke Russia (U.S.S.R) because he thinks the commies are trying to spoil their precious bodily fluids. He says the meaning is water, but the low angle shots, almost as if the camera is in Hayden's lap, of Ripper sucking on a large cigar only scream of something more than just bodily water. I don't know what to make of that. As Turgidson debriefs the President, some of the best scenes of the film are shot in this one room- the War Room and let's be perfectly clear, there's no fighting in the war room. Turgidson informs the President that Gen. Jack Ripper has complete control and has shut off all communications to the base and the secret code, that only he knows, that can get in contact with the planes pilots have no contact with anyone. So, the President has no way of stopping the planes from dropping the bomb because Ripper has shut off all communications- sounds like some of the stories you hear from the 60s. This leads to a great, one-sided, phone call to the head of Soviet Premier, Dmitri, that might leave younger audiences thinking this is some kind of impersonation of President George Bush, but it's not. Peter Sellers best performance of the three roles comes as the President. The scenes between Scott and Sellers are both electric and very funny that hit on all six cylinders. President Muffley informs Dmitri that he's very sorry that 34 planes are on their way to drop a bomb that will ruin the entire civilization in the USSR, so he orders his own plans to be shot down and assists in the attack giving it the okay. Turgidson disagrees with the idea and would love to wipe out the entire Communist regime, but US policy is not to Nuke first. We Nuke second. It's only proper. I'm sorry, too, Dmitri... I'm very sorry... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right. President Muffley sounds very sorry. Quite panicked as well (Not really, which makes it all the more funnier).I thought Sellers gave the best performances as the incredibly off-the-wall, enthusiastic General with more plans on his mind than destroying millions of people- like getting back to Miss Scott, who's in his bedroom on a countdown. Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove is exactly how you think he would look and act. Is it over the top? Yeah, very much so, but his ridiculous quirks and possessed right arm that seems to have a mind of it's own is very funny, especially when you couple that with his survival plan for when the Dooms Day Machine goes off. That's the really big nuke that will kill everybody on the entire planet if the USA pilots reach their targets and in order to save the human race, Dr. Strangelove says all the top generals and leaders of the world will have to live in a coalmine for about 100 years with a 101 ratio of women to men. This perks up the attention of General Turgidson and puts a smile on the face of Dr. Strangelove, even though he has a permanent smile on his face. The best scene in the film may come when the pilot of one of the planes is riding the bomb on it's way down to earth as if he's at a rodeo just living it up. That wonderful bomb has so many great advantages when you really think about it A lot of sex with a lot of different women, you can ride on them like a cowboy, you can eliminate millions of commies&#133; there's just much good that can come of a bomb such as this. The fact that this was made right in the middle of the whole fire storm makes this film even more appreciable, now, more than ever. There are some great performances, good laughs, and a very engrossing look on annihilation and mass destruction as numbers are thrown around like numbers instead of human casualties. Other than the look of the airplanes resembling more paper planes on strings than actual airplanes, there's really not much to dislike. Very rarely do you see a refreshing comedy that was made over 40 years ago, but I've seen just that as Dr. Strangelove has some serious staying power. It's a near-masterpiece. This should be Kubrick's best film, but I certainly see why 2001 may be regarded higher.

That wonderful bomb has so many great advantages when you really think about it A lot of sex with a lot of different women, you can ride on them like a cowboy, you can eliminate millions of commies&#133; there's just much good that can come of a bomb such as this. The fact that this was made right in the middle of the whole fire storm makes this film even more appreciable, now, more than ever. There are some great performances, good laughs, and a very engrossing look on annihilation and mass destruction as numbers are thrown around like numbers instead of human casualties. Other than the look of the airplanes resembling more paper planes on strings than actual airplanes, there's really not much to dislike. Very rarely do you see a refreshing comedy that was made over 40 years ago, but I've seen just that as Dr. Strangelove has some serious staying power. It's a near-masterpiece. This should be Kubrick's best film, but I certainly see why 2001 may be regarded higher.

I have seen a lot of Cary Grant's movies, but none of them prepared me for this dark comedy. Grant is hilarious as the frantic Mortimer Brewster, who finds a body in his aunt's home and tries to get to the bottom of how it got there. There are so many scenes in this film that had me laughing my head off. Much of the credit goes to the actors who all play their parts well, but Frank Capra did a fantastic job with this. A fast pace and great timing and reaction shots made this film that much better. Overall, i would recommend this to nearly everyone. If you don't laugh during this film, I would say that you should check if you still have a pulse.

Stanley Kubrick's best! he takes this movie by the reigns and steers it into the perfect movie. the images in this movie, while not as epic as 2001 a space odyssey, our still certainly incredible! the scene of Alex and his droogs will stay with you for ever! speaking of Alex, Malcom Mcdowell is incredible, he steals the show, the dialog that he speaks is odd and captivating.the music is mesmerizing, its hypnotic, classical music playing opposite such ultra-violence is not the type of music one would first think of for this type of movie. As for the violence, it is not that violent now, in fact it isn't, back then people were over exaggerating! they had grind house movie worse than this all the time! the real main problem is the rape scenes. There is a lot of it, and i can see why people would find it disturbing, but to me, the way they are shot, makes them just one of the things to love about this movie.Most directors give you all the answers, so that you can understand the whole movie the first time you see it.

He is partnered with Andy Garcia, a young detective. Early on they arrest a Japanese gangster they witness murdering other Yakuza members but much to their annoyance are told he is to be extradited to Japan rather than face trial in New York.When they get to Osaka they are met on the plane by a group of local police and hand the prisoner over.

The end up working with local cop Masahiro (played by Ken Takakura) who is less than impressed by Conklin's boorish behaviour.What follows is a tale of strangers in a strange land searching for the man they lost while having no understanding of the language, culture or customs.If you don't have this film already it would be a worthwhile addition to the DVD collection of anybody who likes exciting police thrillers, if like me you own it but haven't watched it many years then dust of the video and watch it again.

Which by the way is a masterpiece..The casting for the movie is flawless..You really feel that they belong in the book..All in all The Godfather won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing (adapted screenplay) (Francis Coppola, Mario Puzo)... The film was nominated for eight additional Academy Awards. Furthermore, it won five Golden Globes, one Grammy, and numerous other awards...My final piece of advice...READ THE BOOK THEN WATCH THE MOVIEIf you really want to enjoy it..

I liked it & would have given it 6\/10 at that time..Three years later I bought the book(accidentally).. Well just for the sake of buying something really wasn't going to read it anyway (so I thought)..A few days later I read a few pages & started loving it..

Not only is it a film that inspired me to become a movie nerd, it is a story that has helped shape portions of my attitude towards life. The message of Hate is Baggage, is something that I think about quite often, and for me, is as a result of watching this movie. The message is legitimized by Derek's story, and the insight the movie provides into the maturity of his psyche. It's simply amazing how the movie show's how easy it is to let little thoughts of hatred you're your brain, and how those thoughts can grow into actions with the help of influential people. Is anything you've done, made your life better? is a powerful question that the movie asks not just Derek, but everyone watching as well. Only a film as good as American History X could pull this question off. The movie creates a character that the audience puts so much emotional baggage into, that they (or at least me) are surprised that their answer is no. In a way, the movie almost makes you believe that Derek's racism is justified, and then smack's you in the face by making you realize how wrong you are. On top of the incredible story, the movie is technically superb. The black and white flashbacks make watching the story easy for anyone. Edward Norton's performance is one that ranks with the best of all time, and the music works well with the emotional response of the audience. 10 out of 10!
