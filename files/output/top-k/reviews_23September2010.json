[{"date":"23 September 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Rounders is directed by John Dahl and written by David Levien & Brian Koppelman. It stars Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen & Martin Landau. Music is by Christopher Young and Jean-Yves Escoffier is the cinematographer on location in New York & New Jersey. Film is based around the underground world of high stakes poker. Plot sees Poker playing law student Mike McDermott (Damon) team up with his Poker playing ex-con best friend Lester Worm Murphy (Norton) to try and raise some serious cash. The cash is needed because Worm has saddled them both with high debts, the sort of debts that can get you killed.In the years since Rounders was released to mixed reviews and a Luke warm box office, Poker has really taken off to become a hugely popular television staple. So it's perhaps no surprise to learn that John Dahl's Poker based movie has gained a cult following. It's also found momentum due to a number of pro Poker players citing it as either the reason they got into Poker playing, or that it's the best Poker movie ever. High praise indeed, then. Yet for someone like me who doesn't play the game, but most assuredly loves a good sports movie, the film has too much wrong with it to deserve such plaudits.First off is Damon, a fine actor, but not in this role. He never once convinces that he needs to play Poker, let alone play himself into a life and death struggle due to his borderline volatile best friend. He looks and seems out of place throughout, his boyish charm undercuts what little tension there actually is. While his relationship with Norton (turning in a good show) is never interesting or spiky enough to form a solid core from which the film can grow. Dahl merely uses their relationship as intermittent fillers as we jump from one Poker table to the next. Cue one moment when Mike's girl (Mol barely getting time to breath let alone act), who shock shock hates cards, leaves him; a period of refection for a moment, a life is cards summary and bingo, lets go play cards! I'd have laughed if it wasn't so insulting.What is totally humorous is Malkovich, who after promising much in the beginning as brooding Russian gangster Teddy KGB, descends into pantomime farce for the supposed nail biting finale. His accent so ludicrous you wonder if you have been whisked into a Hanna-Barbera cartoon whilst you sneaked a peak at your cards. There's also no surprise with the outcome. Poker may be a sport not often filmed on the big screen, but this is a traditional sports movie across the table. Janssen (as yummy as ever) threatens to be a great teasing character but isn't given anything to get her teeth into; which when one considers the director likes his peccadilloes to be film noirish is a surprise. And Landau, too, is given lightweight fluff to work from as a kindly professor type who seems more token than earnest.On the plus side. Escoffier's photography is neat and on the money, particularly for the first quarter as we go into seedy card dens that are dimly lit and tinted by cigar smoke. While Young's score is unobtrusive and deserving of a better film to accompany it. Away from the seemingly always watchable Norton, it's Turturro who comes out the brightest with his non histrionic and believable portrayal of Joey Knish. A sensible and honest character in a film that lacks enough of either of those traits. Utterly predictable and smug into the bargain, Rounders, it seems, is for Poker players only. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 September 2010","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Rounders is directed by John Dahl and written by David Levien & Brian Koppelman.
