I just want to play with their heads.- Andy KaufmanWas Andy Kaufman a brilliant comedian far ahead of his time, or a disgraceful, unfunny, mentally unbalanced individual who had a sick desire to confuse people? This is the topic at the center of Milos Forman's screen biopic, but the movie never really reveals anything remotely interesting - or enlightening - about Kaufman. He's more of an implacable human being after the movie ends than he was before.To be fair, Carrey does a commendable job of portraying Kaufman, the man who was present for the launch of SNL on October 11th, 1975, and was later voted off of the show by callers, after producer Lorne Michaels asked his audience to decide for themselves. What's most bizarre about Kaufman, however, is that he admittedly never actually revealed himself to anyone. He was never in touch with himself, and relied on multiple personalities for amusement. Back then, he was regarded as a different sort of comedic talent, but to be blunt and honest, as much as I love the television show Taxi, I think Kaufman really did have mental problems. As a child he used to stare at his wall, pretend there were cameras and put on shows.This is where the film opens. Then it skips ahead. If there's one movie that needs more flashbacks of childhood, it is Man on the Moon, a film that should have revealed Kaufman's past, rather then present us with a fairly mediocre timeline of events that we're already aware of. What has never been explained is Kaufman's past. Which leads to a startling conclusion, and one that the filmmakers may have stumbled upon (and which may explain the reason some twenty years are cut out of the movie) Kaufman has no past.He's a man who left behind a legacy of mysteries and loose ends that were never settled. Did Kaufman stage his death?To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if he did. It sounds far-fetched, but everything Kaufman did was a hoax, from the David Letterman sequence to the Fridays disaster to showing up on the set of Taxi dressed as Tony Clifton.Lots of people mimic his style, but after a while they usually let up and break character. Andy never broke character. When he was in character, he was in character, and that leads to another interesting possibility that has been oft discussed by his fans Was Andy Kaufman actually a valid persona? Where did this man come from? One day he was a nobody, then he was famous, then soon infamous for his awkward behavior on and off the screen. (During filming of Taxi, his manager found him in the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking fries for people and telling them he was not Andy Kaufman, despite the similarities he was always noted for.) Andy unarguably received pleasure from confusing his audience. He fit into personalities and never let go. Is it too unreasonable to suggest that Andy Kaufman was another persona he created one day? And one he eventually grew tired of and abandoned like he had with so many others? If so, then why would he do this to his family? Why would he not resurface after his adopted daughter traced her origins to Kaufman?We don't know much about Kaufman's parents, and he introduced them only once on David Letterman's shows. To be fair, they could have been paid to pose as parents, and this is exactly the type of bizarre stunt that Kaufman would be capable of pulling. Also, as a child, he reportedly liked to run away and hide and scare his parents into thinking he had gone missing.Man on the Moon tackles none of these subjects. It's a straightforward timeline of Kaufman's life, sloppily constructed and quite poorly directed on the whole. This could have been a controversial, epic biopic, and it also could have been a lot funnier and insightful. Even if Forman and Carrey decided not to delve into any conspiracy theories regarding Kaufman and his origins and his death, it still would have been nice to explore his background more.Was Kaufman an utter nut case or an under appreciated comic genius? We'll probably never truly know. And that's the primary fault of Man on the Moon. By the end of the movie, Kaufman is completely unexplained. We're not able to truly sympathize with him, because the movie portrays him a freak of nature. Kaufman told the press once that he never cracked a single joke. It's true. So was he funny or just a sick, demented human being who liked pulling tricks on people, and possibly pulled a final one before disappearing into the middle of nowhere, leaving behind little traces? Man on the Moon doesn't know, and it doesn't try to offer any clearer resolutions. It's about as muddled and confusing as Kaufman was. And like Kaufman, it doesn't tell us a single joke, which is really a shame.2.5\/5.

Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy this movie but it was just an alright story. One thing that I really did love about it though is that we do have the original cast back and the animation was really lovely. The problem I had though is that at this time we did have the Aladdin animated series, which was awesome to watch, but this felt like a story that they could have just done on the TV show. Aladdin finally gets to meet his father, but of course this wasn't exactly what he was expecting, maybe he was expecting a Ward Cleaver type of guy, but hey, this is Aladdin after all.Aladdin knows his future is being married to Jasmine but can't remember most of his past. But he remembers that his mother died when he was a child and he never knew his father. The oracle, however, reveals that his father is actually still alive. Aladdin chooses his question and asks about his father's whereabouts. The oracle reveals that his father is with the Forty Thieves, trapped in their world. Believing him to be their prisoner, Aladdin tracks them down and stows away into their hideout. He is shocked to find that his father is not their prisoner at all, but their leader Cassim, the King of Thieves. But, family or not, Aladdin has trespassed in their lair and Sa'luk, Cassim's irate right-hand man is eager to have him punished for it. Cassim, however, suggests that Aladdin instead face the Challenge - an initiation ritual - where he must defeat another one of the Forty Thieves and take his place. Sa'luk volunteers to fight Aladdin. The two engage one another in a fierce battle which ends with Sa'luk falling into the ocean. Afterwards, this gains Aladdin a place among the Forty Thieves. Sa'luk however, has survived the fall, and makes his own plans for revenge against both Aladdin and Cassim. Aladdin and Cassim bond, and it is then that Aladdin learns the true motives behind the raid and his father's leave of absence from his family he had discovered evidence of the existence of the Hand of Midas, a powerful artifact that can transform anything it touches into solid gold. Cassim believed that, with the Hand, he could return to his family and give them the life they deserved instead of one living out in the streets, and had instigated the raid so he could capture the oracle's staff so he might question the seer as to the precise whereabouts of the artifact. Only, Aladdin had stopped him. Aladdin convinces Cassim to come back with him to the Palace as his guest and, for a while, he is happy to spend quality time with his son. Cassim meets with Jasmine, Genie and the Sultan, and they immediately take a liking to Aladdin's father. But Cassim may still be up to his old tricks as Aladdin still tries to fill the relationship that he never had with his father.So is Aladdin and the King of Thieves worth the watch? Yeah, I did enjoy this movie over all, it's a lot of fun and it was cool to have Robin Williams bring life back into the genie. The animation was really great and I loved seeing the action sequences between Aladdin and his father. The effects that the animators put into this movie was great and very entertaining. Then on top of that, Aladdin and Jasmine are finally getting married! They invited you to come along as well! Well over all I do recommend that if you're looking for a cute family film, this is a good one, I just preferred Return of Jafar a little more, but it's all good, this was still a worthy sequel and a good finish to the story of Aladdin.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 March 2004","score":"30 out of 32 people found the following review useful","review":" I know that a lot of people had preferred Aladdin and the King of Thieves over The Return of Jafar, but honestly I thought it was a notch lower.

The only thing that put me off was that there was dog fights in it and I don't take kindly to watching animal cruelty in films. I know it's not real but it reminds me that it does happen in some countries and it's just a bit upsetting but I thought to myself 'it's only a movie and I am sure it won't take anything away from it' and thankfully it didn't. I liked the way they put in the beginning of the film reminding us that no animal was hurt during the course of the movie because people don't usually watch the credits at the end unless they really want to because that quote about the animals doesn't really come up till the very last bit of the credits but without it at the beginning then I am sure there would be a lot of very upset people. But back to the film Amores Perros is all about three different stories that come together through a car accident and we see how there lives are before and after the accident. We start off with Octavio who lives at home with his abusing brother, mother and his brother's girlfriend who he has taken a shine to. His brother is always on at him and smacks about his partner which doesn't like but knows he can do nothing about it unless he wants his legs broken. His story begins when his dog kills a champion fighting dog owned by a ruthless gangster of the town.When Octavio realises that he can make some money with his dog fighting so he can escape the slums of Mexico City. But it's not so easy as he wants to take his brother girlfriend and her baby with him but she takes some convincing. The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.The movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. Another good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good.

The other story is to do with Valeria who is happy with her new lover who has just left his wife and kids for her but the terrible accident leaves her wheelchair bound and she loses her grip on wanting to enjoy her life and things start to become hard for her and her lover. But the only thing that is keeping her occupied is the love for her dog who accidentally gets trapped underneath the floor boards. Valeria worries as there are Rats down there and doesn't seem to find a way of getting the dog out and as this happens her conditions worsens with gangrene setting in. The last story is with El Chiro A homeless man with nothing in his life apart from his love for his own pet dogs. He also has a past that is hurting him deep inside as he is not allowed to see his daughter after he walked out on the family but now is ex wife is dead he tries to make up for what he has done with the his daughter but the family do it's best to keep him away and obsolete from her life.The movie is very long and has a lot of unneeded scenes in it. I really wasn't taken in by the story of Valeria as it didn't seem very convincing and doesn't really go anywhere. You think it's just about to get interesting but at the last minute it has gone and it makes you feel whether they could have just cut out the entire screen as she doesn't make a difference. If I had it my own way then I would have kept the whole film focusing on Octavio and his dog Cofi trying their best to gather enough money to get out of there depressing lives and with El Chiro coming in in one or two scenes to make it a lot more interesting. This doesn't make Amores Perros a bad film just not a great one. You will go away thinking it could have been better or you will just plain love it but not watch it again. Its not the sort of film you go back and watch it again and again unless it intrigued you. Another good solid foreign film that didn't hit all the marks but still very good.

The two women have a love affair and decide to steal $2,000,000 that Caesar has in custody before he gives them back to Mafia boss Gino Marzone. Caesar is soon set up in such a way that he's fooled into whose even setting him up. Their plan is working for a while, but soon spirals into blood and disaster, as things start to go wrong and he acts in an unexpected violent way.I am not a fan of The Matrix. Never have, never will be. But I was of the amazing visual effects it had to offer. And that's what drew me to seeing the Wachowski Brother's other movie, their directorial debut, Bound. Bound is different. Bound is bold. Bound is courageous. Bound is one of the best movies of the year. It's not your average movie. It doesn't care who it offends, or who it pleases. Its purpose is simple to entertain the viewer, and this movie is `bound' by nothing to complete its purpose.It starts with Corky locked in a closet, bruised and bloody, tied up. From there, we have a good idea of what has become of their plan. The film then shifts over to when the two women first meet, and then takes off from there when they plan the set-up. So for next two hours, get ready to root for the bad guy.Acting was a major plus to Bound, as I tip my hat to Tilly and Gershon. Both female leads did well, but I just wasn't convinced that they were in love with each other as much as they and the script claimed them to be. This did bother me a little, but it doesn't detract from the fun that is to be had with this film. But the main catch of the film was Joe Pantoliano. This movie wouldn't have been the same if he weren't cast in this. His character is so dangerous and so disturbing that your eyes will become magnetic toward his every move, gesture, and dialogue. Clearly this film is not for everybody, but for those who can stand it, this is a rare treat. Definitely the most unique movie of the year, Bound receives the three and a half star rating.

And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!) or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (What watch?).But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (I was misinformed.) and Claude Rains (I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (Vultures everywhere!) accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the What watch-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, being a German, he would have taken it anyway. His performance is simply criminally overlooked.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes.

The acting (particularly by Hopkins) is superb, and the cinematography and realism are stunning.Unlike some of the previous comments for this film I think it is pretty loyal to the true historical facts of the real mutiny. Alright, there are a few minor changes to fact, but nothing that radically alters the story. Basically Bligh was a very able and fair captain, who was let down by incompetent officers. Bligh was no more a monster than any other Royal Navy captains, the difference was other Royal Navy Captains had able commissioned officers and a squad of marines to back up their authority. Bligh was on his own, because the admiralty insisted on saving money on the bread-fruit expedition by giving Bligh a small ship and no officers. (All the officers on board were non-commissioned warrant officers, who were not employed by the Royal Navy but were in it for their own advancement, Blight was the only Royal Navy officer). This is what ultimately led to the mutiny. Bligh had no one he could rely on to back up his orders from the Admiralty. Bligh was actually an exponent of modern thinking, and treated his men with much more humanity than other Royal Navy Captains. He had learnt his trade from sailing under Captain Cook.I think Hopkins manages to capture this in his performance. Bligh was a professional man, who grew increasingly frustrated by the incompetence and laziness of his officers. Hopkins manages to convey this sense of increasing irritation brilliantly. He felt particularly let down by Fletcher Christian, who was his friend and whom he had personally advanced up the ranks. He expected Fletcher to back up his orders, but Fletcher was more interested in his own pleasure with the Tahitian women.On the journey out the crew were actually very happy and contented, but the trouble began when the crew began to experience the liberties and freedoms of Tahitian life, and they did not want to leave it. Bligh had to force the men to go back to their duty, and instead of having officers to back him up, the officers took the side of the men.I think the script of this film captures the true story quite well. I saw the Clark Gable version of the story many years ago, and the only thing I remember is the portrayal of Bligh as an irrational monster, with none of the reasons behind his anger explained. In this version I feel Hopkins is more like the real Bligh.

The first one of them is, of course, that uncompromising with no breaks, regular dialogue or music island sequence which shows a quite memorable encounter of the hero with the benign indifference of the world. This part of the film, especially the detailed description of the first days on the island highlighting how important our every step or action can - and, probably, should - be, reminds me of 1956 Robert Bresson's A Man Escaped that contains a meticulous report of an escape endeavour undertaken by a French prisoner during WW2.In his usual merciless manner not only Bresson manages in his movie to render extremely important the main character's every single action and movement. He practically makes the audience fulfill them along with him, and thus creates tension beyond conceivable providing us with an actually physical notion of what it takes here to succeed (F.Truffaut called Bresson's movie one of the most accomplished attempts at creating a real time out of an imaginary one).Similarly, Mr. Zemeckis in his one doesn't take the path of least resistance, and instead of just delivering a sympathetic character and emotionally involving situations makes us literally spend some time being encircled by the beautifully ruthless ocean and conjuring a spark out of damp wood (by the way, the French lieutenant's whispered recounting of his actions somehow corresponds to the dialogues with Wilson).And when the man escaped there comes the second device - which, I guess, has surprised, if not disappointed, those viewers who had been expecting a more conventional structure. And which evokes another allusion - this time to the similar structural device used in A. Hitchcock Vertigo. In his masterpiece Hitchcock suddenly reveals the secret somewhat forty minutes before the actual ending and thus elegantly shifts the emphasis. He eliminates the mystery as a driving engine, but significantly amplifies for the viewer the dramatic effect of the heroine's final metamorphosis.Here the escape from the island doesn't triumphantly round off the film either, but opens the third and, in a sense, most dramatic part of it - in which the protagonist goes back to the world that didn't get frozen when he had left it. And this part leads to the resolution that might seem not entirely satisfactory to some viewers, but, in fact, makes a perfect ending for this movie.

Most riders are bunched together for shared protection against the wind, and to keep an eye on their rivals--a group is always more efficient than an individual.  But in moments of confusion, a single rider might just get a jump on the group and, with superhuman effort, beat the odds against going it alone and emerge victorious. In Breaking Away we follow the exploits of four misfits just out of high school who contentedly contemplate a future as dead-enders.  They aren't particularly smart, athletic, or good-looking, and they lack any sense of direction in their lives.  Moreover, as townies, or cutters in a college town, they wear a spell of invisibility in their dealings with the students--the differences are painfully obvious.  When they hang out on campus or lamely try to chat up the co-eds, they might as well be ghosts haunting a town they used to inhabit.  Something happened when they graduated from high school and didn't go on to college  they became cutters, no better than servants, in their own confused eyes.   When we meet Dave Stoller (Dennis Christopher) we think, here's a guy who might be able to break out of his own rut.  He seems to be a kid with a little more on the ball than the others.  But then we see that he's also the most confused--by far.  Dave is wrapped up in a fantasy world where he's an Italian bike racer, a champion of a sport virtually unknown in America at the time.  That Dave's charming misfits of friends take him and his delusions in stride shows us the bond of their friendship and shared misery, and just how far off the map they've all slid.After a chance encounter with a beautiful sorority girl (Robyn Douglass) Dave pretends to be an Italian exchange student in an effort to woo a girl he believes would otherwise be way out of his reach.  He draws on his obsessive knowledge of Italian culture and his own quirky charm to fool the girl into seeing him as someone fresh and new, an outsider, but not a misfit.  The romance seems to be going somewhere, and Dave feels he's finally breaking away.While Dave is conducting his fraudulent personal life he also has an opportunity to race with the Italian bike racers he had worshiped from afar.  It's his chance to get recognition from the masters of the sport.  He may not have much going as a cutter, but he's certain the Italians will see his racing ability and welcome him as one of their own.  But when he shows that he can keep up with them in the race, naively hoping for their approval, they throw him into a ditch.  Dave's fantasy world comes crashing down.When Dave realizes that the Italians will fight to protect their turf just as much as the Americans he resents, his first reaction is to give up--everybody cheats he says resignedly.  And he rejects the friends who had looked to him for something more--his three chums and their own struggles, and the sorority girl, who had seen in him something special.Only Dave can save Dave, but it is his father's hard words that prompt him into action.  To Dave and his friends, a cutter is someone who doesn't measure up to the college kids who are going somewhere in their lives.  They affect being misfits because a misfit is one rung on the ladder above how they see themselves, which is as losers.  But Dave's father points out that cutters were the original stonecutters who built the grand buildings on the campus.  They may not be college-educated, Dave's father says, but to them cutter is a badge of honor for the hard-working men who built something real out of the flat earth.  Dave will never be a cutter, he says, meaning a man of accomplishment, unless he finds something equally real to do with his own life.The Indiana Little 500 is a bike race the university holds that is taken very seriously by the groups that participate.  At the time, it was the largest race in America, and fraternities counted some of the best American bike racers on their squads.  But to Dave and his friends who are invited to race, it is a chance to prove to the students (and themselves) that their lives so far weren't just wasted time.Yes, Dave is a gifted bike racer, but we already knew that.  But the Little 500 (and life) requires that one rely upon not just inner strength, but the creative use of the strengths of others.  It is a team race.  What Dave learns when testing himself against these college students that he never felt would give him the time of day, is that the biggest obstacle to his own success was himself.  Breaking Away  is a rich visual tapestry of life lived outside the spotlight.  The characters are not fancy or sophisticated, and their life goals are simple and well within reach.  It is themselves they struggle with, and their perceptions of themselves.

Story is set in 1955 where a sloppy and dirty private eye named Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is given a call for a job and he heads to a church in Harlem, New York where he meets Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) who gives him $5,000 to try and locate someone named Johnny Favorite. Angel heads to a mental hospital where Favorite was a patient and there he learns that a doctor was given a large sum of money to make it look as though he stayed there longer than he did. The trail leads Angel to Louisiana where he meets Epiphany Proudfoot.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) tells Angel that her mother knew Favorite but now has no information on whether he's alive or not. While in Louisiana some of the people that knew Favorite start to die suddenly and it usually comes after Angel has interviewed them and the local police start to wonder how he is involved. This film is directed by Alan Parker who has such a diversified resume as far as the different types of films he has directed. But two elements in this story are reminiscent of previous efforts by him. The first is the time period (In this case the 50's) and Parker has dealt with period pieces before. And secondly he has made films that showcased the Southern culture and this film does a commendable job of being shot in the humidity of Louisiana. I personally am not as high on this film as others and it's primarily because the script does wander and then lag in the middle as Rourke's investigation goes on without even a hint that he's getting closer to the target. This is a muddled and murky mystery that seems to go on and on but there are some things that raise this film high enough for me to recommend. The set design gives this film such a rich feel for it's time period and the cinematography by Michael Seresin is excellent as he captures the heat and sweat of the Louisiana Bayou. Seresin has shot many of Parker's films and together they certainly have a special relationship that's reflected in their work. But the special thing about this film are the good performances by Rourke and Bonet and they together give one of the steamiest sex scenes in movie history. Parker had to trim it by a few seconds to get the R rating but you can view the original scene now on DVD. Rourke plays one of the sloppiest characters in recent memory and he's always unshaven and dripping from sweat. But with that he still keeps the audience interested in what he is doing during the investigation and Rourke always had good screen charisma. This was Bonet's first big role in a film and she's very good as a sexy young Cajun girl that's involved in black magic. This should have led her to some sort of a film career but it never did which is to bad because she shows so much promise here. This story has many twists and turns and even though it bogs down after a while it's still a well made film that leaves an indelible mark of sorts.

Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his `benefactor' sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all doey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-alec comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these namby-pamby Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.On the face of it, a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative movie-goers, but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully, it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world - indeed, the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon's door, imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first, but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.Portman is truly astonishing - one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny, grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.Aiello and Oldman (at his sadistic, malevolent best) provide predictably excellent support, there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending - heck, there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits - for this (if nothing else) it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"29 March 2004","score":"192 out of 214 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard.

In a bad movie, all of the racist characters would be one dimensional and one hundred percent evil; here, Steiger is allowed to play a prejudiced man who is actually sympathetic and capable of growth (hence the Oscar).  In a great twist, Virgil Tibbs himself is shown to be capable of prejudice, as he pursues Endicott without sufficient evidence.  It's refreshing to see a movie that portrays the entire spectrum of racism, from the crazy extremists (and there are plenty of those on hand here) to the more subtly prejudiced. Mississippi Burning, a weaker effort, is not only more tediously didactic, but also less progressive; that film doesn't feature a protagonist like Virgil Tibbs, and instead focuses on the actions of two white federal agents.  In this case, the old movie really is the better movie; produced at the height of the civil rights struggle, In the Heat of the Night feels more immediate and passionate than preachy films on the subject that were made years later, after the tension had died down.    Some reviewers complain that the mystery segments of the film are confusing, but I follow them without much trouble.  Tibbs does a great Sherlock Holmes routine throughout, as he pieces together the solution based on clues that are also available to viewers.  Sure, the ending is surprising, but it doesn't come entirely out of left field; I actually admire the subtle ways that clues are sewn throughout the film.  If you're not used to mysteries, the barrage of red herrings and dead-end clues might surprise you, but it's pretty standard stuff for the genre.I knew about the classic line They call me Mr. Tibbs! long before I actually saw this movie.  I used to wonder why the line was so famous; it doesn't sound that exciting, does it?  But when I finally heard Poitier say it in context, I asked my brother to pause the tape so I could cheer without missing any of the subsequent dialog.  That's how excited I get during this movie.  The performances are so naturalistic, and the racial conflict so vividly drawn, that I get pulled into the action completely.  Though 1967 was a strong year for films, I still think that the right one got Best Picture, and not just because it was topical; In the Heat of the Night is a well-directed, superb character study, populated by some of the most vivid characters I've ever encountered in a movie.

In a bad movie, all of the racist characters would be one dimensional and one hundred percent evil; here, Steiger is allowed to play a prejudiced man who is actually sympathetic and capable of growth (hence the Oscar).  In a great twist, Virgil Tibbs himself is shown to be capable of prejudice, as he pursues Endicott without sufficient evidence.  It's refreshing to see a movie that portrays the entire spectrum of racism, from the crazy extremists (and there are plenty of those on hand here) to the more subtly prejudiced.

The Watts Riots showed Americans the depressed conditions of the area and led to the initial discussion of a redevelopment effort within the community. Almost 40 years later, little has changed. Unemployment rates are about twice the national average and the underlying issues of social dysfunction remain, seemingly immune to LAPD policing, the War on Drugs, or Habitat for Humanity housing programs. The despair of the inner city ghetto has never been more graphically and realistically presented than in the Hughes Brothers' Menace II Society, a film of raw power film shot in Compton, California one year after the Rodney King incident that triggered the riots of 1992. The film is more of a collection of brutal images than a coherent narrative, an explosive and disturbing picture of a community mired in nihilism and the hopelessness that follows. Containing standout performances from young actors Tyrin Turner, Larenz Tate, and Jada Pinkett, the film's violence is graphic and realistic, avoiding (with some exception) the special effects and highly stylized violence we have come to expect from the genre. Caine (Turner), who narrates the film, is a product of the mean streets and has witnessed violence his whole life. His father, a dope dealer, and his mother, a heroin addict are both dead and Pernell (Glenn Plummer), the man who he turned to for guidance, is in prison. He is forced to live with his religious grandparents and his only adult companion is Pernell's girl Ronnie (Pinkett) and her five-year old son. By the time he is in high school he is already dealing drugs and carrying a weapon. His best friend is a borderline psychotic named O-Dog (Tate), the epitome of inner city youth who have no stake in society, kill without conscience, and whose self-respect is only as strong as the weapon they carry.In the film's opening, a Korean grocer becomes the first target of the pent-up frustration of Caine and O-Dog who kill them in a random, purposeless act after the grocer says that he pities their mother and asks the boys to leave the store. The videotape, retrieved by the killers during their escape, is sickeningly replayed throughout the film by O-Dog as entertainment at parties. The scene underscores the racism directed at Asian storekeepers, also depicted in Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing, and brings to mind the general problem of white storeowners who act as middlemen for corporations unwilling to set up franchises in the inner city. When a new Denny's restaurant opened recently, it was the first restaurant opened in Watts in thirty years.Caine is bright and looking for a way out and we feel sympathy for him without supporting his violent actions and his unwillingness to take responsibility for his life. He is tempted by offers to escape, one with a friend who has become a Muslim and is leaving for Kansas, the other with Ronnie who is moving to Atlanta, but the only world that he is comfortable with consists of drugs, guns, and early death. We want him to get out before it's too late, but we know too well that it is hard to breakthrough the context of his life -- that is no hope and no way out. When he gets a neighborhood girl pregnant and refuses to help, the girl's cousin comes looking for him, leading to a climactic confrontation that leaves us desperate for answers yet unable to see any. Despite its cutesy title, Menace II Society is one powerful mother of a film.

The things which make THE RED SHOES interesting are the same things which make PEEPING TOM interesting Really bright, glossy magazine colors abound in both (and both movies were beginning to fade when I saw them, which is a bit distracting); the world, even in the outdoor shots, seems unusually contained, giving a sense of claustrophobia; and the acting is almost declamatory. Powell, then, is not a realist. I can't say I found much pleasure in either THE RED SHOES or PEEPING TOM, but I'd be lying if I didn't say there is a distinct vision both movies share. This leads me to my point. What bothers many people about PEEPING TOM is not that Powell was not up to his material but that he did not conform to the conventions other directors had established with similar subjects.  In all horror movies there is a moment when the audience wants to scream at the in innocent person walking into a trap. Powell has several such innocents in PEEPING TOM, but they have a fearlessness we reject. It's not that we simply can't believe they're so stupid as to walk into the killer's lair. What audiences can't stand is that at least one of the lone innocents doesn't seem to care if the killer's about to try to kill her. To this I say Michael Powell's movies are like dramas acted by fashion models and they're made for an audience attuned to the runway. Powell wants us to say, 'Interesting movie. Did you see the cut of his blazer?' Claustrophobic though his movies are (at least the two I've seen) there are several doffings of the fashionable cap to other directors. PEEPING TOM bears a definite similarity to Fritz Lang's M. The protagonists are, in fact so similar I can't think Powell didn't ask Carl Boehm to watch M once or twice. The Anna Masey dance is, perhaps, a tribute to the Freed Unit. Why should a movie about a serial killer only make tribute to movies about other serial killers. If Vincente Minnelli had wanted to make a slasher film, this would have been it. Hitchcock, I feel, used the motif of the corpse-laden trunk in FRENZY, which was Hitch's return to London. And the humorous scene where the portly elderly gentleman comes into the shop to buy pornographic pictures seems to me to be a tribute to Hithcock's cameos in his own movies. Watch NORTH BY NORTHWEST, which may feature Hitchcock's lengthiest cameo. He's dressed the same way the man in this scene is.  The truly horrifying scenes are not the ones where the killer films the murders he commits, but the ones of the killer's childhood. I noticed they're the only scenes which seem realistic.
