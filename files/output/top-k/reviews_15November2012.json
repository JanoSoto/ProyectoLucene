It is said, more than one third of his films finally became classics. He was undoubtedly a real master in the field of movie. And the Rear Window, is the brightest pearl on his movie crown.As is well-known, one of the most notable characteristics of this successful film is the shooting angle. Almost everything that happened in the film was presented in the scenery opposite to Jeffries' window, or inside his room. The director told the story just through our hero's eyes.Thereupon, some audiences gave out their criticism. Someone claimed that plenty of contents in this film were dispensable. Hitchcock set several attractive plots to cast a mist before audiences' eyes. But at last, those plots seemed unnecessary. The director should not pay too much attention to what happened on the merchant's neighbors. Also, he cared too much about the interaction between Jeffries and Lisa. He would better have his film focus on the murder.The people who love the film have a different voice. Here is a famous review about Rear Window from a professor of film. 'If you see a movie about murder, you are in first stage; if you see one about peeping, second stage; if you see love, third stage.' In his opinion, the greatest skill of this film is the way Hitchcock expressed his thoughts through the film. He successfully made a large number of different film elements from disorder at the beginning to complete order in the end. Actually, His story is not merely about a murder. He wanted to discuss more.I agree with the professor. From my point of view, Hitchcock is not only a suspense master, but an outstanding psychologist. He always wanted to probe into human nature and people's mentality. In Rear Window, the murder is just the main clue to keep the audiences concentrate. 'The movie combined the introspection and moral criticism of peeping with marriage issues through a theme of murder.' It seems that the director wanted to put more emphasis on Jeffries' peeping, through which Hitchcock also showed us various states of people's living. And mostly, the film discussed the love between the hero and the heroine.In the film, Jeffries and Lisa loved each other deeply, but they had big differences in character. Lisa was a favorite in the field of fashion. She wore all kinds of beautiful clothes showing in front of his boyfriend every day, and kept speaking about the interesting news from the world of fashion. She wanted Jeffries to get a more stable job and marry her, living in a big city calmly and respectably. But Jeffries felt uncomfortable with her desire. He was eager for freedom and adventures. Therefore, a marriage with Lisa seemed constraint to him.Personality conflict is love's enemy. Problems with money or social positions can probably be solved by efforts, but it is hard to force two different people think together.Fortunately, an accident provided a chance for them to get closer. When Lisa found that what Jeffries told her about the merchant was not merely a fuss, she felt really curious and excited, and threw herself into the investigation actively. During the process of solving this case, both of them realized that adventures and challenges could attract not only Jeffries, but also Lisa. It seemed they could possibly be able to live in a same life style in the future.But at the end of the film, when everything had come back to peace, the director presented us a last scene Jeffries, who was still having a rest-cure, dozed off on his bed. On the side sat his girlfriend Lisa, reading books about geography. When she noticed that Jeffries had already fallen to sleep, she put down the book and picked up a fashion magazine. Then she looked much happier than before.Perhaps the director hoped to express an idea dialectical it is good for lovers to try hard to get accustomed to the characteristics of the opposite side and look for interests in common. Hopefully they may finally accept each other to a deeper degree through the changes. But we have to understand and keep in mind that, sometimes, differences are always differences. Real changes are not easy to happen.Hitchcock also extended his discussion from love to marriage. The activities and behaviors of neighbors peeped by Jeffries implied a gradual development of marriage. Ms. Lonely-hearted lived alone and looked extremely unhappy, showing a bad mood of being single; a newly- married couple seemed cheerful so much, closed their window and made love every day; the merchant could not stand his awful marriage any longer, so he killed his wife. People need love. Love turns out to be marriage. Marriage is usually happy at first, but can be a tragedy at last.The neighbors' lives can be projections of Jeffries'. Other people's failures in marriage may deepen his fear of marrying someone else. How would Jeffries think if he could see that the newly-married couple living in the opposite building changed into continuous quarrels and raised the roof at the end of the film?Rear Window has too many topics to talk about. It is impossible to discuss everything that Hitchcock wanted to express in it through one article. But in my eyes, it is a story about love.

There are parts to this film that I really do enjoy, and yet it doesn't really stick out to me as anything other than a clone of other more inspired work. To go back to the time that this film was made, you have to realize that I think it was the first iconic horror sequel John Carpenter had no intention of doing this film, as he felt like he had done everything that he cared to do with the first volume, but he sure didn't mind the royalties, so the film was developed at Universal, where Carpenter would spend a large part of his career in the 80's. The idea of pre-steady cam pov shots that were popular in the first film were maintained with a new sense of gore that had emerged in the genre since the release of the first film. This lead to the original pick for director (IT's Tommy Lee Wallace) leaving the film. Rick Rosenthal, who had the same agent as Carpenter, was brought in. What you end up with is a original script and concept by Carpenter that is now being handed over to a large studio, you still have Akad, an Arab film producer who had released the original that still had rights to the franchise, Rosenthal who would try and put his own stamp on it. While the story line picks up exactly where the first film left off, and it does film in the gap of how we see the story from, but it really greatly deviates from the original and I can't help but wonder if the sequels hurt the legacy of the original. The lighting and camera work in this film remind me a lot of the first film, as their aren't any immediate stylistic deviations in the film, and you never lose the sense that it occurs in middle America, as Loomis is driving around trying to find Michael after he isn't there after being shot seven times by a six shooter. Lauri is taken to the local hospital, and there seems to be two films that are taking place.Loomis, who is looking for clues that takes him to the school where he finds that Lauri Strode is Michael's sister, as well as the Samhain reference on the wall, in what appears to be blood, though it has to be asked whose blood it is as no one has been murdered at the school that I can tell. We also have the fake Michael being killed, which really doesn't serve any part of the story that I can tell other than to mock adults\/law enforcement because we know better than them, but this dynamic doesn't really work for me as Loomis is a very well accepted hero, though the effect of the car crash immediately going into flames is iconic. At the very heart of this film, there are a lot of images that work, and B movie coolness that is inserted without context or consideration for tone, that are added with the Hollywood problem of throwing money at creative issues.This can be seen in the scene with the child who has the razor in his mouth at the hospital. The new older cast seems to be less interested in pretense of innocence resulting in one of my favorite minor characters in the Halloween franchise with Budd, who sings foul songs and seems to only care about sex, not in the childish sense that he is new to girls, but that he still has rules of girls he won't go after, as this is more welcome to the grown up world where sex is a common occurrence. The kills attempt to begin taking center stage as Michael eventually shows up, after a laughable jump out of the shadows first kill. Once we get to the hospital we really begin to see where all the cooks in the kitchen got their say. . Akad didn't like the razor scene so I wonder just what else was cut. I also have to say that the lighting in the hospital is still dark like the other parts of the film, so much so that even the film makers comment on it in the commentary. It is a film that felt a need to change from the original in more elaborate kills that would include an eye puncture and graphic nudity in the hot tub scene, and want to change the scenery without changing it at all. This is the film that Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't do interviews about. The movie where a character slips and falls to his death, or at least seemingly so, while the idea that they needed to include gore almost apologizes for the superior first film The ending of the film, where Michael dies is a great stunt that includes the image of him crying blood from the eye holes of his mask in front of the sister he is trying to kill after she shoots him in the eyes (good shot), punctuated by an incredible fire stunt. It goes into that formulaic concept of killing the horror icon at the end of each installment that would plague later installments of most franchises. Nothing has topped the simplicity of having the killer go through something that should have killed him and him still be out there trying to kill you that the first film left you with, and after seeing the first film, you assume that Michael is going to keep coming until Laurie is dead, which she does eventually die in Halloween 8, but I'm pretty sure our imaginations did a much better job of filling in the details.

His dialog, his acting. Just horrible. And my beef isn't so much with the man himself. Pop culture has torn him up enough as it is. I highly doubt that he had anything to do with the writing of this movie, which is the worst of all. Really though, listen to his dialog! I'm convinced that a rich kid from Beverly Hills could be more street than he attempts to be in this movie. It's so obviously forced and out of touch it isn't funny.

Another annoying thing about this film is that it doesn't really go anywhere until what seems like an hour in. The romantic angle dominates most of the movie, and it appears as if the bad guy\/action angle was just thrown in at the last minute to avoid this being classified as a romantic drama. I just kept sitting there thinking isn't this an action movie as well? When you can't manage to blend all plot elements of a movie together to create a steady and interesting pacing, then your script is a failure.

It doesn't make you feel as if it's really building up to anything without already knowing that the movie contains it.The action scenes themselves just flatly suck.

Give Zack Morris* a even more ridiculous haircut, even cheesier dialog, and you could've fooled me. That's how bad it was. The writing and characters were actually worse than the average episode of that show. This movie is just dreadfully boring. None of the elements are in any way entertaining.*On a funny side note, there was indeed an episode of Saved By the Bell where the entire gang (in a dream sequence) became a famous band.

Arguable the worst movie I've ever seen. Though, my hatred for the absolute atrocity that was Freeway 2 prevents me from putting the undeniable label on it. Really though, this movie is just PAINFUL to watch. Vanilla Ice's dialog in and of itself make it feel that way. But the rest of the movie just adds to it.

Because everything is real here, and it happened in the way it's shown to us. From the baker who got a bit tipsy but who was nevertheless rescued at the end, to the socialite who went back to retrieve her lucky pig that played the maxixe, to the Strauss couple, who preferred to go down with the ship rather than to be separated one from the other.Don't look here for actors, or a director, shooting for an Oscar. Because ANTR is not about being artsy, stagy, but about reproducing to the smallest details the events of the night of April, 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic. And the end result is breathtaking, astounding, as the stated intention of the filmmaker was to put you right there in the midst of events, living them as everyone else aboard the doomed ship. And making sure also that you see exactly what any other person in the same situation would have seen, felt, heard. For that, not only the ship's interior has been faithfully reproduced down to the small designs on the tinted glass on salon doors but also every cast member, extra, is seen performing with just one thing in mind to do exactly what the people they are playing did; and doing it in the same fashion, mood and body language. What all that brings us at the end is the unforgettable experience of seeing it all unfold as if part of the present, through a porthole in the fabric of time. That is why you can watch ANTR many times and it will still look fresh to you.Now, while watching ANTR there was a couple of things that came to my mind, which I had the pleasure later to realize I hadn't been the first one to concoct. Intellectual relief also, as I found the answers I was looking for. See, when Capt. Smith looks at the Californian, even longingly, and calculates that it must not be further than 10 miles, I thought Man, why don't you send a boat with the strongest men on board; what more than a couple of hours could take them to reach it? Not quite so, according to a reviewer here; it would have taken them up to four hours, which would definitively close the matter. But I'm not quite sure that's the end of it, because if they had carried rockets--a boat that can take a load of about 4 ton. could easily withstand the reactive forces of a firing rocket, I guess--and if they fire them at midway, they would have certainly called the attention of the ship's crew, which would have wondered about those rockets taking off from the sea itself. It may seem far fetched, true, but in one of the most recent books on the subject I found something even more strange, and intriguing. In RMS Titanic, by Hugh Brewster (pg. 181) it is said that when Smith sent away lifeboat number 8, he told the sailor in charge, Thomas Jones, to take the people to the nearby ship--the Californian--and come back to pick up more. If that really happened, it would indicate a great degree of mental confusion in him, as what he was asking for was absurd if lifeboat 8 reached the Californian, there was no need for it to come back.The other, more technical point is that I had the nagging suspicion all along that the Titanic could have been saved if the crew had just let the collision happen. That was confirmed to me in the DVD comment. In a head on impact the ship's bow would have been smashed but the most serious damage would have been confined there. As things happen, they did their best to achieve the worst possible outcome presenting the hull's side for the iceberg to rip it apart, while stopping the propellers, which left the rudders without the strong flow of water in which they worked best. One last thing if Smith knew that there were lifeboats for less than a thousand people, but also that help would be arriving in hours, why didn't he put every able man on board to build rafts with all available material&#x97;i.e. wood. It wasn't a far fetched idea after all, in the movie we can even see a sailor fashion a raft with some decks chairs and, according to the DVD comments, it really happened and the man survived. So, my conclusion is that not only Smith but his crew had become so mentally conditioned by their profession that they couldn't act otherwise than by procedure; they were incapable of any improvisation. Just remember the irate steward screaming at the man hacking down a door, that he's damaging company property. I guess that such a mindset spanned all the way up, to Smith himself. Probably a bloke with no experience or knowledge would have improvised in such situation and maybe even come with a few good ideas, but not Smith or his crew. They were too hung up in procedural protocols and navy & company regulations to start thinking out of the box when it was the most needed. In any case, the Titanic story provides an unique case where not only everything that could go wrong went wrong, but also where almost every decision taken was the wrong one.In all, one that you can add to your DVD collection without any fear of second thoughts.

These films cover history from the start of the war (Pearl Harbor), up to the turning points in Europe (Saving Private Ryan) and the Pacific (Flags of Our Fathers). Those who are old enough to see these movies also have been taught in school about the horrors and struggles that American soldiers went through in this time, but not many know what happened for the Russians. If you are curious to see what it was like for the Russians in WW2, or just simply enjoy war movies, then I strongly recommend that you see Enemy at the Gates.The film takes place at the Battle for Stalingrad where the German army is met by the citizens of Stahlingrad who mount a final resistance against the invaders. In the opening scenes, a political officer, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), hides among the dead in a fountain at the square after scrambling for his life. To his surprise, he finds Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) hiding amongst the bodies as well. Vassili quickly makes waste of several Germans as the two of them escape and become best friends. Danilov depicts Vassili to being a war hero through the newspaper as they print stories about Vassili's triumphs as a Russian sniper to inspire their comrades. In turn, the Germans send out their best sharpshooter, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to hunt down Vassili in order to crush the Russian hope. It turns into a showdown between the snipers throughout the movie as the two try to kill each other. Vassili and Danilov both fall in love with the beautiful soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz), but when Danilov becomes jealous of Vassili and Tania; he abandons Vassili in the struggle to defeat Major Konig. The film does a great job of showing how inhumane the Russians were at times along with how terrible the living conditions were for them. In the beginning of the movie, the Russian army launches an all-out attack on the awaiting Germans. It only turns into a massacre as Russian soldiers are shot by the Germans and by their own officers if they attempted to retreat. The special effects and gore in the scene do a great job of showing how awful it was for the soldiers as blood splattered from bullet holes and limbs flew through the air from bombs. Some Russian officers were forced to commit suicide after being out matched by the Germans. It's just so interesting to see what those men and women had to go through just within their own army, not to mention the fact that the Germans were trying to kill as well. In the movie, everyone speaks English in their normal voice and there are no Russian accents. At first people might say that it causes the movie to not be as effective because it's sort of far-fetched that everyone speaks English in Russia. This isn't the case. People don't feel alienated when they watch the movie because everyone in it speaks English and it makes the audience feel like they are a part of the movie which is what the point of the film is. This wouldn't be the same if all the characters had Russian accents. In the end, what you get is a high quality, heart-wrenching film that leaves the viewer feeling all sorts of emotions throughout the movie. It really makes you understand and feel for the sacrifice that those men and women made to counteract German tyranny and it's a good counterpart to the other World War 2 movies because it helps us understand our allies in the war. I believe this movie is comparable to Saving Private Ryan and I would definitely rank it in the Top 5 war movies of all time.

Danilov depicts Vassili to being a war hero through the newspaper as they print stories about Vassili's triumphs as a Russian sniper to inspire their comrades. In turn, the Germans send out their best sharpshooter, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to hunt down Vassili in order to crush the Russian hope. It turns into a showdown between the snipers throughout the movie as the two try to kill each other. Vassili and Danilov both fall in love with the beautiful soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz), but when Danilov becomes jealous of Vassili and Tania; he abandons Vassili in the struggle to defeat Major Konig. The film does a great job of showing how inhumane the Russians were at times along with how terrible the living conditions were for them. In the beginning of the movie, the Russian army launches an all-out attack on the awaiting Germans. It only turns into a massacre as Russian soldiers are shot by the Germans and by their own officers if they attempted to retreat. The special effects and gore in the scene do a great job of showing how awful it was for the soldiers as blood splattered from bullet holes and limbs flew through the air from bombs. Some Russian officers were forced to commit suicide after being out matched by the Germans. It's just so interesting to see what those men and women had to go through just within their own army, not to mention the fact that the Germans were trying to kill as well. In the movie, everyone speaks English in their normal voice and there are no Russian accents. At first people might say that it causes the movie to not be as effective because it's sort of far-fetched that everyone speaks English in Russia. This isn't the case. People don't feel alienated when they watch the movie because everyone in it speaks English and it makes the audience feel like they are a part of the movie which is what the point of the film is. This wouldn't be the same if all the characters had Russian accents. In the end, what you get is a high quality, heart-wrenching film that leaves the viewer feeling all sorts of emotions throughout the movie. It really makes you understand and feel for the sacrifice that those men and women made to counteract German tyranny and it's a good counterpart to the other World War 2 movies because it helps us understand our allies in the war. I believe this movie is comparable to Saving Private Ryan and I would definitely rank it in the Top 5 war movies of all time.

These films cover history from the start of the war (Pearl Harbor), up to the turning points in Europe (Saving Private Ryan) and the Pacific (Flags of Our Fathers). Those who are old enough to see these movies also have been taught in school about the horrors and struggles that American soldiers went through in this time, but not many know what happened for the Russians. If you are curious to see what it was like for the Russians in WW2, or just simply enjoy war movies, then I strongly recommend that you see Enemy at the Gates.The film takes place at the Battle for Stalingrad where the German army is met by the citizens of Stahlingrad who mount a final resistance against the invaders.

The kind where the characters are all self-aware intellectuals but have no problem being dumb as hell anyway. Yeah, the opening sequence is *that* kind of good. But then it all goes pretty much as downhill as it can get from there on....It's sad to say that Brad Dourif may be the highlight of this feature, given that he is only included in one scene, but whatever. The rest of our cast is the typical montage of up-and-coming late teens\/early twenties stars. Jared Leto would of course go on to make great things with 'Requiem For A Dream' two years later, Joshua Jackson has been in a handful of good movies and is recognizable, which is probably a good thing since he is probably the most recognizable face in the whole movie to me. However, Loretta Devine really steals the show here. Forget Rebecca Gayheart and the trying year she had with making not only 'Urban Legend' but appearing in 'Scream 2' also. The ending few minutes are predictable to say the least. But like I said, Loretta Devine makes the whole crap scenario tolerable. The entire movie pays more than enough homage to 'Scream' and gives us an extremely generous helping of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' worship. But, sadly for 'Urban Legend', we've all seen both of those two movies, and Kevin Williamson did it a lot better.

It is personally one of my favorite movies because of the eye-opening story of a couple that unexpectedly falls in love. It has a unique way of not only telling a beautiful love story about how love endures through anything, but also leaving an underlying message to the audience about life, hope, and one's long journey ahead other than love. In A Walk to Remember, a student named Landon Carter is a below average high school student that is going down the wrong path. He is hanging out with the wrong crowd, and participating in events he shouldn't be. The director makes it clear from the beginning that Landon is ultimately displeased with the life he is living, and chooses to take his depression out on other people. After making a wrong decision, Landon is held responsible for committing a crime and is forced to do community service in return, including being a part of the school play. The old-school, conservative, preacher's daughter, Jamie Sullivan, voluntarily participates in the same events Landon does. There is a turning point in the movie when Landon decides to start taking his studies and other activities seriously, so he confides in Jamie for help. Landon starts out making fun of Jamie as usual, and under her request promises her that he will not ever fall in love with her. However, as they begin to spend more time together, Jamie and Landon unexpectedly fall in love with each other. Their love is put to the test when Jamie reveals to Landon that she has cancer. Through the fear and eventual loss of Jamie, Landon is forced to find out if their love can really endure through anything. While Nicholas Sparks is well known for his love stories, I think this is his greatest and most inspirational. While all his movies leave the audience longing for a love like the characters have, A Walk to Remember provides a unique story about something so devastating that has a true impact on such a young couple. For instance, in The Notebook, the characters must conquer their love even though they are separated by distance, however in A Walk to Remember, the audience is able to be more captivated by a young love separated by crippling, life changing effects of a disease called cancer. While the woman in The Notebook does have Alzheimer disease, in A Walk to Remember the audience is able to be more drawn to a love that is forced to conquer with one character left alone due to the other dying from her disease, as compared to in The Notebook where the characters die together, ending their struggle. Because it is expected that one will most likely get sick at an old age, A Walk to Remember arouses one's emotions at a deeper level due to the fact that it is less expected for her to get a disease at such a young age. The couple in The Notebook has had the opportunity to realize their hopes and dreams of a long life lived together, however in A Walk to Remember their journey together is suddenly shortened by her disease. The movie can also be given more credit to its actors actually participating in causing effects to the audience. For instance, Mandy Moore is the star of the movie (Jamie), and her own songs are sung in the movie. By actually showing scenes in which Mandy (Jamie) is singing her music, the audience gains interest. Also, the music that is played all foreshadows the events that are going to happen. For example, in the play when Jamie is singing the song Only Hope, the audience can expect that Jamie and Landon are going to fall in love in that moment. During this moment the camera spins around Jamie's head, showing Landon's confusion of his unexpected feelings for Jamie as he's lost in the song. As he kisses her unexpectedly, the curtain closes, leaving only the portrait of their faces in black with the red curtain in the background. Here, the director emphasizes their sudden love in that moment, making the viewer anticipate what is to come. The director brilliantly foreshadows events that end up being significant to the story. When Jamie first interacts with Landon, she befriends someone she doesn't like, which is number forty two on her list of things to do before she dies. As the movie moves along, we find out that little does Jamie know that Landon is helping her accomplish her list. Also, when Landon first studies with Jamie, he tells her he cant just be her friend, meaning that he doesn't want anyone to know that he would talk to her. The movie then provides an enchanting turn of events when as Landon chases Jamie, he pleads with her that he doesn't just want to be her friend, but wants to be in a relationship with her. As seen, A Walk to Remember displays the common love story where through anything and everything, a love like Landon and Jamie's is able to endure. By displaying the story in a way that everyone can relate to, the director is able to reveal an underlying message through Landon's drastic change in life. The director shows that in life, anything can change in an instant, and it is the people that are willing to keep an open mind that will find their true purpose in life in the end. For Jamie, this was changing Landon's life, and for Landon it ended up being carrying out Jamie's legacy. Through Landon's story, the director shows that anyone can turn their life around in a second and it may just be one person with one gesture that can make that biggest impact on someone's life.

It has deep characters, two breath-taking car chases, and a plot that keeps you guessing right until the end. I am not going to restrict myself here so I shall warn you that if you have not seen the movie read no further. See it first.The movie opens with a description of the Ronin a masterless samurai. The samurai were warriors of feudal Japan that bound themselves to a master. If the master of the samurai were to die then the samurai would become a ronin. A samurai who lost all of his honour would have to commit seboku (sp?), or ritual suicide. Thus we can expect this movie to be about a code of warriors, and people without masters.The cold war is over and many secret agents are now without organisations. The KGB has been disbanded and many CIA agents have been retired. Into the movie come a group of people, hired by a lady, Deirdre, with an Irish accent, to steal a case. Sam (Robert DeNiro) is an American and appears to be ex-CIA, and Vincent(Jean Reno) is French and ex-Euro Intelligence. There is also Spence, an Englishman who claims to have been apart of the SAS, and Gregor, a German, a computer expert and ex-KGB. When Dierdre spoke in an Irish accent, I immediately suspected that this movie was to be tied into the IRA. The IRA is not mentioned until the end, but there seems to be connections through it.It seems that the movie is focused around a case. We never know what is in the case, but we constantly want to know. It is not until the end that we realise that the case was little more than a decoy because the true aim of the movie was for Sam to capture Seamus, who is a radical member of the IRA.We are constantly led to believe one thing, being that Sam is ex-CIA and is only doing this for the money, but a couple of hints are dropped, like when Jean-Piere asks Vincent if he is really ex, and when he seems to have a contact when needed. It is not until the end that our suspicions are proved to be true when he gets into a car and drives off. It is also interesting to note that even though Dierdre has turned on Sam, he gives her the opportunity to escape. This is two-fold. First he likes her, and this is revealed at the end when Sam and Vincent are sitting in the café waiting. Secondly it is a hint that Sam is not after her or the case, but Seamus.Ronin is not afraid to go all of the way. One instance is where they threaten to shoot a major Ice Skating star. Most movies would save her at the last minute, but Ronin does no such thing. Instead they kill her, but this is more to do with Gregor and his Russian contact. In a world where the KGB has dissolved and the former agents now run mafia-like organisations, they begin to operate in a very brutal manner. Gregor knows that he cannot trust his Russian counterparts, and this was shown before when they gave him a case full of blank paper. As such he knows that he cannot trust the Russians and must hold something against them. They call his bluff though because the Russians are ruthless, and what is one ice skater when you are a crime lord. Not only do they let her die, but they don't even hang around. They have the case and that is all that matters.Vincent is a much more interesting character than Sam. Sam does not reveal everything to us, but it is clear that he has a purpose. Jean-Pierre talks to him about Ronin, and Sam listens but does not respond in a way that he would if he does not have a master. He claims that he is a loner, and even thinks about Seboku, but we realise afterwards that this would have never been the case. Sam is CIA and this is the way that he remains. Vincent on the other hand, takes a liking to Sam instantly. Sam is distrustful of most people, but he seems to have a soft spot for Vincent. He reads characters well and he is an excellent bluffer. He knows that he can trust Vincent and this knowledge saves his life a number of times. It seems though that Vincent latches onto Sam because he is somebody whom he can serve. It seems that Sam serves himself, but Vincent has been left in the cold with the collapse of the Soviet Union, so in essence he is the Ronin.The director claims that the title has nothing to do with the movie, but I disagree. I guess he did not want to reveal too much because to do so would give away too much. This is a movie is lots of twists, turns, and betrayals, and to show too much would destroy the integrity of the plot. Instead he gives as much as possible without giving away too much. The one thing that I can talk about (even though I have blown the plot right open already) is the car chase scenes these are the best car chases that I have ever seen, and Triple J agrees with me. The thing that makes these chases terrifying are the narrow streets that the cars literally fly down, and from what the director says, these chase scenes were done as is without any fancy editing that is breath taking because I know that I would have heaps of difficulty traveling at high speeds round such narrow alleys.

It has deep characters, two breath-taking car chases, and a plot that keeps you guessing right until the end. I am not going to restrict myself here so I shall warn you that if you have not seen the movie read no further. See it first.The movie opens with a description of the Ronin a masterless samurai. The samurai were warriors of feudal Japan that bound themselves to a master. If the master of the samurai were to die then the samurai would become a ronin. A samurai who lost all of his honour would have to commit seboku (sp?), or ritual suicide. Thus we can expect this movie to be about a code of warriors, and people without masters.The cold war is over and many secret agents are now without organisations. The KGB has been disbanded and many CIA agents have been retired. Into the movie come a group of people, hired by a lady, Deirdre, with an Irish accent, to steal a case. Sam (Robert DeNiro) is an American and appears to be ex-CIA, and Vincent(Jean Reno) is French and ex-Euro Intelligence. There is also Spence, an Englishman who claims to have been apart of the SAS, and Gregor, a German, a computer expert and ex-KGB. When Dierdre spoke in an Irish accent, I immediately suspected that this movie was to be tied into the IRA. The IRA is not mentioned until the end, but there seems to be connections through it.It seems that the movie is focused around a case. We never know what is in the case, but we constantly want to know. It is not until the end that we realise that the case was little more than a decoy because the true aim of the movie was for Sam to capture Seamus, who is a radical member of the IRA.We are constantly led to believe one thing, being that Sam is ex-CIA and is only doing this for the money, but a couple of hints are dropped, like when Jean-Piere asks Vincent if he is really ex, and when he seems to have a contact when needed. It is not until the end that our suspicions are proved to be true when he gets into a car and drives off. It is also interesting to note that even though Dierdre has turned on Sam, he gives her the opportunity to escape. This is two-fold. First he likes her, and this is revealed at the end when Sam and Vincent are sitting in the café waiting. Secondly it is a hint that Sam is not after her or the case, but Seamus.Ronin is not afraid to go all of the way. One instance is where they threaten to shoot a major Ice Skating star.

John Morris' score, haunting and playful, echoes the seemingly reason-to-be of John Merrick in life suffering and entertaining. John Hurt powerfully communicates the vibrating despair of a trapped soul and if it wasn't for Robert De Niro in Raging Bull, he probably would have deserved the Oscar. And Anthony Hopkins is good as the well meaning, but not without flaws, doctor Treves. There is also something effective in the way Merrick's scariness is asserted, David Lynch waits until almost twenty minutes to reveal his face we see a woman crying in the Carnival, Treves with that deadpan expression and tears coming through his eyes, the iconic mask exuding mysterious breath noises, the shadowy silhouette while he's exhibited to the Medical assembly, and the whole mystery surrounding his look pinnacles with the genuine horrified reaction of Nora, the nurse, a shrill scream, Merrick's first effect on people. At the end, he escapes from his evil master Bytes (Freddie Jones) and is chased in the train station to end up cornered in the toilets, then he finally screams I'm not an animal! I'm a human being! I'm a man! At that point, his character's arc is closed; he went from a horrifying freak to a man who is capable to protest, to proclaim his legitimate right for respect and dignity. This is the true courage of John Merrick, this climactic moment when he confronts, alone, a crowd of so-called civilized people.The entrance of The Elephant Man is a masterpiece of build-up; the climactic cry is his triumph. Yet the evolution between the two moments isn't as fluid as it should be. He goes from a patient who can barely speak to one who recites the Bible quite fluently. Naturally, it would have been infuriating if the doctors never noticed his intelligence, but the moment when Carr-Gomm (John Gielgud) is disappointed by Merrick's aptitudes is immediately followed by the pivotal recitation. It's like Lynch was in an urge to show Merrick's progress. I personally wouldn't have minded if the film was half-an-hour longer for a more realistic evolution. The psalm recitation is rewarded by an immersion in society, during which Merricks prove to be an extremely lovable character, eager to please and impress. There is a childish pride in the way he exhibits the picture of his mother and Hurt is so compelling that you can even feel in his voice, the guilt of not matching his mother's looks. At that part, you can tell that Merrick is still imprisoned in his own perceptions and can't help but see himself as a freak on a reverse way since the irony of his intelligence is that it makes his condition even more intriguing. As Treves said Pray to God he is an idiot But the film unsubtly divides people into two categories those who see the monster and those who see the angel. Regarding the villains, Lynch had the bad taste to trade realism for a sort of Dickens-like atmosphere, which didn't fit Merrick's existential dilemma. I didn't like the party scene because it was cruel but because it was over the top, with the whole kissing, dancing, and alcohol soaking. Now, wasn't the most disturbing part when the guard showed the mirror to Merrick? Hurt's scream was devastating, but it was covered by the noisy ambiance so we didn't have time to grab the true horror of the situation. That moment alone was enough to make the scene painful to watch, Merrick seeing his own face. And it would have made the I'm a man! more significant because he would know he didn't look like a man. But he also spoiled the straight-forward realism of the story with exaggeratedly good characters, like Mrs Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who reads Romeo and Juliet with Merrick and kisses him. Why the rush? Think about it, would she have done that to a 'normal' person? If it was a compassionate kiss, then it's still pity, if it was not, it would have looked more genuine and maybe more sincere if it happened later. If Bancroft was supposed to play a character that would spontaneously kiss a man like Merrick, then she deserved more scenes. It seems like Lynch didn't trust our patience. In a nutshell, it's Merrick, the Elephant Man before, Merrick, the Man after, and in-between, he swings back and forth from excessively good or excessively bad people. Maybe it's to highlight Merrick's tragic condition, to be always seen as a monster, no matter what reactions he inspires, there is always pity. Maybe that's the conflict that tortures Treves when he wonders to which extent he's different from Bytes. By the way, I'm not implying that every supporting character was one-dimensional, Wendy Hiller was terrific as Mrs Mothershead and the funny way she hit the guard on the head. And I thought the standing ovation in the theater damaged the powerful effect of the I'm a man! The same defensive (but courageous) mindset should have made him say something like I want to enjoy the show, what have I ever done to deserve your applause, please stop it. After all, no one deserves praise for suffering, or should be considered as a hero because of a handicap.

At the end, he escapes from his evil master Bytes (Freddie Jones) and is chased in the train station to end up cornered in the toilets, then he finally screams I'm not an animal! I'm a human being!

It's like Lynch was in an urge to show Merrick's progress. I personally wouldn't have minded if the film was half-an-hour longer for a more realistic evolution. The psalm recitation is rewarded by an immersion in society, during which Merricks prove to be an extremely lovable character, eager to please and impress. There is a childish pride in the way he exhibits the picture of his mother and Hurt is so compelling that you can even feel in his voice, the guilt of not matching his mother's looks. At that part, you can tell that Merrick is still imprisoned in his own perceptions and can't help but see himself as a freak on a reverse way since the irony of his intelligence is that it makes his condition even more intriguing. As Treves said Pray to God he is an idiot But the film unsubtly divides people into two categories those who see the monster and those who see the angel. Regarding the villains, Lynch had the bad taste to trade realism for a sort of Dickens-like atmosphere, which didn't fit Merrick's existential dilemma. I didn't like the party scene because it was cruel but because it was over the top, with the whole kissing, dancing, and alcohol soaking. Now, wasn't the most disturbing part when the guard showed the mirror to Merrick? Hurt's scream was devastating, but it was covered by the noisy ambiance so we didn't have time to grab the true horror of the situation. That moment alone was enough to make the scene painful to watch, Merrick seeing his own face. And it would have made the I'm a man! more significant because he would know he didn't look like a man. But he also spoiled the straight-forward realism of the story with exaggeratedly good characters, like Mrs Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who reads Romeo and Juliet with Merrick and kisses him. Why the rush? Think about it, would she have done that to a 'normal' person? If it was a compassionate kiss, then it's still pity, if it was not, it would have looked more genuine and maybe more sincere if it happened later. If Bancroft was supposed to play a character that would spontaneously kiss a man like Merrick, then she deserved more scenes. It seems like Lynch didn't trust our patience. In a nutshell, it's Merrick, the Elephant Man before, Merrick, the Man after, and in-between, he swings back and forth from excessively good or excessively bad people. Maybe it's to highlight Merrick's tragic condition, to be always seen as a monster, no matter what reactions he inspires, there is always pity. Maybe that's the conflict that tortures Treves when he wonders to which extent he's different from Bytes. By the way, I'm not implying that every supporting character was one-dimensional, Wendy Hiller was terrific as Mrs Mothershead and the funny way she hit the guard on the head.

The film centers on Finch's two youngest children over a years time as they learn some hard truths about life in the South through their lawyer father. I've heard a few naysayers call this film too cute and too sentimental for its own good but I really couldn't disagree more. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, some people tend to forget, is told through the eyes of the children and its basically one woman's look back at her childhood so the sentimental aspect was certainly needed. I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said about this film but it's certainly one of the greatest ever made and contains some downright magical moments that still work after fifty-years. Of course there's the major view at the racial tensions of the trial that Atticus is involved in and I think this entire sequence has some of the most brutal and dramatic moments that you'll see from any movie. The heartbreaking climax to this portion of the film just grows darker with what follows but then we have a rather remarkable and uplifting ending that speaks so much. Peck rightfully deserved the Oscar and it's neat to see that he's basically just a supporting character for the first 100-minutes or so. However, whenever he's on screen the power of the performance is just undeniable and especially when he doesn't even say a word. Of course, when he does speak he really nails every emotion that the film called for. Brock Peters and James Anderson are chilling in their roles as is a quickly seen Robert Duvall.

Within the action film, it was Schwarzenegger who was the king of the one-liners. The Running Man offered the perfect vehicle for this fashion of dialogue, with its structure of death-for-survival. In the future (2017 to be precise) the worlds economy has crashed leaving many homeless, and the state runs the entertainment industry - in this science fiction world, television ratings are raised by the depiction of violence and humiliation; as long as it is justified with criminality.Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) is an ex-cop, wrongfully imprisoned for a helicopter attack on civilians. In the opening scene we see the real event, as Richards refuses to shoot innocents, and ignores orders. As we are in familiar sci-fi themes, this dystopic police state, and its control of the media, manipulates the facts to create a criminal. Escaping a maximum security prison (which seems surprisingly easy to break out of), Richards heads for his brothers in the city, whilst Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) and Weiss (Marvin J. McIntyre) head for revolutionary activity. But the butcher of Bakersfield (the name attributed to Richards by the falsified media story) is too buff, and far too athletic to not be used in television most popular gameshow (its title used for this film), and Killian (Richard Dawson) spots the potential of this contestant in a prison break video.Captured and forced to take part in The Running Man, Richards (along with Laughlin and Weiss and the ubiquitous damsel (Maria Conchita Alonso) who is picked up along the way) has to face a series of stalkers, who hunt them down in a fight to the death. Simply put, it is a kind of underground gladiatorial entertainment, and with the over the top stalkers (including Fireball (Jim Brown) and Buzzsaw (Gus Rethwisch), who all have specific modes of weaponry) they face a game- like structure to get to the next level. In this structure we find the linguistic genius (sic) of Schwarzenegger, as he sardonically explains within one comedic line, what happened when he killed another man (for example, after raising buzzsaw's chainsaw to his groin, he is asked what happened to him, and Richards replies He had to split - hilarity!Some of the films themes resonate within our popular culture to this day. Now, I'm in no way stating that this film was prescient, or even that it was ahead of its time. The presentation is certainly of its time, and many of the ideas can be found elsewhere (within literature, Orwell's 1984 is standard for dystopian futures), such as Peter Watkins' Punishment Park (1971). What the film does highlight when viewed in another century is that the general populous has become far more media savvy that ever. We are used to the idea that anything we watch on television (particularly when we consider the mass of reality TV that litters our airwaves) we are watching something edited for the purpose of entertainment. In The Running Man, the audiences are unaware that manipulation is rampant within both current affairs and entertainment broadcasting.I think I may have just taken a Schwarzenegger film far too seriously. This is an '80's gung-ho action film, that perpetuates the throw-away, comic book violence that prevailed - after all, America was defeated in their last war (Vietnam) and, I'm guessing, had to make war and violence accessible to children! This frightening concept would become more concerning when many adult action ideas were transferred to Saturday morning cartoons (both Robocop and Rambo were translated to cartoon, and they were based on two of the most violent films of the decade). This digression is not too far away from The Running Man, as it does often feel like it is directed at a younger audience, despite the bloody violence, it is very much a cartoonish and immature approach to what could have been a more cerebral comment on mass entertainment.Based on a book by Stephen King (Writing as Richard Bachmann), the film does have some interesting elements to it. In our modern world of multi- channel, on-demand entertainment, a large segment (the majority in fact) of the media we consume, is so insipid, so incredibly dumbed-down, that it would be easy to argue that these forms of visual pleasure are produced as a form of control (you know, keep them in line by feeding them s**t that rots the brain). In The Running Man, the largely homeless population gather round the over sized screens that litter the skyline to watch state-controlled gameshows, and they find their entertainment in the death of others. When Richards begins to beat the stalkers, the audience start gunning for the supposed villain. Therefore, the film seems to be making the point that death is what people want to see, even if it is the wrong type of death.Despite all of these transgressions, this was one of the favourites as a youngster. It is undeniably entertaining, and has some genuinely nice moments, and offers some interesting visions of a future that was inevitably there in 1987, but in which has been exacerbated over the last 30 years of increasingly dumb entertainment. Within standard television production modes, The Running Man is not inspiring film making (it was directed by Paul Michael Glaser, who was Starsky in Starsky and Hutch, and also directed many episodes of Miami Vice). There is probably no doubt that this will be remade, as the ideas and themes are still very relevant today, but lets hope that if it is remade, they forget about the muscles and gladiator iconography, and focus on the manipulation through entertainment. And please, never, ever put Schwarzenegger in a Lycra jumpsuit!www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"15 November 2012","score":"","review":" A quasi-disturbing trend in '80's American cinema was the wisecrack; innocuous in some genres, it even extended to the horror film, with the child killer (paedophile if you want a 21st century tag) Freddy Krueger - who would flaunt his quips after extravagantly offing a youngun.

In the future (2017 to be precise) the worlds economy has crashed leaving many homeless, and the state runs the entertainment industry - in this science fiction world, television ratings are raised by the depiction of violence and humiliation; as long as it is justified with criminality.Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) is an ex-cop, wrongfully imprisoned for a helicopter attack on civilians. In the opening scene we see the real event, as Richards refuses to shoot innocents, and ignores orders. As we are in familiar sci-fi themes, this dystopic police state, and its control of the media, manipulates the facts to create a criminal. Escaping a maximum security prison (which seems surprisingly easy to break out of), Richards heads for his brothers in the city, whilst Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) and Weiss (Marvin J. McIntyre) head for revolutionary activity. But the butcher of Bakersfield (the name attributed to Richards by the falsified media story) is too buff, and far too athletic to not be used in television most popular gameshow (its title used for this film), and Killian (Richard Dawson) spots the potential of this contestant in a prison break video.Captured and forced to take part in The Running Man, Richards (along with Laughlin and Weiss and the ubiquitous damsel (Maria Conchita Alonso) who is picked up along the way) has to face a series of stalkers, who hunt them down in a fight to the death. Simply put, it is a kind of underground gladiatorial entertainment, and with the over the top stalkers (including Fireball (Jim Brown) and Buzzsaw (Gus Rethwisch), who all have specific modes of weaponry) they face a game- like structure to get to the next level. In this structure we find the linguistic genius (sic) of Schwarzenegger, as he sardonically explains within one comedic line, what happened when he killed another man (for example, after raising buzzsaw's chainsaw to his groin, he is asked what happened to him, and Richards replies He had to split - hilarity!Some of the films themes resonate within our popular culture to this day. Now, I'm in no way stating that this film was prescient, or even that it was ahead of its time. The presentation is certainly of its time, and many of the ideas can be found elsewhere (within literature, Orwell's 1984 is standard for dystopian futures), such as Peter Watkins' Punishment Park (1971). What the film does highlight when viewed in another century is that the general populous has become far more media savvy that ever. We are used to the idea that anything we watch on television (particularly when we consider the mass of reality TV that litters our airwaves) we are watching something edited for the purpose of entertainment. In The Running Man, the audiences are unaware that manipulation is rampant within both current affairs and entertainment broadcasting.I think I may have just taken a Schwarzenegger film far too seriously. This is an '80's gung-ho action film, that perpetuates the throw-away, comic book violence that prevailed - after all, America was defeated in their last war (Vietnam) and, I'm guessing, had to make war and violence accessible to children! This frightening concept would become more concerning when many adult action ideas were transferred to Saturday morning cartoons (both Robocop and Rambo were translated to cartoon, and they were based on two of the most violent films of the decade). This digression is not too far away from The Running Man, as it does often feel like it is directed at a younger audience, despite the bloody violence, it is very much a cartoonish and immature approach to what could have been a more cerebral comment on mass entertainment.Based on a book by Stephen King (Writing as Richard Bachmann), the film does have some interesting elements to it. In our modern world of multi- channel, on-demand entertainment, a large segment (the majority in fact) of the media we consume, is so insipid, so incredibly dumbed-down, that it would be easy to argue that these forms of visual pleasure are produced as a form of control (you know, keep them in line by feeding them s**t that rots the brain). In The Running Man, the largely homeless population gather round the over sized screens that litter the skyline to watch state-controlled gameshows, and they find their entertainment in the death of others. When Richards begins to beat the stalkers, the audience start gunning for the supposed villain. Therefore, the film seems to be making the point that death is what people want to see, even if it is the wrong type of death.Despite all of these transgressions, this was one of the favourites as a youngster. It is undeniably entertaining, and has some genuinely nice moments, and offers some interesting visions of a future that was inevitably there in 1987, but in which has been exacerbated over the last 30 years of increasingly dumb entertainment. Within standard television production modes, The Running Man is not inspiring film making (it was directed by Paul Michael Glaser, who was Starsky in Starsky and Hutch, and also directed many episodes of Miami Vice). There is probably no doubt that this will be remade, as the ideas and themes are still very relevant today, but lets hope that if it is remade, they forget about the muscles and gladiator iconography, and focus on the manipulation through entertainment.
