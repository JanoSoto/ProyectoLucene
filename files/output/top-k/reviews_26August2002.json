The philosophical heart of the movie seemed kind of forced, especially Hess chanting There are no coincidences, his lungs were closed over and over again, but it was ultimately quite satisfying. As a father myself, I was easily drawn into the father-as-protector story, and I enjoyed that quite a bit. Shyamalan also did a good job of building suspense, working well with glimpses and noises rather than all-out attack. He obviously knows the truth that so many filmmakers seem to have a hard time grasping  The unseen is much scarier and more suspenseful than the seen. Likewise, he has a Kubrick-esque talent for letting a scene develop slowly. Action is often unnecessary, and the biggest payoffs come from a patient director. There was plenty of that in this flick.Weaknesses  Like The Sixth Sense (which I liked a whole lot more), this film telegraphed its revelations from miles away.

I'm not a nitpicky moviegoer. Most of this stuff just washes by me, so when I actually notice it in a movie, the filmmaker must really be letting his guard down. And, of course, there's the whole Why invade a water-covered planet if it kills you question that I'm sure many have already raised.I never know what to make of movies that draw heavily and obviously on other influences. When the camera dropped, Blair Witch-style, in the basement, I fully expected to see Mike standing in the corner, waiting to be killed.

The movie starts with scenes from the first three films. This collage would fill in a new viewer who hasn't seen the first three parts, but it could have been done much better. The collage was supposed to be a bang of an opener, but didn't quite accomplish that effect. The film's plot is once again very simple (SPOILERS ahead) Jason Voorhees is taken away from the country property where he had just murdered several people (in Friday The 13th, Part 3.) He is believed to be dead, and is taken to a facility to be put in an icebox. The next few scenes involving a tasteless character named Axel (Bruce Mahler), are simply tacky. I guess there always has to be a few unappealing characters in this type of movie (maybe so the audience can cheer when they are murdered), but I found the Axel character to be appalling to the point that it ruined the beginning of the movie. Jason kills Axel and a nurse, and eventually makes his way back to the area where he had been slaughtering people. Living in this area of the woods are Mrs. Jarvis (Joan Freeman), her daughter, Trisha (Kimberly Beck), and her son, Tommy (Corey Feldman.) Renting the house next door is a group of six young adults. The six renting the house meet twin sisters on the way to go swimming, and the sisters are invited back to the house for a party. Also in the woods is Rob Dire (Erich Anderson), who is hunting for Jason. Trisha and Tommy befriend him, and there seems to be some sparks of romance between Trisha and Rob. Jason begins to kill during the party at the rented house. Even Mrs. Jarvis becomes a victim when she goes outside her home. Trisha goes for Rob when she can't find her mother, and the two go to the rented house. There they discover carnage, but worse Jason finds them. Trisha makes it out of the house alive, and she and brother Tommy must fight for their lives in their own home. Tommy then attempts to use psychology on Jason, which I again found to be as far-fetched as I did when it happened in Friday The 13th, Part 2. The film isn't too bad, but I feel it would have been so much better without the obnoxious hospital scenes in the beginning, and the psychology attempt on Jason at the end. The acting is more balanced on a decent level than in the previous three films. The plot does allow some character development, but not a lot. Harry Manfredini's Friday The 13th themes are orchestrated differently than in the previous three films, and sound more haunting. However, what would have helped this supposed closing to the series of films would have been to have had a more thriving and relentless score. Tom Savini, who did the blood and gore effects in Friday The 13th, returned to do the effects in this movie. These effects were well done. Friday The 13th - The Final Chapter tried to have a more grand approach, but it never really reaches the levels of suspense that were hoped for. Friday The 13th - The Final Chapter was well filmed and is somewhat enjoyable, but it left a lot to be desired and the overall outcome was average.

I have lamented for years that nobody in Hollywood had ever made a movie out of one of Connelly's novels, but now I hope no one ever does it again, if this film is going to be the standard.I assumed (wrongly) that the inspiration to make a film out of Blood Work came from the ingenious plot of the novel, with Connelly's trademark misdirection, small clues, and overall LOGIC.  An expectation that these characteristics would be faithfully conveyed to the big screen was the ONLY reason I went to see the film!  (I was less optimistic when I saw in the commercials that Clint Eastwood was involved, but he HAS made subtle, intelligent movies before (see IN the Line of Fire). WARNING  SPOILERS AHEAD---Apparently, the writer who adapted the novel to a screenplay failed either to read the novel or to understand it.  As has been mentioned in many reviews above, the trail of clues in the novel led LOGICALLY to the killer, so changing who the killer was without changing the trail made no sense at all.  The novel's third murder, which allowed McCaleb to put together the clues, was essential and eliminating it made the connections he DOES make in the film seem either stupid or obvious.  The opening scene involving the Code Killer drew too much attention to that case, which the novel merely describes among others in passing so as not to give too much away.  Changing the tag line (from Don't forget the cannoli to Happy Valentine's Day was simply stupid.)  The No 1 inspiration only made sense after looking at ALL of the Code Killer's codes, not just one.  In the novel, the killer only made one mistake, and it took intelligence to notice it, put the clues together, and track him down.All in all, not a good adaptation.  Plus, the movie simply had elements that make for bad movies.  First of all, Clint Eastwood is approximately 244 years old, and should know by now that he does not have to sleep with every one of his female leads.  (What he does off-screen is his own business.)  The encounter between Graciella and McCaleb, which was brought about convincingly in the novel as a RELATIONSHIP developed between them, is simply contrived in the film.  I was in a theater full of teenagers, and the entire audience laughed out loud when Graciella slipped out of bed and basically attacked McCaleb.  It was about as well segued as a porn film sex scene.

Plus, the movie simply had elements that make for bad movies.  First of all, Clint Eastwood is approximately 244 years old, and should know by now that he does not have to sleep with every one of his female leads.  (What he does off-screen is his own business.)  The encounter between Graciella and McCaleb, which was brought about convincingly in the novel as a RELATIONSHIP developed between them, is simply contrived in the film.  I was in a theater full of teenagers, and the entire audience laughed out loud when Graciella slipped out of bed and basically attacked McCaleb.  It was about as well segued as a porn film sex scene.  Obviously, everyone knew it was going to happen (it was an Eastwood film, after all), but when it actually did happen, it was unbelievable and a bit creepy.

In The Bedroom is the first movie that the talented Todd Field has directed. He gave a good performance in 1999's Eyes Wide Shut. His inspiration to carry out this movie was the American writer Andre Dubus who died in 1999. Dubus draws a compassionate and a somewhat sentimental portrait of the American soul. For instance we see a happy aged couple Ruth and Matt with their only son Frank, however all becomes tough after frank's murder! Everything in this family changes in a so simple and complex way showing us how hard life is! In The Bedroom is an interesting film that is revealed in front of something conventional, which lacks the easy crying. In The Bedroom is showed as a deliberate film, disregarding haste, with a constant rhythm, but slow that tells one of the most tragic stories that a human being might suffer, which is the loss of a loved one. The plot is unpretentious, argumentative and lineal. Matt Flower is a doctor married for 25 years to a choir teacher Ruth Flower. Their only son Frank is spending his vacation in their house, he works as a lobster fisherman to get some money for his studies. Frank is in love with Natalie, a single mother of two children. This deed will cause Frank's murder by Natalie's evil ex-husband. As of this moment, the relationship between Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek's characters is spoiled to unexpected boundaries!Tom Wilkinson amazes the viewers with his expressions' strength and his capacity of showing us his feeling through a long and a countless silence. A silence helped by the cinematography, which makes an unusual movie for people used to Hollywood quick movies. On the other hand Sissy Spacek is the shadow's harassing, she's the one who moves the threads and gets what precisely she was looking for.My only complaint about this movie was the weak ending it had. It was shockingly disappointing. After a great beginning and climax, In the Bedroom falls apart because of an incomplete and ridiculous ending. The whole story ends making Matt a killer who took justice in his hands, he didn't wait for God's justice. We don't know what will happen to Matt, we don't know whether he's going to jail or not. Neither do we know what'll happen to Natalie or Ruth. This film should have showed us a complete ending, For instance this story could have gone on telling us about Matt and Ruth's life after Matt became a murderer, but it didn't, which should have been the most important issue in this movie. 6\/10   ","genre":null},{"date":"26 August 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers Even though this film was acclaimed by the critics from all around the world, its ending leaves too much to be desired.

And there are probably many other previous tellings of the same basic story.  It all adds up quickly No electricity, no telephone, the postman never comes, and the priest doesn't visit anymore.  It's not too hard to figure out the twist and where Victor and his family fit into it. ********END SPOILERS******Despite finding the story predictable, I'd recommend this movie to people because the story is told well and with atmosphere.  However, I was never scared nor startled once.  This isn't that kind of ghost story.   ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller"}]
