IF anyone has seen Brave Fart, god help them, this movie is better than all those which have come before or after.The movie starts with a bloodbath in the California docks of San Pedro. many have been murdered, all but two, one is Verbal (Kevin Spacey), other guy is in coma. So Kevin spacey is asked a few questions and then let go. But a further cop grills him even after he's granted immunity. So during the two incidents, he fills him up on how they got together, a gun heist had taken place in NYC, they were all grilled, verbal was the only misfit as he was a small-timer and a cripple who could not pull it off. As is the case these guys put their evil minds to work in the prison cell and rob some corrupt NY cops causing a stir turning the whole force upside down with people getting fired.The gang then moves to LA, start working for red-foot. One job goes fine and the next job they are screwed. SO they ask him to give them the guy who gave the tipoff. Kobayashi walks in, and tells them about Kaiser Soze, a mercenary drug-lord of Turkey and Hungary. Its Soze's will that these guys pull off a Coke deal going down in the docks.Apparently Kobayashi knows all about their lives since forever.So these guys decide the 91 Million package is too big to overlook and decide to work nonetheless and split the cash. What follows is the bloodbath. And there was NO DOPE, the deal was about a guy who could identify Soze, he was the only one.

Then he 's allowed to go as he's in tears.Meanwhile the coma guy is talking during the whole thing and FBI gets a translator and get Skecth done of Soze, which resembles verbal strikingly in appearance, but the cop misses it as he tries to chase Verbal.On first viewing you may be stumped, but the hints are all over. The golden lighter, In one Scene he's asked why he's called verbal, so he says, because i talk too much ( Soze also means talkative or verbal in Turkish, Kaizer means King in German, according to verbal, Soze was German, maybe Turkish, so the link). Even when Keaton and verbal talk in the docks during the climax, verbal easily identifies the language as Hungarian, and when he leaves the office, his cripple disappears as Kobayashi picks him up.I was left speechless after the movie.

The film is, of course, Batman Returns; which can only be described as an all out comic book masterpiece. Quite frankly, everything that could be good about this film; is great. Tim Burton has succeeded on a number of levels to bring us the ultimate comic book movie - the characters, the plot, the atmosphere - everything in this film is right on cue. What really annoyed me about the first Batman film was that Burton didn't seem to know where he wanted the focus. It seemed as if he wanted it to be more on The Joker, but then he threw in some character building for Batman; and the final result was very messy. This has been sorted out for this film, and although it has once again left Batman in the shadows; Burton has given us two great villains to have fun with, and the fact that the focus is more on them only makes the film better.The plot mainly follows a young child that was dumped into the sewers at birth. This child would grow up to become 'The Penguin', and he chooses to rise from the sewers at around the same time that businessman Max Schrek has decided to throw his secretary, Selina Kyle out of the window; who then becomes her alter ego, Catwoman. The Penguin and Max Schrek then team up so that the former can get his revenge on Gotham City, and, of course, the caped crusader is on hand to dispatch the baddies. The plot isn't all that deep or intelligent, but it serves it's purpose and allows Tim Burton to do what he really wanted to do with the movie; create a very dark Gothic look for Gotham City! Batman's home town looks absolutely fabulous throughout this film, and the winter setting blends magnificently with Burton's Gothic architecture to create a world that excellently compliment's it's hero's dark personality, while creating a great aesthetic playground for Burton to weave his tale within.It's not just the atmosphere that makes this film what it is - a plethora of great performances have been added into the mix, with each performer giving great energy and enthusiasm to their roles. Michael Keaton returns to his role as the caped crusader, and pretty much does what he did in the last film. He's never really given a chance to impress, as his three villainous counterparts constantly upstage him. Danny DeVito is supremely grotesque in his role as The Penguin, and makes sure that he holds the focus in every scene he's in. This sort of role suits an actor like DeVito excellently, and this is the best I've ever seen him. On the flip side to The Penguin, we have Catwoman; who is played by the very sexy Michele Pfifer. She looks great in her black leather suit, and her demented portrayal as the tortured villain works brilliantly. Rounding off the cast is the magnificent Christopher Walken. Walken has an uncanny ability of making a huge impression in everything he's in, and his dark and downbeat portrayal as a shrewd businessman is just great.On the whole, I highly recommend this film to everyone. While the substance isn't always there, Burton has given this sequel enough style and enough entertainment value to more than adequately mask that fact and if you're a fan of cinema; I see no reason to dislike this film.

Clint Eastwood took his iconic Man With No Name character from the three spaghetti westerns of the 60s,gave him a few tweaks and then placed him in modern day San Francisco,in the process creating another iconic character for audiences to cheer and critics to get steamed up about. Here was a cop who sometimes seemed as brutal as the villains he battled,yet who still lived by his own very moral code. Since this film's release,and especially during the 1980s,the cinema has been filled with tough cop heroes who get the job done by whatever means necessary and are always being told off by exasperated bosses. However,Harry came first.As a film Dirty Harry has possibly lost a little of it's edge now because many subsequent similar films have been much more action packed and violent,the action scenes in this film are fairly quick and to the point-no extended shoot outs here. However,it still has incredible tension. The plot is extremely simple-Harry versus a nasty sniper called Scorpio,that's it-and all the better for it. Director Don Siegel,aided by Lalo Schifrin's funky and sometimes chilling score the music as Scorpio prepares to shoot people is particularly menacing piles on the suspense with the skill of a master possibly the only film he made which bettered this one was the original Invasion Of Th Body Snatchers.Siegel is especially good with the scenes of violence. In one scene,Harry basically tortures Scorpio for the whereabouts of a girl he is kidnapped. As Harry places his foot on Scorpio's wound and the music goes all wild and dissonant,the camera pans up from the action very quickly until Harry and Scorpio are specks. No real gloating on the brutality,but maximum impact.Harry Robinson's Scorpio is one of the most terrifying villains ever,especially when he manically laughs as he beats up Harry and says about his prisoner you know what,I'm going to let her die. I just wanted you to know that. Clint has rarely been more effective,subsequent films would develop Harry's character a bit,but he never had the edge and sheer cool as he had here,check out his opening entrance as he checks out a crime scene whilst chewing gum. The writers and Eastwood realise a certain amount of humour about the character without losing his credibility listen out for the adult male with a butcher knife line.This has been called a fascist movie,but if it is than why did audiences respond so much to the film and the character of Harry? In truth,people related to Harry's anger at a criminal system that sometimes seemed to favour the criminals and there is always a certain pleasure in seeing nasty folk being wiped out. Watch the afore mentioned scene where Harry tortures Scorpio,and see if you're not with Harry a bit and share his concern for the kidnapped girl.

Watch the afore mentioned scene where Harry tortures Scorpio,and see if you're not with Harry a bit and share his concern for the kidnapped girl. Perhaps some of the sequels had more interesting plots and situations and had more action,but Dirty Harry remains a terrific pared-to-the-bone thriller which is still extremely gripping.

During the spring semester of 2003 I took a class called Visual Culture in Modern Japan and _Woman of the Dunes_ was the final novel that we read. After discussing the book, our teacher had us watch the film adaptation of Abe's novel, and by seeing what the character Junpei experiences, I was able to sympathize with him greater than I had when I read the novel.In order to escape his mundane life in Tokyo, the salary-man Niki Junpei travels to a small seaside village to collect insects. Engrossed in his hobby Niki accidentally misses the last bus. In order to aid their visitor, the villagers suggest that Niki stay the night in one of their homes. Liking the idea of staying in a local's home and tasting the local cuisine, Junpei readily agrees to the proposal. Junpei is taken to house situated in a sandpit and there he meets a woman who dutifully prepares him dinner. Her home lacks not only electricity and water, but it is also quite ramshackle as well. The woman informs Junpei that the sand causes the wood to rot because of its moisture. Junpei scoffs at the woman, stating that sand is dry not moist.

Also, _Woman of the Dunes_ is a good example of a film that can be very erotic without showing naughty bits. There are a couple of scenes within the film that are quite stirring.

There was Hitchcock, Curtiz, DeMille, and the list goes on and on. Eventually you'll get to Stanley Kubrick, director of such films as 2001 A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the , Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and my personal favorite, A Clockwork Orange. Out of all the filmmakers to ever live, I always thought Kubrick was the finest. His meticulous and carefully crafted works of art (his films) are superior to any other filmmaker on a good day (in my opinion). Out of all his incredible achievements, I find the best is 'A Clockwork Orange', the controversial - Best Picture nominee about in youth in our society, well a future society.In futuristic Britian, young Alexander DeLarge (Malcom McDowell) and his droogies enjoy pranks, robbing, izing, , spiked milk and 'a bit of the old ultra '. One day while Alex and his crew (Dim, Georgie, and Lodger) are izing and eventually ing a dirty old sumka with a lot of cats, Alex's crew decides to turn against him, and leaving him alone at the scene for the cops to come. Young and trouble-making Alex's life gets turned upside down when he goes to prison. In prison he becomes very interested in religion and the and pain Christ went through. Not because of sorrow for Christ, but because of his obsession with inflicting upon people. He day-dreams of being a Roman, whipping Jesus while he carries the cross, and having s with the temple chambermaids. One day, Alex comes across an experimental medical procedure that supposedly cures violent criminals, and decides to take up the offer so he can get out of jail. The rest of the film follows him in the procedure and the consequences, hardships and situations that follow. 'A Clockwork Orange' is such a well-made production it almost can't even be considered a film, it should be considered a work of art. Stanley Kubrick beautifully molds this dark, dim and disturbing tale based on Anthony Burgess' novel, and turns it into his own glorious vision. Kubrick achieves utter and absolute perfection in his direction, and he also provides a magnificent screenplay filled to the brim with intriguing almost Shakespeare-ish sort of dialogue in which Alex speaks. The acting is a cut above the rest also. Malcolm McDowell owns the role of Alex DeLarge, and plays him with intensity, passion, great understanding and an almost shocking realism. You don't see Mr. McDowell on the screen, you see his character Alexander DeLarge, a young mischievous monster in the making. The film also stars Patrick Magee, Warren Clarke, Carl Duering, Adrienne Corri, Anthony Sharp, James Marcus, and Michael Bates in a very comedic role as chief guard at Alex's prison. The film garners neat cinematography, awesome set decoration, interesting costumes and a highly inventive and exceptional vision thanks to the brilliant Stanley Kubrick.'A Clockwork Orange' is my favorite Kubrick film, and that is saying a hell of a lot. Others may not agree because it doesn't have the awe of '2001' or the cult following of 'Dr. Strangelove'. I love it to though, because it's so different then his (Kubrick's) other work and that is what makes it so special. It was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s because of it's extreme and , and it had to be cut from it's original version (now restored on DVD today) to receive an 'R' rating it all along deserved.

There was Hitchcock, Curtiz, DeMille, and the list goes on and on. Eventually you'll get to Stanley Kubrick, director of such films as 2001 A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the , Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and my personal favorite, A Clockwork Orange. Out of all the filmmakers to ever live, I always thought Kubrick was the finest. His meticulous and carefully crafted works of art (his films) are superior to any other filmmaker on a good day (in my opinion). Out of all his incredible achievements, I find the best is 'A Clockwork Orange', the controversial - Best Picture nominee about in youth in our society, well a future society.In futuristic Britian, young Alexander DeLarge (Malcom McDowell) and his droogies enjoy pranks, robbing, izing, , spiked milk and 'a bit of the old ultra '. One day while Alex and his crew (Dim, Georgie, and Lodger) are izing and eventually ing a dirty old sumka with a lot of cats, Alex's crew decides to turn against him, and leaving him alone at the scene for the cops to come. Young and trouble-making Alex's life gets turned upside down when he goes to prison. In prison he becomes very interested in religion and the and pain Christ went through. Not because of sorrow for Christ, but because of his obsession with inflicting upon people. He day-dreams of being a Roman, whipping Jesus while he carries the cross, and having s with the temple chambermaids. One day, Alex comes across an experimental medical procedure that supposedly cures violent criminals, and decides to take up the offer so he can get out of jail. The rest of the film follows him in the procedure and the consequences, hardships and situations that follow. 'A Clockwork Orange' is such a well-made production it almost can't even be considered a film, it should be considered a work of art. Stanley Kubrick beautifully molds this dark, dim and disturbing tale based on Anthony Burgess' novel, and turns it into his own glorious vision. Kubrick achieves utter and absolute perfection in his direction, and he also provides a magnificent screenplay filled to the brim with intriguing almost Shakespeare-ish sort of dialogue in which Alex speaks. The acting is a cut above the rest also. Malcolm McDowell owns the role of Alex DeLarge, and plays him with intensity, passion, great understanding and an almost shocking realism. You don't see Mr. McDowell on the screen, you see his character Alexander DeLarge, a young mischievous monster in the making. The film also stars Patrick Magee, Warren Clarke, Carl Duering, Adrienne Corri, Anthony Sharp, James Marcus, and Michael Bates in a very comedic role as chief guard at Alex's prison. The film garners neat cinematography, awesome set decoration, interesting costumes and a highly inventive and exceptional vision thanks to the brilliant Stanley Kubrick.'A Clockwork Orange' is my favorite Kubrick film, and that is saying a hell of a lot. Others may not agree because it doesn't have the awe of '2001' or the cult following of 'Dr. Strangelove'. I love it to though, because it's so different then his (Kubrick's) other work and that is what makes it so special. It was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s because of it's extreme and , and it had to be cut from it's original version (now restored on DVD today) to receive an 'R' rating it all along deserved. In conclusion, this is an incredible work of art (one of the two only - features to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture) that will be adored by the film buffs and detested by the weak-hearted.

The high priest Kharis (CHRISTOPHER LEE) was in love with the princess, but the rules set down by their religion meant that it was a forbidden love. However, when Ananka was entombed, Kharis attempted to revive his love using the sacred scroll of life and for this he was sentenced to have his tongue cut from his mouth, mummified alive and then cursed to become the guardian of Ananka's tomb forever more. In 1894, archaeologists Stephen Banning (FELIX AYLMER), his son John (PETER CUSHING) and Joseph Whemple (RAYMOND HUNTLEY) discover the tomb of Ananka while on an expedition in Egypt. As they prepare to enter the tomb, a mysterious Egyptian called Mehemet Bey (GEORGE PASTELL) warns them that whoever robs the graves of Egypt dies. Ignoring his warnings they enter the tomb and Ananka's mummy is removed and put on display in the British museum. However, Stephen suffers a mental breakdown after he discovered the scroll of life. He read the words and brought Kharis back to life. This meant that as soon as he returned to England he was confined to a home for the mentally disordered. Four years later after they have returned to England, Mehemet Bey follows bringing both the mummy of Kharis and the scroll of life with him. Using the scroll, Bey brings Kharis back to life and orders him to murder the three men who desecrated the tomb...Having enjoyed tremendous success with their colour remakes of Frankenstein and Dracula, it was rather inevitable that Hammer would turn their attention to the mysteries of ancient Egypt with this remake of Universal's THE MUMMY'S HAND (1940). The film was successful enough to warrant three sequels. They were CURSE OF THE MUMMY'S TOMB (1964), THE MUMMY'S SHROUD (1967) and BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB (1971). But these more or less ran the same storyline over and over again and as a result their box office appeal rapidly declined. THE MUMMY isn't one of Hammer's best horror films by any means as the sets are more stagy than usual and Jack Asher's photography is so bright that it robs it of any Gothic mood. However, it is still made worthwhile by the intelligent handling of director Terence Fisher who wisely opted to concentrate on Kharis's love for his princess. In the story John Banning's wife Isabelle (also played by YVONNE FURNEAUX) bares an uncanny resemblance to the long dead princess. There is one particularly moving sequence where Kharis is strangling John for his desecration of the tomb. Isabelle rushes in and begs him to stop. Kharis turns and sees the resemblance and this saves her husband's life. Kharis turns and goes to who he thinks is his long lost love and you can see the emotion in the mummy's eyes. Christopher Lee's performance is really amazing as he manages to convey all of his character's emotions such as the love for the princess and the anger for the desecration of her tomb behind all that heavy make-up and bandages where there is only a slit for his eyes. Whereas in all the company's follow-ups, the mummy (not played by Lee) was a totally emotionless creature who just went on a rampaging murder spree as none of the other actors who took on the part could convey that same emotion. Add to that the entire cast all give first rate performances notably Aylmer and Cushing as father and son and George Pastell is suitably restrained in a sinister way as Mehemet Bey the guardian of the tomb. THE MUMMY may not be one of Hammer's classics, but is certainly the best of a franchise that would wear itself out sooner rather than later.

He was raised in the desperate lower end of the working class in England, by a single mother whose heroin addiction foreshadowed his own. Sid was full of anger and aimlessness, and was ultimately done in at age 21 by the poison of drugs and an equally poisonous romance. His story is not unlike so many other troubled youths in this world. He would have long ago faded into complete oblivion and obscurity were it not for two things rock and roll and homicide.That just about tells Vicious's life story in a nutshell. However, the devil is in the details, as they say. The biopic Sid and Nancy gives us a more in-depth and inside look at Sid, his destructively dysfunctional and co-dependent relationship with Nancy Spungen, and the eroding effect it helped to foster in the ultimate dissolution of The Sex Pistols. While no biopic tells its tale without taking artistic license, we do get a feel for the gritty underbelly of punk. We also watch with discomfort the pathetic downward spiral of a young man who was a central member of the whole punk movement and ethic, and who could have had a lot to live for.At the very least, his pop culture immortality is assured because he was part of the pioneering Brit Punk band, The Sex Pistols. The Sex Pistols were only together a couple of years or so, only did one album, and only made it halfway through their first American tour before they imploded onstage. However, the musical and cultural legacy they left behind was powerful, lasting and immeasurable. The other members of the band are still with us and have reunited onstage now and again since 1996; John Johnny Rotten Lydon also had his own post-Pistols' success with his group, PIL (Public Image Ltd.) Unfortunately, Sid Vicious spiraled downward into a haze of drugs, drink and self-sabotage. This was only exacerbated by his draining relationship with Nancy Spungen, an American former prostitute and longtime addict. She was an overbearing person from all accounts, and the other members of the Pistols actually tried everything they knew to get Sid away from her. In the end, their romance ended in her death, and a drug-addled Sid Vicious being charged with murder. He did not last to see the inside of a courtroom, however; he succumbed to a heroin overdose four months later.Sid and Nancy, like the Sex Pistols themselves, have been practically deified to the point where they are almost like cartoon characters. This biopic, while it does have its flaws, shows us just how human they really were. Kudos to Gary Oldman, who gives an outstanding performance as Sid Vicious. He's riveting to watch. Chloe Webb as Nancy Spungen is grating, overbearing, whiny and not terribly likable...if that portrayal is even reasonably accurate, it's no wonder she was nicknamed Nauseating Nancy. Given that, I have a feeling Webb nailed it in her interpretation.God Save the Sex Pistols, always.... and R.I.P. Sid and Nancy, two young people just too out of control to last in this world.

That's were the good part starts. We first see him again with his co-workers and everything he says is THE TRUTH! It's just spilling out of him!! This movie is Great!! It's very funny. Plus,there's really nothing offensive despite the PG-13.I LOVED this film. It's the best! I rate it a 10!

I thought it would be a nice colorful adaptation (without digital color enhancement) of the 1934 March of the Wooden Soldiers, but the only similarities are the songs when Little Bo Peep loses her sheep and when the soldiers come marching out, but that is it. Barnaby is hardly a frightening character (Ray Bolger gives nothing short of a comedic performance of this villain, but that is notably his style - you would not expect anything different from this extraordinary talented man.)There is far too much singing in this movie and it is very difficult to follow what the plot is (you have to listen closely to the words in the songs). It borders on a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, but they are by far a million times better and much more enjoyable as the musical numbers flow with ease.If anything, it is nice to see Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk as they have graduated from the Mickey Mouse Club and doing the transition into adulthood. Annette's voice has finally matured from the childlike voice she had during her Mickey days.Thankfully, for DVD, I was able to fast-forward through all of the musical numbers because they grew tiresome quickly (after a few seconds)! Do yourself a favor and save the $4.00 it would cost to rent it, that is if you can find it anywhere. Now I know why it has been discontinued by so many video\/DVD stores at this point.

Tim Roth stars as the title character - the spastic, moody pianist who was born and raised on a ship, and named after the year in which he was found. He encounters many unique personages on his travels, most notably the story's narrator, Max Tooney (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The two become fast friends 1900 teaches Max to find his sea-legs, and Max becomes his most devoted fan. For 1900 is a piano prodigy. He plays beautiful music that no one has ever heard before, inspired by the faces of passengers that he sees. Appropriately, his most gorgeous piece is written when he catches sight of the woman he is destined to love. There's only one problem he refuses to set foot on dry land.The film is, basically, a fantasy. A grown-up's fairy tale. Not for a moment do I believe that any of this could ever happen, and neither did all the critics who gave it negative reviews. This kind of movie is acceptable, perhaps, in Europe. Not in America. Our critics demand realism, and their usual beef with any given film is the unrealistic happenings, or plot holes. But it's The Legend of 1900 for a reason...it isn't real, and we're not meant to believe that it is. In order for this type of story to work, the characters must be compelling enough to carry a fantastical tale. Films like Goldfinger and Ocean's 11 have banked on this before, and we've become used to such hijinks in the action\/adventure genre. But an unbelievable drama? There's no question that Roth's 1900 is fascinating. Charmingly neurotic, he endures the ribbing of his friends and enemies with Bogartesque grace. The character of Max Tooney is meant to be the duller companion to his genius the Watson to his Holmes, the Robin to his Batman. Unfortunately Vince's performance leaves something to be desired, and his character is given little to do. He plays the trumpet well and (reportedly) tells a great story, but he lacks the charisma needed in a sidekick. When 1900's home ship, The Virginian, is destined to be destroyed, Max embarks on a quest to find 1900 and save him from the explosion. This search spans the whole film, intercut with flashbacks to the many voyages of Max and 1900. The ending is predictable. In fact, each moment in the film is predictable, with one exception. Almost every single plot point is shamelessly foreshadowed at least once, and I found myself wondering wearily how long it would take to reveal each twist. Maybe it's the American in me. I just wanted to see stuff get blown up.The one truly interesting scene is the piano duel between 1900 and jazz sensation Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III). You find yourself as bewildered by 1900's behavior as are the passengers...what is he doing? Why? When will he finally show Jelly Roll who's boss? In spite of yourself, you really want this strange young sea-bound man to win. You like him. What's not to like? But liking a character isn't always enough to carry a film. Such is the case here. In the end, you realize that you never really had any vested interest in 1900 or his fate. He's interesting to look at, but his magic lasts only as long as his fingers play.

The movie does it by inserting newsreel footage of Bobby winning the World Chess Championship Tournament in Reykjavik Iceland back in 1972 against the Soviet Unions Boris Spassky. It then jumps back to when Bobby Fischer was a young boy, and man, in the 1950's and 1960's as his obsession with chess brought him the fame and glory that he sought. Yet at the same time denied him the life of a normal boy growing up in post WWII America that his night and day chess fixation cost him. Josh has lots of promise in becoming a future Bobby Fischer; he has a computer-like mind and a natural ability to foresee moves by his opponents, even before they even know that they'll make them. One thing that Josh doesn't have is that drive and determination, as well as killer-instinct, that Bobby Fisher had and as far as I know still does in playing to win and pulverizing his opponents into the ground by doing it. Josh likes all kinds of sports, besides chess, and his dad Fred Waitzkin, Joe Mantegna, is a sports writer who takes Josh along to the Yankee and New York Mets baseball games where the young boy really has as much of a good time watching the ball games as he has playing chess. Fred realizes what a whiz his young son Josh is in the game of chess and wants to have him study the finer points of the game by hiring former national chess champion Bruce Pandolfini, Ben Kingsley, to tutor him and Bruce right away realizes that Josh has the makings of another Bobby Fischer. What does bother Bruce about Josh is his playing with the local chess hustlers like Winnie, Laurence Fishburn, in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. Which, in Bruce's opinion, is far to fast and doesn't give young Josh time to develop his all around concentration and understanding of the game of chess. During the course of the movie Josh is driven relentlessly by Bruce in his attempt to mold him into another Bobby Fischer but Josh slowly starts to lose his interest in winning all the chess tournaments that he enters. The very fact of his invincibility makes Josh feel uneasy since it's always expected of him to win, like the sun is expected to rise in the morning, that there's no fun or excitement in it for him any more. Losing becomes more of a growing experience for Josh and even arouses his passions in making him feel more human. Josh is also too sensitive to beat down his opponents, like Bobby Fischer did. That later lost him the championship game against the likewise seven year-old chess phenomenon Jonathan Poe, Michael Nirenberg. After his defeat to Jonathan Josh is looked on as if he let down all those who believed in him and at the same time he starts to get his life back together as a young boy living a normal life and not carrying the weight of the entire world of chess on his shoulders. It's during this time that the real talent that Josh had in playing chess comes up to the surface, without him being driven relentlessly by Bruce. Those untapped talents leads him to go back to playing chess, first with his friend at the park Winnie, and then working his way back in winning a number of tournaments to his becoming a top chess champion competitor. All that finally earns Josh a re-match with Jonathan for the Junior Chess Championship of the US in Chicago at the conclusion of the film.Powerful movie and very intense for the young boys and girls in it in how they drive and push themselves to be the best at the game of chess and at the same time putting themselves in danger of sacrificing their one and only childhood to do it.
