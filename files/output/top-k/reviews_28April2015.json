[{"date":"28 April 2015","score":"","review":" Powerful cautionary tale regarding America's response to Arab terrorism. Produced before the tragic 9\/11 attacks in New York City, this film is stunning in the way it is so prescient. It is also unrelenting in suspense and building the tense environment that follows terrorism perpetrated by rampaging Arabs. Some of the sequences are truly haunting and one scene in particular where Bruce Willis, the commander of the military force in Manhattan, is framed by the Twin Towers is simply startling. Tony Shaloub gives a tremendous performance as an Arab- American FBI agent who witnesses his innocent son incarcerated in a Central Park camp surrounded by barbed wire. A scene involving him and Washington outside the fence of that camp absolutely steals the motion picture and puts Shaloub on the map as one of this country's finest actors.
