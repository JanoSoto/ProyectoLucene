This movie is about a man who is sent to a work farm but tries to fool everybody by letting them think that he is insane so he can go to a mental institution, but at the end everything goes wrong for him. We can see McMurphy as a person who does not like to live by the rules, who wants to do everything his way and does not realize that in this world we should all follow rules. We also see nurse Ratched who is the person who rules the institution and is also an example of the corrupted power of authority. This movie shows the different points of view of McMurphy and nurse Ratched. McMurphy is a man that has been sent to a work farm for a short time, but he decides to let the authorities think that he is insane so he can be transferred to a mental institution where everything should be nicer and easier, When he gets to the mental institution, he meets nurse Ratched who is the person who rules the institution. McMurphy goes against what nurse Ratched says and brakes many rules. McMurphy realizes how nurse Ratched has controlled the minds of the patients and tries to help them out so they can stand by themselves and realize that they are good men and should not be treated the way nurse Ratched treats them. McMurphy is a fun person who brings a lot of happiness to the inmates so they start following him. Later in the movie McMurphy realizes that his plan has backfired on him because now he can no leave this place until nurse Ratched decides he can. McMurphy Finally ends up in vegetative state so his friend chief kills him so he can be free. McMurphy is a character that teaches us a lot of good and bad things but most of them are good. In this movie he teaches us that we should always enjoy life and that we should not feel inferior to other people. This is a man that cares for his friends and helps them to realize that they are good people. Since the beginning of the movie to the end McMurphy catches the audience attention with his way of living life. The bad things that McMurphy shows is that he tries to get the easy way out instead to taking responsibility for what he has done and face his sentence. McMurphy was a symbol of freedom, he did not want any rules but not everything can be done with freedom. We need rules so we can have a better world. Mildred Ratched is the head nurse in a mental institution where she has absolute power over the patients' privileges. She intimidates the patients and treats them bad. Most patients are afraid of her. When McMurphy comes to this mental institution, nurse Ratched tries to make him to submit to her but fails. Nurse Ratched is character that shows how many places can be ruled by a person who can do whatever they want with other people. It shows the corruption of authority that can be found and many places like this mental institution. I believe this is movie that demonstrates that sometimes we do not want to take responsibility of our actions and we try to take the easy way out. Sometimes the easy way out can lead us to something worse. In this movie McMurphy tried to fool everybody but at the end the only person he fooled was himself because he ended up in a vegetative state. I really enjoy watching this movie. From the beginning McMurphy not only gets his friends attention but the audience as well. One can get into McMurphy's character and feel what he feels. At the end the message is really clear.

I eventually caught on to the fact that it was a sequel of James Whale's first movie Frankenstein made in 1931. I highly recommend that any viewer see the first movie before watching this one. Just like all other sequels you could be lost. The flashbacks are a great help to remind people of the original story line. Flashbacks were a very crucial part of numerous old black and white films. They are, to this day, also very important to a sequel or trilogy that is made several years after the previous movie. Also, most black and white films made in the 30's and 40's have trouble with the lighting. When a director wants to make something look like it is appearing at night, the darkness can ruin the object in the shot. Whale gave the nightly appearance very well when shooting at buildings. He kept the right amount of light in the background not to get in the way of it being to light. I felt that the angles the director took to place the characters in specific lighting added to the drama, horror, and sci-fi genre this movie is placed in. The lit candles used in older versions of movies add to the horror of a movie. With every scary horror movies comes great scary characters. The actors played a wonderful part in this. Boris Karloff, The Monster, and Ernest Thesiger, Dr. Pretorius, gave a remarkable dark and scary performance as a monster and mad scientist. The music, to today's' generations, does not hinder the story or make it cheesy by any means. It is the classic, old, scary organ like music that gives hope, despair, and fear to every shot. Music has always defined a critical point a scene for movies. That is also the reason why soundtracks are made after movies are released because we relate a specific song with a specific movie. This is one reason why this particular movies music nominated it for an Oscar in 1936, only a year after its release date. James Whale is a native of the English country side. In the Bride of Frankenstein, he does a great job of using English dialogue and clothing to help accent the age of the movie. He uses the English royalty line to show power and what happens when it is abused and misused. Despite the good shots that were taken, some of the close ups were numerous in their appearances. I had trouble telling where the climax of the movie was, but caught back up with the movie. There are small subtle moments in the movie that are outdated for the twenty first century to hold in a movie. You could tell when Whale was using certain things that were obviously fake in their entirety. For being a movie that plays for an hour and thirty minutes, the story builds up fast and has some holes in the plot. There are pieces that could have been used better in the overall film, as well. Overall the performances were strong and the shots flowed well. I would love to discuss it further in detail but can not because I do not want to spoil anything. The opening of Bride of Frankenstein finds the similarity between the ending and another part of the movie with romance. This movie shows a great love story hidden behind the parallels of an emotionless and friendless monster and his want not to be alone. Hence, one of the reasons why this movie has been classified as a drama, romance, and sci-fi. This movie also speaks another motif of life and death. Most people, in their explanation of any Frankenstein movie, would say that it is about giving life and eventually ending in death. You do not know whose life while come to end or even when it will occur or how. However, James Whale with the first and second Frankenstein movies has contributed to another power that we can show to have a small portion of control over. The sad fact of the matter is that Whale lost the control of his life and committed suicide only twenty two years later after this movie was made. I give this movie an eight out of ten because I am sure that it frightened most people upon its release in the 1930's. Also, because it has miniature twists and turns around every bricked corner. Every shot helps the next to give the story line strength and fill the hour and thirty minutes that it was asked of. I definitely recommend this movie for any viewers that wish to see an old black and white film that keeps to the traditional scary, yet somehow lovable monster and quirky scientists. For the twenty first century viewers, it would appear to be a movie filled with some laughter and wonderment.

It's certainly excellent, but I think at least two of Scorsese's films on either side of this one -- Taxi Driver and King of Comedy -- are better.Robert De Niro is truly impressive as Jake LaMotta, but, as so often happens with these biopics, the character he's given to play isn't all that interesting.

Quite a hat trick! All of these films were perfect vehicles for Murphy's talents. And whether in a starring or supporting role, he completely dominated each film through sheer enthusiasm alone.But every other film he made thereafter seemed beneath him somehow. They either weren't providing him with the proper material, or they were just pointless sequels merely rehashing past glories. By the time 1996 dawned, you were beginning to wonder if Eddie Murphy's talents were all but spent.But then he seemingly emerged out of nowhere with The Nutty Professor. A film that provided him with one of the best roles he'd played in years. I must admit when I first learnt of this film, it didn't exactly raise my spirits. Murphy starring in one of Hollywood's biannual remakes hardly seemed any different than the flat, unremarkable dross he'd been churning out for ten years solid.But its what this remake does with its idea that makes the film so entertaining. Not only does it finally allow Murphy to flex his muscles as a comedian, but its also clever, inventive and an absolute laugh riot.The original film starred Jerry Lewis as a socially inept scientist, who after drinking a wonder tonic, became a smooth, super-cool crooner. But the remake's redefinition on the same idea is positively inspired.Murphy plays an astonishing number of multiple roles here, but the main one, and the most sincere and heartfelt is Professor Sherman Klump, a grossly overweight scientist with a pure heart of gold. Very insecure about his weight, he gets all nervous and flustered around beautiful grad student Carla Purdy (Jada Pinkett Smith).When he works up the courage to ask her out, they go to a night club where Sherman is insulted by a stand up comic. In a desperate bid to lose weight, he develops a weight loss tonic, and once he slims down, he becomes the wild, loud lunatic party animal Buddy Love!Buddy may be much more toned than Sherman, but he has none of Sherman's charm and warm personality. Buddy's wild and wacky adventures cause havoc in Sherman's life, leading to conflict between two disparate personalities in the one body. But once the genie's been let out of the bottle, its not so easy putting him back!After seeing the wasteland of Eddie Murphy's career from 1985 to 1995, watching The Nutty Professor is like experiencing pure, unadulterated delight. This is a really wonderful performance(s) from Murphy. All the more so because he's finally back on top form and moving at warp speed.In fact I think TNP may be that rare thing...a superior remake. And that's a very small niche indeed. Something reserved for films like 1986's The Fly and 2005's King Kong.It's completely reworked the plot of the original film (as all good remakes should do), and taken it in new and wonderful ways.Its a whole new spin on Jekyll & Hyde. The overweight but kindhearted Sherman. And the ultra-slim but unhinged dynamo, Buddy.Through an astonishing makeup job by Rick Baker, Murphy so completely disappears into the character of Sherman. Even bulked up in a fat-suit and buried under 40 pounds of makeup, Murphy's natural dynamism continues to shine through.And he does a superb job of making Sherman a sympathetic character. That is what gives the film its conviction. Without it, TNP would be a gimmicky, one-joke affair that would run out of steam all too soon.But the film never does. And that's because of Murphy. He hasn't had this much fun in a role in years. But as entertaining as he is as Sherman, he is positively joyous as Buddy! Murphy lets out all the stops delivering a broad, anarchic, frantic performance. His motormouth going fifty to the dozen, from the moment Buddy shows up its one long line of highlights. And its full steam ahead! From Buddy doing stand up comedy of his own, to romancing Carla (and numerous others!), trying on tricks, fibs lies and deceptions like a whirlwind on acid, Buddy is mania on two legs!Murphy shows his astonishing ability for chameleon transformations too. Not only does he play Sherman, he plays the entire Klump family! All different too! Their dinnertable scenes, all bickering with each other are so funny you will literally bust your gut wide open!There's an interesting subtext at the heart of TNP. Sherman's conflict with Buddy seems almost true to life. Buddy represents the manic Murphy of yesteryear. And Sherman is the cuddly figure Murphy will become. And when Sherman eventually wins out, this is the path Murphy stays on. Makes the ending a little more poignant with foreknowledge of what's to come.Still, The Nutty Professor is a madcap masterpiece.

I'd first like to cover what I view are this film's major weaknesses.1. Gregory Peck. He struggles with revealing emotion and instead looks merely constipated. I believe he should be portraying a character completely immersed in his own fantasy of beauty as he gazes upon Mrs (Madaleina) Paradine. The role of Tony Keane should express his self-inflicted torture, in this Peck fails. It is said that when asked Peck said if he could burn any of his movies this would be the one.2. Clunky courtroom scenes. One gets the feeling that a lot of context has been lost in the courtroom scenes due to editing by Selznick. It is known that he attempted to cut as much as he could with Hitch's works and that Hitch deliberately made this difficult for him with his shooting style giving little collateral in the way of alternative takes and also in his development of the long take. I think Selznick probably had a lot of control over the courtroom sequences post-production and I sense a lack of direction in these scenes which plod along with too much dialogue.Now having said all this I still feel that we are left with a good film that stands up in the Hitchcock oeuvre...this is a film about relationships and fantasy. By the time of production Hitch and his wife Alma (credited as script adviser on the movie along with James Bridie) had reached almost 50 years of age and been together more than half their lives. Although we know that they were an outwardly close couple there are many who knew them who were aware of strains in their marriage. I feel this movie more than any other seeks to explore these strains of marital fidelity and is a precursor to Vertigo in its awareness of male fantasy and the male gaze. Many shots show the constraints of both profession and marriage...the courtroom set is very claustrophobic and we get shots of Ann Todd contrasted with Valli showing the former appearing more imprisoned than the latter.The male parts in this film of Keane and La Tour are shown as weak men. Indeed we see Peck and Charles Coburn's character's unwilling to believe a woman of such beauty capable of murder. Keane vacillates and attributes words and intentions to Mrs Paradine from the off. One gets the impression that if the blokes had shut up for a minute at their first meeting with Mrs P. she may well have just told them the truth. IT IS THIS ELEMENT OF THE MALE ENDOWING THE FEMALE WITH HIS IDEAL OF BEAUTY AND TRUTH THAT IS THE CENTRAL POWER OF THE FILM. The contrast and counterpoint to the male fantasy is the woman back home, BARRYMORE\/TODD. There are fascinating exchanges between the Barrymore and Charles Laughton characters which give an indication of the regrets and sadism that relationships can be filled with if the underlying problems are not faced. I find all the acting apart from Peck's to be competent. Indeed I find Valli expresses the character - a blank canvas upon which others make their marks - as similar to Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster each giving there best performances of their careers. They're not great actresses but they accomplished what was required in this film very well. So there you have it...think Vertigo, think also Hitch and Alma.

Director Robert Redford and writer Alvin Sargent clearly understand their subject matter. And in fact, this film so closely mirrors many of the personal circumstances of my wife and her family (my wife even established a productive relationship with a Jewish therapist who works out of Skokie, no less), that we joke that the film is really about her. Maybe it's my closeness to the subject matter that gives me my appreciation of the movie, but even without that I still think that I'd consider this film to be a superb drama, flawlessly acted.Speaking of the acting, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch and Timothy Hutton were all recognized with Academy Award nominations (Hutton won) for their work in this film, all deservedly. Moore especially is memorable in her portrayal of a brittle power mom who must constantly hide behind a veneer of icy aloofness for fear that one tiny crack in her facade will send her crumbling to pieces.

While agreeing with the many other comments concerning its romance and humor and while not being an admirer of Freud I still thought there was a strong sexuality to the story. We start with a young woman with little life experience married early to a pleasant but unremarkable young man. By the strength of the mother in the story he was probably dominated by the mother. He dies. Despite being born into a rather repressed society and an even more repressed segment of that society she determines to strike out on her own. The question is then is she simply looking for her own living arrangements or are other powerful drives involved? She meets the ghost and while others have been affected by him she is only one who talks to him(other than the daughter which is found out later). So you have this young lonely woman with if written differently could be imagining this masculine rough sea captain with whom she talks of his adventures many of which are rather ribald. She meets a charming man, Sander's character, and the ghost goes away. Ghosts are not good lovers. She then finds out the man is a cad and already married. The movie doesn't speak about her life much after that but it is easy to imagine that having discarded the ghost and it was unlikely there were many suitable mates for her in the area were she lived, disappointed she moves on to middle age. In the movie her adaption to this life seems to be acceptable. Up until this point she could easily imagined the seaman. Then her daughter tells her that she also talked to the captain. This is my favorite point in the movie and it changes the context. So where is the sexuality? For me it was in the music and the sea. Powerful, alive and uncontrolled it surges during different parts of the movie. There is a rawness about it that is not part of apparent settled life and character of Lucy but is the place she, despite her frailty, is attracted to. It is the tension in the story. It's the captain's world outside her rather prim life. Hopefully this isn't too Freudian. It says to me how movie makers of that period could say a lot without being too graphic.

This movie portrays the life of a convicted felon name Mc. Murphy, this man is convicted of statutory rape and is sent to prison. Once in prison he comes up with the idea of faking his mental sanity in order to avoid been sent to the penitentiary. So he is sent to a mental institution so that he can be evaluated, he is supposed to be in there e for about 12 weeks only. Everything goes well according to his plans; He meets all the patients that will be living with him for the next 12 weeks. Among them there is a very tall Indian man everybody calls 'Chief'. Chief doesn't speak, nor hears, so everybody believes. As soon as Mc.Murphy gets to the ward he starts defying the rules and guidelines of the institution. These rules and guidelines are enforced by the head nurse of the ward, Ms. Ratchet. Ms. Ratchet is a very dominant woman who in the course of her career has won the respect of her colleagues. Her opinions are highly regarded by everybody in the ward and the community too. Mc.Murphy doesn't know this and he begins to go against Ms.Ratchet's rules. This lands him in big trouble on the long run. When is time for his evaluation He thinks he is going to be let go, but is here the turning point of the movie, after all the doctors agree that he should be sent somewhere else Ms. Ratchet tells the board that she believes that Mc.Murphy needs help and would like to keep him in the ward. The board does not reject her petition and Mc.Murphy stays. This really wasn't in Mc.Murphy's plans. When he realizes that he is not being let go because of Ms.Ratchet's opinion, He gets really concerned about his staying in the ward. But life goes on for couple of weeks, then one night, after he bribes a guard on Christmas eve, two of his girlfriends sneak in the ward with lots of alcohol and music, they have a great party and end up so drunk that they passed-out. The next morning Ms. Ratchet walks in and finds a complete mess in the ward. She orders everybody to be round-up and accounted for. One of the patients,'Billy',is found in one of the rooms with a woman this is really unacceptable to Ms.Ratchet , she demands to know who is responsible for this, Billy has no choice but to tell on Mc.Murphy, then Billy is sent to a room by himself where he commits suicide. All the blame is Mc.murphy's, so he is punished and is giving electroshocks; He was giving so much that he is almost killed. His friend Chief knows that he is going to suffer a lot so he decides to kill Mc. Murphy and finish his suffering. After that Chief smashes a water fountain against the window and escapes. Bottom line is no matter how shrew a person thinks is, if you go against the system more often than seldom, you are going to lose.
