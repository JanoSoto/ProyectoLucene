I love Stephen King, in fact hands down he is my favorite author, and in addition to that I love King films but it seems like they have misstepped King films as of late so I went back and checked out The Dark Half. It has been a long time since anyone truly captured the King spirit in film like they seemed to accomplish in the eighties and early nineties but Romero did a terrific job with The Dark Half. Disturbing, gory, with the tinge of the Supernatural that King does so well. Granted I have not yet read The Dark Half but it seems like it stays pretty true to it's original concept. The movie reeks of King and that is exactly what differentiates a great King movie from a not so great one. Romero also respects the key elements that make King's novels so brilliant. The world around them, Castle Rock, the characters, their lives, a lot of directors and film makers have complained that King is too this and too that and make the film differently (Kubrick?) but King sells millions upon millions of novels so maybe they should respect his work and I think Romero does that.Timothy Hutton is a great actor, and I think very under rated. He never really hit huge stardom and it's unfortunate because he has the potential and is a very emotionally driven actor. Hutton really shines in the role of author Thad Beaumont but also has his disturbed maniacal alter ego George Stark. Hutton's Beaumont is the ultimate good guy, family man, creative, and smart and Stark is just twisted and evil and just crazy. Hutton is a great King actor and he should have done more Stephen King films. Amy Madigan, a terrific character actor over the last few decades, plays Beaumont's strong headed wife. She balances her male counterparts very well Hutton included. She's not stunning beautiful or curvy but she's a girl next door type, the average girl and that makes her really good at her role. Her and Hutton have great chemistry together. Michael Rooker is great in a small role as Stephen King character favorite Sheriff Alan Pangborn (played also by Ed Harris in Needful Things.) Also enjoyed Julie Harris in a small role as Beaumont's friend and mentor. I wish she had a bigger part in the picture.The Dark Half film achieves what is necessary to make a great Stephen King movie. It's dark, gruesome but also creepy, there is just this strange aura around it and everything unfolds perfectly. There is plenty of blood splattering gore for the horror fanatics and creepy genre inducing thrills for the thriller lover out there.

It doesn't really matter how the critics reviewed it, nor the fact that it lost money in the end. The most important element about this film is the storyline. The story itself is what carries the film, in my humble opinion, by virtue of its message alone. Overcoming adversity in one's life is the impetus behind the concept of the story, the sport itself is merely the visual aid, the vehicle. Granted, although it contains the element of a fantasy film, if you think about the forces involved whenever someone loses faith with his\/herself, and the painstaking attempt to gain back that faith, it all boils down to being one with nature, with one's life-force being in tune with all things around them. Much the way we seek solace whenever we pray to the Almighty, or ask for help from some 'higher power', Bagger Vance is the culmination of every force in nature. He is the sky, the earth, the wind and the water and is manifest in the form of a human being. The movie is such an inspiration for anyone seeking approbation or, more simply, just a good feeling.

Camp? Comedy? Noir? I just couldn't make sense of it, and so I dismissed it as something of a joke, as many people did at the time, and a BAD joke at that.Well I just saw it again this morning and I was astonished by how good this movie is. It is gorgeously made, in spite of a limited budget and a fast shooting schedule, masterfully edited and shot, every detail of set design, costume and makeup just exactly right, gorgeously acted by every single person in it, with perhaps the exception of Davis' daughter, BD Merrill (now known as BD Hyman, Christian teacher) who is excruciatingly bad in her tiny role. Everyone else is spot on, blazingly, terrifyingly honest and truthful in every single scene, even Crawford, who could be awfully phony sometimes. Davis's performance is a miraculous tour de force, brilliant in its technical mastery, acting with her entire body (she DID study dance with Martha Graham after all!), her face, her eyes, her voice, her hands, always true to the character and the moment, but still playing with a sense of style, which is the character's but also is the actor's. I don't think there's anyone now who could pull off something like this. Actors today lack the technique to do it, most of them.It's all done so well, with such utter seriousness of purpose by everyone involved, that I still didn't quite get why! One comment here, by one Robert Glass, explains it for me. These people were making an honest film about the Hollywood they knew, about PEOPLE they knew, about what that crazy level of fame does to the people who have it and the people who crave it. They were all of them familiar with this scene, they all knew people who had sunk into it or crawled their way out of it. This accounts for the almost documentary-style photography, with no cheating, no gauze filters or flattering lights. This accounts for cinematographer Ernie Haller, Bette's favorite, following her around for days with his camera, sometimes in the back seat, as she tooled around Los Angeles as Baby Jane in that gorgeous 1940 Lincoln convertible, in full Jane Hudson makeup and costume, just right for the character as written. Davis said, She's the kind of woman who doesn't wash her face, she just puts on another layer of makeup! And you know her through Davis' compassionate interpretation, and know why she is the way she is.Davis had looked at some of this before, giving a good, unflinching performance in The Star ten years before, but not as deeply and in not as good a film. Crawford had never done anything quite like this and she doesn't come across as honest with herself or as insightful as Davis does, though she is pretty honest (for Crawford) in the way she dresses and looks the part.But everyone else matches Davis's honesty, shot for shot and line for line and approaches this with the same utter seriousness. And now I know why.I'd suggest to everyone that they look at this picture again with all of this in mind.

Most of the first half of the film follows Rico as he undergoes basic training. He nearly quits after a fellow recruit dies due to a mistake he made, but as he is about to leave he learns that his home city of Buenos Aires has been wiped out in an attack from a distant world populated by huge insects.The action then switches to the bug planets where our heroes expect an easy victory over the supposedly mindless insects, unfortunately for them the planet is crawling with insects that can tear them apart and even attack ships in orbit. Later on they learn that Military Intelligence suspects that the insects are being led by a brain bug and are tasked with capturing one on a small planets where they had just suffered a major defeat at the hands of the bugs.While this film isn't perfect it is great entertainment, it also isn't as brainless as it might appear at first sight, I don't think it is a coincidence that some of the uniforms resemble those of the Third Reich. There is a slight let down in the fact that the main characters are a little too good looking and some of the acting isn't as good as it could be, it must be pointed out that this complaint doesn't include the excellent Michael Ironside who played the teacher who re-enlists to become the troops' Lieutenant.

There are only three stories in this film, all based on stories by Stephen King a wooden Indian statue seeks revenge for the death of his owners, four college students are terrorized in the middle of a lake by a mysterious black ooze, and a woman is tormented when she kills a hitchhiker in an accident. While the stories are entertaining, this movie isn't quite as good as the original.While all three stories are based on tales by Stephen King, the actual screenplay was written by George Romero (who gave up directing duties this time around), and it shows. There is a lot less humor this time around and horror has become the centerpiece. This film is missing all of the campiness that gave the original film it's style. Director Michael Gornick took a much more serious tone for his film and drops the colored lighting and odd camera angles in favor of a more realistic feel. In this case, that's one of the film's weaknesses because that is what made the original as fun as it was.My biggest problem with the film it bored me. Not the whole movie, but a good amount of it. The first and third tales (Old Chief Wood'nhead and The Hitchhiker) felt so long! I was bored halfway through their segments. The second segment (The Raft) was the only highlight to this movie; it had scares, some decent dialogue, and some nice gore effects. Another difference in the sequel was the lack of any real highlight performances from the cast. Lois Chiles was decent as Annie Lansing in the third segment, but it wasn't enough to keep the tale interesting. I thought the four college kids in the second segment felt genuine enough that the audience could root for them.Most of the performances, unfortunately, were less than entertaining; God, I hated the character of Fatso Gribbens (David Holbrook)...his voice\/acting grated on my nerves. I couldn't stand the new Creep either. He was a second-rate Cryptkeeper rip-off who popped in between stories for lame puns we all could've done without. All of these factors lead up to a mediocre sequel with some strong spots. Entertaining? Sure, a bit...if you can sit through the whole thing without nodding off.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"3 September 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Welcome to the 1980s. The 7th Heaven for the adolescent's ingenuous dreams. Some hate the 1980s; maybe because it has nothing to do with them nostalgically, or because the lost relationship between them and the *dreamer adolescent* inside them. For me, dancing with the 1980s is forever my hobby, my fun. Whatever the date is, I must enjoy something. Always romantic or meaningful. Its fever is still sweet and electrifying. This time, you may feel that the dancing floor has a beauty queen. Beautiful ? For sure, queen ? Not that sure ! This time, (The Karate Kid) meets the very noisy kids from (The Goonies), meets the honorable MTV ! Actually, the case wasn't that bad at all. You have some charismatic young martial arts fighter, some real dashing girl with charming, too sexy, presence; look at her eyes and her smile.. Pure magic (Taimak, Vanity.. Where are both of them now ?!), some shadows of comedy and action. Plus the fantasy factor. The formula looks nice, it has elements of a world I love. But OH MY GOD, some movies aren't meant to be made !The 1980s was overweight with too many fantasy adventures. For instance, at the same year of 1985 there were  (Red Sonja), (The Black Cauldron), (Ladyhawke), and (Legend). Though (The Last Dragon) didn't even have the opportunity to challenge them or else. But at least it's not the negative version of many innocent dreams that filled the era. It's like a rapid reverie among them.It was the right ambition in the wrong hands, or in the wrong way. While trying to achieve the ambition of one fantasy \/ musical \/ romance \/ comedy \/ action movie; serious hastiness seriously interrupted, to end up with a campy version of that ambition instead. It's the quick little of everything; knowing that it was so poor as well. In fact, the low budget transformed it into cheap comic-book.Let alone, few provocative elements  The storyline of the bad singer, the idiot characterization of the evil man, the savage presence of that 11 years kid who was screaming so faithfully and unbearably too Take your hands off my woman !! To tell you the truth, I hoped that the evil man cooks him and eats him fast enough ! I hated his acting, his role, or even his existence in life. Basically the role must have been for OLDER boy, but if we just bring up the subject of what was necessary to be here and wasn't, I think I'll exceed the limited space of reviewing movies on the IMDb ! Sorrowfully, the final result was bizarre mix of modern fairytale which has gone destitute, and one musical which has been miscarried.Still some moments, or echoes from the original ambition, are available. On the top of course is the great First Time on a Ferris Wheel by Smokey Robinson and Syreeta at the finale.

When it comes to ghost stories on film, there must be a complete combination of all the necessary elements for a film about ghosts to be anything more than mildly entertaining nonsense. The design must be good, the direction must be just about faultless, the acting must be convincing, the sound work must also be of a high quality. This combination is undoubtedly and understandably rare.I have seen countless horror films, among them many ghost stories, and none have made something as simple as walking in the dark as trying a task as The Haunting, where master director Robert Wise crafts an elegant, intelligent horror film, one which displays what is basically technical perfection when it comes to the way the film is edited (particularly the sound; there is absolutely nothing like watching this film in a dark and silent room late at night), photographed, and directed. It is so easy for even skilled directors to make choices that make hauntings seems silly rather than unsettling, but Robert Wise makes all the right choices here and no wrong ones. There are few better examples of suspense than certain scenes in The Haunting, particularly one sequence toward the end of the film, which features one of the most unsettling and heart-stopping 'jump moments' ever recorded on film, and we all know how hard it is for a horror movie to actually pull one of those off.The plot, taken from a novel by Shirley Jackson, is nothing to write home about. Take a bunch of characters and have them spend a couple of nights in a house with a dark history (haunted or not, Hill House doesn't sound like a pleasant place), and proceed to put the characters in 'scary' situations. What makes Oscar nominee Nelson Gidding's screenplay work is the complexity of the psychological profiles given to the characters. As a fan of The Haunting I have read many analyses of the characters in the film, especially the lead character Eleanor and the possibly clairvoyant Theo, and as different as many of them are, they are all still rooted in what is indisputably present in the film, and not in wild speculation. It is pointless to attempt to cover certain aspects of the film, or even just one of them, say the (arguably) implied lesbianism, in the body of this review as it would not only take too much space but also since there are many other resources available where the film is discussed in much greater detail than I can go into without discussing particular aspects of the film which someone who has not seen it would not want to know prior to doing so.Beyond the psychologically complex characters and their interesting interactions the film is just marvelous to look at. Having already commented on the technical quality of the film-making here, that still might not have been enough for this film to become the resounding success it is, as there was certainly the need for quality performances as well, and the acting here is superb from basically every cast member. Making a genuinely unsettling horror film is extremely hard in the first place, but making one about ghosts which manages to be completely unsettling basically from start to finish is a near impossible task. Robert Wise may not fit the auteur label, which is probably why he is not discussed as much as other great directors by film buffs and critics, but he is one of the most talented directors there were, and it is his The Haunting that remains the most unsettling ghost story ever put on film, and one of the five or so best horror films ever made.

It was mismarketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, instead of just a lame cop comedy. Whether or not this movie is mismarketed, it's still a horrible movie.In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology, and they talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he's given the case to work on, but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder, and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud.Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character, but by the end he is unbearable to listen to. For some reason along with being a detective, he's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. He does imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says, It's not my butt trumpet! Wow! What a puerile, immature line, even for a kid's movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film.This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When the futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome. The action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough, and as stated earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here.Having a dinosaur\/human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

On one side you can say it almost implies that you have to be ruthless and get what you want because no one's gonna give it to you. On the other side it shows so effectively how sooner or later the consequences of our careless actions catch up with us. It gives a brilliant multilayer message and lets you do the choosing. After all a message is only as good as it's receiver. This film will never get old. In a way it's a film about all of our lives because everyone can watch this film and relate to it whether you are rich or poor, young or old, i'm not sure i should say male or female.

Between the lines however this is a story about so many things besides selling drugs and killing people. What i love about this film is that it's message is whatever you make it out to be. On one side you can say it almost implies that you have to be ruthless and get what you want because no one's gonna give it to you. On the other side it shows so effectively how sooner or later the consequences of our careless actions catch up with us. It gives a brilliant multilayer message and lets you do the choosing. After all a message is only as good as it's receiver. This film will never get old. In a way it's a film about all of our lives because everyone can watch this film and relate to it whether you are rich or poor, young or old, i'm not sure i should say male or female. Anyway it's #1 in the genre mayn and it's a Masterpiece Chico!

All his life he has been looking for an opportunity which he finds on the streets of Miami. To him only time stands between him and the world and soon he goes right through the top. Money, Power, Respect, he gets it all only to learn that the hard part is not getting to the top but staying there. Pacino really gives everything he's got in this one and makes the part so his own that one can't help but wonder whether this movie would have been this good if it was someone else playing this role.

What happened??? The movie the acting and the plot was going great and then everything was gone!!! It was as if even the writers didn't know who the killer was, so they just gave up and ended the movie. If anyone has any ideas PLEASE let me know. Anywho, the movie is great and it keeps you guessing even passed the ended. Jack Nicholson is great as always (I'm a big Nicholson fan) and the acting is superb. If you're looking for a thriller that will keep you guessing, this is it. If you into a twist ending ( though not altogether pleasant) this your movie.
