[{"date":"26 March 2012","score":"","review":" Basic Story Guide Spoiler Alert (once again I am forced to spoil a few things about the movie, I humbly apologize but it is unavoidable)The movie begins in Hollywood were Cotton Weary is set to do a cameo in the upcoming movie Stab 3 Return to Woodsboro. But on his way home, he receives a phone call from none other than Ghostface, demanding the where abouts of Sidney Prescott. After not disclosing her location, Ghostface kills both Cotten and his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Sidney Prescott, living in total isolation, works as a crisis counselor, and is absolutely terrified that the murders will resume. Her fears are well founded as she learns about the murder of Cotton Weary. Meanwhile, Gale Weathers is approached Detective Mark Kincaid to show her a new development, and a change in Ghostface's pattern he left a photo at the murder scene of Cotton Weary of a young woman in her 20's. Gale recognizes the woman as none other than Maureen Prescott, Sidney's mother. Now, Sidney must confront not only the psychopath behind the mask, but a ghost of her own past, the woman she called mother. Verdict The final chapter of the horror movie trilogy that breathed life back into the slasher genre during the 90's was labored during this movie. Not saying its bad, but it's like eating too much ice cream, tastes good the first time you eat it (Scream), it's even good when it goes down (Scream 2) but then it hurts so much (Scream 3). It's above average at best, but it does rely on tired clichés. And there is one part that just made me want to scream (no pun intended). It was just way out there and although it is nothing major, it's just one of those things that doesn't belong in Scream. (spoiler) Basically put, a house EXPLODES! Why in the name of Hades would a house explode in a horror movie? When you take into account that this a horror movie that prides itself on meta humor, bloody violence and the like. It's just a mild irritation but still the movie itself is pretty good overall. The killer's identity is a bit of a stretch, but not impossible. This movie mostly deals with Sidney putting the past with her mother to rest and coming to terms with her. If you are a die hard Scream fan (such as myself) you will like this movie, but it won't win over any non-converts. An above finish to this film trilogy...or, like Creed's song at the end asks, Is this the end for us my friends?7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2012","score":"","review":" Basic Story Guide Spoiler Alert (once again I am forced to spoil a few things about the movie, I humbly apologize but it is unavoidable)The movie begins in Hollywood were Cotton Weary is set to do a cameo in the upcoming movie Stab 3 Return to Woodsboro.

But one night, while a teenager is settling down to watch a horror movie, she receives a phone call from an unknown person. At first, its all innocent flirting from both person on the phone and your girl. Until, he begins stalking her, with repeated phone calls. (spoiler, if you wish to remain in the dark, do not read) After an extended amount of time, young Casey, and her boyfriend are both murdered. Enter Sidney Prescott, an average teenager of who is still recovering from the tragic murder of her mother a year prior. The murderer, Cotton Weary has been placed in prison, is awaiting the death sentence. As she begins to put her life back together from this traumatic event, she then receives phone call from an unknown person. Sidney finally realizes she is in the cross hairs of a killer who is relentless, and that she may have placed the wrong person in prison for her mothers murder.Verdict This movie is my all time favorite. The acting in it is convincing, the plot is throughly engaging, and the characters are absolutely enjoyable. Although I will say this (spoiler alert for a certain event in the movie) by the time the party scene starts up, it's almost like it has out of steam, and then it picks back up, so be prepped for that. But this movie is my all time favorite horror movie for three reasons 1.) The main character had a back story to her, and the movie had a plot. It wasn't some nihilistic movie like Hostel or something along those lines where someone is standing on a street corner and is abducted by a deranged psychopath, and plunged into violent circumstances.2.) The movie has a balance of both comedy and horror. One moment you are laughing, the next you are jumping in your seat. And the characters themselves are lovable, even the killer. They literally grow on you.3.) This movie breathed life back into the slasher genre, most of the movies were sub-par, but none-the-less, effective and creative. Urban Legends, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Cherry Falls being a few that stick out in my mind.Overall, an awesome movie, and I am grateful for seeing this movie. Thank you Wes Craven for making this historical movie.10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2012","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Some of the basic story guide spoils some of the movie, but I needed an good intro, and this was as good as I could make it.Basic Story Guide Spoiler Alert (some of the introducing paragraph spoils certain aspect of the beginning scene, if you wish to remain in the dark, read from Enter Sidney Prescott,) Woodsboro, a town settled far away from the more violent and notorious states of California, such as L.A., or Oakland.

Think about it. What would you do? Drive a 600 horsepower, supercharged dune buggy that gets 3 mpg or ride a horse. Gasoline supplies would deplete after about a month. Hoarding gas will not work. (it goes bad after about a year of storage) Most people raised in big cities would starve within a couple of months due to lack of survival education or tyranny by people with guns.Secondly, In the film, Costner ends up being the hero in the way that real hero's do. Hero's aren't the people who are tough and beautiful. They're people who are forced into a situation and do the best they can. He starts the new government purely by accident. The only real mistake I see in this movie is that in the beginning, Costner is portrayed as being weak and unable to defend himself.
