I also find it hard to believe that I was also only a year old when this movie came out and strangely enough, the special effects have held up quite well since 1986.As many of you already know, Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first encounter with the deadly alien. Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) is floating through space in hypersleep. Her escape pod is picked up by a deep-space salvage crew. She wakes up in a hospital where she meets Carter Burke(played with the right amount distrustworthiness by Paul Reiser) who informs Ripley about how long she has been floating in space. He also tells her that the Yutani Corporation has funded colonization of LV-426, the planet that the Nostromo(the ship from the first Alien film) landed on. Burke later shows up at Ripley's room with Lt. Gorman(William Hope) and tells her that contact has been lost with LV-426. Ripley tells them that it was the aliens had probably gotten the colonists. As her nightmares continue, she becomes convinced that the only way to end her nightmares is to go to the planet and see that the creatures are eliminated. So she goes. We next see her on the military ship, The Sulaco. She sees that many of the marines are very confident that they will succeed in their mission of exterminating the aliens. The marines include Hicks(Michael Biehn), Hudson(Bill Paxton), Vasquez(Jenette Goldstein), Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews), Drake(Mark Rolston), and an android(Lance Henriksen). They go to the planet and Ripley becomes a sort of surrogate mother to a lonely and terrified little girl named Newt(Carrie Henn). Newt tells that the aliens were in fact responsible for the disappearance of the colonists. Soon after, all hell breaks loose as each marine is picked off in the alien hive, thus leaving a only a small group of survivors.Aliens is probably one of the best movies to come during the eighties. Sigourney Weaver deserved the Oscar for best actress. The supporting performances are great also especially Bill Paxton who plays the frightened Hudson. He is probably my favorite character in the movie. Special praise should go to director James Cameron for keeping the action slick and the tension always mounting. I also think it was pretty clever with the film editing that made it look like that hundreds of aliens were all over the place when in actuality only six costumes were used. That's pretty tight.One gripe that I do have with the Alien films in general, are the aliens themselves which I think, are the most overlooked part of these movies. The aliens are the heart and soul of these films, but come off most of the time as just a really cool looking special effect.

It may be because of the fact that it managed to stretch out the relatively simple premise of a retarded serial killer to 9 films (with another one upcoming that takes place in the far future, no less!).  I mean, take Jason's first appearance, which featured him with a pillow over his head, and then take at a look at Jason Goes to Hell, in which Jason is a semi-supernatural being with the ability to hop into other people's bodies.  The series has evolved quite a bit, if you ask me.  It will be odd to see how different the latest sequel will be than say, Part 3, which is pretty much the same as the first two, only this time Jason has his hockey mask and the girls are better-looking.The film takes place only several hours after the events of the previous movie.  The focus is on a group of teens headed to a farmhouse not far from Camp Crystal Lake for a weekend of sex and fun.  These teens are the basic slasher cliche characters, ranging from the heroine to the geeky loser who seems to p*** everyone off.  The heroine is Chris (Dana Kimmell), who actually once encountered Jason.  She's having trouble adjusting to being in a forest and heads out into the woods(!) with her friend Rick while everyone else stays behind at the house.  Jason then arrives and begins his massive slaughter. The story is as simple as that.With a plot that's basically a carbon-copy of the previous two films, it feels a little odd to review what is pretty much the same movie over again. For 70 minutes,  the movie is every bit as boring as Part 2, due mainly to Steve Miner's inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going.  His direction hasn't improved much at all (only in the finale, which I'll get to in a moment) and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film.There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands.  But these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense, and what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score (It's a little funny to note that the score sounds a bit like the one from The Thing, so Morricone might have received a little inspiration from these films).  It's interesting to note that Part 3 was made in 3-D upon its original theatrical release, which probably explains the numerous scenes of knives and other dangerous objects maniacally waved in front of the screen. I'll admit, if I had seen this movie in the 3-D enhancement, I probably would have found a lot of these scenes more entertaining, but without the gimmick, it's almost a complete bore.The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.  The most laughable effect is the literal eye-popping scene that was obviously shot to get a reaction out of the 3-D viewing audience.  It just looks fake now.

Though I hate to sound shallow, this cast is easier to bear than the previous installments because Dana Kimmell and Catherine Parks do make for very good eye candy, and at least they're both better than the horrendous Amy Steel, a scream queen who seems to have her fans despite having all the acting skill and charisma of cardboard.But there is a reason why I rate this above Part 2 (and probably the original Friday the 13th, too) despite how much my criticism seems to place it on the exact same level as that film.  It's because of the last 20 minutes, which features the typical climactic chase where Jason moves around trying to get at our heroine.

The focus is on a group of teens headed to a farmhouse not far from Camp Crystal Lake for a weekend of sex and fun.  These teens are the basic slasher cliche characters, ranging from the heroine to the geeky loser who seems to p*** everyone off.  The heroine is Chris (Dana Kimmell), who actually once encountered Jason.

The story is as simple as that.With a plot that's basically a carbon-copy of the previous two films, it feels a little odd to review what is pretty much the same movie over again. For 70 minutes,  the movie is every bit as boring as Part 2, due mainly to Steve Miner's inability to build up any good scares or shocks as well as the fact that he takes too long to get the movie going.  His direction hasn't improved much at all (only in the finale, which I'll get to in a moment) and he's certainly not helping himself by not trying anything new or different in this film.There are a few memorable death scenes, particularly one guy who gets slashed in half when he's walking around on his hands.  But these moments aren't built up to particularly well, there's no sense of dread and almost no suspense, and what little of it is there is mainly because of Harry Manfredini's very effective and creepy Ennio Morricone-esque score (It's a little funny to note that the score sounds a bit like the one from The Thing, so Morricone might have received a little inspiration from these films).  It's interesting to note that Part 3 was made in 3-D upon its original theatrical release, which probably explains the numerous scenes of knives and other dangerous objects maniacally waved in front of the screen. I'll admit, if I had seen this movie in the 3-D enhancement, I probably would have found a lot of these scenes more entertaining, but without the gimmick, it's almost a complete bore.The gore effects are in more abundance than in the previous two films, but they still look rather cheesy sometimes.

Why did they suddenly come out of the blue and throughout the film even newer, different types were revealed without any explanation. How does the wounded soldier robot work? Do they act normal until they are wounded or do they already know what they have to do, and if so why did he do things to protect them (i.e Becker killing the child screamer with them).The ending was the biggest disappointment though - predictable and it just kept dragging on and on! These robots just kept popping up from nowhere trying to stop him getting away (e.g where the hell did the 2nd Jessica come from??)If they expanded and enlightened us on a few things, maybe this film would've been slightly better.

And it's an interesting, and almost shocking, statement about society then and now that she's so willing to take him back after what he's done.  On top of it all, you have one of the ultimate examples of good (Shearer) triumphing over evil (Joan Crawford).  Plus, like all great classic films, there is a brilliant supporting cast that provides even more laughs and never a dull moment.

Let's face it. What film IS?! Red Dragon was a masterpiece and so is Manhunter.To appreciate that there are two issues. Firstly, the film was created in 1986. It's stylised and looks slightly dated. The soundtrack is excellent but again very 1980's. Secondly, Red Dragon was not an easy book to write a screenplay for. There is way too much information that made the book so enthralling to squeeze in to 2 hours.The cinematography, in particular the clever use of light and colours, is breathtaking. The choice of locations was also very deliberate. The scene where Will is running out of the building after speaking to Hannibal Lecter. They chose a building with a long spiral ramp down. The ramp is white, clinical. Running down the ramp is like those dreams where the bad man is chasing you and you can't get away. Will runs his heart out but doesn't get very far.I agree that Cox plays a different Lecter but then the book wasn't about Lecter. There was some mention made but Lecter in this film is very much a Cameo appearance. The way in which Will goes about catching the killer is every bit as clever as Starling's methods, if not more so. In addition, we are treated to the thoughts, the inner monologue, the frustration and triumph of a hunter.Make no mistake, if you expect an up-to-date movie as good in every respect as the book, you'll be disappointed.

However I feel that people are unnecessarily harsh on the film due to the success it recieved at the academy awards. It beat Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption to the Best Picture Oscar and has been criticised since. All three films are superb movies in their own right, ( Shawshank just shading it as my favourite), and should be enjoyed on their own merits rather than on what they prevented others doing.I may be wrong but I feel a lot of the criticism of the film is due to the academy awards and that if Forrest Gump had won on a different year it would not suffer the criticism it does.Anyway on with the film. Hanks was brilliant as usual and the support players especially Sinise, and Williamson will live long in the memory. OK towards the end there are too manny references on how Forrest misses Jenny ( e.g naming the boat )but overall I think Robert Zemeckis balances out the emotional with the humorous and it is close to a perfect film.1994 was truly a great film and the arguments about who should have won will go on and on, just be grateful that 3 splendid films came out together.

First, I'm amazed that it got past the development stage.

(I'm a comic, so trust me when I say things have eased up again in terms of what you can and can't get away with.) This film took b*lls to make. I'm surprised no one insisted that D-Fens should have a chemical imbalance that forced him to act this way. Whatever Hollywood stuff creeps into the film is there by necessity, and even then I think it's minimal.-- That it's racist. People, do you actually think the folks who made it didn't know that?

To have the main character take such negative, life-altering action, and yet to be ambiguous enough that it lets you draw your own conclusions, well, I think that's gutsy. How often does a film portray things so wrong and leave open a window so people might find them right? You ain't gonna get a flick like this every year, so appreciate it.
