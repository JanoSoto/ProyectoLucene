He was the most renowned and most skilled chess master who ever lived. His level of expertise at the game of chess could be matched by no one but himself. He was a legend to that world, but only revered because of his ability at chess. Apart from that he was a detached and solitary individual who obviously had some sort of mental deficiency that kept him from connecting with the real world. Thus his world was all chess. Searching for Bobby Fischer is the story of Josh Waitzkin, another chess master who was discovered long after Bobby Fischer. Josh unexpectedly discovers that he has a unique gift in playing chess and so the pressure from all different people sets in for him to become the best. The title of the film is Searching for Bobby Fischer, but in the context of the film the title literally means searching for the next Bobby Fischer. These pressures and goals Josh must face send us through an interesting, yet very subdued story.Searching for Bobby Fischer is very slow, but appropriately slow. Not a ton actually happens in the film as it is much more character driven. There are a lot of different characters in the film that each drive different plot lines. The film takes a while to get going because of the different characters that have be introduced, and are introduced very slowly and drawn out. Because of this early character development, there's a lot of build up necessary before the first actual conflicts of the film arise. It is almost an hour into the film before we get to see these conflicts start to take shape and affect the storyline. You have to stick with this film to get the full effect of it, which is worth it in the end. I can also commend the story for being very focused but also broad. The stories obviously centers around chess, but as it goes along it becomes more about Josh's relationships with the various people in his life, more so than anything else. The main theme of the film eventually molds into character relationships, as each character seems to have a clear cut relation with the others in order to fully flesh them all out and make them interesting.The storyline works in such a way that it is easy for it to elicit emotional responses out of its audience, so because of this I felt a little less drawn in. I didn't feel much emotion throughout the film and most of the time I just had to take it for what it was. Speaking from a personal standpoint, it isn't the most fascinating kind of story for me, but it doesn't mean it wasn't a well made film. It is very high quality with all the necessary aspects to make it a notable film. The direction is very subdued and avoids anything flashy or grand, but it keeps the flow of the film nice and smooth. The dialouge also keeps with the silky smooth theme of the film, and it is delivered by some very fine actors.All the actors do a very nice job in their respective roles. The main character, Josh Waitzkin, is only seven years old and for a child actor does a decent job. He was very sophisticated for his age and didn't always feel like a kid, but maybe that was the intention of the film. He probably was a fairly detached boy, just like Bobby Fischer, and so he didn't seem like what we think of when we think seven year old boy. And yet the film also spent a lot of time focusing on Josh's balance between chess and growing up like a normal kid, so his attitude wasn't always fitting. Plus he seems like he is on depressants for the entire film. The rest of the cast is A-list and does a great job. Joe Mantegna as Josh's father does a great job as a character trying to balance out his life much in the same way Josh is balancing his. His father must balance his want for his son to be a great chess player, but he also wants his son to live a normal childhood without all of the extreme pressures of chess. Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne both play mentors to Josh, but with very different personalities. Kingsley is an old retired chess master who is very by the book and rigid in his teaching. Fishburne is much more free and sees the game of chess as a much more surreal and introspective experience. The contrast between these two characters is very interesting to watch unfold.Searching for Bobby Fischer is a good film, not a great film, just a good film. It has all the necessary components that make good films. The direction is smart, the dialouge is crisp, and the acting is fantastic. From a personal standpoint this wasn't the most gripping or emotionally moving film for me, but for others I can definitely see how it would be. This film can be enjoyed a lot more than I enjoyed it because it is a good film and there are a lot of good things going for it. But as far as I'm concerned, it was one of those films that I watch, enjoy enough to feel like it was worth my two hours, but then I never watch it again.

While it's not an absolutely terrible movie, this sequel to the first two, hugely successful, films suffers from a few major problems.Problem one &#x96; no Macaulay Culkin. He may not be the best, or even cutest, kid actor in the world but Culkin was the undeniable star of the Home Alone movies and so setting up a story in which some other kid (young Alex, played by Alex D. Linz) has to stay at home on his own thanks to a case of the measles just isn't going to please those who wanted more of Culkin's antics.Problem two &#x96; no Daniel Stern or Joe Pesci. The baddies of the piece are a bunch of agents (three men and one woman) who are after a special chip that has been placed in a remote control car given to Alex by one of his neighbours. The actors all do fairly well with their roles but they're no match for the gut-busting physical comedy that Stern was able to showcase in the previous films.Problem three &#x96; it stretches believability, even for a Home Alone movie, in places and the complexity of some of the booby traps here make the kid look more like a new MacGyver than a new Macaulay.But for those not feeling overly precious about things and willing to give it a go, these problems can also be turned around and viewed as positive. At least with a different kid as the focus of the attention we don't have to try to believe that the same thing would keep happening again and again to little Kevin McCallister and Alex D. Linz is quite a likable little moppet so that also works in the film's favour.And while we're lacking The Wet\/Sticky Bandits we at least get double the amount of victims trying to navigate their way through numerous, inventive booby-traps. Olek Krupa, Rya Kihlstedt, Lenny von Dohlen and David Thornton may have weaker material to work with but they still provide a good mix of menace and idiocy.The other big bonus for the movie is that, although it's inherently repetitive when compared to the concept of it's predecessors, it doesn't identically replicate moments as the second film did. This means that things feel familiar but also a little fresher this time around.The cast all do well enough and there's the lovely Haviland Morris playing Alex's mother while a very young Scarlett Johansson appears in the role of big sis, so completist fans may be interested in this for that reason alone.Director Gosnell doesn't do anything spectacular but he's far from incompetent and paces the film well while leading everyone towards that big, trap-laden finale that we all want to see. An easy film for fans of the first two to be harsh towards, this actually makes for mildly amusing family fun and I'm sure it would keep some kids happy on a dreary afternoon stuck indoors.

It was the most complicated crime movie that I'd seen from before 1960. I thought that the intricate bank job plan was really interesting. All of the actors gave great performances and the characters were all very interesting. I especially liked the sharp-shooter character. I thought the way he spoke was cool. I'm not sure if that's the way the actor really spoke or if it was just acting. I liked it because it was interesting and I thought it gave the film some extra realism.

The story is straightforward enough. A former SS officer Max (Dirke Bogarde) goes into hiding as a night porter at a hotel. He lives a gloomy, uneventful life until one day he sees a former concentration camp inmate, the beautiful Lucia (Charlotte Rampling), in the hotel lobby. He becomes obsessed with her because all the memories he had about torturing and molesting this young girl come to the fore again and he wishes to relive them. But more than that Lucia wants to relive those experiences too, though whether this is because she has not quite recovered from her Stockholm syndrome experience is a question that this film chooses wisely not to answer. What follows is a perverse, strange, painful and sad love affair that eventually ends in tragedy.If this movie was entrusted to typical Hollywood actors, it could have been a disaster. But Dirke Bogarde gives a mesmerizing performance as the cold, tortured, perverse and somewhat loving (though it almost always comes out the wrong way)night porter, Max. He not only delivers very complicated lines in a very believable way (imagine someone else saying the lines he was given without sounding scripted and you will see what I mean), but he even draws in the audience with something as simple as his facial expressions. Charlotte Rampling is also extraordinary as Lucia. She does not have many lines, but she does give a remarkable performance nonetheless which consists of strange body language that forces the audience to ask themselves what she is thinking.But the truly great achievement of this film is that Dirke and Charlotte force you to care about Max and Lucia and their love affair, even though their lifestyle is so perverse, so masochistic and so different from our own. Film director Pier Paolo Pasolini tried to make a perverse and sado-masochistic film called Salo (1975), but his film was quickly brought done by its own disgusting subject matter in large part because he failed to create characters that we could actually give a damn about. But Cavani has created a film that does that. So even though the subject matter is perverse, cruel and disgusting, it has a logic all its own that intelligent viewers can appreciate. Even though this film's plot challenges social mores, the characters still inspire sympathy. The Night Porter is about people behaving in perverse, sometimes cruel, sometimes disgusting and often degrading ways, but at the same time it talks about these things without becoming a degrading and disgusting movie. The Night Porter is a challenging, profound and brilliant film.

Also known as ID4 this movie starts out with a scene of the first man on the moon and that the American's came in peace for all mankind. On July 2nd aliens from another planet enter the earth's atmosphere with their mother spaceship and many other smaller spacecraft attached. They plan to invade and destroy the world starting with all major cities. At first the Americans try to come in peace and send a message to the alien mother ship. They respond by blowing up the helicopter and all other surrounding aircraft. At this time president Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) learns by help of David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) that the aliens are using our own satellite system against us and will destroy the world in a short period of time. The president then orders everyone to leave the cities and prepare for destruction. Then the alien's strike they blow up and destroy major cities all around the world in their first attack. The United States set up a counter attack to destroy the mother ship when they learn that the alien space craft has a protective shield that none of our weapons can penetrate. U.S. air force captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is one of the only few survivors in this counter attack and he beings down a small alien space craft and captures an alien and brings him to a secret lab\/ army base called area 51. The aliens continue destroying cities and president Whitmore is forced to engage in nuclear warfare with the aliens to destroy them. However the protective shield around the alien space craft cannot be penetrated by a nuclear bomb. Many of Americans have died at this point and the president and every other world leader is distressed. At this point David Levinson who figured out they were using the worlds satellite system against us realizes that the protective shield around the space craft's works off of an advanced computer system. By giving that system a computer virus the shield will be dropped and then the military can attack them. They plan an attack with the whole world on many different space craft because once the mother ship is infected with the virus then all the smaller ships will be also. Capitan Steven Hiller teams up with David and Steven will fly the recovered alien spacecraft from area 51 into the mother ship and David will implant the computer virus. The rest of able Americans and other pilots around the world are ready to attack. Once inside the mother ship Steven and David get locked in to the system and implant the virus. Their protective shields are now ineffective and the Americans begin to attack the smaller ships. They destroy them and then Capitan Hiller and David set off their nuclear bomb in the mother ship and they fly out in their spacecraft. The mother ship explodes into millions of pieces and David and Steven make a safe landing back on earth and return to their families. The aliens have been defeated. The central theme of this movie is heart and never giving up. The human race did not give up once on fighting for their freedom. Even after many counter attacks failed they proved that they were not going to go down without a fight and they all came together and worked together to save their world from destruction. Throughout this movie the sound effects of the explosions and the flying shrapnel and fire make this movie very realistic. After many counter attacks have failed you can see the distress on the president's face in a close up when he gives the order to nuke them. Overall this movie is very well written, action packed and very realistic. Watching this movie feels like you are really there and you become part of it because it is so intense.

His unfinished project was taken on by his long-time cinematic pal, the illustrious Steven Spielberg, who as a tribute to the great director of Dr. Strangelove (1964), 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), decided to complete the film for him.Written by Spielberg based on Kubrick's early material and vision, Artificial Intelligence is at times brilliant and immensely thought-provoking. As a science-fiction film, this is one of the genre's better Hollywood entries. It may have suffered scathing criticisms from people who disliked the extended ending (which I admire and will try to rationalize its importance), but it remains to be a very well-told and identifiable story that has its roots in Pinocchio and realist fantasy.The story tells of a robot boy called David (Haley Joel Osment) who is brought home by a loving couple to replace their comatose son, Martin, who would never wake. Set in the distant future, the creation of David, a mechanical human-like companion who is programmed to love, turns self-aware and seeks to become a real human after the miraculous recovery of Martin leads to a competition for love from Monica (Frances O'Connor), their mother. Because of a series of misunderstandings, David is left to survive on his own outside the comfort of home together with Teddy, a talking toy bear who can think.For most parts, Artificial Intelligence is a film chronicling the journey of one persevering robot as he attempts to find his Blue Fairy who he hopes would turn him into a human so that he could return to Monica and be loved again. The existentialist nature of Spielberg's film allows viewers to question the idea of human consciousness. What makes us humanly real? Is it because we can differentiate truth from falsehood? Or is it because we are living flesh and blood? By similar extension, what makes a Mecha humanlike? Is it because they look human? Or is it because of their capability for reciprocal compassion and love? Spielberg's direction is mostly assured, and with Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List, 1993; Saving Private Ryan, 1998) photographing the film, expect a visual feast for the eyes. The use of visual effects, which is nominated for an Oscar here, while unabashedly cool, retains a measure of hypnotic allure. There are moments in the film in which only Spielberg could have conjured up. For instance, the shot of Teddy's silhouette against a huge, bright moon, which references E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982).In addition, the heavily-criticized final thirty minutes features some impressive visuals, with one particular moment evidently a homage to Kubrick's 2001 &#x96; that of a box-like vehicle floating across a desolate icy landscape. Speaking of which, it is with an acute sense of irony to note that the final act was what Kubrick had actually envisioned &#x96; the idea of moving thousands of years into the future &#x96; faithfully and boldly recreated by Spielberg but unfortunately thought of as overindulging in Hollywood sentimentality.In my view, I feel that the final act is very important as it gives the film the closure that it needs &#x96; a measured, subtle, (and even meandering) philosophical ending that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but offers composer John Williams to finally perform the full main theme in all of its beauty and melancholy, which until then has only been heard in parts. Artificial Intelligence is an engaging science-fiction adventure that melds Kubrick's chilly bleakness with Spielberg's warm touch. But for better or worse, it is the latter's imprint that is more influential here.GRADE A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.

Because of a series of misunderstandings, David is left to survive on his own outside the comfort of home together with Teddy, a talking toy bear who can think.For most parts, Artificial Intelligence is a film chronicling the journey of one persevering robot as he attempts to find his Blue Fairy who he hopes would turn him into a human so that he could return to Monica and be loved again. The existentialist nature of Spielberg's film allows viewers to question the idea of human consciousness. What makes us humanly real? Is it because we can differentiate truth from falsehood? Or is it because we are living flesh and blood? By similar extension, what makes a Mecha humanlike? Is it because they look human? Or is it because of their capability for reciprocal compassion and love? Spielberg's direction is mostly assured, and with Janusz Kaminski (Schindler's List, 1993; Saving Private Ryan, 1998) photographing the film, expect a visual feast for the eyes. The use of visual effects, which is nominated for an Oscar here, while unabashedly cool, retains a measure of hypnotic allure. There are moments in the film in which only Spielberg could have conjured up. For instance, the shot of Teddy's silhouette against a huge, bright moon, which references E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982).In addition, the heavily-criticized final thirty minutes features some impressive visuals, with one particular moment evidently a homage to Kubrick's 2001 &#x96; that of a box-like vehicle floating across a desolate icy landscape. Speaking of which, it is with an acute sense of irony to note that the final act was what Kubrick had actually envisioned &#x96; the idea of moving thousands of years into the future &#x96; faithfully and boldly recreated by Spielberg but unfortunately thought of as overindulging in Hollywood sentimentality.In my view, I feel that the final act is very important as it gives the film the closure that it needs &#x96; a measured, subtle, (and even meandering) philosophical ending that not only tugs at the heartstrings, but offers composer John Williams to finally perform the full main theme in all of its beauty and melancholy, which until then has only been heard in parts. Artificial Intelligence is an engaging science-fiction adventure that melds Kubrick's chilly bleakness with Spielberg's warm touch.

His unfinished project was taken on by his long-time cinematic pal, the illustrious Steven Spielberg, who as a tribute to the great director of Dr. Strangelove (1964), 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), decided to complete the film for him.Written by Spielberg based on Kubrick's early material and vision, Artificial Intelligence is at times brilliant and immensely thought-provoking. As a science-fiction film, this is one of the genre's better Hollywood entries.

Limited, resourceful, and yet makes mountains out of molehills. I also love David Mamet and I could listen to his expert dialouge for hours on end. So how could I not love this film? Sure if you dissect it, it has some issues, but I can't help but love everything it does. The movie only has three characters. Dustin Hoffman is Teach, a bitter and cynical man whose friend is Don, played by Dennis Franz. Don owns a junk shop and also looks out for Bob, a street kid with a lot of issues. When Teach and Don learn that they might have been jipped out of some very valuable coins they decide they're going to go steal the coins back. The plan reveals the dark inner turmoil the three characters feel and it is ultimately their quest to find meaning and purpose in a world that has hung them out to dry. It's a story of futile human desperation delivered through snappy and quick witted dialouge that I found fascinating.It's imperative to mention that this film is only dialouge. There is no action, no special effects, and not even a change in scenery. I might be crazy for saying this, but I loved it. It was an extremely interesting watch to see what could be accomplished on an existential level with so little tangible material. The film was originally a stage play written by David Mamet that he adapted into a screenplay with little to no changes in his near perfect dialouge. Because of the little change in location and the unusually small cast of three I get the feeling the film works better as a stage play, but having never seen the stage version, the movie was a great watch unto itself. Everything is kept very simple and all of the focus was on the actors and the dialouge they delivered making the movie very unconventional, so much to the point where it doesn't really feel like a movie. But this uniqueness is what I enjoyed so much about the film, just out of personal love for the strange and different.Now I will admit that if the film had not had good actors to back up Mamet's sharp edged dialouge, American Buffalo would have been an awful, dreary, and pathetically boring film. But the three main, and only, actors in the film keep it lively and interesting from start to finish. Hoffman and Franz work together as a perfect duo and their contrast in characteristic give the film a lot of its deep perplexity on the human condition. Nelson isn't in the movie as much as Hoffman and Franz, but when he is present he does a great job, and his character is very important to the progression of the story. The actors do a lot of justice to the ingenious dialouge of this film.There isn't much more to say about American Buffalo. There isn't a whole lot to the film, but what elements it does possess are fantastic. The dialouge and acting is brilliant, and there isn't much more to the movie. I honestly loved how different of a movie experience this was, and can give the movie nothing but props for making me think and delivering to me such a unique experience.

Whether his writer's block was a result of his alcoholism or that he's taken to the bottle because of it is never firmly established with viewers. It's a moot point anyway as far as director\/writer Blake Edwards is concerned. Alcohol has driven Zach over the edge and he's in big trouble. The fact that he's able to easily charm his way into one brief sexual encounter after another and get by with his obvious intelligence only compounds his problems. Yet his sexual escapades and disheveled lifestyle contribute to some of the most hilarious scenes ever filmed in a movie. The real funny thing, however, is that Skin Deep is actually a serious film posing as a standard Blake Edwards slapstick farce; its underlying theme is about the main character's desperate and dire situation. Zach is spiraling towards suicide even faster than he drives his sportscar. So why are we laughing? Others in the cast include Alyson Reed as Zach's estranged and exasperated wife Alexandra. She provides some gravitas to the film as does the great Nina Foch (Zach's not too happy mother-in-law). Zach has been a huge disappointment to both of them and it's written all over their faces. Julianne Phillips (Bruce Springsteen's first wife) has a nice role as one of Zach's almost serious relationships. The best secondary role is reserved for Michael Kidd as Zach's psychiatrist Doctor Westford. His simple but critical advice near the end of the movie saves our hero from complete disaster. You know what I tell alcoholics when they want me to help them? I tell them to STOP DRINKING. At last, his terse words of wisdom have an immediate and sobering effect on Zach and the recovery of his life begins. Skin Deep plays like a combination of two of Edwards' very popular and earlier films, The Days of Wine and Roses and Ten. One minute it's deadly serious and in the next it's a rip roaring comedy-of-errors. The balance is a delicate one and without the sure-handed direction of Blake Edwards, the movie would've fallen flat on its face. As it turned out, Skin Deep was nowhere near a hit at the box office. That's too bad because the film is one of the better ones in Blake Edwards' career and certainly could use a reappraisal. Also, John Ritter never gave a finer performance than he did in this movie. That fact alone should prompt interested viewers to find this film before it gets lost in the archives.

It reached out and tried something new, which helped make the film a huge success.

The film is primarily about emasculation, how we have come to live in a world of shopping, with there being nothing left to hunt, and the dull lives we lead because of it, slaves to the IKEA nesting instinct.The film is a dark, stylish thriller and, despite the movie's film noir facade it gives off the feel that you're not watching your garden-variety detective movie. There's a deep sense of foreboding that's never completely realized until the last forty minutes of the film and after it you're left with the near-uncontrollable desire to watch it again.To sum it all up, the movie is impressive and will undoubtedly leave you with something, whatever it might, after it's all over. The acting is great and it is ,without a doubt, one of the most unforgettable films I've ever watched.

It has been a bit difficult to find in recent years but it turned up last night on MGM's new HD channel. I enjoyed it the first couple of times but, at this third viewing, I enjoyed it even more. It does not seem to have lost any of it's originality over the last 30 years and maybe it just strikes a resonance with my 30 years older self.The film appears to be autobiographical with the Allen character being named Sandy Bates. He attends a weekend retrospective of his films where he is constantly hounded by admiring fans. There are flashbacks to his Brooklyn childhood and also to the great love of his life with Dorrie, played by a frighteningly twitchy Charlotte Rampling. He has a dalliance with Daisy, radiantly played by Jessica Harper, who seems to remind him of Dorrie. He is joined by his current lover Isobel, serenely played by Marie-Christine Barrault who seems to offer him the prospect of stability with a ready-made family.Stardust Memories reminds me of Fellini's 8½ in both style and content. When asked, at a question and answer session if one of his films is an homage, his friend Tony replies An homage? Not exactly, we just stole the idea outright. I think that is Woody getting his retaliation in first. Similarly the comment that we keep on getting from fans that they love his films particularly the early, funny ones. The other film that came to mind was the 1997 documentary Wild Man Blues. In real life Woody also seems to be constantly accosted by people telling him that they are his greatest fan.The film has some great one-liners, most of which are listed in the quotes section on this page so I will not repeat them. As usual there is some wonderful music, notably Django playing Body and Soul and Louis Armstrong playing Stardust. It also has considerable psychological insight. There is a touching scene when Sandy describes a moment of happiness gazing at the woman he loves while listening to Louis Armstrong. I suppose that's better than gazing at Louis Armstrong while listening to the woman you love.On a couple of occasions in this film Woody continues his lifelong endorsement of masturbation. For example &#x85; only art you can control. Art and masturbation. Two areas in which I am an absolute expert. I cannot imagine that it is chance that his character is named Bates. Presumably in the childhood flashbacks he is Master Bates.

Every step of the time travel, whether backwards of forwards, is logically explained as life or death, and this jaunt to 1885 fits perfectly into the world of Doc Brown and his slacker apprentice. It was a great idea for the writers to include objects from various points in history so the characters, and the audience, can see the results of the antics the heroes get into immediately. Things like pictures of tombstones, newspapers, etc. allow the outcomes to be shown on screen without more exposition than is necessary. Hats off to Spielberg, Zemeckis and Gale for allowing the audience to join them on a 3 part adventure that will truly be timeless, and each generation will rediscover. I know this isn't too much about the 3rd film, but what is there to say at this point? It's a fitting ending to a deftly manicured tale of heroics in unlikely places and from unlikely sources.
