We all know that Jurassic Park is a big title for modern audiences, but there is a lot more to a movie than just selling the name. It almost seems as though the movie was bad on purpose, just because the producers knew that they could get away with it and still make money. That is how sad the film industry has become. Don't you as an audience member want something more than just a quick put together of random effects? Don't you want to be really entertained instead of just being fooled into it?

But let me tell you, in its respective genre, a summer blockbuster can still be a good summer blockbuster or a bad summer blockbuster.

You just have to experience. All the reviews you read and all talk you hear will not do it justice.The plot is simple (at first) as we have a person, Leonard, whose wife was raped and murdered and he was attacked during the incident. The whole incident (either the hit by the attacker or the traumatizing effect of seeing his wife die) left him with this illness. He lost his short term memory. He cannot form any new memories. Several times in the movie we see Lenny (Leonard) doing something, and as soon as he loses focus for several seconds, he forgets what he was doing. At one point he is being chased by an armed man, he gets tangled in a few obstacles and when he comes out of them he can't remember why he is running, he sees this man running on the opposite side of the building and he thinks he is chasing that man, as he starts running at him the man pulls out his gun and starts firing.. Lenny then realizes it is he who is being chased. In another incident.. Lenny is harassed by someone who knows his condition, that someone insults Lenny and his wife and then walks out.. Three minutes later that same person walks in (to Lenny trying to find a pen to write down that this person is bad) and the mere distraction of the door opening is enough for Lenny to forget what took place and for that person to pretend he\/she was Lenny's friend.From the get go, there are two things that capture your interest..One, Lenny is a strange person, he has this weakness that he refuses to succumb to. He refuses to trust anyone or anything but his own observations, sentences like I know when someone knows me, I just look into their eyes strike you are pretty confident for a guy with no memory. He places infinite trust in his Tattoos, notes, files and photos. The major facts he finds about his wife's killer, he writes as a Tattoo on his body, his research work on the killer is in a file he keeps with him all the time. He leaves notes in his pocket for things he plans to do, simply by leaving them there, he is sure to revisit them later. He takes polaroid photos of all the important things in his current situation, where he's staying, his car, people he met (and on the back he writes his impressions about them). The techniques he uses to record these memories are not surprising, but the way he trusts his own handwriting and his own remarks on the back of each photo is what strikes you as odd. I believe it is a very accurate depiction by the writer of the story as anyone who has dealt with a disabled person will testify that this form of defiance and reluctance to rely on others is very much a real behavior. As Lenny himself said (describing a case he handled when he was an insurance investigator of a man who suffered from the same condition he later on acquired), I realized that the look of recognition in his eyes (which made me think he was faking the condition) was actually fake. He was giving that look to everyone who approaches him hoping to give them SIGNs that he is doing better.Two, the movie is told as two tales.. One moving backwards, and the other moving forwards. The reverse tale is in color and is the personification of Lenny's case. Like Lenny, you see events unfold with out knowing what took place before them. You see he is talking to a man who is trying to help him, but on the photo he has of that man he has written the sentence Don't trust him so he ignores the man's advice. You (like Lenny) have to believe the photo (of course as a viewer, you start thinking, may be that's not his handwriting, may be someone forged his handwriting to lead Lenny in the wrong way). And as this story unfolds backwards (with you having the privilege of knowing what would result from each scene because you've seen all the way till the end) the other story (shot in black and white) is moving forward. From the beginning you realize that it is taking place prior to the colored story (Lenny has less tattoos).Eventually, the two stories meet near the movie's finale. Until THAT point in the movie, it is one of the greatest movies EVER.But it is the finale that detracts from the movie as the director (or story writer?) tried to leave a puzzling finish to make the movie sound real deep. He succeeded in making the finish puzzling, but he failed in making the finish live up to the level of story telling and overall performance of the movie to that point.Someone likened the surprising ending of this movie to the ending of the 6th Sense.. All I can say is that this statement would be true if the Sixth Sense ended in you finding out that all those ghosts the kid saw were just actors and that it was all a prank on the little boy. That's how surprising the ending of Memento is.. It's REALLY surprising, but greatly frustrating.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"4 October 2001","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is truly unique. One of those movies that you MUST see. You just have to experience. All the reviews you read and all talk you hear will not do it justice.The plot is simple (at first) as we have a person, Leonard, whose wife was raped and murdered and he was attacked during the incident. The whole incident (either the hit by the attacker or the traumatizing effect of seeing his wife die) left him with this illness. He lost his short term memory. He cannot form any new memories. Several times in the movie we see Lenny (Leonard) doing something, and as soon as he loses focus for several seconds, he forgets what he was doing. At one point he is being chased by an armed man, he gets tangled in a few obstacles and when he comes out of them he can't remember why he is running, he sees this man running on the opposite side of the building and he thinks he is chasing that man, as he starts running at him the man pulls out his gun and starts firing.. Lenny then realizes it is he who is being chased. In another incident.. Lenny is harassed by someone who knows his condition, that someone insults Lenny and his wife and then walks out.. Three minutes later that same person walks in (to Lenny trying to find a pen to write down that this person is bad) and the mere distraction of the door opening is enough for Lenny to forget what took place and for that person to pretend he\/she was Lenny's friend.From the get go, there are two things that capture your interest..One, Lenny is a strange person, he has this weakness that he refuses to succumb to. He refuses to trust anyone or anything but his own observations, sentences like I know when someone knows me, I just look into their eyes strike you are pretty confident for a guy with no memory. He places infinite trust in his Tattoos, notes, files and photos. The major facts he finds about his wife's killer, he writes as a Tattoo on his body, his research work on the killer is in a file he keeps with him all the time. He leaves notes in his pocket for things he plans to do, simply by leaving them there, he is sure to revisit them later. He takes polaroid photos of all the important things in his current situation, where he's staying, his car, people he met (and on the back he writes his impressions about them). The techniques he uses to record these memories are not surprising, but the way he trusts his own handwriting and his own remarks on the back of each photo is what strikes you as odd. I believe it is a very accurate depiction by the writer of the story as anyone who has dealt with a disabled person will testify that this form of defiance and reluctance to rely on others is very much a real behavior. As Lenny himself said (describing a case he handled when he was an insurance investigator of a man who suffered from the same condition he later on acquired), I realized that the look of recognition in his eyes (which made me think he was faking the condition) was actually fake. He was giving that look to everyone who approaches him hoping to give them SIGNs that he is doing better.Two, the movie is told as two tales.. One moving backwards, and the other moving forwards. The reverse tale is in color and is the personification of Lenny's case. Like Lenny, you see events unfold with out knowing what took place before them. You see he is talking to a man who is trying to help him, but on the photo he has of that man he has written the sentence Don't trust him so he ignores the man's advice. You (like Lenny) have to believe the photo (of course as a viewer, you start thinking, may be that's not his handwriting, may be someone forged his handwriting to lead Lenny in the wrong way). And as this story unfolds backwards (with you having the privilege of knowing what would result from each scene because you've seen all the way till the end) the other story (shot in black and white) is moving forward. From the beginning you realize that it is taking place prior to the colored story (Lenny has less tattoos).Eventually, the two stories meet near the movie's finale. Until THAT point in the movie, it is one of the greatest movies EVER.But it is the finale that detracts from the movie as the director (or story writer?) tried to leave a puzzling finish to make the movie sound real deep.

Unfortunately the facistic philosophy of  original = good    ,   sequel = garbage   is inherent in 99% of the reviews from both critics and the audience . WHAT 'S THE MATTER WITH YOU PEOPLE ???  Film history has already proved us that if the materials are used properly and the reconstruction is done carefully , a sequel can top the original even by miles ( examples like Superman II , Karate Kid II and of course the untoppable James Cameron's Aliens come to mind ) . Although Halloween II doesn 't actually manage to surpass its predecessor it belongs to a strange category of sequels that have their own special charms and are on a par with the original (just like Gremlins 2 ). Keep in mind that it was written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill themselves , the creators of this story . Why are you being so negative ? Can 't you realise that it is the second chapter of the whole story ?Personally I find brilliant the idea of picking up (LITERALLY) where the first movie left off . ( I cannot recall not even one sequel that did that ) It gives a very realistic touch to this hopelessly rediculous and farfetched story (don 't get me wrong , I like Halloween but it is ridiculous) . On top of that there are many reporters and TV bulletins which cover the incidents and the Hadonfield habitants now know that there is a psychopath killer loose on the streets . The realistic atmosphere gains more points . Moreover the basic set is now a hospital which is definately frightening .

This was his next film, and the reason I mention that is that this is a serious and melancholy drama with the form and rhythm of comedy. But it's not a funny movie, and part of the genius of the writing and direction is that Lemmon's character especially only figures this out in the third act.Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, an unmarried drone amongst drones in a huge insurance company, possessing of two important things a bachelor's apartment near Central Park (check out his rent!!), and an amoral willingness to allow company higher-ups to use his place for after-hours trysts with their girlfriends and pickups they meet in bars. To C.C., the problems associated with operating a safe-house for affairs are merely logistical, not moral; in one scene, he is seen rearranging his and everyone's schedule to accomodate Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray) a real bigwig, with the expertise and interest of an air traffic controller.His hope is to promote himself within the company by pleasing his superiors, and for awhile that seems to be working. It turns out, however, that Sheldrake's current flame is Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who C.C. has quite the crush on; in fact, she stands him up on their first date to meet Sheldrake at their favorite Chinese restaurant, where Sheldrake asks her to resume their affair, intimating that he will leave his wife for her (a lie that no-one except her even pretends to believe).Without going into too many details, the joy of and intelligence this is how well this triangle works itself out slowly and with some pain by all concerned. Although C.C. really likes Fran, she won't give him the time of day, first because she's already bruised and involved with Sheldrake, and, later, because she sees his flaws better than he does (and, possibly, we do). At one point they agree that it's too bad that she doesn't fall for a guy like him, but the exchange is given additional bittersweetness not only by her inability to fall for a nice guy but her awareness that, as he is at that point, he's not really such a nice guy. One of the beauties of this script is that it takes awhile for us to notice that C.C. is just as bad as Sheldrake is; he's totally okay with the infidelities he is assisting in as long as he gets his promotion out of it, and it isn't his business whether anyone (wives or girlfriends) gets hurt in the process. Even the resounding disapproval from his next door neighbors (who just think he's a very busy playboy from what they can hear night after night coming through the walls) doesn't get him to think. Yet Lemmon plays the role with total innocence; he thinks he's in a comedy and it takes a real life-threatening problem halfway through to get him to start considering the error of his ways. Even then, he's still just trying to work the situation, without taking any stand himself. (There are only about two actors I know of that could pull this role off Jack Lemmon and Tom Hanks, both of whom have such audience appeal that they can be this spineless without the audience despising them.) Interestingly, for all her personality, intelligence and self-awareness, Fran isn't much better; she's no stranger to the hazards of having affairs with married men, yet has little qualms about resuming her affair with Sheldrake. Both C.C. and Fran really are willing to sacrifice their integrity for something they hope to get from Sheldrake - him, the high-floor, corner window office, her, the gold wedding ring.I've stressed that this is a drama in comedy form to emphasize that this screen play is one of the most intelligently written I have ever seen; it takes a non-story (or at least, obviously bedroom-farcical material) and inhabits it with character interaction and development of the most subtle and human kind. You expect lots of bedroom-closet-under-the couch people shuffling (like in The Pink Panther of three years later) and general hilarity, perhaps ending up with someone partially disrobed and dangling from a window; instead you find out that each of these characters has a little history of his own. I rented this the other night, thinking that it would indeed be a comedy, and about halfway through found myself thinking This is REALLY good!.  I've been renting lots of pre-1975 movies (The Sting, Spartacus, this one) in an unprecedented attack of escapist nostalgia, and have been rewarded with jewels like this.

Sure, Jackson and Jones are both strong, honest, and intense in their roles. But honestly, haven't we seen them in the same roles a few times too often already? The film is also very predictable and by the numbers.  There's really nothing in this story line that hasn't already been done a hundred times before in different movies of the week, paperback novels, stage plays, TV episodes... There are a couple of good performances in this film, though.  Ben Kingsley is compelling as always.  How he manages to save his work even in terrible films(remember Species?) is a reminder to actors that a bad film doesn't mean you have to do bad work.  Guy Pierce is also strong as the prosecution lawyer making his case against Jackson.  Even though you know he's going to lose(come on, is that really a spoiler? Did you really think Samuel L Jackson was going to go to jail by the end of the movie?), Pierce fights like hell to prove his point.  And it is a strong point. The trouble is, both those roles are underused.  And as the story between Jackson and Jones goes on, I really wanted to know more about Kingsley and Pierce, and what they were thinking.  I never found out, though. What tipped my thumb up on this film, then? The combat sequences and Captain Dale Dye, USMC. Dye is the leader of a movie-combat group called Warriors, Inc.

It's realistic and very frightening to watch, especially considering the times we live in, and that American troops in Afghanistan will be in situations just like this.  Or worse, horrible as that thought may be. Is it propaganda?  Yes.  But that's Hollywood. Is it mediocre?  Yes.  But again, that's Hollywood, mostly. Is it irrelevant?  No.  Watch the combat scene, take your problems with it, and tell it to the Marines.

I agree with the side that hates it, and I agree, with reservations, with the right-wingers who love it. Let's start with what I don't like. Sure, Jackson and Jones are both strong, honest, and intense in their roles. But honestly, haven't we seen them in the same roles a few times too often already? The film is also very predictable and by the numbers.  There's really nothing in this story line that hasn't already been done a hundred times before in different movies of the week, paperback novels, stage plays, TV episodes... There are a couple of good performances in this film, though.  Ben Kingsley is compelling as always.  How he manages to save his work even in terrible films(remember Species?) is a reminder to actors that a bad film doesn't mean you have to do bad work.  Guy Pierce is also strong as the prosecution lawyer making his case against Jackson.  Even though you know he's going to lose(come on, is that really a spoiler? Did you really think Samuel L Jackson was going to go to jail by the end of the movie?), Pierce fights like hell to prove his point.  And it is a strong point. The trouble is, both those roles are underused.  And as the story between Jackson and Jones goes on, I really wanted to know more about Kingsley and Pierce, and what they were thinking.  I never found out, though. What tipped my thumb up on this film, then? The combat sequences and Captain Dale Dye, USMC. Dye is the leader of a movie-combat group called Warriors, Inc.  A Vietnam veteran himself, he choreographed the combat scenes in Platoon, Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, among others.  And his work in the massacre sequence made the whole movie work for me.  It's realistic and very frightening to watch, especially considering the times we live in, and that American troops in Afghanistan will be in situations just like this.  Or worse, horrible as that thought may be. Is it propaganda?  Yes.  But that's Hollywood. Is it mediocre?  Yes.  But again, that's Hollywood, mostly. Is it irrelevant?  No.  Watch the combat scene, take your problems with it, and tell it to the Marines.

Like most film buffs and Woody Allen fans, I like Manhattan very much. It's funny, engaging film that is also a feast for the ears and eyes. And just like real every day life, the film unfolds with a series of haphazard events. I can also relate to this film on a very personal level, but I won't go into those reasons as they're inconsequential. I'll go into the film by saying it is hard to really like any of the characters in this film; most of them are hopelessly self-involved and tragically misinformed. You know you're in trouble when Woody's character is the most level-headed in the picture! But for me that only aids the film's realism; we spend every day of our lives involving ourselves in ill-advised and even ignorant activities. Woody's characters aren't the typical Julia Roberts and Freddie Prinz Jr's that always say and do the right thing at the right moment. Being able to portray people the as they are-individuals with real faults and genuine problems-has always been one of the director's strengths. One of the main ideas of the film is that cerebral people purposely, albeit maybe subconsciously, create their own troubles. The virtue of being intelligent, cultured, admired and perhaps even wealthy is not enough for these people. Or perhaps it's too much. The characters here dig their own graves so to speak and later hate themselves for it-but it's the only they can function. I think like-minded people will agree with me that many so-called happy individuals in this world mindlessly wander through life, content with their television commercials and fast food and shopping malls and Julia Roberts movies. The same thing taht allows these people to be perfectly happy is possibly the same thing that drives more open-minded folks to challenge everything, including their own well-being. I imagine I am getting way off track now, but I feel everything that I am saying has some relevance to the film. Maybe that's all subjective, but that's what I take from the film. The thing I can most objectively identify from Manhattan would have to be the gorgeous photography coupled with a beautiful George Gershwin score. I think that is the first thing people usually notice about this film, the fact that it is a very loving homage from the director to the only place in the world he would want to call home. The story, to me anyway, has little relation to the setting-these kind of situations can happen in any city in the world.

I don't intend to start doing so.  But, man alive, did this flick try my patience.Training Day is about Jake Hoyt (Hawke)'s first day in training to be a narc.  His &#145;mentor' is Alonzo Harris (Washington), a veteran of the LAPD narcotics beat.  Now, Hoyt isn't a true rookie &#150; he's been a cop for over a year, but he wants to be a detective.  One good way to become one is by training in narcotics.  Alonzo has been on this beat for years, and is considered one of the best.  What better training ground could there be? During his day of training, Hoyt learns to disregard the 4th Amendment, lie, use drugs, and all sorts of other things a good cop shouldn't do.Now, there is some validity to having an undercover cop or narc be familiar with the quality of drugs, but they must also remain above the culture. Donnie Brasco and Rush both showed this very well.  Training Day does not.I have a host of complaints about this movie.  I'm going to address them in no particular order.1) The story made no sense at all.  It starts off fine &#150; Alonzo is a typical hard-nosed narc with little to no patience with a rookie who wants to be a do-gooder.  The street has no patience for those types.  Ok &#150; I'll buy that. But then, all of a sudden, we're in the middle of a mystery, and we have no idea where it started or what the details are.  We know that Russians are involved, and some other guy, and then all of a sudden we make a bust that makes even less sense, and then, the movie doesn't end.  It keeps going, adding new subplots, and don't even think that any of these are going to be resolved at the end.  And then the movie is over.2) Alonzo is not likable.  Yes, he's a tough cop.  Yes, he uses methods that aren't exactly legal.  But Washington gives the audience nothing about his character to like.  We grew to like Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  We liked Darth Vader.  We saw the humanity in those characters.  Washington is a very good actor, and has the awards to prove it.  I don't know if it was the way the character was written or what, but we are given nothing about Alonzo to like.  We aren't allowed to see his humanity.3) The pacing is terrible.  This movie went on and on and on, and just kept going after it had stopped making sense.  Now, this, I don't understand. Fuqua started off directing music videos (This is not a bad thing &#150; David Fincher, who directed Se7en and Fight Club started out the same way.  As did Spike Jonze, who made Being John Malkovich.).  He should understand pacing. He directed The Replacement Killers, which starred Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino &#150; he can obviously work with actors.  So, I'm not sure what happened.  Perhaps the editor should be canned.  Or the writer.  Someone, anyway.I'm done making my list.  There are just too many things to go into with this movie.  I'm not about to write a spoiler for those of you who still insist on seeing this movie, but I will advise you to reconsider.  There are plenty of other movies opening this week.I'd go into more detail, but, this movie was so frustrating that it made my brain hurt.
