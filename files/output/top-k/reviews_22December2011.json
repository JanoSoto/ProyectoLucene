It's a comedy-drama woefully short on comedy and it doesn't do much better in the drama department. There's the famous scene with Tom Cruise and Old Time Rock and Roll. It's that scene more than anything else which people seem to remember all these years later. Everybody seems to forget the rest of the movie rather stinks.Cruise plays Joel Goodsen, a suburban Chicago teen whose parents are away on a trip. Joel orders up a hooker out of a newspaper advertisement. Apparently you can do that sort of thing in suburban Chicago. Who knew? Anyhow the lovely Lana, played by Rebecca De Mornay, shows Joel the time of his life. Unfortunately Joel doesn't have the money to pay for his dream night and while he goes to the bank to scrounge up some cash Lana steals his mother's precious crystal egg. Things go downhill from there, both for Joel and the movie. There's a slimy pimp with a temper and a gun, more hookers and an expensive car going for a swim. Somewhere along the way Joel and Lana kinda sorta maybe fall in love. Lana needs money to get away from killer pimp Guido. He just had to be named Guido didn't he? Joel needs a whole lot of money to clean up the mess he's made of his comfortable suburban life before his parents get back. The fresh-faced teen and the friendly neighborhood hooker come up with an interesting, and of course risky, business plan to solve their problems.So yeah, this movie is stupid on all kinds of levels.

They can make the movie bearable but they can't make it good. The story is largely absurd. It's one stupid, nonsensical thing after another. Entertainment value is sorely lacking, there's not much here to keep you engaged in the proceedings. The whole thing is rather dull.

Both very good actors, put together they did a wonderful job of making this a very funny movie, largely by playing their roles so seriously. Stiller's character of Greg Focker was one any man can relate to - if you've ever been in the position of having to meet your girlfriend's father for the first time. In this case, the pressure was really on. Greg wants to marry Pam (Teri Polo) but finds out that her father would expect to give his permission before he even asks. So he accompanies Pam home for her sister's wedding, and discovers that Jack (Deniro) isn't your average, everyday potential father in law. Instead, he turns out to be an ex CIA agent who's extremely protective of his daughters and has more than a few quirks of his own - not the least of which is an obsession with his cat, Mr. Jinks. Desperately trying to impress Jack (or at least trying not to get on his bad side) Greg ends up unintentionally causing chaos in the home. He breaks the urn holding Jack's mother's ashes; he lets Mr. Jinks outside and loses him; he accidentally breaks Pam's sister's nose while playing volleyball; he sets fire to the backyard; he causes the septic tank to overflow. If that sounds like it might be going a bit overboard, it really doesn't go overboard. It never falls into mere slapstick humour. Greg's misadventures all seem very natural and believable. It's simply that nothing goes right on this weekend with his potential in-laws, and the end result is that Jack becomes convinced that this guy isn't good enough for his beloved first born daughter - a feeling compounded by the fact that her sister is marrying a doctor who's also the son of a doctor, while Greg is a nurse. Deniro and Stiller played off each other perfectly and produced a number of very funny scenes together.The movie was weakened a bit, in my opinion, by supporting performances that weren't as strong. Polo was very much in the background. She was likable enough, but added really very little to the movie (except that her character was necessary to push forward the tension between Jack and Greg.) Blythe Danner was underused as Pam's mother, and I found Owen Wilson's character of Kevin (Pam's ex-fiancé) to be irritating more than anything, and maybe a little too much for the story.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable movie; one of the better comedies of recent years.

Stiller's character of Greg Focker was one any man can relate to - if you've ever been in the position of having to meet your girlfriend's father for the first time. In this case, the pressure was really on. Greg wants to marry Pam (Teri Polo) but finds out that her father would expect to give his permission before he even asks. So he accompanies Pam home for her sister's wedding, and discovers that Jack (Deniro) isn't your average, everyday potential father in law. Instead, he turns out to be an ex CIA agent who's extremely protective of his daughters and has more than a few quirks of his own - not the least of which is an obsession with his cat, Mr. Jinks. Desperately trying to impress Jack (or at least trying not to get on his bad side) Greg ends up unintentionally causing chaos in the home. He breaks the urn holding Jack's mother's ashes; he lets Mr. Jinks outside and loses him; he accidentally breaks Pam's sister's nose while playing volleyball; he sets fire to the backyard; he causes the septic tank to overflow. If that sounds like it might be going a bit overboard, it really doesn't go overboard. It never falls into mere slapstick humour. Greg's misadventures all seem very natural and believable. It's simply that nothing goes right on this weekend with his potential in-laws, and the end result is that Jack becomes convinced that this guy isn't good enough for his beloved first born daughter - a feeling compounded by the fact that her sister is marrying a doctor who's also the son of a doctor, while Greg is a nurse. Deniro and Stiller played off each other perfectly and produced a number of very funny scenes together.The movie was weakened a bit, in my opinion, by supporting performances that weren't as strong. Polo was very much in the background. She was likable enough, but added really very little to the movie (except that her character was necessary to push forward the tension between Jack and Greg.) Blythe Danner was underused as Pam's mother, and I found Owen Wilson's character of Kevin (Pam's ex-fiancé) to be irritating more than anything, and maybe a little too much for the story.Overall, though, this is an enjoyable movie; one of the better comedies of recent years.

It's the point in time where America realizes on what their views should be for any race and not just the white Anglo Saxon individuals. I am proud to own this movie for multiple reasons. The first is that it is the longest in running time in the history of cinema, four hours! And that's not even the extended cut version, that one's even longer! I also love the performances, the music and the way everything was film at up-most accuracy. If I could give this film eleven stars out of ten, I definitely would.The cast for this movie is way too large for me to all name but there are many good actors in this film. Starring as one of the main characters is Tom Berenger as General Longstreet who has the beard almost as amazing as Albus Dumbledore's! Berenger is a fine actor and I enjoy watching how he acts and reacts to situations. He does a magnificent job and I only wished that he had reprised his role in Gods and Generals (2003). Along side Berenger is Martin Sheen, playing as General Lee. He too does a good job at his part. Whenever he talks, he gives his character the impression that he is gentle but also a strong leader who knows what he's talking about. Jeff Daniels plays as Colonel Chamberlain. Whenever the camera is focused on him, I lose the sense that this is Jeff Daniels talking. That is how good Daniels acts out his role. It's almost like Chamberlain came back just for this movie. Even Sam Elliot has brief role in this film as General Buford. Although it is hard to picture Buford talking like Sam Elliot he's pretty convincing with his part. The last actor that I think does a superb job with his part is Richard Jordan who plays General Armistead. I've always enjoyed Richard Jordan's performances. He has a way of doing things that are just so believable. There were points in this film where I almost cried because of the way Jordan acted. And for me, it's not easy to make me cry. Although his part is not as major as the other roles, it's still just as powerful. And what a fine way for Jordan to end his career because not long after he passed away (unfortunately).The music in this epic was composed and conducted by Randy Edelman. I love Edelman's work, I really do. The way the music starts out, and the way it ends is so noble and unforgettable. There is one song that I really enjoy listening to; that song is Kathleen Mavourneen. This song can be heard when Armistead and Longstreet have a heartfelt conversation. It was so beautiful to listen to that it is now one my most favorite soundtrack tunes. One thing that I've heard some say about this film is that it is not a good war movie unless it has blood, guts, and body parts flying everywhere. I agree TO A POINT. Sure it would have been nice to see a little more bloodshed to make the film more realistic but isn't it realistic enough as it is? The film contains all the military movements of both armies; it shows the viewer how they were executed and the mistakes that were made. And its not like there AREN'T people shown getting shot or blown away by a cannon shell. Is blood and guts really necessary? That's just icing on the cake if the viewer can handle such graphic images. Plus that would restrict the age limit for this movie, which could have possibly lowered the amount of money it could have made. There is nothing wrong with a PG war movie, The Big Red One (1980) was like that too. Case closed.Director Ronald F. Maxwell has created a fine piece of cinema for anyone to enjoy; even non civil war buffs will like it. Although it is long for a movie, Gettysburg sustains realistic images, great acting, and a memorable soundtrack.

The plot is fairly simple; thirteen year old Annabel Andrews and her mother have an argument one Friday morning and start think about how the other one doesn't understand how hard their lives are compared the easy life they lead&#x85; the next thing that happens is the wish they could spend a day in the others body and suddenly that happens! Annabel is back home in her mother's body and Mrs Andrews is with Annabel's friends in her body. Inevitably each of them discovers that the other's life is much more difficult than they realised; they also learn a few facts about themselves along the way. Things get more stressful later in the day when Annabel's father asks her to supply a buffet for a business event when she can't cook&#x85; it could be worse though; his wife is going to have to put on a water-skiing display!

The film isn't without its flaws; the worst being the special effects and green screen shot; they may have been passable in 1976 but they looked very dated now, thankfully there weren't too many such shots. As the film progresses towards the end it does get a bit silly but that doesn't matter as it was pretty funny; I'm sure these scenes will be the favourite for younger viewers. Being a Disney film there is nothing to offend and is suitable for viewers of all ages; a proper family film.

So, as you can imagine, I was very eagerly looking forward to Memento one of the early films of the much-lauded Christopher Nolan, whom I also have great admiration for. Now Memento could be considered more of an avant-garde narrative puzzle than a groundbreaking film and it probably works better on a first viewing than a second, but it had me enveloped from the word go.Director Nolan and his brother, co-screenwriter Jon Nolan, took the conventional narrative movement and essentially played it in reverse. The movie's timeline starts at the end, with an amnesiac (Guy Pearce) murdering another man (Joe Pantoliano) and then photographing his handiwork. May not seem all that extraordinary or new, except that it's played in reverse, so the Polaroid we see in extreme close-up goes from developed to black and the blood on the walls runs upwards instead of down. From there, the picture plays its narrative backwards in section, with black-and-white prologues and epilogues, if you will, providing the groundwork for what will come in between.The story is that Mr. Pearce is an amnesiac for anything that happened in the past few minutes. Yet he's on a mission to murder the man who raped and killed his wife. Could it be the fellow from the beginning? How would a man with this condition maintain such a task without being conned, used, or targeting the wrong guy? Well, that is one of the great things about Memento. The imaginative if non-plausible information that it supplies in suggesting how a person with this handicap could accomplish (or try to, at least) something of this nature. For instance, Mr. Pearce photographs his current residencies (motels, usually) and the people he's helping or help, and jots down notes. They're notes for the audience as well as him, and that's another thing that makes this so much fun audience involvement. It's up to us to help solve the mystery as well.Played in a regular narrative-form, Memento might have been a neo-noir. To some extent, it might still be, with its elements of a misguided, vulnerable man, a femme fatale (or is she?), and a mission to murder. But overall, it's more or less a film of its own kind. One of the best things about Christopher Nolan the director as well as the storyteller is that he's like Stanley Kubrick in this regard he's self-defined. He makes his movies in a way that is distinctly his own and unlike others, probably part of the reason why he's admired by some and absolutely despised by others. He's got an aggressive style that is mostly foolproof (although I would prefer he learns to frame action in wider shots and ease up on the quick cuts) and very engaging. It's always fun to see something new, and so his radically unique style is perfectly matched to this radically unique form of storytelling.The picture is like your favorite jigsaw puzzle, if that's your thing. It's most exciting the first time around and still plenty enjoyable once you've done it a few times and gotten a pretty good handle on which pieces go where and when. It is also very well-acted, with an especially good performance from Joe Pantoliano as the murdered man, who turns out to have played a big part in the amnesiac man's life before. As the amnesiac, Mr. Pearce does a phenomenal job acknowledging one fact and then seeming to forget it a minute later. A picture like this requires a star who can work well with the audience and he succeeds on all levels. Carrie-Anne Moss, as a woman who might not (or just might) be helping Mr. Pearce along is in good form as well, providing flesh and blood to a fascinating supporting character.It's no wonder why Christopher Nolan has become one of the more widely-discussed filmmakers of the twenty-first century.

To some extent, it might still be, with its elements of a misguided, vulnerable man, a femme fatale (or is she?), and a mission to murder. But overall, it's more or less a film of its own kind. One of the best things about Christopher Nolan the director as well as the storyteller is that he's like Stanley Kubrick in this regard he's self-defined. He makes his movies in a way that is distinctly his own and unlike others, probably part of the reason why he's admired by some and absolutely despised by others. He's got an aggressive style that is mostly foolproof (although I would prefer he learns to frame action in wider shots and ease up on the quick cuts) and very engaging. It's always fun to see something new, and so his radically unique style is perfectly matched to this radically unique form of storytelling.The picture is like your favorite jigsaw puzzle, if that's your thing. It's most exciting the first time around and still plenty enjoyable once you've done it a few times and gotten a pretty good handle on which pieces go where and when. It is also very well-acted, with an especially good performance from Joe Pantoliano as the murdered man, who turns out to have played a big part in the amnesiac man's life before. As the amnesiac, Mr. Pearce does a phenomenal job acknowledging one fact and then seeming to forget it a minute later. A picture like this requires a star who can work well with the audience and he succeeds on all levels. Carrie-Anne Moss, as a woman who might not (or just might) be helping Mr. Pearce along is in good form as well, providing flesh and blood to a fascinating supporting character.It's no wonder why Christopher Nolan has become one of the more widely-discussed filmmakers of the twenty-first century. Again, to compare him to Kubrick, he's self-defined and engaging in his own unique way. But it's more than unique that makes his films, Memento included such a treat. It's the way he engages the audience. Granted, his style is not for everyone. Folks who dislike puzzles and mind tricks, beware.

Non-binding clothing must be donned, a hot drink must be within arm's reach, and a cozy blanket must be tucked up against one's chin to foil any possibility of draught. In a perfect world, a fire would sizzle and pop in the fireplace, and inclement weather would rage against the window panes.And Johnny Depp would be on my couch. Or at least in my DVD player. Edward Scissorhands (1990) is a heartwarming, quirky romantic comedy with a twist of fantasy. It's the story of an awkward, innocent misfit, and it's just the right choice for a wintery evening in.My personal love affair with Johnny Depp began in 1990 when he played Edward Scissorhands. But I'm going to try to be objective in this review, really I am.It begins as a kind of fairy tale, a grandmother tucking a child into bed while explaining the mysterious origins of snow. I would like to say the film is suitable for the whole family, but there is one seductress scene where the neighborhood hussy (Marge, delightfully played by Kathy Baker) tries to Mrs. Robinsonize young Edward in the back room of her beauty parlor, the innuendo of which would bump the film into the PG-13 category. (Hooray!) Edward (Johnny Depp) is an awkward misfit boy, who has been created with scissory blades where his hands should be. He speaks only 169 words in the entire movie and looks at the world with wide wonder. He desperately wants to do the right thing; moving around gingerly so he doesn't stab or slash anything. By the time Edward punctures the water bed with an accidental poke, and then tries to fix the spouting water by covering it up with stuffed animals, he has won our hearts.Edward Scissorhands is regarded by many critics to be the crazy-haired director Tim Burton's finest film. No argument here. Burton calls it his favorite creation as well. It was his first project with the then 27-year-old Depp, the first of seven collaborations between the two.The Burton\/Depp relationship itself bears some discussion.Why is there this unholy alliance between the disheveled, uncombed lunatic Tim Burton and the man-god Johnny Depp? What fuels this obsession of Johnny's to keep making Tim's movies? Johnny once said in an interview that he would do anything Tim Burton asked him to do. ANYTHING! (capitals mine) Yes, Johnny, we KNOW you love Tim but you don't have to say yes every time the man drinks too much tequila and has a weird movie idea.I have a theory about why Tim and Johnny are joined at the artistic hip People with gaps in their front teeth are magnetically drawn to other people with gaps in their front teeth. Hear me out, there's empirical data.In orthodontic terms, this gap is called diastema, and I think the National Science Foundation needs to throw some serious research money at the diastema-to-love correlation. Tim Burton has it. Johnny has it. Johnny's life partner Vanessa Paradis has it - the exact same gap in her front teeth that Johnny has. Coincidence? My theory is that there is a glittery, invisible beam of attraction that emanates from the heart, comes up through the esophagus and is emitted out the gappy tunnel between the teeth. It then passes through the other person's gappy tunnel, and locks on to their heart, resulting in love. Or a movie deal.But Burton and Depp aren't the only ones involved here.If it is possible for me to love anyone in this film as much as I love Johnny Depp, it is Dianne Wiest. She superbly plays Peg, the Avon lady and the mom everyone wants to have. Her reaction upon first meeting the frightening looking Edward? What happened to your hands? Where are your parents? I think you need to just come home with me. She adopts Edward and brings him home to live with her family. I want her to adopt me.This was Vincent Price's final film. Price plays a small but poignant role as Edward's creator\/father, living in the eerie, Gothic castle, and kindly tutoring Edward in all subjects including proper decorum when tea is served. Ironically, Price's death scene was to be the last scene he ever filmed before his own death, a fitting farewell to the Crown Prince of all things mysterious.Winona Ryder plays Edward's love interest, Kim. Edward is instantly transfixed by her photograph, but the relationship never materializes. SPOILER ALERT At the end of the film, Edward hears the words he has longed to hear from Kim Hold me. He tries, but cannot, because he is afraid of hurting her. But she maneuvers in past his blades and snuggles against his chest in what is possibly the sweetest embrace in all of cinematic history.In real life, Johnny and Winona had a hotly fueled affair that was to end in a bad breakup and a tattoo revision.

She's attending a party held by a wealthy businessman at his huge tower building. When he arrives McClane is thrown into a not so regular situation when a group of terrorists, led by the mysterious Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman), take over the building and keep all the guests hostage. McClane is able to avoid capture but must now find a way to get the polices' attention, save the hostages, including his wife, and stay alive.The plot sounds simple enough, because it is, but the action in Die Hard is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. McClane isn't a superhero and he does take a lot of damage throughout the movie and goes through many close calls. That's what makes you drawn to his character and makes you want to see him get out alive. As the movie goes on he's able to take out each of the terrorists and is able to get up and down the building in very creative ways. He befriends a LA police officer halfway through the movie(played by Reginald VelJohnson) and their conversations delve more into their characters and make them more human. We also learn more about Hans and his motives to capturing the building.All these elements combined with edge of your seat action scenes make Die Hard a must watch for any fans of the action movie genre. Bruce Willis is able to play a convincing every day man who just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and Alan Rickman is always a great antagonist. I highly recommend it.

I was too young to play with my brother and his friends and none of my friends were ever interested.

And that's just what I got.What you have to understand is that this movie has to take the time to explain everything for those who never played D&D. It's romantic, campy, and I absolutely loved it. It reminds me of a group of friends getting together to play a game, thinking up an adventure unlike any other. I thought the acting was good. The plot was fun.

We always just called it Otis and Milo! I loved this very much as a kid, but then it vanished on me and it was about 15 years before I was finally able to see it again. I fully expected to be hit by waves of sweetest nostalgia, but what I got was more of a cold shower. I found it very childish. I still liked it, but didn't love it as I once did. Of course, nothing's ever as good as you remember, but there are still glimmers and moments that give me the old magic feeling. It's visually gorgeous, you do see incredible scenes and situations totally unique to it involving various species of animals. Generally all cute. My favourite one is the scene with the cat and doe in the field of cotton blossoms. The aching purity of the scene is so warm and beautiful, it's like a dream, or a little piece of heaven... It was the one part of the movie that remained vividly etched in my mind long after I'd forgotten pretty much everything else. It's positively sacred to me.  I really don't care for ignorant types who try and make out that those who enjoy this film are condoning animal abuse or something. I'm not saying their points aren't very valid, but in this case I believe they are very overblown and unnecessary. And to the reviewer who said that parents should consider the moral ramifications before showing the film to their kids, I damn well disagree with you. I watched plenty of times when I was about 7 or 8 and it never made me want to do anything bad to any animals. I think that parents need only have that concern if it were people harming the animals in the picture. Everything scary that happens is portrayed as the natural peril of their journey. This movie's completely harmless. So I think all people like you need to just lay of the sweet little children's movie and lighten the hell up! I'm sorry, if any animals did get hurt, but I never saw this film that way before and I'm not going to start now. You people aren't gonna taint my memories of this film. I see beauty, innocence and hope. That's all I see. The only thing I really dislike is how much of a child's movie it really is. That, and Dudley Moore's damn ceaseless narration, he's really quite annoying! He's almost patronising. I don't think there are any big life lessons to be learned here, it's just a nice little picture for children, and really nothing more. If it has a big failing, that's it. I also hate that stupid song.  This movie has great sentimental value for me. To me sentimental value is when you don't particularly love something to death, but for whatever reason, you always want to know it's close by, and that's how I feel about this movie now. I thought one review was very sweet and apt in it's description of this-that of a bedtime story. Sweet precious little bedtime story that's very much worthy of remembering, and hopefully for its more positive and uplifting aspects.
