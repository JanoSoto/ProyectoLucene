[{"date":"23 April 2015","score":"","review":" Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) is an overachieving Type A personality. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is the conscientious civics teacher. His best friend and fellow teacher Dave Novotny gets into serious trouble having an affair with Tracy. Dave loses his job and his marriage. Tracy is an only child and running unopposed in the class president election. Jim convinces rich popular football player Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against her after his injury sidelines him. Paul's sister Tammy gets too obsessed with girlfriend Lisa. Lisa breaks up with her by having sex with Paul. That drives Tammy to run in the election against her older brother.This is a hilarious black comedy from Alexander Payne. Reese is so aggressively aggressive. She is absolutely brilliant. Chris Klein is also funny as the clueless jock. Broderick is sometimes on and off. He's not quite as funny in comparison. He's more in the pathetic area. I prefer the hilarity of the younger kids.
