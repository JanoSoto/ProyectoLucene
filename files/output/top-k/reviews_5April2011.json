To underline and celebrate this kind of anniversary, I decided to pick one of my favourite movies of all times.Everything about this movie just seems perfect to me.Let's start with the director's work. Sergio Leone is one of the most gifted directors of all times and he had a feeling for monumental and impressing landscapes. His images are as epic as the scripts and stories. I also adore the way he captures the emotions of its actors. The devil is in the detail as he concentrates on seemingly instinctual nervous movements and actions, the impressions of the actor's faces and especially the looks of their eyes. Even almost fifty years after the release of this monumental milestone of the western genre, his way of filming remains unbeaten and unreached. It is emotional, well crafted and perfectly organized.The filming goes hand in hand with the majestic score of the movie. Ennio Morricone is maybe the greatest composer for cinema alive. The instruments are diversified, the melodies epic and still catchy and filled with emotions of pressure, anger, despair, hope and joy that fusion perfectly with the chosen images. Without the music, often only chosen randomly to underline a conceptual background by many others, the movie wouldn't be the same. Sergio Leone really knew what he wanted and I music has never had such an important role in a movie since the end of the age of silent films. Without the works of Morricone, there would have been no place for many grand composers such as John Williams or Hans Zimmer that create stunning soundtracks nowadays.Another amazing thing is the acting around the three key personalities. Lee van Cleef as Angel Eyes does the best work of his career as a cold hearted, pitiless and cool villain with an eerie look. He is not the usual bad guy but a rather silent, patient and intellectual villain and this what makes him appear so cruel and dangerous. Eli Wallach as Tuco, one of my favourite actors of all times, does also the best job of his long career in this movie. He plays an ugly little bandit that seems to be naive, superficial and rude at first sight but turns out to be much more diversified and is finally a crafty, darkly humorous and brutal villain that is nevertheless very sympathetic because of his high degree of charisma and the high amount of bad coincidences that he lives throughout the whole movie. Finally, Clint Eastwood as Blondie does also an amazing job and has developed since the first two movies he had done with Sergio Leone before. In this movie, he is extremely smart, calm and thoughtful but nevertheless a mean villain that plans and organizes everything at his advantage and that never stops to surprise. Those three memorable actors at the peak of their early careers have an amazing chemistry and I have never ever seen a movie with three outstanding actors. Normally, there are one or rarely two actors that give good movies a certain kind of soul and creativity, but this movie is graced by the works of three great actors. If that was not already enough, the supporting actors such as Aldo Giuffr√® as a drunk and desperate Union Captain that befriends with the characters of Wallach and Eastwood.One must also underline the story itself. It takes the time to slowly introduce each of the characters in their own special ways. The viewer gets the time to get used and connect with them before the main plot kicks off which is an unusual and great idea. The further development reveals more and more about the characters and their past. Lee van Cleef is shown as he fulfils his dirty works and contracts, Eli Wallach meets his brother, a catholic friar that confronts him with old family problems and Clint Eastwood remains the tough vagabond and mysterious man without a name. The story is filled with many memorable and diversified situations, connecting a the elements of a treasure chase with a tale of revenge and scenes of the American Civil War. The movie is not just a western, it's has some slight social touches that look behind the brutal characters and gore or desperate war or prison scenes. The movie has some touches of a drama, an anti war movie, a satire of the usual westerns and an epic adventure flick. There is much to discover and analyze beyond the main plot that is a breathtaking treasure chase filled with cliffhangers.Finally, this movie has also had an important influence on an entire genre. The Italian spaghetti western genre got finally accepted and boomed as well as the whole western genre. The movie made an incredible gross with a very low budget. Many critics regard this movie as a classic nowadays and even people which use to hate westerns happen to like this flick, especially women. That's why this movie is way more than just a western, it is an epic masterpiece for the ages and everybody that disagrees on that has a very subjective point of view because the artistic factor of this flick is very elevated and the acting memorable. Everybody that hasn't seen this movie yet should do this right now, it is one of those movies one should have seen at least once in a lifetime. Personally, I watch this flick at least once a year and I'm always looking forward to it and never get bored. I happen to invite friends that don't know this movie yet to open their minds and until now, I never got less than enthusiastic comments.I would say that this movie is probably my favourite one of all times until now and will surely stay in my eternal top five.

These guys could make reading a tax audit engrossing! Along with the script, i have to re-credit Tarentino's direction. I am convinced that in anybody Else's hand this would not have been nearly as great a film. They camera angles the scene shots and oh yes, the editing, are so innovative that they are beyond words. The cast. John Travolta gave, i think, his best performance ever as the drug addict hit-man Vincent Vega. Samuel L. Jackson, who is brilliant in any performance, brings out new dimensions in acting excellence here as Jules Winfield. Uma Thurman is breathtaking as Mia Wallace, the coke head who does drugs because her life is so superficial she thinks she cant feel anything without them. Bruce Willis, as boxer Butch Coolage, commands the screen with a reserved but seething intensity. Havey Keitel has a great scene stealing moment as the problem solving expert Mr. Wolf. I could go on and on but you will not find one week performance from anyone in this movie.How this movie did not win best picture in 1994, instead losing to Forrest Gump is way beyond me.

I like Alan Ladd, love Jean Arthur, adore Jack Palance, so I thought I'd love the movie too. But something went wrong...someone somewhere decided the book was defective, and so they started making changes.Minor change the boy's name is changed from Bob to Joey, for no good reason. Major change (SPOILER ALERT) in the book the two men, Joe Starrett and Shane, are practically the other half of each other. They are as close as brothers. The movie somehow decides to change this into a rivalry, so that from the time Shane rides in to the time he rides out, the two are finding ways to get at each other and better each other. They even seem to be fighting over Joe's wife, which is ridiculous.Their rivalry even turns the scene where Joe prepares to meet Stark Wilson in town for the climactic shootout into a fight. In the book, Joe never knew what hit him; in the movie, the two men slug each other all over the house until Shane essentially can't take it anymore and belts Starrett with his gun. Then the boy, who has seen all this, yells that Shane cheated and I hate you Shane! Joey might, but Bob never did. He adored Shane from beginning to end.There are other differences I won't bother with, but those are the ones that really made my skin crawl. The other thing that's inherently wrong with the movie is Alan Ladd. Nothing against the man; I have liked many of his other films. But he is not Shane.

The good thing was that it focused on three main central characters.In MKA, it puts too many characters altogether, some making appearances then getting wiped out with no dramatic effect. Take Sheeva for example who is one of the most intriguing characters in the game - her demise was so laughable and stupid there was really no point putting her in the film. What a waste!I thought Sindel wasn't too bad, but with her bad dialogue, it was quite ridiculous in many ways. She didn't feel much like a fighter, especially with the fight with Kitana at the end - Kitana could have knocked her down in a second - horrible choreography.Why did they make Jade a traitor? I thought she was one of the good characters in the game, not a traitor. And what's more - why didn't they make her character black? She is not Asian! I think they just wanted to bring some chemistry between her and Liu Kang but hey it didn't work!The visual effects seemed more obvious and cheesy than in the first and a lot of the cast are replaced by new actors. James Remar does not make an interesting Raiden nor a worthy one that is worthy of being feared or respected as the Thunder God. I didn't mind the new actress who played Sonja but the original had more toughness and attitude in her performance. The way Sonja was portrayed made her a bit more softer than fierce - Bridgett Wilson just kicked ass all the way.Acting wise, it's pretty flat and it doesn't help with some corny lines. Kitana and Sindel get some of the funniest lines 'My mother's dead....'as soon will be her daughter!' Overall, the film feels like it's going in too many directions, introducing new characters out of nowhere and not really drawing you into this world. Talisa Soto seems to have the same expression on her face most of the time and really fell flat in this one whereas in the original she seems like she was enjoying herself a bit more.Oh and the ending was so cheesy - how they all walk off hand in hand arms around each other. I think they could have made it a bit more...dramatic. I mean the first one's ending was similar but it seemed to have more of a punch.If you can overlook a lot of its faults, you'll have a fairly amusing time with this but in the end you'll be wondering how they managed to make this really uninspiring or suspenseful for a story that is meant to be about saving the world.

Yet, to me, that's really beside the point, especially since no one with any self respect should ever take any single source as gospel. This film is great because it's not just ABOUT a conspiracy, but it's about why conspiracy's are so fascinating, and why people like to believe in them. The simple answer is they make great stories. I mean, pretend for a second that JFK was a fictional film... exact same film, except nothing was based on actual people. It'd be rightly seen as a brilliant thriller full of plot twist after plot twist.There's also a lot of black humor in the film I think people miss as they huff and puff about this and that. Personally, do I believe JFK's death was done by the US government as an internal coup from one ideology to another to help jumpstart the Vietnam war and also help line the pockets of companies that build military equipment? No... but it makes a great story. And I find it easier to watch this kinda story, too, when the official story makes no sense. Obviously something was going on. The most reasonable theories usually deal with some mob connections and a small but powerful group of people behind the assassination. Not a massive governmental conspiracy, but also not just one lone guy. But JFK goes beyond that as a film, and it really represents to me WHY conspiracy theories are so attractive (and why, when things don't add up, we automatically start connecting the dots in the most extreme ways. Foul play may be involved, but not to the level we sometimes wish it was involved).There's one other film that does this.... Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Another film where people try to claim it's outing the Illuminati or whatever, but that's really not the point of the film at all. In Eyes Wide Shut, we see a man who has lost the passion for life because there is no conflict in his life, so he goes looking for it. It parallels human's need for excitement and challenge with the same needs in marriage and sex, but JFK and EWS go together for me as two sides of the same coin. Different tones and structure, but both are about - beyond everything else - why the idea of conspiracies are attractive, and ultimately, why storytelling can be such a powerful force. Because after all, in the end all a conspiracy theory is is, well, a tall tale.

I simply waited too long.Fast Times at Ridgemont High is as dated as they come, yet all the males (mostly, if not exclusively straight) remember this movie fondly. Heck, it was featured just recently in the most current American Dad episode. (Side Note thankfully, I just now saw this, so I knew who Jeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) was and could catch the reference.) So, it's an enormously influential part of the everyday heterosexual male's life.Is it because of the extensive female nudity? The surfer-dude anarchy\/teachers N school sucks! attitude? How about the whole package show a movie that should contain male nudity, such as the boy's locker room or a guy masturbating, but don't because guys don't want to see that?Pause. Yep, that's what guys wanted to see. No sausages, only breasts. Well. You'll get that, plus so little more!Such as NO PLOT. Guys fooling around. A school year that passes before your eyes. Teachers that are a blind as politicians to the American voter's needs.What more do you want?Well, I want more. But, even being late to seeing this movie, roughly thirty years &#x96; argh, I need some resemblance of a plot line. Halfway through this movie I was trying to figure out what it was all about. And then when it ended, I said Oh! I now know&#x85;less than when it started.That said&#x85;the movie wasn't terrible. It was funny for the most part.

THE BIG SLEEP certainly doesn't come close to the Humphrey Bogart\/Lauren Bacall film but at the same time it's somewhat unfair to judge the two especially when you consider that this version was a lot closer to the original novel and features stuff that couldn't even be hinted at in the 1947 version. The basic plot how a lot of perversion as we're dealing with one sister (Clark) who is certainly a sexual pervert and someone who is taken nude photos, which sets off the entire blackmailing. Teenage pornography is one of the many subplots as a wide range of characters come in and out of the story. For the most part I enjoyed this version but I think what really kept it from being a good movie is the rather lackluster direction by Winner who just doesn't seem to know what to do with the material. There are far too many scenes that contain no suspense, no tension and even worse is that some of the action scenes come across as some sort of bored after thought. There are a couple different scenes where Marlowe finds himself in some sort of struggle yet they're all filmed rather poorly and end up going no where. I'm not expecting some sort of masterpiece but the director should have at least worked the mystery a tad bit more but sadly there's very little energy or emotion to be found. I will admit that the story here is much better than the original movie as Marlowe and Mitchum seem perfectly well suited for the material. There are several scenes where the sisters come onto Mitchum and that laid back approach of his is perfectly done and there never was a better acting at playing this type of detective. Mitchum is clearly having fun with the role and he certainly helps keep the film moving. Stewart only has a couple small scenes but it's always nice to see him and the stuff with Mitchum was a lot of fun because the two legends are clearly having fun working together. Both Miles and Clark are good in their roles and we get nice supporting work from Richard Boone, Richard Todd, Joan Collins and Oliver Reed. This film certainly earns its R-rating as Clark is nude in pretty much each of her scenes here and the dirty nature of the pornography certainly sets the film apart from the original. The film had its setting changed to London, which is somewhat of a letdown as L.A. would have been much better but overall THE BIG SLEEP is a fairly rewarding picture but one only wishes the director had done a better job.

With their whole lives ahead of them the boy breaks things off, which sends their lives down different paths as he follows a life he doesn't want while she slowly loses her mind. This isn't the greatest film ever made but it's certainly worthy of watching for a number of reasons including the marvelous performance by Wood and of course the screen debut of Beatty. I was a little surprised to see that William Inge won an Oscar for his screenplay because I honestly thought this was one of the things that held the film back. I think it's safe to say that the film wanted to shine the light on mental illness and it also might have wanted to tell teens that their parents aren't always right. The problem I had with the screenplay is that Wood's mental illness seems to come out of no where. One day she's happy and normal and then the boy breaks up with her and right off the bat she falls off the deep end. At first you'd think that she was just going through a heartache but there's nothing here to show why or how she ended up in an asylum for over two years. There was nothing early on to warn us that she might have some sort of problem so when she falls so far it's somewhat hard to swallow. I think the screenplay also goes on a tad bit too long but other than these issues this here is a pretty solid picture. The main reason to watch this is for the performance of Wood who has never been better in her career. She does a remarkable job playing the girl and this is especially true during the pre-asylum scenes where she comes off like a fresh rose. I thought Wood did a terrific job playing the sweet girl and when we see her struggling over her sexual feelings the actress nailed this perfectly. When the breakdown happens the actress handles this extremely well too. Beatty is pretty good as well, although I thought he struggle with a few of the more dramatic moments with his father. Beatty certainly had the looks for the part and you can't help but feel he's trying to give a James Dean type performance. Pat Hingle is terrific as Beatty's father and Sandy Dennis, Phyllis Diller and Eugene Roche have small roles as well. Kazan handles the material quite well but there were a few times where I was questioning if he was the right person for this type of melodrama. I thought he let a few scenes go on a tad bit too long but it turned out he was perfect for the ending at least. I won't ruin the ending for anyone but it was incredibly powerful and touching without going for any of the melodrama. Instead, we're given a fairly quiet little scene that packs a terrific punch by saying very little.

The problem I had with the screenplay is that Wood's mental illness seems to come out of no where. One day she's happy and normal and then the boy breaks up with her and right off the bat she falls off the deep end. At first you'd think that she was just going through a heartache but there's nothing here to show why or how she ended up in an asylum for over two years. There was nothing early on to warn us that she might have some sort of problem so when she falls so far it's somewhat hard to swallow. I think the screenplay also goes on a tad bit too long but other than these issues this here is a pretty solid picture. The main reason to watch this is for the performance of Wood who has never been better in her career. She does a remarkable job playing the girl and this is especially true during the pre-asylum scenes where she comes off like a fresh rose. I thought Wood did a terrific job playing the sweet girl and when we see her struggling over her sexual feelings the actress nailed this perfectly. When the breakdown happens the actress handles this extremely well too. Beatty is pretty good as well, although I thought he struggle with a few of the more dramatic moments with his father. Beatty certainly had the looks for the part and you can't help but feel he's trying to give a James Dean type performance. Pat Hingle is terrific as Beatty's father and Sandy Dennis, Phyllis Diller and Eugene Roche have small roles as well. Kazan handles the material quite well but there were a few times where I was questioning if he was the right person for this type of melodrama. I thought he let a few scenes go on a tad bit too long but it turned out he was perfect for the ending at least. I won't ruin the ending for anyone but it was incredibly powerful and touching without going for any of the melodrama. Instead, we're given a fairly quiet little scene that packs a terrific punch by saying very little.

With their whole lives ahead of them the boy breaks things off, which sends their lives down different paths as he follows a life he doesn't want while she slowly loses her mind. This isn't the greatest film ever made but it's certainly worthy of watching for a number of reasons including the marvelous performance by Wood and of course the screen debut of Beatty.

The ingenious ideas of linking the whole movie with aliens, coincidences, the existence of a supreme power, the ever wavering human mind and how events change a person for good or bad Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors I have seen And the script has been so well written that it suits perfectly for a person like him. The super caring and concerned Father who is going through a personal misery. And the two kids have played their parts brilliantly too. Especially the little girl is really cute. And the brother has played his part really well. Everyone has played their parts so well that the movie feels so real. The movie's script has been really well thought. The way the things are linked right from the beginning till the very end. Including the brain nerves of Mel's wife going all crazy and recollecting Swing away and Mel thinking about his wife all though the movie resulting in the outstanding climax that suits this movie perfectly. The boy having asthma and the aliens secreting small amounts of poison. This movie is quite simply made of coincidences and has been put forth brilliantly. And the very simple fact that they hardly even show the Alien, is the best part. One of the many concepts of crop circles being for navigation and they are for forming maps . The aliens using only hand to hand combat as they know that humans would eventually use nuclear weapons making the planet useless . Shows how well the movie has been made.

I remember when the remake starring Tim Allen came out in 2006 and I saw a trailer for it, but I didn't know that film was a remake at the time. I still haven't seen that version, and have known for sometime now that it's not all that popular, but now I have finally seen the original 1959 version of The Shaggy Dog, with a cast featuring Fred MacMurray and several cast members of The Mickey Mouse Club. I didn't think this movie would be amazing family entertainment, since it doesn't seem to have that kind of reputation, but I was expecting it to be a 7\/10 for me, which it is.Wilby Daniels is a teenager who likes to conduct experiments in the basement, but his father, Wilson, does not like this, and after Wilby accidentally launches a missile from the basement, Wilson tells him to clear out all his experiments. A new family moves into the neighbourhood, and Wilby and his friend, Buzz Miller, soon meet the daughter of the family, Franceska Andrassy. They also meet the family's sheep dog. Wilby, Buzz, and Franceska go to the museum together, but Wilby is separated from the other two. He meets Professor Plumcutt, a man he used to know, who tells him about his beliefs in ancient magic, including shape-shifting. Wilby ends up accidentally bringing home a mystical ring, which turns him into the Andrassy dog! This is not a good thing, since his father hates dogs! He sneaks out to tell Plumcutt what has happened, and learns from him that he is now under a spell, which will turn him back and forth from human to dog, and the only way to break this spell is through a selfless act of heroism! As a comedy, this 1959 live action Disney flick is far from consistent, but I did laugh a number of times, starting around the beginning when Wilby has his missile in the basement and accidentally launches it from there, obviously putting holes in every floor above! More laughs come after Wilby turns into a dog, including the scenes where Officer Hanson hears the teenager talk to him while in dog form. I didn't usually laugh that hard, but those parts were definitely exceptions, and were not the only ones! The acting in The Shaggy Dog is mostly not that impressive, and the plot isn't the most interesting, but in both cases, I've certainly seen worse. The dance sequence is maybe a bit tedious, and during parts like that, it was somewhat of a struggle for me to stay into it, but eventually, that changed, as the story gets better and the suspense builds up! For the rest of the film, I had no trouble staying into it, even if it wears out its welcome just a BIT towards the end. So, while by no means a masterpiece, this original Shaggy Dog probably still has enough to please the family.
