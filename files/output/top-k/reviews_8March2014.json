With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.I give it a 9\/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.

( Oh, please. Hits an iceberg? Like THAT could really happen. Sheesh, give us a break! ) All in all an OK film, ... up until then. But the ending is a real downer (or is that 'drowner'?) Maybe the Titanic 2 sequel will be better; or at least Cameron could release a Director's Cut Edition without the total buzz-kill ending. It's a wonder that any movie studio considered this film 'commercial', given the near absence of explosions and car crashes? There are only a couple of explosions in the whole movie ( ship's boilers, yawn ...), and there are no car crashes at all. In fact, the closest thing to a car crash is an antique car in the ship's hold, with the two lead actors in a little steam-up-the-windows backseat action. Seriously, I'm not kidding! ( palm to forehead, shake head and groan CLICHE' ALERT! ) ... They LITERALLY steam-up the windows. Good grief! Fortunately there is some gratuitous nudity; although the actress exposing her 'lady-bits' clearly weighs-in at well over 100 pounds, ... and I think we all would agree that's just wrong!!! In the Director's Cut Edition Cameron should Photoshop a few pounds off the actress, and redo that scene in 3-D ( and maybe the 'nekkid' actress could be painted blue, and sport pointy ears and a tail! ) And it would be great if Cameron could add a parallel storyline that the lead character, Jack, is actually the great-grandfather of John Connor, and at the last possible moment great-grandson Connor, hotly pursued by a homicidal cyborg Terminator, travels back in time through a wormhole, lands on the foredeck of Titanic and fires a couple of missiles and blows up the iceberg. Small pieces of iceberg rain down all over the deck, and it's celebratory on-the-rocks cocktails for everyone! Cue the music, ... fade to black.

Anthony Michael Hall's Geek (actual character name) might be the most perfectly build-up character in Hughes' entire filmography, never have I been so happy for a guy this creepy. Occasionally though, I got to say things get somewhat weird with the various likeable characters. For instance, the perfect boy of our main character's dreams is someone who tries to hook up with her while passing his current girlfriend (who for good measure is unconscious and drunk) to a 15-year-old who he forces to drive a car. Wow, get him while he's available ladies! But hell, this movie has such a sweet atmosphere and somewhere in there I heard the happy ending music so let's not nitpick. In the same category the Chinese character might be the worst racial stereotype since Andy Rooney in Breakfast At Tiffany's, but I dare you to see the YES, MARRIED!-scene and not laugh.

I haven't seen the 1947 movie of An Ideal Husband, but I did see the 1969 BBC production with Jeremy Brett. I can't imagine any production of this witty, clever and satirical story not being highly entertaining. At the same time, I can't think that any future version will top this 1999 film. The story spectacle is excellent &#x96; along the lines of the big splashy movies of Victorian England. All the technical and production values are first-rate. But it is the directing and acting that stand out most. It is in the dialog, with facial expressions, gestures and moves that one best appreciates Wilde. It is from the people that the author wrings out the great comedy and satire &#x96; amidst drama at times, and romance and suspense.This film has a substantial cast of wonderful actors. Every role is exquisitely played to perfection &#x96; um, make that NEAR-perfection. But Rupert Everett's Lord Goring is something else. To imitate a quip in the play penned by the witty Wilde, Everett's Goring is only slightly less than perfect. It's hard to imagine this egocentric, ego-maniacal character any funnier than in this film.A bonus featurette with my DVD intimates that An Ideal Husband is also a drama. I'll concede to the dramatic moments and undertone. But the comedy thread provided by Lord Goring throughout never lets those elements of drama take hold or last longer than to set up the next pun or witty line. This movie is a wonderful feast of quips, subtleties, face-offs and dismissals. It pokes fun at different aspects of society &#x96; the rich and idle, the wealthy and powerful, the prim and proper, the cunning and conniving, the perfect and the imperfect. It has messages and delivers them with good humor and subtlety. This 1999 version of An Ideal Husband is Oscar Wilde at his best. I highly recommend this film. It's suitable for the whole family &#x96; that opening scene with the blurred background passes quickly. But the young folks may not readily catch or enjoy the humor. The following are some lines of dialog to whet your appetite for watching An Ideal Husband.Lord Goring You see, Phipps, fashion is what one wears oneself.

His films always had a deep understanding of human nature. His characters moved with the flow of real life. That human quality endeared his films to audiences and that's why they are still viewed today.That endearing quality probably came from his directing style. He didn't believe in sticking to the script. It has been reported that he showed up with only the framework of a scene, and then let his actors fill in the rest. All I want is a master scene and I'll take care of the rest, he said How to shoot it, how to keep the machinery out of the way, and how to focus attention on the actors at all times. I have always thought of Capra as a pioneer, not least because it was his genius that created It Happened One Night, a movie so popular and so far-reaching that it would inspire two entirely new film genres, the romantic comedy and the screwball comedy. It also helped to perfect the road picture from which some of the greatest films ever made have drawn inspiration; The Hope-Crosby Pictures, Sullivan's Travels, The Blues Brothers, Lost in America, Midnight Run, Rain Man, Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Almost Famous. What these films have in common is some form of familial or romantic attachment from the characters and\/or a feeling of self discovery.It Happened One Night is responsible for all of these things. The story involves Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the spoiled daughter of a millionaire on the cusp of marrying an aviator named King Westley against the wishes of her father (Walter Connolly). He has the marriage annulled, and she is so put out that she so jumps off the side of her father's boat, swims to the shore and boards a bus from Miami to New York in hopes of catching up with her new husband. On the way, she runs into a world-wearing newspaperman, Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who hates her at first sight. He's a man of the world, who knows how to get around.Peter doesn't think much of her, he knows she's a babe in the woods and isn't shy about telling her so. She thinks he's brutish and cruel but she follows him because he can get her out of a jam, at one point he pretends to be her husband in order to fend off the advances of an overly-friendly traveler that she meets on the bus. He doesn't want to lose sight of Ellie because he believes that the story could be a major scoop.Peter and Ellie make amends long enough to get where they are going but their mutual connection is that don't have one. He knows how to keep her safe &#x96; when she runs into the friendly traveler again, Peter pulls him aside and informs that man that he's a gangster who is about to pull a big job. The frightened man wants no part of any criminal activity and makes tracks. Ellie proves herself. During a stop on the side of the road, Peter unsuccessfully tries to show her how hitchhike by shaking his thumb in just the right way. A dozen cars pass without slowing down. Ellie decides to show him a system all my own. Lifting her skirt, the next passing motorist gets a view of her shapely leg and the guy nearly runs himself into the ditch trying to stop.There are a dozen moments like that. One night when Peter and Ellie are forced to share the same cottage, he devises a way that two unmarried people (they're posing as married) can sleep in the same room and have privacy. He builds The Walls of Jerico, a clothesline with heavy blankets thrown over it between their beds. What do you think the odds are that before the movie is over, the walls will come down? The comedy works in broad strokes, but the ever-present Capra-esqe quality of humanity and social commentary isn't quite as bold as it is in his later films. Peter and Ellie aren't interested in the social ills of their country until it crops up &#x96; they both have a personal agenda to tend to. This movie was made five years into the depression but that event exists around the edges of the film. It only takes center stage once, during a scene in which Peter and Ellie give their last few dollars to a starving mother and child on the bus. There is a personal transition in Ellie's soul. What we come to realize about Ellie is that she's been given the spoils all her life and that this revolution &#x96; the road trip in which she finds her sense of personal freedom.If there is a weakness in the film it may come at the moment when we are supposed to accept that Gable and Colbert have fallen in love. He's so mean and critical that it is difficult to believe it when he in love with her. The movie does allow them to meet in the middle as the heavenly rich and the earthy poor come together, the transition of her soul that allows her to follow her own path.

Fortunately, this is not what it turned out to be. Never Been Kissed has a very creative story, and I was amazed for such good ideas these filmmakers had. Josie goes undercover in a high school class, in order to discover some interesting story to tell in her job as a journalist. However, once she gets involved with the students-- and with one teacher--, she starts remembering what high school was like when she was actually there, bringing some nostalgic thoughts in her mind. It's interesting to notice nowadays known actors doing their jobs when they were younger. In this case, Drew Barrymore's character looks much like the classic Cindy Campbell from Scary Movie franchise-- except for the spectacular Campbell's dumbness. The film is full of funny situations; one, in particular, is when the rude big boss screams at everyone in the first reunion. The other happens when Josie eats cake in the party, mainly when one Rastafari dude tells her the cake contains vitamins t, h and c. The bullying portrayal in high school isn't anything different from what you've seen in other movies, so you may not expect much from it. One thing that irritates me is the tradition that Hollywood has in portraying all nerds wearing braces; I mean, only geek people are born with flaws in their teeth? What's wrong with common people using them? The film's ending sadly appeals to cliché moments, but, in my point of view, the overall qualities turn that forgivable, and the outcome is positive for the viewer. Never Been Kissed is, with a few exceptions, a relatively intelligent work that deserves to be seen, even if you've already seen a thousand of high school movies out there. It's better than the most, I assure you.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"8 March 2014","score":"","review":" Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the Hollywood legends that in film-lover circuits has achieved a status usually reserved for Scorsese-helmed gangland dramas, Wellesian experiments, and most musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly. This film, more than any other film of the time before, made comedy classy and personable. It has genuine heart, skillful gags that have no need for pies or extravagant slapstick, and intelligently written characters who are along for a ride, literally and figuratively. It is one of my favorite comedies and my goal for this post is to renew interest in my readers who have already seen it and ignite a curiosity in those who haven't experienced the joy of viewing it for the first time.For those unfortunate ones who haven't yet seen Frank Capra's master work, or simply those who have forgotten its plot, here are the basics. 'Ellie' Andrews, the irresistible Claudette Colbert, is a young socialite from Miami who is bored with her smothering father. She impulsively marries a fortune hunting heel of a man which infuriates her father. She rebelliously runs away and determines to meet her husband in New York, traveling by Greyhound bus. On board, she makes the acquaintance of recently laid-off reporter Peter Warne, the ever charming Clark Gable, who within hours deduces her identity and makes her an offer. She'll allow him exclusive story rights to cover her journey to reunite with her love and he won't tell her daddy where she is. The rest of the movie is a wagon-load of shenanigans that the two of them get into on the bus, off the bus, on the road, in the wilderness, and in the process of multiple overnight rooms. This movie was the boasted favorite of Friz Freleng, one of the pioneers of the Looney Tunes and you can see why. The gags and dialogue are snappy and always effective, all the actors are in rare form, and the story moves at a brisk, yet leisurely pace to compliment the sometimes leisurely, sometimes chaotic journey these two share. Why don't I own this one yet?! Time and generational gaps have unfortunately given It Happened One Night the label of an old movie, something an unfortunate number of youth today will go out of their way to avoid, which saddens me. I am as much a proponent of classic film as Scorsese or Roger Ebert, and that does not make me old. That makes me educated in a certain regard to history. It Happened One Night was the first of only three films thus-far in American film history to win the Big Five Oscars Best Picture, Screenplay, Director, Actor, and Actress. This movie is a time capsule of how it was in the Depression on the road. I would rather watch this movie than another time capsule of the Depression-era, John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, since this movie is nothing but lighthearted fun from start to finish. Grapes of Wrath is so heavy-handed and sappy, that it tends to make Paul Haggis' Crash look subtle and that movie could hardly have been less subtle.This film is a bundle of joy wrapped in caustic lunacy with love from one of America's prime comedic directors, Frank Capra, whom most would remember as the maker of 1939's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the public domain classic It's a Wonderful Life. If you're interested in seeing more from super-zany Capra rather than soapbox, melodramatic Capra, look for 1938 Best Picture Winner You Can't Take it with You. This movie is begging to be watched, so do It Happened One Night a favor, and give it a look. I personally guarantee you won't be disappointed.Final Rating 5\/5 Practically Perfect in Every Way ","genre":null},{"date":"8 March 2014","score":"","review":" Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the Hollywood legends that in film-lover circuits has achieved a status usually reserved for Scorsese-helmed gangland dramas, Wellesian experiments, and most musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly.

It has genuine heart, skillful gags that have no need for pies or extravagant slapstick, and intelligently written characters who are along for a ride, literally and figuratively. It is one of my favorite comedies and my goal for this post is to renew interest in my readers who have already seen it and ignite a curiosity in those who haven't experienced the joy of viewing it for the first time.For those unfortunate ones who haven't yet seen Frank Capra's master work, or simply those who have forgotten its plot, here are the basics. 'Ellie' Andrews, the irresistible Claudette Colbert, is a young socialite from Miami who is bored with her smothering father. She impulsively marries a fortune hunting heel of a man which infuriates her father. She rebelliously runs away and determines to meet her husband in New York, traveling by Greyhound bus. On board, she makes the acquaintance of recently laid-off reporter Peter Warne, the ever charming Clark Gable, who within hours deduces her identity and makes her an offer. She'll allow him exclusive story rights to cover her journey to reunite with her love and he won't tell her daddy where she is. The rest of the movie is a wagon-load of shenanigans that the two of them get into on the bus, off the bus, on the road, in the wilderness, and in the process of multiple overnight rooms. This movie was the boasted favorite of Friz Freleng, one of the pioneers of the Looney Tunes and you can see why. The gags and dialogue are snappy and always effective, all the actors are in rare form, and the story moves at a brisk, yet leisurely pace to compliment the sometimes leisurely, sometimes chaotic journey these two share. Why don't I own this one yet?! Time and generational gaps have unfortunately given It Happened One Night the label of an old movie, something an unfortunate number of youth today will go out of their way to avoid, which saddens me. I am as much a proponent of classic film as Scorsese or Roger Ebert, and that does not make me old. That makes me educated in a certain regard to history. It Happened One Night was the first of only three films thus-far in American film history to win the Big Five Oscars Best Picture, Screenplay, Director, Actor, and Actress. This movie is a time capsule of how it was in the Depression on the road. I would rather watch this movie than another time capsule of the Depression-era, John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, since this movie is nothing but lighthearted fun from start to finish. Grapes of Wrath is so heavy-handed and sappy, that it tends to make Paul Haggis' Crash look subtle and that movie could hardly have been less subtle.This film is a bundle of joy wrapped in caustic lunacy with love from one of America's prime comedic directors, Frank Capra, whom most would remember as the maker of 1939's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and the public domain classic It's a Wonderful Life. If you're interested in seeing more from super-zany Capra rather than soapbox, melodramatic Capra, look for 1938 Best Picture Winner You Can't Take it with You. This movie is begging to be watched, so do It Happened One Night a favor, and give it a look. I personally guarantee you won't be disappointed.Final Rating 5\/5 Practically Perfect in Every Way ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"8 March 2014","score":"","review":" Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the Hollywood legends that in film-lover circuits has achieved a status usually reserved for Scorsese-helmed gangland dramas, Wellesian experiments, and most musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly.

The early nineties, maybe, the late eighties, more likely, I think. Yet, there is it. Release date 1996. The film feels much older then that, a deliberate throwback to early eighties creature features, when Rick Baker, Rob Bottin, and Stan Winston redefined monster effects. The film was ignored upon release and remains somewhat obscure to this day. Open-minded horror fans who take a chance on it might find a likable, eccentric werewolf thriller.Based on the novel Thor by Wayne Smith, Bad Moon is a story about a boy and his dog&#x85; And a werewolf. Attorney Janet lives with preteen son Brett in a big house on the edge of the Pacific Northwest forest. Seems the only company the family of two has is Thor, their loyal German Shepherd. That is until Janet's brother Ted comes to stay. Unbeknownst to the family, Ted was bitten by a werewolf while in Nepal. Changing every night, he struggles with his animal tendencies, handcuffing himself to a tree when he transforms. Neither Janet nor Brett connect Ted's reappearance to the vicious mauling deaths in the area. Thor, on the other hand, senses something off about the uncle. The dog keeps a close eye on the man and his nightly rituals. It's not much longer until Ted realizes that Thor is on to his secret.Perhaps the reason the film has never been well-received, besides it generic title, is that Bad Moon seems to be a movie with two minds. The films open with a steamy sex scene that ends with a werewolf tearing a woman apart and then having its head blown off. The film then transitions to a little boy playing catch with his dog. The whole film slingshots between those two tones. The gore is fairly explicit, the werewolf crushing a construction worker's head in its jaws, strewing his body parts through a tree. Later, the wolf tears a con man apart with his claws, the blood spraying through the air. When the movie isn't focused on graphic werewolf violence, it's a film about family, including the beloved pet Thor. This schizophrenic tone is most obvious in the final act. While Ted confronts Janet about his lycanthropy, chasing her through the house, Brett sneaks off on his bike, rescuing Thor from the local pound. The hard horror content doesn't always co-exist easily with the Spielbergian family drama.Yet it almost doesn't matter because veteran genre screenwriter turned genre director Eric Red nails the heart of the story. The soul of the film rests behind Thor's vivid eyes and the love his family has for him. If they gave out Oscars to dogs, Primo, the shepherd who plays the part, would have won. I'm only being partially facetious when I say he's the best actor in the film. Any animal lover is bound to have their heart-strings tugged by the scene where Thor is separated from his boy. The last act, where Thor and the werewolf fight, would have been ridiculous if the audience didn't care about Thor as much as the characters do. The movie successfully endears the dog to the viewer, investing Bad Moon with far more emotion then it otherwise would have had.The human cast is a bit more mixed. Mariel Hemingway does very well as the single mom, never reduced to a screaming female. She's strong in the face of a petty con men and remains strong when being chased by a werewolf. Mason Gamble as the young boy is less impressive. It's a good thing that the kid is pushed towards the sideline for most of the film because he's not quite convincing. Michael Pare's performance is a bit harder to read. He conveys a threatening attitude subtly, especially when only a blink frightens Thor into attacking. However, moments of bigger emotions seem unconvincing coming out of Pare's mouth. A brief voice-over narration especially doesn't work, Pare given melodramatic dialogue about the restorative power of love, for goodness' sake.The center piece of any werewolf movie is its werewolf. Bad Moon doesn't feature the most original design, your standard up-right dire wolf. However, the effects are convincing. Some might consider them cheesy but I like the close-ups of the drooling, snarling face. The film's relatively small cast keeps the body count low but gore hounds might still find effects of note here. The dismembered body mentioned earlier is especially gruesome. The only effect in the movie that doesn't work is a nightmare sequence featuring a were-dog. It's a silly moment and luckily one the film doesn't focus on. Werewolf of London is briefly seen and the film outright pays homage too, with its werewolf vulnerable to regular bullets and Nepal-set opening.Red's direction is handsome and makes good use of its lush shooting location. The score balances frights and lovely orchestral nicely. I'm not surprised that Bad Moon bombed in theaters as a post-Scream audience probably didn't have much interest in an eighties-style creature feature. The movie's unlikely to blow anyone's socks off but it's a solid werewolf flick nevertheless.
