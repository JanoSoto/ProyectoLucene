But I loved this movie. I watched it four times on the big screen. And this was even before I knew that Woo's HK works and later films were twice a extravagant.I've heard that Woo's fans didn't like this movie because it was too tame for him. (Limited double gun action and so forth) While I would have liked this movie even more if Woo went all out like in THE KILLER or HARD-BOILED, he showed that he doesn't need to depend on bullet ballet film making to create cool action scenes. Relying on a gimmick is what kills some film makers, and Woo is a man who doesn't need to rely on his creation. (WINDTALKERS is another film that doesn't need HK styled action to look good) I was glad that his other traits were able to go on film. The standoff scene with Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis where he has the gun and she has a knife was put to great effect. And even though it seems odd that a park ranger would know a thing or two about combat, it made sense for Mathis' character since she was that type of actiony person. (I'd be fighting and shooting it out if I were a park ranger.) The use of slow motion was cool too. All of the sequences of things blowing up were awesome, and didn't rely on CGI as movies of today do. (Even though some of them use it correctly.) Of course the performances of the actors were all great. What else can I say other than John Travolta's vilainous performance was slick, and that Slater made a great action hero? (I hope he's the star of another cool action film. It was nice seeing his brief role in WINDTALKERS, but he needs more.) Samantha Mathis was really cool. Wo says he's always wanted to make a strong female character, and he really came close with her.

I am not a fan of nudity in films, especially the backsides of people jumping into a pond or the front of some woman swimming and swimming and swimming.  I failed to glimpse a great love story.  I thought it was never developed, and I cannot recall whether John and Iris referred to each other as husband\/wife.  Instead of loving Iris, John always seemed in awe of her.  Instead of being a great writer, Iris seemed to be a walking, talking platitude.  The scene that featured young Iris kissing upward young John's arm was yucky.  Judy Dench was excellent in this role.  Her slipping away, ever so slowly, was realistic  the look on her face, her blank eyes, her messy hair, her walk, and those long, wet sleeves of her sweater while she wandered lost in the rain.  The flashbacks were all right although the attempts at being clever were silly.  I liked the young and the old characters played by different actors.

There are flawless performances, excellent cinematography, and the art direction and costume design are perfect, both for film-lovers and for historical nit-pickers.Ridley Scott's direction does well to bring to life the great tale of a Roman general turned gladiator-slave, Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russell Crowe) who defies and overthrows the wrongful and villainous emperor of Rome, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The director manages to invoke exceptional performances from the entire cast and leaves us wanting more. One of the other most enjoyable parts of this movie is Hans Zimmer's score, moving in every scene and creating a mood matched by few movie scores. Personally I think Zimmer was ripped off at the 2000 Oscars.Now for the spoilers. As a piece of cinema, Gladiator struggles. The central interaction between the two main protagonists is brilliantly done and the under-tone of each battle scene is well portrayed, that Maximus kills only when he is required to and that is enough for him to go on to the afterlife. However, the film itself is fundamentally inaccurate, historically speaking. History tells us that Commodus was a fine emperor, beloved by his people, far from the evil, plotting emperor we see Phoenix portraying here. Naturally, the screenwriter Franzoni, Logan and Nicholson decided to use artistic license and alter the lines of history in order to make a one-off, unconnected movie. But for this reason, the attempt to incorporate political ideas into this movie fails, as it tries to create a tale of a new, young emperor struggling to follow in the footsteps of his beloved older father, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). But neither the senate nor the real emperor Commodus would ever have had problems on this score. Hence, the 'movie' chooses to write its own rules in order to tell a story, under the pretence that is a historical epic.Also, while not intending to say anything of a racist nature, the casting is slightly odd. Personally I have had a little trouble recently understanding the fact that the gladiator referred to as the 'Spaniard' is played by Russell Crowe who, in this movie, speaks in more of an Australian accent than any other type, while the Hispanic actor Phoenix portrays the Roman Emperor. This is not to say that both actors do not do a tremendous job in their roles, it is just that Phoenix does not, in the end, look much like Richard Harris' son and Connie Neilsen's brother. But overall I don't think it is important, for the simple fact that Phoenix pulls off one of the most amazing and empathetic performances ever to grace a movie screen. Personally I believe that in the past decade, there have been only two truly great villainous performances; Phoenix is one, the other, more recently, being Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York. As a sidetrack, Gangs of NY actually contained the similar ambiguous casting, with English-born Day-Lewis playing an American 'native', while Leonardo DiCaprio, born and raised in Hollywood, played the Irish settler.Back to Gladiator, and Ridley Scott's direction being another element to diminish this as a piece of cinema. There is nothing wrong with Scott's direction, it is perfect. But it is cliched, the film is very Hollywood, set against an almost monochromatic ancient backdrop. While the art direction and so forth are all stunning, Scott uses them only as a background to the main tale which is nothing original. It is a little too hackneyed, I would say, to have the main protagonist, despite however many people he has killed, to be the dedicated family man who wants vengeance for the murder of his wife and son and so the character of Maximus does not quite work on that score. But that is the only problem; the battle sequences, both in the arena and in times of Roman conquest, are all impeccably directed and are, unlike some of my other comments, historically realistic as far as we can tell in this day and age. It is actually an accurate depiction of the way people fought during that time period.And finally to mention the performances more in-depth, they are all flawless. Despite the visually odd casting as previously mentioned, Crowe and Phoenix are perfectly cast and perfectly directed to extract brilliant performances in two very difficult roles. While the stand-out for me is always Phoenix, the minor characters also play a very important role. Connie Neilsen produces what I think is her best performance to date as the frightened and virtuous Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou is great as Maximus' fellow gladiator, while Marcus Aurelius and Antonius Proximo provide two later roles for two great and esteemed careers of Richard Harris and Oliver Reed respectively. Having said this, I think that the most perfectly cast is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. When all is said and done, Jacobi contains far and away the most credibility of the minor characters, both visually and in terms of his performance. It is not an entirely difficult role to play but Jacobi achieves it to perfection.Overall, Gladiator is outstanding viewing and what will become a classic for everybody to see. It is powerful, moving, tense and not overly violent and for these reasons it is extremely widely accessible. As a piece of 'cinema', four stars, as a movie, five.

In five minutes you are not going to believe what I just told you. I'm in the middle of a mystery and it's all secret. I'm seeing something that was always hidden. What does that mean?A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. This is where mechanical excellence and one-thousand four-hundred horsepower pays off! I had a dream. I had a dream about this place. In fact, it was on the night I met you.  In the dream, there was our world, and the world was dark because there weren't any robins and the robins represented love. And for the longest time, there was this darkness. And all of a sudden, thousands of robins were set free and they flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it seemed that love would make any difference, and it did. So, I guess it means that there is trouble until the robins come. It's a strange world. This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the sitution, don't you think?  Well, that's for me to know and you to find out. Well, I don't think much of anything. I like to remember things my own way. A man's attitude... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. You sure you're doing okay? Everything all right? It's no longer your film. There's something I've been meaning to ask you for some time now. Am I a good man? Or a bad man? Oh no... no... you're a Romeo. Okay, I'm thinking. That ain't no way to treat your wife, buddy.

The first two Hill\/Grier collaborations were women in prison movies with Grier an important part of an ensemble cast (which also included Hill regular the legendary Sid Haig). Then came 'Coffy', one of the best exploitation movies of the 1970s. Grier really shone in that movie, and along with 'Spiderbaby' it's arguably Hill's best film. 'Foxy Brown' comes across as a rather self-conscious attempt to recreate the success of 'Coffy', but sadly something is missing. Both movies follow a similar revenge formula, but there's less realism this time round. The opening credits are kitschy and fun, but it's very hey, look at me, Pam Grier Superstar!, and the movie reflects this. 'Coffy' was great because it was the story of an average working class black woman who must find it within herself to do some extraordinary things. In 'Foxy Brown' things just come too easy for Grier's character, and she is much closer to Roundtree's John Shaft or even Tamara Dobson's Cleopatra Jones. I feel this movie loses a lot of what was unique and compelling about 'Coffy', and gets too close to just being a generic action flick. However Grier with Hill is still better than her subsequent movies in this genre like say 'Sheba, Baby' or 'Friday Foster', so I can't say it's a complete waste of time. Grier is sexy and charismatic throughout, and still one of the best exploitation stars of the mid-70s. Grier really dominates 'Foxy Brown' but the much-loved Antonio Fargas ('Shaft', 'Cleopatra Jones', but best known as Huggy Bear on TV's 'Starsky And Hutch') plays her shifty coke-dealing brother, Katheryn Loder (who some might remember from Hill's earlier 'The Big Doll House') is great as a sadistic Madame, and Sid Haig has a nice bit as a horny pilot. I wish the supporting cast had more chances to shine, and that Grier's character had a bit more depth, but it was not to be. This was Jack Hill's last movie with Pam Grier. He went on to make the marvelous 'Switchblade Sisters', she went on to a very uneven career until Tarantino's excellent 'Jackie Brown', possibly her best role to date. I really wish Jack Hill would make movies again, and I'd love to see him team up once more with Pam Grier and Sid Haig, because I think they have some unfinished business and the results could really be something special.
