According to the DVD sleeve description, Reese Witherspoon plays 'Tracy Flick', a straight-A go-getter determined to be president of Carver High's student body. Popular teacher 'Jim McAlister' (Broderick) decides to derail Tracy's obsessive overachieving by recruiting an opposition candidate. 'Mr. M.' never imagines that stopping Tracy is like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube. This sophomore feature by Alexander Payne is anything but sophomoric - it's very cleverly written (from a book by Tom Perrotta), and directed. Mr. Broderick and Ms. Witherspoon offer fresh and funny performances, and are supported by an amazingly strong second string actor and actress - Chris Klein (as Paul Metzler) and Jessica Campbell (as Tammy Metzler); they make grand early career impressions. The film breaks tradition by actually resembling its high school setting, with the cast looking and acting like they actually belong in the school. This makes the story's satire all the more effective.******** Election (4\/23\/99) Alexander Payne ~ Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein, Jessica Campbell ","genre":null},{"date":"11 June 2010","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Matthew Broderick, so memorable as a truant overachiever in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), finds the tables turned as a history teacher fooling around with his high school's Election for Student Council President.
