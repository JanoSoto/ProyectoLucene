Director Dan O'Bannon had enough sense to decide he didn't want to end up with unfavourable comparisons to George Romero's timeless classic. So he rewrote this script idea as a sort of satire. Which is rather novel when you consider that the zombie horror concept is, at heart, a satire of consumerist social ideas. What makes this satire work is how irreverently it plays out. What counts against it is that it never seems to make up its mind whether it wants the audience to laugh or scream.Another moment in the film's favour is when one of the young punk women, played with aplomb by Linnea Quigley, strips down to her birthday suit and dances about. Not only is she very pleasant to look at this way, she remains in this state throughout the rest of the film. Even when she becomes a zombie. But that was one of the fun things about Hollywood in the mid-1980s. Women could get their clothes off without people making such a big drama about it. It would have been nice if more of the feminine part of the cast could have taken their clothes off, but this particular woman was pleasant enough to carry the show on her own.The rest of the cast do a decent job of playing the required parts, but there are no standout parts. Scratch that. The story and characters do have enough potential for memorable performances, but the actors seem utterly lost as to how to take advantage. Those who have watched enough B films will recognise a few familiar faces here and there, Thom Mathews and Miguel A. Núñez Jr. being two examples that spring to mind, but one will be hard-pressed to remember the characters' names. The real stars of this show, other than the aforementioned stripper, are the makeup effects.The majority of the zombies, in contrast to the more cerebral works of George Romero, really look like they're dead. Unfortunately, they also seem to follow that fast-zombie pattern. In fact, this could well be where the origin of the fast-zombie idea may be traced back to. The ending seems more like a cop-out than a wrap-up. Given how the rest of the film makes the zombies seem invulnerable, I suppose this was inevitable, but it also has that faint odour of poor planning. When all is said and done, John Russo appears to have been doing some serious coattail riding with his connection to Night Of The Living Dead.I gave Return Of The Living Dead a five out of ten. It is amusing enough to pass ninety minutes with, but I wouldn't want to take it with me to a desert island. It is worth a rental.

While there, she gradually discovers the truth about their bizarre past and falls for a zoo curator.First, a caveat. Director Paul Schrader, in his interview on the Cat People DVD, says that he regrets that he didn't just change the name of the film to remove some of the perception that this is a remake of Jacques Tourneur's Cat People from 1942. It is wrong to look at this as a remake. Aside from mostly superficial similarities, Schrader's Cat People really has little to do with the original--no more in common than, say, The Grudge (2004) and The Ring (2002), assuming that Kayako from The Grudge would have been named Samara instead, or no more similar than any two random vampire films. Irena's first name is the same, there are similarities in her background story and what she is, she visits a zoo, she falls in love with a man with the same first name of Oliver, and there are maybe two and a half scenes similar to Tourneur's film. That's it. Yes, I'm a fan of Tourneur's film, too--it's my favorite out of his collaborations with producer Val Lewton. But you have to forget about Tourneur's film when watching this one. This is a remarkable work of cinematic art in its own right, with its own story and goals.Schrader's Cat People deserves a 10 on visual terms alone. The cinematography, production design and lighting are nothing short of genius throughout the film. Almost every shot is one that deserves to be paused and studied. Director of photography John Bailey never ceases to find interesting perspectives, angles and tracking. The sets are elaborate and exquisitely constructed for visual impact. In conjunction with the lighting, the film is mired in a rich, varied palette of colors similar to (and as good as) Dario Argento's best work.Of course the film is more graphic than Tourneur's--it would be almost impossible for it not to be, both in terms of blood\/gore and nudity, and all of that is shot brilliantly as well. The only cinematic instance of blood that I can think of that is as effective as the scene in this film where blood runs by Irena's shoes and down a drain is the shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). The event leading up to this image has more impact of most similar scenes, as well. The copious amounts of nudity throughout the film are never gratuitous (not that I have anything against gratuitous nudity, mind you), but always interestingly blocked, with some grander artistic purpose. These scenes range from creating juxtapositions between prurient voyeurism and horror, to surrender to and (sometimes perverse) domination of animality, to interior psychological conflicts--just look at the ingenious placement of a window frames during a full frontal nudity shot in Oliver's swamp cabin.The music--both the score and the incidental songs, are just as good. Most of it is an eerie, synthesized score by Giorgio Moroder. It often approaches the tasty moodiness of Brian Eno's excellent work with David Bowie (Low, Heroes, Lodger), which is perhaps ironic in light of the fact that Bowie contributed a great song for the closing credits. The limited incidental music--such as Jimmy Hughes' Why Not Tonight? during the cab ride to the zoo--fits the mood of the film perfectly.Of course, the film isn't all just visuals and music. There's an intriguing, surreal story here, and great performances from a seemingly odd combination of actors--ranging from Kinski and McDowell to Ed Begley, Jr. and John Laroquette. Setting the film in New Orleans was an inspired choice, as it allowed for eerie voodoo-weirdness ala Angel Heart (1987) and moody swamp vistas ala Down By Law (1986) to seep into the already creepy story. Setting the more dreamlike imagery in a desert (albeit a studio-created desert) also helped draw me into the film, as there is probably no environment I find more aesthetically captivating.I first saw Cat People as a teen during its theatrical run. I didn't like it near as much then, and that fact caused me to put off re-watching it for a number of years. I think at that time, the film may have been too slow for me, I may not have understood it very well, and I certainly didn't have the visual and overall aesthetic appreciation that I currently have. Now, I think it's a masterpiece--perhaps one of the better films of the 1980s. It's worth checking out at least once, and if you've seen it awhile ago and think you didn't like it so well, it's worth giving a second chance.

While there, she gradually discovers the truth about their bizarre past and falls for a zoo curator.First, a caveat. Director Paul Schrader, in his interview on the Cat People DVD, says that he regrets that he didn't just change the name of the film to remove some of the perception that this is a remake of Jacques Tourneur's Cat People from 1942. It is wrong to look at this as a remake. Aside from mostly superficial similarities, Schrader's Cat People really has little to do with the original--no more in common than, say, The Grudge (2004) and The Ring (2002), assuming that Kayako from The Grudge would have been named Samara instead, or no more similar than any two random vampire films. Irena's first name is the same, there are similarities in her background story and what she is, she visits a zoo, she falls in love with a man with the same first name of Oliver, and there are maybe two and a half scenes similar to Tourneur's film. That's it. Yes, I'm a fan of Tourneur's film, too--it's my favorite out of his collaborations with producer Val Lewton. But you have to forget about Tourneur's film when watching this one. This is a remarkable work of cinematic art in its own right, with its own story and goals.Schrader's Cat People deserves a 10 on visual terms alone. The cinematography, production design and lighting are nothing short of genius throughout the film. Almost every shot is one that deserves to be paused and studied. Director of photography John Bailey never ceases to find interesting perspectives, angles and tracking. The sets are elaborate and exquisitely constructed for visual impact. In conjunction with the lighting, the film is mired in a rich, varied palette of colors similar to (and as good as) Dario Argento's best work.Of course the film is more graphic than Tourneur's--it would be almost impossible for it not to be, both in terms of blood\/gore and nudity, and all of that is shot brilliantly as well. The only cinematic instance of blood that I can think of that is as effective as the scene in this film where blood runs by Irena's shoes and down a drain is the shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960).

It takes some time to really get into his mojo, but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films of his), there was no clear story in this film. I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others, but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out. Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him, but you could tell that this was not Lee's favorite film. Not only did Lee direct this film, but he also wrote it. You could tell. The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film. This film was coming full circle and it wasn't going to be pretty. Lee was not 100% behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing. Of all the films I have seen Lee direct, this was the brightest and more modest of his films. It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own. I don't know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it, or what &#133; but this film did not demonstrate his true talent.For anyone out there that has seen this film, and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film, I suggest you give him a second chance. Don't get me wrong, I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you, but Lee does grow up. His work becomes more of his own, and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films. It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour, but when I did, it was sheer brilliance. Perhaps it was the actors, perhaps the story, but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man's journey into the unknown. I guess that is what I was hoping Mo' Better Blues would turn out to be. This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up, but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel. He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation, and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema, but this was not the film to showcase his talent.Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike's sister playing one of the love interests. I don't know about you, and your family, but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister. I don't care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid, I would never do it. It is just something that I never wish to see, but apparently that is different for Spike. He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse. It was sad and it even made me blush. Also, I need somebody to answer me this. What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film? So, I am sitting there on my couch, ready to start the film, when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film, then he acknowledges himself. That did not build for a strong remaining of the story. Again, I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent. Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions.There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end. Don't get me wrong, this was a very bad movie, but there is always a diamond in every alleyway. The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing. He continually went back and forth, weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera. It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes. The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life.

The lighting, the camera angles, the new visual techniques and trick photography used for the first time in an American movie to great effect. Special mention has to go to the acting of a 25 year old Orson Welles, an aspect the least highlighted.The grand-daddy of the American Soap Opera, it tells the life of Charles Foster Kane, from his humble beginnings, his mother's giving him up to a wealthy guardian, and his building of a newspaper\/radio empire. It sees Kane go from an idealistic journalist to a powerful mogul able to manipulate history through his media empire. Despite all his money and power, Kane is not immune to the hand of destiny, and oh how she slaps Kane the old American way. A married Kane is caught through pure innocence with a singer and a scandal erupts, costing Kane the state governorship; you can guess the instigator of the scandal-mongering the incumbent governor.In the first part of the movie, we see a Kane adored by the public and employees but we don't see the reason why his relationship with his wife deteriorated, shown in a powerful film sequence of spouses drifting apart through the years. In the second part we see his relationship with the singer whom he took as his second wife, and how he uses her to try and manipulate public opinion of himself, just as he had used the media empire previously. The only problem is that his second wife isn't as competent as the media empire was in gaining respect or adoration; she is just terrible as an opera singer. But Kane wants to prove to the public that the singer who he was caught with, was more than whore and that he had the power to shape public opinion; she even told kane that she didn't want to be a singer. It is the cruelest thing any man could have done to another human being; manipulated for his own ends. William Randolph Hearst was said to have been less angry about his own portrayal than that of his mistress, Marion Davies.The movie broke new grounds for cinema also, in its story-telling we see first the death of a recluse Kane in his old age, and then there are flashbacks from newsreels and investigations and interviews of reporters piecing together the life of Charles Foster Kane and his dying word rosebud.The reporters never found out what his dying word meant, but the audience is shown what it is.

This movie bred a bunch of copycats like The Carpetbaggers and Valley of the Dolls, and inspired the great TV soapies like Dallas and Dynasty. Many other movies from different genres have copied and perhpas bettered the camera work and lighting and yet this movie has stood up well through the 60 years from its sheer brilliance and originality.Despite its greatness, Citizen Kane seems to have taken some victims along the way. At age 25, Orson Welles starred, wrote and directed his masterpiece, but because of various reasons, political, envy, hatred, he was never able to match it.

'Watership Down' is an exemplary case of not just what makes a great animated film, but also great epic storytelling in general. It has everything I look for in such a movie - well-developed, convincing characters (that they happen to be talking rabbits does nothing to diminish this), an engrossing story and a powerful milieu carried by the background score and imagery. The music in this movie is completely entrancing, something which always stands out about it - a nice mixture of emotive melodies that accompany their pertaining moments in the story just perfectly, along with 'Bright Eyes', a beautiful little song that I have never since forgotten (and I dare you not to get dewy-eyed during the sequence where it plays).As an adaptation of a classic piece of reading, it doesn't fare too badly - the original story naturally had to be abridged considerably to suit the running time, and there are a handful of details that feel rather glossed over, but nonetheless, it gets enough right in all the important places to both do justice to the book and succeed as a brilliant movie on merits of its own. Within the time it has, it manages to convey a great deal of character and depth, and defines each individual rabbit's personality very ably - the self-assured Bigwig's growing sense of respect for both Hazel and Fiver is especially well-woven into the story, and gives their interaction a lot of essence.The animation quality can be a little uneven at times (breathtaking one moment, slightly sketchy the next), but overall reflects a rougher, more realistic style that keeps it from ever becoming too cute or cuddly (a la Disney). I've always loved the character design they gave to Fiver in particular - large, sad eyes and a skinny little body which give him an almost alien-like quality, helping to distinguish him as the unique and atypical individual he is amongst the other rabbits. Some viewers have commented that the majority of Efrafan rabbits look so similar that it gets rather hard to tell them apart, which is true, but I personally feel that this is very effective in highlighting the lack of independence and individuality that most of them had amongst their ranks, contrasting with Hazel's group where everyone is respected and free.Above all, I applaud it for refusing to succumb to the Disney formula, which had been far too influential on most other animated features for decades beforehand and would continue to be so for some years to come. It's one of the things that made 'Watership Down' such an outstanding piece of animation and why it still feels like such a one-of-a-kind film to this day - it wasn't afraid just to do its own thing, and people had seen very few like it before at the time; a serious and very mature kind of cartoon that remains truthful to the dark and turbulent spirit of the book. This is no fluffy, light-hearted tale about a bunch of innocent little bunnies - as the opening 'creation story' sequence deftly explains, the world these rabbits live in is overflowing with peril, and one where every day presents a hard, violent struggle to survive. Expect a fair share of blood, fighting, and even a couple of rather brutal death scenes. Kehaar, the extroverted seagull that the rabbits befriend on their journey, does provide a light touch of comic relief every so often, but not excessively, and no more so than in the original novel. There are times when this movie can become very bleak indeed, and as a very little kid I remember having a tough time trying to swallow a lot of the imagery - some of the sequences, including Fiver's vision of the field being 'covered with blood' and most of the traumatised Holly's flashbacks, are downright disturbing, and one key reason why this movie would probably be better appreciated by older kids and adults.But it's more than just a depression-fest, and the trials these rabbits must endure only bring you to appreciate their well-earned triumphs all the more. In the end, the sombre darkness is effectively countered by the movie's relative themes of unity, spirituality and survival, and it's hard not to leave this film feeling somewhat uplifted by the experience. After all, there is something incredibly inspirational, even from a human perspective, about those immortal linesAll the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you.

But DEEP IMPACT is enriched tenfold by this deliberate shift of emphasis, even though the film adheres to a routine formula established years earlier in such disaster pics as EARTHQUAKE and THE TOWERING INFERNO (both 1974). Here, the contrived melodrama of those older movies is replaced by a sincere contemplation of unimaginable catastrophe and the subsequent effect on mankind, highlighted by Morgan Freeman's authoritative presence as the beleaguered US president, who commissions a group of astronauts (led by Robert Duvall) to land a spacecraft on the comet and attach a series of nuclear devices to the surface.Proceedings are hindered slightly by Téa Leoni's blank-faced performance as the TV journalist who stumbles onto the impending cataclysm whilst researching an apparently unrelated story about a 'philandering' senator (James Cromwell). Thankfully, the film is redeemed by its tremendous supporting cast, including Vanessa Redgrave as Leoni's proud mother, struggling to cope following her divorce from estranged husband Maximilian Schell, and a pre-hobbit Elijah Wood, playing the juvenile lead. It's to the filmmakers' credit that all these characters (and more besides) play vital roles within the overall structure, adding depth and resonance to an otherwise crowd-pleasing commercial enterprise.The climactic scenes of destruction - involving a huge tidal wave striking New York - are brief but potent, precisely because of the human dimension stressed by Leder's intuitive direction.

Here, the contrived melodrama of those older movies is replaced by a sincere contemplation of unimaginable catastrophe and the subsequent effect on mankind, highlighted by Morgan Freeman's authoritative presence as the beleaguered US president, who commissions a group of astronauts (led by Robert Duvall) to land a spacecraft on the comet and attach a series of nuclear devices to the surface.Proceedings are hindered slightly by Téa Leoni's blank-faced performance as the TV journalist who stumbles onto the impending cataclysm whilst researching an apparently unrelated story about a 'philandering' senator (James Cromwell). Thankfully, the film is redeemed by its tremendous supporting cast, including Vanessa Redgrave as Leoni's proud mother, struggling to cope following her divorce from estranged husband Maximilian Schell, and a pre-hobbit Elijah Wood, playing the juvenile lead. It's to the filmmakers' credit that all these characters (and more besides) play vital roles within the overall structure, adding depth and resonance to an otherwise crowd-pleasing commercial enterprise.The climactic scenes of destruction - involving a huge tidal wave striking New York - are brief but potent, precisely because of the human dimension stressed by Leder's intuitive direction. True, the outcome is fairly predictable, and there's a slight lurch into artificial sentimentality towards the end of the movie, but these are minor drawbacks in an otherwise worthy production. Fine music score by James Horner.

This is one of the very best gangster films I've ever seen. Almost all of that brilliance derives from Al Pacino's performance...on every level Tony Montana should be a truly contemptible piece of work a treacherous, foul-mouthed, coke-addicted murdering gangster. But you empathise with him, if not sympathise. You understand his mentality, you can see the twisted logic to his actions. He plays the big guys at their own game and does it smarter, more efficiently, and even more honestly than they do. He wastes anyone who stands between him and what he wants he falls for his boss's girlfriend, so he ends up betraying his boss, shooting him and marrying his girlfriend. Nice behaviour! And yet the viewer comes away feeling the weaselly, irritating boss deserved everything he got.Ultimately Tony's downfall becomes imminent because he has nothing left to prove, nothing left to offer, and so an entropy of paranoia, laziness and arrogance sets in. However the denouement is actually triggered by a momentary fit of anger, when he discovers his sister at the apartment of his sidekick Manny and he instantly shoots him. Like Casino, all the power and money in the world cannot smooth over complex interpersonal relationships between gangsters, their girlfriends and their friends and family. Scarface combines the brutal, semi-dehumanised power of the Miami gangs with the more down-to-earth issues of having your mother disapprove of you, idolising your younger sister (to a point of suffocation where you refuse to accept that she has grown up and has her own life) and ultimately, the absolute futility of cocaine use.As for the cheesy music, I'm a big fan of Giorgio Moroder and although I can see how the brash synthpop is not to everyone's tastes, it does work perfectly in the context of providing a loud, tasteless, gaudy sheen of 80s glamour to the lifestyle depicted in the movie. That is exactly the kind of music non-artistic, money-orientated people would have danced to in image-conscious, coke-sniffing 80s discos. In fact, that's still the kind of music those sort of people would listen to today, although with more updated synth sounds! What's noticeable as well is how as the movie progresses the music becomes steadily slower, less bubbly and more morose sounding. By the end, the synths themselves seem to be having trouble breathing, with long, ponderous minor chords replacing the sub-Madonna bounce of the early scenes. Pompous classical music would have glamorised the movie, lending it a somewhat bogus air of sophistication and culture. Shallow 80s synthpop is much more in keeping with shallow 80s gangsters! It's definitely a movie that turns you off cocaine (not that I was ever turned onto it). It should turn you off violence as well, because it clearly demonstrates that in the end there are no winners.

Without the violence it would have just been cheesy. Without the cheesiness it would have just been violent. But juxtapose the two elements and suddenly each becomes more stark, more unnerving, more psychological. Like horror films that feature children singing nursery rhymes. There are loads of scenes that have this strange juxtaposition such as after the chainsaw incident when Montana shoots the coke dealer in the street, in front of dozens of people, and then jumps into a car with blaring pop music as if shooting people is the most casual, everyday thing in the world. Or in the Babylon club where a ropey old cabaret act is suddenly interrupted by gunfire and an attempt to take Montana's life.There's one person who in particular seemed to really take on board this combination of violence and cheesiness...Mr Quention Tarantino.

Also continued from Halloween is the masterful use of the 2.351 frame, and some cast members who would, or have had, figured prominently in Carpenter features. Tubby Tom Atkins would feature very prominently in Escape From New York and future Halloween sequels, giving Carpenter a sort of mini-Kevin Bacon status. Of course, it is typical of a good director to want to work with the same staff repeatedly. However, the qualities that make Carpenter want to work with Atkins more than once remain a mystery, even after multiple viewings of Escape From New York.What The Fog lacks, in essence, is depth. One can look at the running time and see that the film is too short to give any of its characters anything resembling a second dimension. One winds up remembering characters by their profession rather than any unique characteristics of their personality. Another problem is that the rules regarding what the titular fog can or cannot do seem to flex with the wants of their situation. When they want to stop the town's residents from communicating, they simply cut power wires. No explanation of how they are able to do this is forthcoming.Where the film's strength lies is in the practical realisation of its storytelling elements. In some long shots, the titular fog looks as if it has been crudely painted onto the negative. In closer shots, such as on one landing, the use of a few smoke machines quite obviously had great effect. It would have been perfect if they had not shown cars suddenly failing to start in the middle of this fog. Honestly, cars will only be as unreliable as depicted in film if Microsoft get their way and start putting their software into cars. Had this element only been used once, it probably would have hurt credibility a lot less.Again, Carpenter proves there is a reason why he exclusively uses the Panavision anamorphic process. Every frame is used to full effect, with either a nice populace spread throughout, or moving from one end to the other. DVD-Video was made for films like The Fog. Carpenter also proves his musical prowess once more with a very driving, punchy score that adds dramatic tension to shots that would otherwise be meaningless transition. Indeed, that Carpenter's scores are not widely available on compact disc is yet more evidence of the RIAA's short-sightedness.In the end, the simplistic ghost story, which seems to have been yanked from the pages of Ripley's Believe It Or Not, sustains the 89-minute film to the extent of leaving the viewer wanting more. In this day where films seem to make a habit of overstaying their welcome, even if they run for less than this rather small length, going back to a time when films didn't outlast their welcome is always refreshing. If nothing else, The Fog shows that either the supernatural can be greedy, too, or that a Dwarf can have a ghost. Whatever conclusion you reach, the weakness of the characters is more than made up by the back-story. It isn't frightening, it isn't exciting, and it certainly doesn't have any interesting people in it. In spite of all those things, it builds a good atmosphere, and is worth watching once. The ending seems a little redundant to me, but what the hell.I gave The Fog a seven out of ten. It does have more than its fair share of flaws, but it is also entertaining as one of those typical ghost stories.

Sometimes there comes across a movie that's overwhelming in a completely different manner, achieved through a cast that's devoted in the best possible way, a much more down to earth moving storyline and a meaningful soundtrack that never gets in the way with the actors.What's Eating Gilbert Grape really belongs to the latter kind of film. Since the rising popularity of (the then virtually unknown) Leonardo DiCaprio, much more people took a look at this production, which has got so much to offer it's a shame it hasn't received the kind of attention before. It really is pointless to go into the story of this film because there's so much to mention, so many moments pass along with great intensity and truthfulness that I can only recommend every viewer of this page to go and see this movie about a not so average American country family trying to make the best of the world they got dealt with.

The acting and direction was amazing and through this, Shalespears best work (only my opinion of course) was truly brought to life.I thought Emma Thompson and Keneth Branagh stole the show as Beatrice and Benedick, who have always been my favourite characters. The other main reason for my great loving of this play\/movie is that there is a strong female character, who is more than a match for a strong male character.

I know that Call could have been played by many others, but I think Winona's performance in the film is truly magical, cause she created a person who is both whimsical and innocent at the same time. Thanks to her acting we have another main character. It helps Weaver, who does't have to act like she was the only really interesting character in the film (I think the same thing was made by Ian Holm and John Hurt in Alien). Ryder was to be a robot and she really looked that way - notice that there is no sweat and such things (ok I know it depends on makeup, but anyway - she did her part really good).
