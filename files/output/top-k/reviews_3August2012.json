I felt that they should have shown more time filming Jamie and Landon working together before he tells her he loves her. It kind of went from one bit where he was rude and mean to her, from another bit telling her he loves her.And the scene where Jamie is photo shopped onto a photo which is stuck all through the school. That scene could have been so much more improved and dramatic all I felt was that he saw her upset, then punched a guy and then it was it.But apart from that Mandy Moore was brilliant, she did such a great job in portraying a purist girl without being to cheesy. I felt she did much more of the loving towards Landon, and he was just letting it come to him.Overall it was a good movie, and although there are a few things that could have been improved, it still managed to make me cry and become attached to the storyline. Its a film about first loves, miracles and opening yourself up to things you never imagined.

I really couldn't recall what the movie was about except for a couple of scenes, but in all honesty I don't think this film has aged very well. Arnold may have been an action hero during the 80's and 90's, but he really isn't a very good actor. I preferred him in more comedic roles actually, although I must admit he was great in the Terminator films. Total Recall fails because it tries to take itself too seriously and goes a little over the top with the violent scenes. I'm not against violent films, but in Total Recall it just feels a little over the top and exaggerated as is the case with most of Paul Verhoeven's films (famous for Robocop, another film that is getting remade, but that I actually enjoyed more). There are some clever one liners that will get a smile out of you because it's what Arnold is best at, but most of the dialogues feel forced. It just didn't work for me. The concept of the movie is interesting and the ambiguity of the film is what many people liked, but I didn't enjoy it all that much really. I think this is one of the worst Phillip Dick novels adapted for the big screen considering I liked Blade Runner, Minority Report, and The Adjustment Bureau a lot. This film plays out a little more cartoonish than the others, but unintentionally and that's why I didn't like it. It tried to be serious and ambiguous, but it ended up being cartoonish. Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker who feels like his life is too ordinary and something is missing. He has a beautiful wife, Lori (Sharon Stone), but is obsessed with Mars and has this recurring dream where he is in Mars with a brunette who he has never met. There is a human civilization in Mars and Douglas dreams of taking a vacation there but doesn't have the time or money to do so. Instead he decides to visit Rekall Inc., a company that specializes in implanting memories, and asks for a memory where he goes to Mars on a mission as a secret agent. Something goes wrong during the process and the doctor realizes that his brain has already been implanted and he's been living on a fake memory. Douglas realizes that he actually isn't who he thinks he is and begins discovering things about his past. Lori isn't actually his wife; the memory was implanted in his head and she has only been posing as his wife during the last several weeks. Everything is a hoax, even his job as a construction worker. Douglas finds himself running from several men who are trying to kill him and discovers a clue about his past. He's actually a secret agent from Mars and somewhere in his head he has an important secret that the administrator from Mars named Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) is trying to keep locked up and hidden. Douglas travels to Mars to try to discover more information about his past while trying to decipher what is real and what is a memory implant. I really didn't like any of the performances in this film. Sharon Stone is beautiful here, but she just doesn't give a very memorable performance. Arnold Schwarzenegger has some funny moments but he just can't play the serious parts very well. Ronny Cox and Michael Ironside play one dimensional villains and the actor who plays the taxi driver, Benny, is just terrible and obnoxious. The story didn't work for me either so there were very few things I liked about Total Recall. They had some original and interesting ideas, but they just weren't able to work them out in a cohesive manner. The science fiction and futuristic part of the film actually is what I enjoyed the most about it, but some of the effects were a little too far out. The scenes where some of the characters are being inflected by the atmosphere in Mars are way too cartoonish for my taste.

Is it a movie that failed at the box office yet found an audience on home video such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Office Space? Is it a film that's so bad it's good such as Troll 2 or The Room? Or is a cult film just a movie with a rabid fan base that will throw out dialogue after dialogue and adorn rooms with odd memorabilia?Really a cult film can be all these things; the phenomenon of cult cinema has been around since the 50's with the infamously bad films of Ed Wood and it doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. The purpose of these reviews is to bring the weird, wonderful and downright insanity of cult cinema to you. The reviews will be broken up into the main review itself as well as quotable lines and oddest moments. Many will choose The Rocky Horror Picture Show as the ultimate piece of cult cinema, but really it's become so mainstream it defies cult films. The real king of cult cinema is the 1984 film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension.Film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension Director W.D Richter Cast Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is possibly the most nonsensical film ever to be put on celluloid. The majority of it doesn't make a lick of sense, the plot flies by without letting the audience really understand it, and we're just thrown into this world full of myth and science fiction and we just have to accept it. This is the beauty of the film, it just forces you to accept everything and enjoy it. Banzai is a melting pot of genres, a weird high-bred of action adventure, science fiction, comedy, satire, and romance and none of it makes sense yet it's a brilliantly original and enjoyable film.The plot follows the adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (Robocop himself, Peter Weller) a physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, and rock star who, along with his rock band\/assistants, The Hong Kong Cavaliers must stop a group of inter dimensional aliens, lead by John Lithgow's alien leader, Lord John Whorfin trapped inside the body of an Italian scientist, in order to save the world. The film just drops you into all of this, creating an incredible myth surrounding Buckaroo and his band and intrigue among the audience about what exactly is going on.The beauty of the film (much like many cult classic) is that its flaws are also its greatest strength. The dialogue can be incredibly heavy on the techno babble at times attempting to explain the science of the film, and it can confuse the audience, but within two seconds there's some great joke or dead pan delivery made and we're sucked right back in. The cinematography isn't really all that spectacular, its flat and very colourful and really isn't great, but in Buckaroo Banzai it works because it makes the whole film look like a comic book come to life. That's the best way to describe Buckaroo Banzai; it's an old 80's comic book that somehow jumped onto the silver screen.The performances are all very solid in that great cult cinema way. Peter Weller is believably charismatic as Banzai, who delivers his lines with a deadpan that would make Bill Murray jealous. Banzai's Hong Kong Cavaliers include great eccentric performances by such actors as Jeff Goldblum playing a New Jersey cowboy, and Clancy Brown as Banzai's own personal narrator, Rawhide. The crown jewel of the film in terms of performances however, goes to John Lithgow playing the villainous role of Lord John Whorfin in the most over the top, insane way possible throwing out lines with an Italian accent that makes Super-Mario seem legitimate. It's a performance that will be forever remembered as one of the most brilliantly funny portrayals in cult cinema history.If the film has any legitimate flaws it's that we don't get to see enough of Banzai working with his team as they all seem like brilliant characters that just don't get enough screen time. The love story between Banzai and Penny Pretty (Ellen Barkin) isn't given all that much time to develop and could have been more interesting, especially with her being the long lost twin sister of Banzai's murdered wife.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension really is the ultimate cult classic, it bombed at the box office, at times it's so bad it's good and it has a rabid fan base that are still clamouring for a sequel. It's a must see film if you're a fan of cult cinema a truly brilliant piece of pop cinema that is so insane it works. Buckaroo Banzai is by far the weirdest film around and it's brilliant.

The dialogue can be incredibly heavy on the techno babble at times attempting to explain the science of the film, and it can confuse the audience, but within two seconds there's some great joke or dead pan delivery made and we're sucked right back in. The cinematography isn't really all that spectacular, its flat and very colourful and really isn't great, but in Buckaroo Banzai it works because it makes the whole film look like a comic book come to life. That's the best way to describe Buckaroo Banzai; it's an old 80's comic book that somehow jumped onto the silver screen.The performances are all very solid in that great cult cinema way. Peter Weller is believably charismatic as Banzai, who delivers his lines with a deadpan that would make Bill Murray jealous. Banzai's Hong Kong Cavaliers include great eccentric performances by such actors as Jeff Goldblum playing a New Jersey cowboy, and Clancy Brown as Banzai's own personal narrator, Rawhide. The crown jewel of the film in terms of performances however, goes to John Lithgow playing the villainous role of Lord John Whorfin in the most over the top, insane way possible throwing out lines with an Italian accent that makes Super-Mario seem legitimate. It's a performance that will be forever remembered as one of the most brilliantly funny portrayals in cult cinema history.If the film has any legitimate flaws it's that we don't get to see enough of Banzai working with his team as they all seem like brilliant characters that just don't get enough screen time. The love story between Banzai and Penny Pretty (Ellen Barkin) isn't given all that much time to develop and could have been more interesting, especially with her being the long lost twin sister of Banzai's murdered wife.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension really is the ultimate cult classic, it bombed at the box office, at times it's so bad it's good and it has a rabid fan base that are still clamouring for a sequel. It's a must see film if you're a fan of cult cinema a truly brilliant piece of pop cinema that is so insane it works. Buckaroo Banzai is by far the weirdest film around and it's brilliant.

Is it a movie that failed at the box office yet found an audience on home video such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Office Space? Is it a film that's so bad it's good such as Troll 2 or The Room? Or is a cult film just a movie with a rabid fan base that will throw out dialogue after dialogue and adorn rooms with odd memorabilia?Really a cult film can be all these things; the phenomenon of cult cinema has been around since the 50's with the infamously bad films of Ed Wood and it doesn't seem to be stopping any time soon. The purpose of these reviews is to bring the weird, wonderful and downright insanity of cult cinema to you. The reviews will be broken up into the main review itself as well as quotable lines and oddest moments. Many will choose The Rocky Horror Picture Show as the ultimate piece of cult cinema, but really it's become so mainstream it defies cult films. The real king of cult cinema is the 1984 film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension.Film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension Director W.D Richter Cast Peter Weller, John Lithgow, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension is possibly the most nonsensical film ever to be put on celluloid. The majority of it doesn't make a lick of sense, the plot flies by without letting the audience really understand it, and we're just thrown into this world full of myth and science fiction and we just have to accept it. This is the beauty of the film, it just forces you to accept everything and enjoy it.

Disney did an admirable job with their animated adaption, and Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson have written a marvelous book series about Peter Pan. Hook, unfortunately, isn't nearly as good as it should be. It's silly premise, lack of comedy, and long length this a considerably lesser Pan-tale. Peter Banning has long since forgotten his childhood as Peter Pan, and is now a middle-aged lawyer who puts work before family (and is severely afraid of heights to boot). But when his kids, Jack and Maggie, are kidnapped by Captain James Hook, Peter is forced to remember his life at Neverland, and learn to best Hook and save his children. One of Hook's many problems is that it's a children's movie. Much of Hook will only appeal to the younger crowd, and the extensive running time (nearly two and a half hours) and it's slow, crawling pace will leave most children bored out of their minds. The action is extremely minimal until the end, in which a battle against the pirates and the Lost Boys ensues, which mostly consists of dull slapstick. The humor is also extremely childish. It seems most everything in Hook is geared toward the youngest of children. Yet, as I just mentioned, it has an ominously long run time, which diminishes the film's audience to, well, no one. It's such a shame too, because Hook might've been a decent film. There was a lot in Hook that I loved, and had Hook played it's cards right, this could've been the Peter Pan film I've been waiting for. Alas, the few elements of Hook that I enjoyed are vastly overshadowed by it's many flaws. The premise is awkward, and even a bit confusing. The awkwardness is mostly due to the fact that Peter Pan is a middle-aged lawyer. Talk about shattering your childhood dreams. No one wants to see Peter Pan as an adult. His naive perspective of life and staying young is part of what made Pan so appealing in the first place. With Pan being all grown up, much of what made him such a lovable character is gone. One rather tasteless scene that's worth pointing out occurs during Pan's dinner with the Lost Boys in which a rather grotesque and childish series of name calling occurs. In addition to names like Mucus Muncher and Zit Popper, there are many others not worth repeating. As sorry as I feel for those who watched this scene (including myself), I am much more sorry for the actors that had to memorize these obscene names, as well as the writers who had to come up with them. The score by the consistently incredible John Williams is perhaps a bit under-par. It's not bad, but it's not quite as good as William's other scores. The score isn't playful enough, nor is it grand enough. Compared to William's other film scores, it's a bit of a disappointment, but it's still mostly solid. The acting is something of a mixed bag. No one does a poor job at acting, but there are problems, regardless. Robin Williams plays Peter Pan. This is a problem as Peter Pan is no longer a boy, he is now a man. This is a completely different version of Pan, so the actor needs to leave a completely new imprint. Unfortunately, Robin Williams is too big a star for this part, so instead of remembering Peter Pan as a confused and loving father, we remember him as Robin Williams. Dustin Hoffman, on the other hand, blends excellently as Hook. When we see Hook, we don't see Hoffman. I'm sure the wig and makeup helped, but Hoffman is considerably less recognizable then Robin Williams, which makes his role much better. Hook, as a character, is already one of the better parts of the film, with his subtle elements of satire and humor, and this is aided even further by Hoffman's performance. Julia Roberts, on the other hand is severely miscast as Tinker Bell. Most other actors do decent, yet not outstanding jobs, though Bob Hoskins performs amusingly as Hook's assistant, Smee.

It is not a comfortable movie and not for everyone, but those who appreciate true cinema, incredible script and story telling, perfect direction and impeccable acting there can be no greater. Ralph Fiennes as the wickedly evil Amon Goeth is spell binding, a part which must have been difficult to play is played to perfection, in which for me is Fiennes finest performance. He plays the part so perfectly you would believe you where watching an actual piece of footage of the events. And indeed this was Spielberg's idea behind the black and white theme, to allow the audience to experience the film as if it was historical evidence. A film which asks questions about the depths of the human ability to carry disgraceful acts of violence and horror, and the mindset of the ones who can no longer standby and say they did nothing to stop it. All the acting is perfect in this movie, Neeson excels and plays Schindler with a grace and coolness that few other could execute. To sum it up every time i watch this movie it gets better, but to call this a movie would do it an injustice, this is a Picture, a nod to the old days when detail was everything, but with the pace and the brilliance for it to last forever.

Yet it is an aspect of Tom's life that Amy soon finds herself in after discovering Geese eggs, once they hatch Amy is lead down a memorable path of courage and bonding. As Amy begins to raise the Geese as her own Fly Away Home becomes an incredibility touching story where it is hard not to want Amy achieve the goal of getting the Geese to migrate south. Fly Away Home succeeds on an emotional scale in placing the viewer into the predicament Amy faces and the love she feels for the Geese. The cinematography is an additional factor to the heart - tugging vibe, watching the Geese eggs hatch and crawl out of their shells with crystal clear precision as if we are witnessing the birth in person is extraordinary to see and sentimental to feel as they are just as vulnerable as Amy. This sense of vulnerability makes the aerial shots of Amy and Tom leading the Geese to their rightful place in nature later on all the more powerful.

Well look no further that The Dark Crystal. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Julianna No one shares her review of the film below Video Review here http\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RVjf8ZrGepEThis is a Jim Henson film that stars Jim Henson as Jen, Kathryn Mullen as Kira and David Goelz as Fizzgig. This movie is about an elf-like gelfling who is sent by his dying master to find a shard from a broken lamp that will help restore the balance in his universe. This gelfling's name is Jen, and Jen has some troubles along the way. First off, he has the shard but doesn't know what to do with it. Also the skeksis are trying to kill him so that the prophecy can't be fulfilled and the skeksis can live forever. However, Jen gets some help from Kira, the only other gelfling alive, and the animals from the forest, where the witch Kira lives. I think that the puppets they use are very well designed and detailed so much so that they have anthropomorphic qualities. The cinematography is considered to be cutting edge for this movie, but could have been better, as some scenes in the movie you can see the wires on the puppets. My favorite characters are Kira and Fizzgig, Kira's pet. I like Kira because she is brave and determined to protect Jen. I like Fizzgig because he is loyal to Kira and protective of her. Also even when Fizzgig does not want to do something he still does it when Kira asks him to. My favorite scene is when Kira and Jen touch hands and share their memory with one another. I like these scenes because it is kind of the podlings to share their village with a stranger and because I dislike the scenes that are rude and\/or cruel. The puppeteering is phenomenal as expected from Jim Henson. I hope you guys out there enjoy this movie. I think that this film is for ages 8 to 14, because these aren't your normal Jim Henson puppets, and the dark story line may be too much for young children. Overall, I rate this film 3 out of 5 stars because while it was well done, the darker storyline just isn't for me.

She showed all the agony of a death of a loved one but not as many films do, showing a little tear behind a black veil, but the agony, the railing against fate, the resentment against the person who died for leaving you and then the guilt of that, plus the ultimate pain as you realise they have gone, never to be seen again. It's over and you can do nothing about it. The unfairness of it all . . .The way I saw it was that Stevenson went a little mad and imagined her loved one had returned. I did as well so that bit rang so very true. The staying away from work, the sudden mood swings, the secretive bits and the loss of days at a time were all there for me. I didn't see my loved one, but I talked to her at times and felt, believed in fact, she replied. That part of the film, which went through most of it, showed me how near I'd got to madness.Whilst Rickman returns in her mind there are differences, ones she can't cope with.

I've since bought the DVD but it has the cellophane still around it after a number of years.I'd suggest it is not one to watch if a loss of a loved one is still raw with you, certainly keep sharp knives in a locked drawer, as it is in many ways morbidly depressing. There is a little brightness, a fair bit of humour, some lovely words and beautiful music. But there's no running away from the fact that it can be like someone sticking a finger in a recent wound and digging deep.Seen without the recent loss of someone close you will experience a gem. Beautifully acted, with a very clever script. The pacing was superb. It is a triumph but one that came too early for me.

Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not anywhere as good as Gosling's central performance. Gosling is on screen throughout most of the film, though. I rarely watch movies at home in one sitting and I sat through this entire film, almost afraid to look away, Gosling was so intimidating and fascinating. The Believer was inspired by Daniel Burros, (1937-1965) a Jewish man who became Grand Dragon of the NY Ku Klux Klan. After the New York Times revealed Burros' ancestry, he killed himself. The Believer opens with Balint menacing a wimpy Jewish student on the New York City subway. The Jewish student cringes, cowers, and attempts to scurry away. Balint menaces him before he gets into the subway car, on the subway car itself, and on the street outside the subway, where he finally pounces, beating the student into a bloody, broken mess. It's a horrible scene to watch. The soundtrack expertly wrings the scene for all the tension and terror it is worth. As brilliantly manipulative as this scene is, there's a problem with it. As much as you hate what you are seeing, you end up identifying with Balint. The Jewish student is weak and cowardly and refuses to defend himself. Balint at least has the integrity to act on his vile ideals. Even if you didn't know that Gosling is playing a self-hating Jewish character, you would be able to read that from his facial expressions. He sneers as if smelling something foul. He begs the student to defend himself. You know that he is beating the student because he hates the despised potential Jewish victim inside himself. That theme &#x96; the theme of Jewish self-hatred as a reaction to the Holocaust &#x96; is one of the movie's big ideas, and it is not a worthy one. After committing one of many hate crimes, Balint is forced to undergo sensitivity training. He is lectured by three elderly Jewish Holocaust survivors. One describes the Nazis bayonetting his son, peeling the corpse of the son off the bayonet, and dropping the corpse on the ground at the man's feet. Balint turns the table and lectures these survivors. Why didn't you fight? He asks. At least then you would have had your dignity. You were going to die anyway. The film allows that question to go unanswered, and that is not right. Jews *did* fight. Jews fought in the Polish Army when the Nazis first invaded Poland, and in the Anders Army at famous battlegrounds like Monte Cassino. Jews fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the first urban, civilian uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe. Jews fought in the forests with the Bielski Brothers. Jews fought in the Treblinka concentration camp uprising. Jews fought in non-martial ways, as well. There were poetry readings in the Warsaw Ghetto, and Sabbath commemorations in concentration camps. To remember your own culture in the face of death is also a revolt against death. It isn't the responsibility of The Believer to provide viewers with this detailed history lesson, but it lessens the value of the film to allow Daniel Balint, a Jewish neo-Nazi, to go unrefuted. Other than Gosling's performance, there isn't much to recommend the film. There are shadowy scenes of fascist plotters meeting in New York City apartments, strategizing ways to take over America. Billy Zane is pretty much wasted in his few scenes as a fascist theorist. Summer Phoenix, River's little sister, has a gratuitous, exploitative, topless scene. She plays the part of a depressive, masochistic fascist sex toy. Through Balint, she becomes obsessed with Judaism, and begins to practice, lighting Sabbath candles and attending synagogue services. This is the movie's second big idea if you look at it through the right kaleidoscope, being a member of a Jewish community is in some ways comparable to being a member of a hate group like the Nazis. This is just simple-minded, undercooked, grandiose thinking, and this is why, outside of Gosling's performance, I can't recommend this film. There is some incoherent, implausible plotting fascists meet in the woods and beat each other up; there is a bungled assassination attempt; there are a couple of synagogue bombings. None of this goes anywhere. There's another problem with this film. It is very much in the cinematic tradition of Sexy Nazis like Inglorious Bastard's Colonel Hans Landa, Black Book's Ludwig Muntze, Oskar Werner, Maximilian Schell, and too many others to mention . Ryan Gosling is a very attractive man and in this film he is shown shirtless, lifting weights, and masterfully beating other men. In real life, Daniel Burros was not so omnipotent, not so sexy. In fact, journalist William Bryk said of Burros that he was an inept paratrooper overweight, poorly coordinated and slow. He wore thick-lensed glasses that made his eyes look larger than they were. The other guys in the barracks laughed at him. He had no friends. Finally, he made three phony suicide attempts a few shallow razor cuts on the wrist; an overdose of aspirin; and again the razor &#x85; The Army discharged him 'by reasons of unsuitability, character, and behavior disorder.'In short, Burros was mentally ill, as is Daniel Balint in this film. Given that the film is about a man who is not processing reality accurately, it is unfortunate that the film provides no coherent counter voice to the flawed conclusions Balint lives by.

Ryan Gosling is a very attractive man and in this film he is shown shirtless, lifting weights, and masterfully beating other men. In real life, Daniel Burros was not so omnipotent, not so sexy. In fact, journalist William Bryk said of Burros that he was an inept paratrooper overweight, poorly coordinated and slow. He wore thick-lensed glasses that made his eyes look larger than they were. The other guys in the barracks laughed at him. He had no friends. Finally, he made three phony suicide attempts a few shallow razor cuts on the wrist; an overdose of aspirin; and again the razor &#x85; The Army discharged him 'by reasons of unsuitability, character, and behavior disorder.'In short, Burros was mentally ill, as is Daniel Balint in this film. Given that the film is about a man who is not processing reality accurately, it is unfortunate that the film provides no coherent counter voice to the flawed conclusions Balint lives by. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 August 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The 2001 film The Believer is worth seeing for Ryan Gosling's riveting performance as Daniel Balint, a violent, mentally disturbed American, Jewish, neo-Nazi. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not anywhere as good as Gosling's central performance. Gosling is on screen throughout most of the film, though. I rarely watch movies at home in one sitting and I sat through this entire film, almost afraid to look away, Gosling was so intimidating and fascinating. The Believer was inspired by Daniel Burros, (1937-1965) a Jewish man who became Grand Dragon of the NY Ku Klux Klan. After the New York Times revealed Burros' ancestry, he killed himself. The Believer opens with Balint menacing a wimpy Jewish student on the New York City subway. The Jewish student cringes, cowers, and attempts to scurry away. Balint menaces him before he gets into the subway car, on the subway car itself, and on the street outside the subway, where he finally pounces, beating the student into a bloody, broken mess. It's a horrible scene to watch. The soundtrack expertly wrings the scene for all the tension and terror it is worth. As brilliantly manipulative as this scene is, there's a problem with it. As much as you hate what you are seeing, you end up identifying with Balint. The Jewish student is weak and cowardly and refuses to defend himself. Balint at least has the integrity to act on his vile ideals. Even if you didn't know that Gosling is playing a self-hating Jewish character, you would be able to read that from his facial expressions. He sneers as if smelling something foul. He begs the student to defend himself. You know that he is beating the student because he hates the despised potential Jewish victim inside himself. That theme &#x96; the theme of Jewish self-hatred as a reaction to the Holocaust &#x96; is one of the movie's big ideas, and it is not a worthy one. After committing one of many hate crimes, Balint is forced to undergo sensitivity training. He is lectured by three elderly Jewish Holocaust survivors. One describes the Nazis bayonetting his son, peeling the corpse of the son off the bayonet, and dropping the corpse on the ground at the man's feet. Balint turns the table and lectures these survivors. Why didn't you fight? He asks. At least then you would have had your dignity. You were going to die anyway. The film allows that question to go unanswered, and that is not right. Jews *did* fight. Jews fought in the Polish Army when the Nazis first invaded Poland, and in the Anders Army at famous battlegrounds like Monte Cassino. Jews fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the first urban, civilian uprising in Nazi-occupied Europe. Jews fought in the forests with the Bielski Brothers. Jews fought in the Treblinka concentration camp uprising. Jews fought in non-martial ways, as well. There were poetry readings in the Warsaw Ghetto, and Sabbath commemorations in concentration camps. To remember your own culture in the face of death is also a revolt against death. It isn't the responsibility of The Believer to provide viewers with this detailed history lesson, but it lessens the value of the film to allow Daniel Balint, a Jewish neo-Nazi, to go unrefuted. Other than Gosling's performance, there isn't much to recommend the film. There are shadowy scenes of fascist plotters meeting in New York City apartments, strategizing ways to take over America. Billy Zane is pretty much wasted in his few scenes as a fascist theorist. Summer Phoenix, River's little sister, has a gratuitous, exploitative, topless scene. She plays the part of a depressive, masochistic fascist sex toy. Through Balint, she becomes obsessed with Judaism, and begins to practice, lighting Sabbath candles and attending synagogue services. This is the movie's second big idea if you look at it through the right kaleidoscope, being a member of a Jewish community is in some ways comparable to being a member of a hate group like the Nazis. This is just simple-minded, undercooked, grandiose thinking, and this is why, outside of Gosling's performance, I can't recommend this film. There is some incoherent, implausible plotting fascists meet in the woods and beat each other up; there is a bungled assassination attempt; there are a couple of synagogue bombings.

I think the last time was when I watched and reviewed Film Socialisme, a picture that's idea is still unfathomable to me today. But while that film was a piece of indulgent French cinema, Charlie's Angels is a piece of mind-numbing American cinema, so pick your poison.I have yet to encounter a film based off a Television show from decades past that has amused me enough to earn a recommendation rating. The Dukes of Hazzard was a hackneyed and a cherry-picking reboot to a show that must've had more appeal than mindless car chases (the show was unseen by me), the film Starsky and Hutch was elevated just barely by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson's capable casting, but everything else was seemingly on autopilot, and do we even need to mention Bewitched? And don't even get me started on those CGI\/live action hybrids...Back on track with Charlie's Angels, the film I should be discussing. Its basic story concerns the three angels, Natalie Cook (Cameron Diaz), Dylan Sanders (Drew Barrymore), and Alex Munday (Lucy Liu), and their mission, which they choose to accept, involves safely returning Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), of the famous Knox Enterprises, back from Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), a satellite-communications expert who has kidnapped him for one reason or another. The angels use their sly and sexy skills, if that's what we're calling them, to infiltrate the scheme and rescue the man as fast as possible.Am I not mistaking? Isn't that how the back of the box would describe Charlie's Angels The Video Game? I would say so. The film looks and plays less like a movie, but more like a cheap, video game demo involving three girls who hunger for action that were summoned straight out of a lonely geek's head. There's even several pointless scenes (and there are many of these, but these kinds are certainly the most pointless ones) involving Natalie dancing in her underwear as soon as she gets out of bed or grooving it to that ever-so-mindless Sir Mix a Lot jam, Baby Got Back on Soul Train while numerous people chant, go white girl, go white girl! It's scenes like that that make me wonder if a film even cares if we pay attention to it or not.The same thing Hollywood would later ruin about The Dukes of Hazzard becomes Charlie's Angels most glaring problem; the insulting simplification of its story, plot, and characters. When Hollywood proposed the idea of creating a Dukes of Hazzard film, they most likely thought up the most logical thing to feature in a film with them Duke boys and that thought immediately was car chases. When the executives thought up the most logical thing to feature prominently in a Charlie's Angels film, it was the character's sexiness and fulfilling the urge to blow somethin' up real good. That's exactly what it did. It doesn't even have the humor and barely passable idiocy Michael Bay's Bad Boys had, and I can't believe I'm complementing one of his films for having something that another doesn't.If development would've been taken into consideration, if a wider range of ideas would've been explored, and if the route of featuring flyweight women in tight leather suits would've been traded for some serene wit and at least some sign of intelligence, we might have a decent, memorable Charlie's Angels film. But that's asking a lot from an industry that sucks dry everything likable about something classic and reworks and remolds it into something of total banality.Starring Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, Sam Rockwell, Tim Curry, Crispin Glover, Luke Wilson, Bill Murray, and Tom Green.

You have two of the greatest comedians in American cinema in it; Dan Aykroyd (playing Roman) and John Candy (playing Chet), and they were really a great comedian couple, complementing each other well and having great on-screen chemistry.The story in The Great Outdoors is about the Ripley family coming to a very idyllic and beautiful cabin site, where Chet's father used to take Chet when he was a child, and now Chet want his children to have their own memories of this paradise. But within only moments of getting there, Chet's brother Roman and his family show up unannounced to surprise the Ripley's and spend a week of vacation together.The movie is filled with great and memorable moments that will have you laughing hard, because Aykroyd and Candy really do some great comedy in this movie and put on great performances. Sure it is very 1980's in spirit, but still today the movie is fun and entertaining to watch. And I personally never will tire of John Candy and his greatly missed comedy act, he was truly one of a kind.If you enjoy 80's comedies and the movies of Dan Aykroyd and\/or John Candy, then I am sure you are already well familiar with The Great Outdoors, but if you aren't, then get your hands on this movie, because it is well worth a watch.

You have two of the greatest comedians in American cinema in it; Dan Aykroyd (playing Roman) and John Candy (playing Chet), and they were really a great comedian couple, complementing each other well and having great on-screen chemistry.The story in The Great Outdoors is about the Ripley family coming to a very idyllic and beautiful cabin site, where Chet's father used to take Chet when he was a child, and now Chet want his children to have their own memories of this paradise. But within only moments of getting there, Chet's brother Roman and his family show up unannounced to surprise the Ripley's and spend a week of vacation together.The movie is filled with great and memorable moments that will have you laughing hard, because Aykroyd and Candy really do some great comedy in this movie and put on great performances. Sure it is very 1980's in spirit, but still today the movie is fun and entertaining to watch. And I personally never will tire of John Candy and his greatly missed comedy act, he was truly one of a kind.If you enjoy 80's comedies and the movies of Dan Aykroyd and\/or John Candy, then I am sure you are already well familiar with The Great Outdoors, but if you aren't, then get your hands on this movie, because it is well worth a watch.

Secondly, it features my favourite actor and actress in the world the great Robin Williams & the wonderful Hannah Taylor Gordon. I have admired these two for years and to have two of your fave actors in one film is a very rare treat. The scenes with the two of them together are heartwarming.Williams plays Jakob Heynn, one of the hundreds of Jewish people living in a Polish ghetto in 1944, during World War II. After hearing radio broadcast announcing the Russians' approach, he tells of the possible end of the war, leading the ghetto inhabitants to believe he possesses a hidden radio. This leads to him having to tell false rumours, thus increasing the hope of the inhabitants of the ghetto.It certainly feels odd to hearing Williams speak in a different accent, I can tell you. His performance, all the same, is as good as ever. Hannah Taylor Gordon, who plays the little girl who hides in Jakob's apartment, is just so lovely in her role. Having watched her stunning performance as Anne Frank in Anne Frank The Whole Story previously, I have always admired Taylor Gordon, so to see her in this is, to me, a real marvel.The supporting cast also offers a great performance. It all makes this film that much inviting to watch.There is, of course, quite a bit of tragedy in this film. But, seeing as it is set during the Holocaust, that is to be expected. It's a way of showing respect to the memory of it all. If you don't like tragic scenes, let alone tragic films, then maybe this isn't for you. However, there is some humour in it, thanks to Williams.So, all in all, I'd say this film is one I'd recommend. It certainly has an original storyline and the whole thing offers a heartwarming experience.

'Jaws' the ultimate shark film has been the most frightening film since its 1975 release to audiences. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw star as Chief Martin Brody, oceanographer Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint on the hunt for a killer great white who killed and devoured a young woman and little boy. The film is suspenseful with a spooky score by John Williams to match (if you hear the music get out of the water). Many viewers are so frightened by the film that they develop the misconception that all sharks are killers and will eat them. That is true in only 100 cases where great whites do kill humans (this is actual scientific data), but this is not entirely true. There's no need to fear sharks all the time. Anyway, Steven Spielberg shows off a spectacular film that will make you fearful of going into the water.
