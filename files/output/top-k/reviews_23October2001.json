The best game-series ever, in my opinion. That´s why I expected really good things from this movie. Was I satisfied? Both yes and no, actually.The story takes places in the future (name a science fiction-movie that doesn´t), when the whole world´s been deserted, after a huge meteorite crashed in the Kaspian area and made killer-phantoms appear. Doctor Aki Ross is determined to find out the reason to why these creatures emerged, and if there is a way to stop them. She´s assisted by a colleague of hers, Doctor Sid and a platoon of modern soldiers, called Deep Eyes. Working against them is crazy General Hein, who believes that nuclear weapons is the right way to end the problems. Science fiction movies often have confusing storylines, and this is certainly not an exception. I was able to follow the plot almost through the entire movie, but in the end it became way to much unbelievable mumbo-jumbo for me to handle. Final Fantasy Spirits Within has been much discussed whether it could make real actors out of work, since this is the first entirely CGI-made movie with real humans. Yes, the characters look fantastic and very realistic (especially Aki, wow!), but no, the actors do not have to worry a bit about losing their jobs. It´s a rather stupid discussion to start with, I don´t believe any cinema-goer would prefer computer-made humans instead of real ones. Bad things about the film, besides the rather unfocused story, is the dialogue. Steve Buscemi´s character tried to joke all the time, but none of his efforts hit the spot. And his character Neil´s constant quarrel with Peri Gilpin´s character Jane, was tiresome from the very beginning. The voices were overall okay, but the only really good one belonged the heroine Aki. Very nice vocal work by Ming-Na, she made the character more interesting. Another thing I disliked was that Hironobu Sakaguchi used too few references to the games in his script. It mostly didn´t feel like Final Fantasy at all, more like Aliens or something. Some people have suggested that the ending feels like Final Fantasy, but I disagree. It feels more like Sakaguchi ran out of ideas. The music, by Elliot Goldenthal, fits the movie perfectly (his best musical score since the unbeatable score to Alien 3), although it´s not even close to the music from the games, written by genius Nobuo Uematsu. It would have been nice to hear some of his work here, perhaps Prelude during the end credits? Oh well, you can´t have everything, sadly.The movie had it´s exciting moments, with great environments. And the characters are, as mentioned above, fantastic to look at. I do belive you have to be a fan of the videogames to be able to forgive the movie´s flaws. A sequel would be very interesting.* * *  ","genre":null},{"date":"23 October 2001","score":"","review":"  First of all I´m a HUGE fan of the Final Fantasy-videogames.

Even if you are underage, sneak into the cinema and watch it carefully.I'm not going to spoil the film for you and write the entire story out, which most people tend to do whilst writing their comments out. After all, Le Fabueux Destin d'Amelie Poulain doesn't have much of a plot anyway; it's just... nice. It may be a (very funny) comedy, but it is also very thoughtful at the same time. The director (Jean-Pierre Jeunet) has made the film flawless by choosing the perfect cast, perfect soundtrack and by using his natural ability to his greatest potential as a director.Now, let's start with the two main characters in Amelie...Audrey Tautou plays the part of Amelie Poulain with ease and perfection. Tautou may not be the prettiest girl on the planet, but she definitely has the best eyes I've ever seen. She has this unique and unexplainable attraction and innocence which makes her the only person able to play the part of Amelie... it's really hard to explain. You've got to watch the film and see for yourselves.Mathieu Kassovitz plays Nino, the man who Amelie falls in love with. Kassovitz seems not to need to do too much for the part (all he has to do is to act a little spaced out), but since I'm not an actor I can't really comment. After all, I thought he had a (AGAIN!) unique presence which I can't (AGAIN!) explain.The other characters (you can look the names up yourselves) were equally as excellent as each other. They were all slightly strange in their actions(including Amelie's and Nino's) but I guess the director is trying to emphasize the fact that everyone is different and emotions are also very relevant in our behaviour...Yann Tiersen, the highly prolific and original multi-instrumentalist composer and performer who worked on the soundtracks of French movies like Alice et Martin, also did the sountrack for Amelie (apart from two very old French songs written in the 1930's). In my opinion, the soundtrack made a significant difference to the film.It's really hard to say why I am so in love with this film... it just happens.

His final scene in this film, which ended up being his final scene in filmdom, for he died when Giant was being edited, is truly embarrassing.

The difference is that the Devil and Gabriel Byrne aren´t half as cool as T-1000 and Robert Patrick were in T2. It feels a bit like Arnold´s trying to repeat the successful formula that was T2. But End of Days is nowhere near the classic James Cameron-epic. Schwarzenegger tried to make his comeback with the science fiction 6th Day instead, and once again he didn´t succeed. Even if that movie is definitely underrated and far better than this, but that´s not the case here.End of Days is okay, but not more. Arnold can do much better!* * ½  ","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"23 October 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"   I am your average movie going idiot.

The first time I saw this at university in a large lecture hall I was not prepared for the impact it would have on me. I thought that the Russian Roulette scene between the Vietcong and their prisoners was bad enough, but the climax that had Robert de Niro beseeching his best friend Christopher Walken to come back home was almost unbearable.Deerhunter is such a deceptive movie and that's what gives it its remarkable emotional punch. The first phase of the movie trundles pleasantly along as we observe a pleasant small town in the backwoods of industrial America. There is a great deal of male bonding and general machismo as we see a close-knit bunch of friends doing what boys do best - hunting, fooling around, drinking at the local bar and playing pool. The wedding just emphasizes the joyous innocence of this backwoods idyll.The viewer is, as a result, reassuringly relaxed, after the opening section of this movie. However, we hardly pause for breath when we are suddenly plunged into the horrors of the Vietnam war. The psychological anguish of the prisoners forced to play Russian Roulette by their captors certainly takes you aback, wrenching you out of your lethargy and dragging you through this world of squalor and despair. I believe that this movie addresses the ultimate human predicament and that is what gives it such force committing suicide when you are loathe to be dead. I cannot think of any more appalling confrontation. Moments like that inevitably leave scars and so that is what happened to Christopher Walken.Robert de Niro's heart-rending scene when he tries to drag his best friend away from his nightmare and ultimately fails made me so emotional. I don't think I have ever wept so much in a movie. Just to exacerbate that misery, when all the friends are back in Pennsylvania and mourn over Walken's death there is such an epic pathos that when you leave the cinema your eyes are hardly dry. The first 10 times I watched this remarkable movie left me blubbing at the end and I still get emotional when I watch it now. I don't think there has ever been a drama with more emotional punch than The Deerhunter. It flings you straight into the maelstrom, taking you completely unawares, and never lets up as it puts you and the characters through torment after torment. There is a dignified beauty about the main protagonists and how they are able to deal with such tragedy. The power, brevity and loyalty of de Niro's character is quite simply majestic. When you come out of this movie you feel as though you have experienced a major slice of life and you feel changed in some ways. That is what great art does.

The acting was decent but the number of characters that had any sense of development were few and far between, but this seemed to fit well with the pace of the movie. I mean, how many of the faces at post-teen punk parties do you still remember and\/or communicate with? A series of acquaintances with only parties in common lack depth, much as the characters do.As a rule I usually don't care for movies in which the actors address the camera, I take exception for this one because the way in which it's done makes you feel like you are actually there being introduced to these people and circumstances. For the most part it is not done with that feel of the actor becoming invisible when he addresses the audience. You feel like you're being introduced to these people and hanging out with Steve-O.The story itself is a bit more of a series of anecdotes and ramblings rather than a plot. With that said, for those that grew up with punk music in conservative towns, there is a strange air of familiarity to certain situations of the movie, which makes it that much more likeable.The biggest problem with this movie (and I mean HUGE) is it's one-sided approach to the punk scene. Straight Edge (sXe), hardcore, emo punk, and all the other sub genres are brushed aside to present this sort of anarchy laden punk rock scene obsessed with destruction. Having only been around the west coast punk scene, I'm not sure how accurate of a representation of the punk scene is at that time and location. Most of the punks I knew and associated with were peaceful if not pacifist, with a hatred for rednecks and jocks and a penchant for vandalism, but we were far from the point of going out and beating people up for kicks because that was the exact macho jock mentality that we rejected in the first place.It's an entertaining movie with a one-sided stereotypical view of punk rock music and punks in general, ignoring the passion and creativity that rebellion can inspire (it also completely ignores the punk rock skate scene so big in the 80's). I recommend it because it is entertaining and genuinely funny in parts, but if you want a punk rock experience, buy a ticket to a local hardcore show that costs about as much a the rental price and go live it.

Jolie is the one who is like a real Lara Croft and making this movie good. She is Sexy and Cool in that character. The Soundtrack is good, a perfect match for this kind of movie. The characters are 100% well chosen. The Sounds are worthy to experience.But the problem of this movie is there is not a decent story! The movie is totally like when you are playing a game and sometimes they don't focus on the story! When they are on this mission, It's like you are sitting down on the couch and playing a cool game! The scenery is like what you see on the game so this movie scenery is not that good. It's not that realistic enough. They should have made this movie longer as they jump to the conclusion too soon. If this movie was about 2 hours, I will be more satisfied.So as a matter in fact, Jolie is excellent, soundtrack and the characters are good but need to work on the story a bit. On the other hand, It might be better just to play the game instead.But this movie is worth watching, only it doesn't have a decent story.
