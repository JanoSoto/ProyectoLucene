[{"date":"9 October 2011","score":"","review":" Wes Craven's third instalment is just as powerful as any of the other entries. Many fans of the franchise and many critics have poorly overlooked this underrated entry, and quite possibly because it was the work of another writer Ehren Kruger. I believe most people shot it down before it even got a chance to get off the ground because Kevin Williamson's name was not under writer.As usual David Arquette (Dwight 'Dewey' Riley), Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott), Courtney Cox-Arquette (Gale Weathers), and Liev Schreiber (Cotton Weary) all return to reprise their roles and deliver solid performances.Although not all of the following characters were given much screen time, the same credit should also be attributed to the new co-stars of the franchise Kelly Rutherford (Christine Hamilton), Patrick Dempsey (Detective Mark Kincaid), Scott Foley (Roman Bridger), Lance Henriksen (John Milton), Deon Richmond (Tyson Fox), Matt Keeslar (Tom Prinze, Jenny McCarthy (Sarah Darling), Emily Mortimer (Angelina Tyler), Parker Posey (Jennifer Jolie), and Patrick Warburton (Steven Stone). Call many of them only two dimensional characters if you want, but I frankly did not see a difference in character development between the characters of Scream 2 and the ones from Scream 3. Of course by this film, you as an audience and\/or fan of the series should know that there is a very simple formula to quote Jamie Kennedy's character Randy Meeks, who also happens to make a cameo (not a ridiculous cameo either, considering the eccentricity of the character) in this chapter via a home video titled Scary Movies 101 to introduce the rules of a trilogy. If you know the Scream movies than you know it has to have the signature opening prelude before the film's opening title sequence. From then on it follows the same formula of the first two quite similarly, a bad thing? No, not for this viewer at least. Otherwise why call it a Scream movie? The only thing viewers and fans of the series may feel a bit of a disappointment with, is the producers call to have toned down the violence and play up on the humour in the series. The humour was a hit for me, but could be a miss for others. The tone of Scream 3 is much lighter on some levels with the bloodshed being mild and not as excessive. The scares are still there and the film still achieves the same eerie effect of the first two successors, however in an entirely different style. This sudden change in tone may not go over well with most viewers. Ehren Kruger does an excellent job as screenwriter, creating a very witty script (if you pay real close attention). This may have also been a reason for its panned reviews, because viewers were watching the movie rather than listening. Several real life incidences were what called for a drastic change in tone for Scream 3, and it is interesting when you look at each Scream film and notice how it is changed to adapt to its specific era.Of course all predecessors are on some level a sequel, Scream 3 is still the trilogy Randy deems it to be, mostly linking it back to the plot of Scream with only subtle references to Scream 2. Any plot holes that were left ambiguous in the first film are explained. The climax in Scream 3 is one of the most well developed conclusions to its genre, and leaves the trilogy? on a satisfying note.Do not underestimate this film until you see it, it is still everything Scream and Scream 2 are but with a fresh approach to the franchise. If you loved the originality of the first film don't bother seeking originality from any of its sequels, the originality has already been done, a sequel only has an underlying originality built from a previous original idea. But I guarantee you it is not the very thing the original Scream set out to make fun of, everything in Scream 3 is intentional and intelligently thought out. Scream 3 is haunting and comical, with its superb score (used very chillingly as Sidney returns to Woodsboro), its uncanny ambiances, and its satirical approach to Hollywood politics, actors and films. Pay close attention and you may think twice before panning this film.-MovieCritic33-6 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 October 2011","score":"","review":" Wes Craven's third instalment is just as powerful as any of the other entries.
