It is, of course, a sequel to The Omen; a film that had tapped into the 70's thirst for religious themed horror and had went on to be a big smash hit. Damien Omen II, perhaps unsurprisingly, doesn't have the originality of that first film but it maintains the story very well in my opinion. It's the one film in the franchise where the action has moved from the UK to the USA. It focuses on the now 13 year old antichrist Damien Thorn, who is being schooled in a military academy. It's also the part where he becomes aware of who he really is.In many ways its story arc follows quite close to the original template but with the addition of more frequent, inventive and gory death scenes involving the poor unfortunates who get too close to the truth. In effect, this movie plays out like a series of elaborate set-pieces strung together over a fairly basic plot-line. This isn't such a terrible thing though because these macabre moments are all really executed very well. In particular are three notable death sequences &#x96; on a deserted road a woman is attacked by a raven who pecks her eyes out, she is then finished off by being hit full force by a truck; a man is cut in half by a falling elevator cable; during a game of hockey on a frozen lake, the ice breaks and a man falls under resulting in the disturbing scenario where we see him helplessly floating just below the ice. These set-pieces, along with several others, constitute the highlight of the movie and they are all well-conceived and give the film its definite draw. Because the film is neither a beginning, nor an end to the story it allows this instalment to simply focus its attention on the macabre material in between and it's really not a bad thing.There are other interesting changes though, such as the use of the raven as the creature of the devil, I thought it was a better choice than the Rottweiler from the first movie and it was very well integrated into the story. The acting too is more than decent with the likes of William Holden basically taking on the role Gregory Peck filled in the first movie, while Jonathan Scott-Taylor looks right as Damien, his thin features can look cold and ominous but he is never cartoonishly evil, which was a good thing. He has one particularly memorable and original scene too where he knows the answer to every single question his history teacher throws at him. It's one of the less gruesome more subtly sinister moments that really stands out. Some things remain the same though and once again there is a really good score from Jerry Goldsmith. It's very dramatic with that ominous choir sound that is just perfect for this subject matter.

These unnecessary spin-offs rarely work as quality movies, but apparently they are very profitable. Long story short, this year (among other things) we will get a remake of the 1987 Action\/Sci-Fi classic RoboCop. Although I strongly oppose remaking RoboCop (but I oppose remakes in general), this review wasn't meant to serve as criticism of the remake, but as a look back to, and a glorification of, the original movie. I will be tackling the remake when it is released, of course. In spite of being considered a classic action movie today, back in the day almost every big director passed on the opportunity of directing RoboCop &#x96; before Paul Verhoeven eventually settled as the director; and he also would have passed the opportunity if it weren't for a pleasant turn of events of his wife reading the script and convincing him to direct it. The reason I'm mentioning this is because Paul Verhoeven is the ideal director for such a movie, and if it weren't for him, I doubt RoboCop would have achieved the cult status it has. But I'll get to that in a moment. 'RoboCop' is set in a futuristic\/dystopian version of the city of Detroit, which has a big problem with crime, and the police can't seem to do a thing. The police's main problem is one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith), who is a notorious cop killer and the crime boss of 'Old Detroit'. Besides him, the police has trouble dealing with Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a company which signed a contract with the city that puts them in charge of controlling the city's security and police department. As an attempt at decreasing the city's crime rate, OCP has been developing some weapon programs &#x96; amidst which is a certain Robocop program, that would create a cyborg super cop who could easily deal with the troublesome crime rate. Luckily for them, a cop named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets killed on duty, and they decide to run the prototype of the Robocop program using his dead body.To be honest, the concept of the movie does sound a bit ridiculous (which might explain why everyone passed the opportunity of directing it), but that's exactly why Paul Verhoeven is the perfect choice for directing it. He easily manages to turn the source material upside down and create something that is, at the same time, excessively violent, funny and satirical. And in that way 'RoboCop' isn't much different from Verhoeven's 1997 underrated gem Starship Troopers. His subtle director trademarks (the commercials in the movie and the religious imagery) are precisely what makes 'RoboCop' a good movie that stands out from other\/similar action movies. Furthermore, Verhoeven directing is absolutely brilliant (the scenes in which RoboCop gets revealed come to mind) and he puts just the right amount of excessive, sometimes cartoonish, violence in the movie, in order not to avoid the campiness of the movie's premise. All of this makes 'RoboCop' a very unique and enjoyable experience which wouldn't have been possible without Verhoeven.Of course, not all of 'RoboCop' is Verhoeven's one man show. Props should be given to the people who designed the suit and to Kurtwood Smith, who plays the villain &#x96; Clarence Boddicker. His Boddicker is menacing, unpredictable and crazy, and the rule 'each film is only as good as its villain' undoubtedly works for 'RoboCop'. The only minor flaws that could be attributed to 'RoboCop' are that some of the special effects are really outdated, and that Peter Weller's role in the movie is unusually small, in spite of him being the titular character he doesn't do much in terms of acting (more flashbacks could have helped with that problem). But I understand that some people may consider these as nitpicks. Finally, just like the old saying goes &#x96; 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.

Put them together and add James Cagney, William Powell and Jack Lemmon and you have yourself the amiable Mister Roberts (1955), a movie whose backstage drama should have been called Clash of the Titans.Ford had always been known as a tough man to like yet he did have a stable of reliable actors willing to work with him including Fonda and the legendary John Wayne whom he called the big idiot.

After LeRoy had finished putting his mark on the film, Fonda brought original play author Joshua Logan in to re-shoot key scenes.What results after all this horse trading is done is a movie that is surprisingly good. Not South Pacific (1958) good but decent enough to pass for nostalgic WWII fare. Fonda stars as Roberts, an under-appreciated junior lieutenant onboard a cargo ship in the middle of the Pacific. He yens to fight with his brethren but is refused multiple transfers by Captain Morton (James Cagney) who sees him as the key to his success in the Navy. Only the wise ship doctor (William Powell) and careless Ensign Pulver (Jack Lemmon) know his motivation to fight the good fight and aspire to help their friend make it to the front.It's hard to tell which director did what to make Mister Roberts the sum of its parts. LeRoy wanted to shoot things how Ford would have and hides his style well. Likewise there is only a handful of interior scenes with drifting camera movements that has Logan's name all over them (Ford used to avoid tracking shots and close-ups).Still the film has the overall feel of having too many chefs in the kitchen. The energy between scenes is jerky overall, most evident when the ship lands ashore for liberty. Actors seem to talk past each other while attempting to convey they're having a good time. Minutes later the scene ends with Roberts standing triumphantly under a warm morning light; then the Captain reestablishes authority. The scenes are cut correctly but lack an overarching theme. We know what Roberts wants yet at this point we should know how he's going to get it. Unfortunately this isn't so. Is Roberts supposed to be pensive, worried or celebratory throughout? Did he feel he won a victory against the Captain for allowing liberty? How does all this relate to his goal? Henry Fonda had always said he was proud of the film but thought seeing the play live was much better. Fonda had been playing the main character for years on the stage and due to being absent from the screen for eight years, likely wanted a surefire triumph to reinstall his box-office appeal. Yet his insistence in adapting the play with only minor changes I feel stifled Ford's attempts to breathe air into the picture.Regardless Mister Roberts is still an interesting film with much to say about the wartime doldrums. Eager soldiers and sailors poise for deliverance and absolution yet are met with a mind-numbing wait. I'm tired of being a lousy spectator, remarks Roberts. Yet while most military men in WWII eventually saw battle, the crew of the U.S.S. Reluctant never got to be on the frontlines staying listless in the safe area of the Pacific.

Both have very dark and dry senses of humor, a lot of bad guys (nothing but bad guys), bad language and crude material all wrapped up in an incredibly stylish package. You like one film, you'll like the other. You hate one, you'll hate the other.This film is about several groups of idiot criminals who all converge. There are the incredibly stupid and burn-out drug dealers, the tough guys who plan to rob them AND a third group that plans to rob the second group once they've committed the robbery. In addition, you have some super-scary baddies--super-scary indeed. Who will survive with all these guns, knives and swords being wielded? And, speaking of guns, two of the shotguns used in the robbery MIGHT just be worth more than all the stuff they steal--but the dummies don't even realize it.This film is, above all else, very stylish and weird. The criminals DEFINITELY have odd and quirky personalities but more importantly, the camera-work and edits are very well done--very innovative and they get your attention. It's all very well worth seeing but it's also NOT a film for everyone. Of course, you shouldn't let your kids, your mother or Father Jenkins watch it. But to enjoy it yourself you need a very high threshold for this sort of thing. It certainly AIN'T rated G! However, despite the very harsh language and very adult subject matter, Richie actually doesn't show that much of the violence. It happens--but mostly off-camera.By the way, of the two similar films, I slightly prefer Snatch simply because it tried harder to be overtly funny--though the nihilistic ending in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was priceless.

It's true this fantasy film is not up there with The Hobbit series or Game of Thrones in my book but it's not trying to be. This is a fantasy film that is just plain fun, and thats what it is.Not a whole lot I can really say about the film. I like the story, it's a simple plot which is fine by me, I like most of my fantasy films uncomplicated most of the time, which to me makes it all the more fun because that means no filler. I love the fact that this takes place on some other planet that is Earth like, which to me makes it all the more fascinating, because it feels that this is a place where anything is possible and you wonder what else is there.I really love the production value, they spent what was a great amount of money at the time to make the film possible and it really shows, because most to all of it was practical; and part of why I think is still looks good today. I really like the use of the locale, it's just beautiful looking. Even the design of the Black Fortress inside and out. But I really like some of the effects from the Glave, but mainly the creature designs of the Slayers, the giant Spider and the Beast whom don't disappoint, their menacing. The Slayers are sort of these Golems since their really tough but really slow. The Beast is a solid monster design it's face looks like a humanoid piranha which I think is kinda cool. The Shelabab like Spider in the Widow of the Web sequence was also cool and creepy, the stop motion was on par.The characters are decent from the protagonist to the villains their not deep they serve their functions. But this film were in it for the adventure and it's a fun one at that.I really like the action from the siege of the castle, swamp battle, down to the raid of the Black Fortress, the chirography is solid. However one of the highlights of the film for me is the music by one of my favorite composer's James Horner which I think is great and memorable, the theme song is solid but my favorite score is during the fire mares sequence, which I think is just beautiful because the tone is adventurous and epic.And of course one other highlight of the film is the Glave which to me is one of my favorite fictional weapons. It's just a really cool mystical boomerang knife which you can control with your mind, it can cut though anything, go as fast as the wind, and can shield you from power blasts.The only disappointment is he doesn't us the Glave enough. I know that he was only suppose to use it when he needed it the most but wasn't that one battle in the swamp or even part of the siege on the teleporting fortress, it just felt like lost opportunities but oh well.Overall Krull is a fun fantasy that makes the cut.Rating 3 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"30 January 2014","score":"","review":" I was a kid from the 80's and fantasy was my thing, I was a fan of the cartoon show He-Man and the Masters of the Universe so seeing this film was a thrill for me.

That said, I did catch the even more renowned LOVE AFFAIR (1939) &#x96; of which this is a remake (by the same director, no less!)&#x85;but, then, I have no interest in checking out the 1994 version (despite the presence of Warren Beatty and Katharine Hepburn). Incidentally, this marks yet another example in a curious trend prevalent around this time among veteran Hollywood directors (like Frank Capra, John Ford, Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock) &#x96; that of 'upgrading' their own earlier successes!Anyway, this is a glossy Fox effort in color and Cinemascope, given added commercial appeal by its title tune (sung by Vic Damone) the central casting, however, is really what makes it work &#x96; Grant, Deborah Kerr and Cathleen Nesbitt standing in for Charles Boyer, Irene Dunne and Maria Ouspenskaya. As always, Grant is basically playing himself here, that is to say, the epitome of a ladies' man; indeed, his impending marriage to a prominent society woman is seen making the news the world over in the very opening scene! He meets and falls for Kerr (who has promised to tie the knot with her own boyfriend) during an ocean voyage. Despite their attempts to keep a low-profile on board ship, the couple cannot fool the nosy crew and passengers. They decide to pull their hair down on the last day of the trip, knowing they must part soon after. To this end, they opt to have a go at the life awaiting them in New York but, if it fails, they are to meet in six months' time atop the Empire State Building. So far, the film maintains a light mood, albeit punctuated by nostalgia (their visit to Grant's French grandmother, who takes an instant liking to Kerr) and melancholy.The second half does go overboard with contrivances the heroine meets with an accident on the day she is to be reunited with Grant; oblivious to this, he believes he has been stood up and grows bitter. Eventually, he attends a theatrical performance with his former intended, only to run into Kerr and her own ex-flame (now devoted to taking care of the crippled woman). In the meantime, the narrative grows even more saccharine with Kerr's taking charge of a children's choir (for the record, we are treated to numerous songs throughout the film&#x85;since the leading lady also unconvincingly takes up work temporarily as a chanteuse, the actress' voice dubbed &#x96; as had been the case with THE KING AND I 1956 &#x96; by Marni Nixon)!

Sure, much of it was out of place in its own way, but Keitel was not convincing for me.Roger Ebert wrote that Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader paid Christ the compliment of taking him and his message seriously, and they have made a film that does not turn him into a garish, emasculated image from a religious postcard. Here he is flesh and blood, struggling, questioning, asking himself and his father which is the right way. This is an excellent point. While the film may be offensive to some, it does raise the valid point that Jesus was (half) human and had the issues that humans have. To portray him as simply perfect is too easy.

The acting was so poor, by not just Muniz, but all the children in the film, that it completely pulls you out of it. However, I feel that this is not entirely the fault of the actors, but also the poor director.

The strongest of all bonds is the one shared between a father and his son. The father being the mentor, whose job it is to help his son, to guide his son through the unsteady, turbulent and sometimes painful sea that is life. His kind words of encouragements must act as sails boats to guide us into man hood. Well Mockingbird is not strictly just a father and son relationship, there is also a daughter added to the mix, but despite that, Atticus Finch is the perfect illustration of what a good father should be as with stern love and mostly importantly education, he teaches his children to love in a world full of hate, and for me that's the greatest lesson any father could teach his children. And To Kill a Mockingbird is the perfect illustration of a true American classic. Based on the Pulitzer-Prize winning masterpiece novel by Harper Lee (Her only novel), writer Horton Foote and director Robert Mulligan, ingeniously guide us through a painful period in human history for all those involved, a period of economic turmoil and the very apex of racial tension in the deep south, Maycomb, Alabama, in 1932 to be more precise. But what makes the film the even more compelling is how we are shown a world filled with so much ugly, but at the same time we are lead to a single red rose of beauty, because we are shown the world through the eyes of 6 year old girl called Jean Louise Scout Finch (Mary Badham) a high spirited and precocious young girl, who despite her innocent smile, you certainly don't want to find yourself on her bad side. On her journey she is accompanied by Brother Jeremy Atticus Jem Finch (Phillip Alford), neighbourhood friend Dill Harris and last but not least farther Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. But it's through Scouts eyes we see her father a nigh-on perfect, eloquent and intelligent lawyer seeks to uphold what is true and just, in a world that seeks to abuse and belittle a whole race of people, as he puts it upon himself to protect a black man in court against the bigoted arm of injustice. The black man is Tom Robinson and he has been accused of raping a poor white girl named Mayella Violet Ewell, but as you would expect in 1932, an all white jury sees him as guilty even though the film consistently paints him a positive light, suggesting he is innocent. Despite this, Atticus still endeavours to protect a man he firmly believes is innocent, leading to one of the most impressive and compelling (and longest) courtroom scenes in history. The two things that stood out to me the most was, for one Gregory Peck performance as the father, which I felt he defiantly deserved his Best Actors Oscar for his performance, because as many times as I watch the film back I can't help but fall in love with it again and again, because peck is able to take a onion layered character who one point his a pacifists, loving father, then a second later he shots down a dog 100 meters away with just one bullet, as if he was in a Clint Eastwood film. And it's this ability to take such a complex character, with so such juxtapositions at his core, and be able to do Harper Lee's character a great service with a gentle, controlled and fine paint brush flick from a true artist. The second thing that stood out for me was the three young actors who made the film such an enjoyable and funny watch, each brought passion and enthusiasm to the role, which helped Foote's script truly come alive. Ranked 33rd greatest American film for a reason! An intoxicating watch, I strongly recommended it as viewing for all occasion.
