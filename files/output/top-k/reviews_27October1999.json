Carrie Fisher never did anything for me, although I did see Star Wars. The younger generation, I understand, found her quite fetching. The TV show Friends had Rachel dressing up like her as Princess Laya to excite Zimmer... So I suppose if I had concentrated on her, I would have gotten a bit of a yen because she does have agreeable features. But her main quality, it now appears, is her ability to write dialogue (she wrote the screen play as well as the book). The dialogue made the book and is the heart and soul of the movie.I guess a few words about Meryl Streep are in order since she is one of the great actresses of our age. I always thought of her as flawless, but she's more than that. She just demands the camera, and she has the talent. In the finale she sings a country and western song (music by Carly Simon, by the way) and she can warble. But she is almost absurd in the police uni she runs around in (playing a part in a movie within a movie). She doesn't quite achieve a comedic effect and just avoids the ridiculous; however when the camera gets on her face, we believe her, as we always believe Meryl Streep.Streep has always made it on talent. She had to. Her eyes are not really good. And her nose is too thin. She has no figure. But her mouth is nice, and when she flashes her smile, it lights up the place. And she never lets go of the illusion. Particularly telling was the opening scene, nicely directed by Mike Nichols. I saw the PV cliffs and the shots of the ocean below and waited for the SoCal scene to unfold, only it was Mexico, and I thought Gee, this looks like a cheap MOW set, and I continued to be fooled as Meryl is hauled from customs by the customs officer and slapped. It is only when they go to cut! and the movie within the movie is exposed that I realized why the set looked cheap. (Because it was supposed to!) Meryl sold the scene within the scene, and irony, she was supposed to be doing a terrible job because of her drug dependency. Somehow a scene with Meryl Streep in it never drags. Maybe she guides the direction and the editing. Thinking back (this is the first movie I've seen her in in years) to Sophie's Choice, for example, (1982 best actress Oscar and other honors) she hasn't changed much except that she's a little more relaxed, and while her concentration is still total, there is a touch less urgency in her performance. I've heard people complain about her mannerisms, that head to the side so that the corner of the mouth goes up, a little defensive smile, and then the flash of eyes, comes to mind, and some others, but compared with say, Dustin Hoffman or (horrors) John Wayne, she's as pure as Olivier.Shirley MacLaine is, if anything, even better here as Carrie Fisher's mother, one part alcoholic, one part stage mom, and one part frustrated actress jealous of her daughter's youth and talent, all parts overbearing. I recall Shirley MacLaine as a young woman of course. I can see her in Can- Can (1960) showing off those gorgeous legs (she shows her legs here too, but I cringed). She was pretty, healthy and busting her bodice as a young actress, and I liked her, but she was never more than a popular actress. Then came many years later, Terms of Endearment (1983).Shirley MacLaine is the classic example of the actress who really learned how to act as she got older, not like Betty Davis, who was an accomplished actress from the get go and got better as she aged. Shirley MacLaine (Warren Beatty's sister, one recalls) was just another pretty face with some talent. She got an academy award nomination for The Apartment (1960), but it was undeserved. I liked the hospital scene here at the end, mother and daughter renewing their bonds, Shirley without her wig, and no make-up. Ah, now that's a serious actress who will just let herself look terrible for the camera!Some great lines endolphin rush. (Streep corrects with, You mean endorphin rush.) You smell like Catalina.

The TV show Friends had Rachel dressing up like her as Princess Laya to excite Zimmer... So I suppose if I had concentrated on her, I would have gotten a bit of a yen because she does have agreeable features. But her main quality, it now appears, is her ability to write dialogue (she wrote the screen play as well as the book). The dialogue made the book and is the heart and soul of the movie.I guess a few words about Meryl Streep are in order since she is one of the great actresses of our age. I always thought of her as flawless, but she's more than that. She just demands the camera, and she has the talent. In the finale she sings a country and western song (music by Carly Simon, by the way) and she can warble. But she is almost absurd in the police uni she runs around in (playing a part in a movie within a movie). She doesn't quite achieve a comedic effect and just avoids the ridiculous; however when the camera gets on her face, we believe her, as we always believe Meryl Streep.Streep has always made it on talent. She had to. Her eyes are not really good. And her nose is too thin. She has no figure. But her mouth is nice, and when she flashes her smile, it lights up the place. And she never lets go of the illusion. Particularly telling was the opening scene, nicely directed by Mike Nichols. I saw the PV cliffs and the shots of the ocean below and waited for the SoCal scene to unfold, only it was Mexico, and I thought Gee, this looks like a cheap MOW set, and I continued to be fooled as Meryl is hauled from customs by the customs officer and slapped. It is only when they go to cut! and the movie within the movie is exposed that I realized why the set looked cheap. (Because it was supposed to!) Meryl sold the scene within the scene, and irony, she was supposed to be doing a terrible job because of her drug dependency. Somehow a scene with Meryl Streep in it never drags. Maybe she guides the direction and the editing. Thinking back (this is the first movie I've seen her in in years) to Sophie's Choice, for example, (1982 best actress Oscar and other honors) she hasn't changed much except that she's a little more relaxed, and while her concentration is still total, there is a touch less urgency in her performance. I've heard people complain about her mannerisms, that head to the side so that the corner of the mouth goes up, a little defensive smile, and then the flash of eyes, comes to mind, and some others, but compared with say, Dustin Hoffman or (horrors) John Wayne, she's as pure as Olivier.Shirley MacLaine is, if anything, even better here as Carrie Fisher's mother, one part alcoholic, one part stage mom, and one part frustrated actress jealous of her daughter's youth and talent, all parts overbearing. I recall Shirley MacLaine as a young woman of course. I can see her in Can- Can (1960) showing off those gorgeous legs (she shows her legs here too, but I cringed). She was pretty, healthy and busting her bodice as a young actress, and I liked her, but she was never more than a popular actress. Then came many years later, Terms of Endearment (1983).Shirley MacLaine is the classic example of the actress who really learned how to act as she got older, not like Betty Davis, who was an accomplished actress from the get go and got better as she aged. Shirley MacLaine (Warren Beatty's sister, one recalls) was just another pretty face with some talent. She got an academy award nomination for The Apartment (1960), but it was undeserved. I liked the hospital scene here at the end, mother and daughter renewing their bonds, Shirley without her wig, and no make-up. Ah, now that's a serious actress who will just let herself look terrible for the camera!Some great lines endolphin rush. (Streep corrects with, You mean endorphin rush.) You smell like Catalina. (Makes me think of the song lyric I smell sex and candy.) I get to be hyper-conscious to the series of humiliations. (Carrie's life now without the deadening effect of drugs.) Streep's timing on the ..And you weren't wearing any panties line was great (talking about the embarrassment of her mother showing her legs drunk at a party in the past).(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

I just don't want to be blacklisted! What struck me about this film is that the protagonist (good guy) and antagonist (bad guy) are not as clear as in some two-dimensional plot-lines. What brought this idea home was at the end, when Michael Douglas says, in utter astonishment, You mean I... I'm the bad guy?  Since this is in the point of view of what, in most films, would be the antagonist, (he is after all, causing civil unrest, property damage, etc. to the dismay of the police and in particular, a soft-hearted old Robert Duvall who is about to retire--bring on the violins!) the audience has sympathized with him, as audiences usually do to the character whose side of the story they know most about.  One might even say that the roles of the good guy and the bad guy have been reversed entirely.  Why? Consider the personalities of the two central characters.  Is it not Duvall who seems the most dishonest of the two? After all, he is the one who, to comfort his wife, tells her anything to appease her hysteria.  He is the one who cons the mother of Douglas's character to get what he needs from her. In contrast, Douglas is always very straight forward with the people that displease him to the vetI'm not giving you my money,to the fast food cashier But...I want breakfast!, to the psycho with the army surplus stash We are not the same...I...am an                       American...and you...are a madman? it's                       been a while Most shocking, at the end, Duvall does not even want to discuss anything. He pulls his gun and is no nonsense.  All he wants is to get this over with and get home to his wife which he has finally put in her place. However, these are evidences only to the small minded.  This movie is not that simple.  Although he attacks things in our society that are irritable to us all, he is still attacking.  Most importantly, this behavior did not start with his dismissal from his job.  In the home movie which he watches in his wife's home after he realizes that she and their daughter are not there, we see him at on one of his daughter's birthdays, insisting that she ride the horse-thing that he bought her despite her crying protests.  He is a controlling person, and when he doesn't get his way he is, as evidenced by most of this movie, able to resort to extreme measures.This is probably why he was fired from his job in the first place, though, of course, an employer would not say You're a psycho, don't come back! Ironically, he identifies himself with the man protesting in the street who was told that he was no longer viable, as presumptuous as the army surplus man identifying with him, Douglas's character. In short, this is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels.  Every piece of it seems to have a greater meaning.  By the way, for some reason it took me a long time to figure out that Falling Down, in addition to being the perfect phrase for the way Douglas's character felt, also referred to the song on the music box which Duvall sung along to in order to soothe his hysterical wife.  The song,London Bridge, was also where he and his wife were planning to visit.  The sno-dome thing that played the song was not unlike the sno-dome thing that Douglas had bought as a birthday present for his daughter.  What a great movie!

If you saw Double Jeopardy and marveled at the wit and intelligence of the screenplay (SARCASM ALERT) then this film is not for you.Personally, I loved Fight Club and I thought it is the best film of the year, so far.The plot, which can't be revealed in any great detail so as not to spoil the surprises of the movie, is basically about a character (referred to in the credits as the Narrator) played by Edward Norton, who has had it with the corporate Single Serving life and finds a new thing with Brad Pitt, who plays Tyler Durden.This movie is violent, but not senselessly so.  Each scene has a point, or as my drama teacher used to say, Each scene turns a corner.  The corners this movie turns are pretty remarkable.  If this film doesn't have you questioning your life, you must be extremely rich and successful.  For those of us who are not (99%), this is a breath of fresh air.This and Iron Giant give me hope abut Hollywood again.  And this year isn't over yet...we still have The Messenger, Dogma, Being John Malkovich, The Insider, Sleepy Hollow, The Green Mile, etc. to look forward to.YOU ARE NOT YOUR JOB.  YOU ARE NOT THE CONTENTS OF YOUR WALLET.  YOU ARE NOT YOUR F*****G KHAKIS.  YOU ARE NOT AN ORIGINAL AND UNIQUE SNOWFLAKE.

But who better than a puppeteer to wring the funniest, widest-ranging performance yet seen from Mr. Exaggeration himself, Eddie Murphy?Murphy is just a big muppet in Oz's hands. A lot of the humor is based on his extreme facial expressions (not quite Jim Carrey, but closer than I thought I'd ever see) and otherwise over-the-top characterizations. And I don't mean that as a criticism at all, because it turns out to be really funny.Murphy plays both an action-movie star and his nerdy brother. The action-movie star bits use Murphy's patented loud-angry-black-man character, played to the hilt. The nerdy brother scenes, though, are something of a a shock THAT'S Eddie Murphy? They're the best bits in the flick. Murphy must have put more energy and effort into every scene in this movie than into the whole of Beverly Hills Cop 3. (Which, in case you don't get the hint, you should skip.) Any doubts I had about Murphy's basic talent have evaporated.So it's Murphy's movie all the way. The other folks?Steve Martin has a good opening scene, but after that he basically plays the straight man, which he does well enough I guess. As screenwriter, he wrote himself right out of center stage.Heather Graham's role is slight, but she plays it well. (Guys, she's modestly dressed through the whole thing. Yes, really.)Terrence Stamp is amusing as the low-key, screwball head of the new-agey MindHead organization. Hmm, I wonder what litigious bunch of powerful California morons screenwriter Martin is taking umbrage at there?7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 1999","score":"","review":"  When I noticed that Frank Oz directed this movie, I was surprised.

I think this is the first good black movie I have seen that didn't need to be but simply was.  Well-known, medium-powered Black actors and actresses in a movie that didn't focus on the Black experience.  The BEST part... the whole movie was done with thought-out class.  The story wasn't about brothers from the 'hood trying to make it in the White Man's world or some racially-charged Spike Lee joint.  Think of a great episode of the Cosby Show re-written for an adult audience, bearing a PG-13 rating and you know how you'll feel when you leave the theater.  It's about time.

Even minor roles are perfectly cast, and Verhoeven shows he can coax the best out of every actor. On the bad guys side, Ronny Cox and Michael Ironsides are superb, and even the minor henchmen, such as Michael Champion, are great. Plus, you get Sharon Stone back when she was actually attractive. The characters in the Total Rekall office are all minor, but they are all memorable.The script has some great one-liners, which get more hilarious with each repeat viewing. My current favorite is when Arnold's character yells down at the Ironside character, as the latter falls to his death See you at the party, Richter!OK, well, you had to have been there.Anyway, TOTAL RECALL is a classic, and I would hazard to suggest that it is the best adult-oriented action sci-fi film of all time.A word to parents TOTAL RECALL has no (real) nudity, but it has just about everything else it takes to earn it a hard 'R' rating. You may want to preview it before renting it for the kids.
