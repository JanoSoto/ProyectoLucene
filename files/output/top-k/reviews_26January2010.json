Managing Emotions in Medical School Students' Contacts with the Living and the Dead written by Allen C. Smith,III and Sherryl Kleinman examines the physical intimacy in medicine by depicting the results of the research on medical students' way of feeling management as they make contact with their patients; so the article can be used to analyze the way Patch Adams, as a doctor was expected to do his job in the movie. Also, Gary L.Brase and Jillian Richmond's article The White-Coat Effect Physician Attire and Perceived Authority, Friendliness, and Attractiveness draws attention to the various effects of the doctors white coat which include the fact that white coat increases perception of authority, friendliness and trust; and the statements in this article can be disapproved by the Patch Adam's style of dress and his relations with his patients.According to Smith and Klein's study, medical students use different strategies to avoid unwanted feelings which might arouse from their contact with patients. One of these strategies is called 'transforming the contact' and it involves students mentally transforming their patients body into something totally different; it could be a set of body parts, a math problem or something nun-human such as a toaster or an engine. Students also transform the moment of contact into a complex intellectual puzzle, the kind of challenge they faced successfully during previous years of schooling. They interpret details according to logical patterns and algorithms, and find answers as they master rules. (Smith 60) In effect, science itself is an emotion management strategy. By competing for years for the highest grades, these students have learned to separate their feelings from the substance of their classes and to concentrate on the impersonal facts of the subject matter. (Smith 61) In contrast, in the movie, Patch Adams' philosophy is to treat the patient, not the disease. His professor and his classmates think and speak of the patient impersonally when they are doing a presentation of a patient's case, but Adams does not impersonalize his patients. Moreover, he makes personal contacts with them; he knows their names, learn about their families and personal lives. He uses unconventional methods and wacky surprises to ease patients' anxiety and enhance their healing. He sings to Mr. Davis, a patient dying of pancreatic cancer, he makes another patient's-the old lady's- dream come true by preparing a swimming pool full of noodles for her. Patch Adam's attitude and way of practicing medicine depicts a great contrast with the results of the study Smith and Kleinman wrote in their books.In their article The White-Coat Effect Physician Attire and Perceived Authority, Friendliness, and Attractiveness where they draw attention to the various effects of the doctors' white coat, Gary L.Brase and Jillian Richmond also state some facts about the influence of the doctors' way of dressing on the patients. ..They way they should dress for functional and hygienic reasons, and because of the supposed influence on the doctor-patient relationship. .. The clean, carefully dressed doctor might give the impression that patient contact is an important event and that it takes time to prepare for it, whereas the unkempt doctor can be perceived an unskilled and uncaring. (Brase 2469) Furthermore, in the study they conducted, Brase and RIchmond found that casual dressing has a negative affect on doctor- patient relationship. Overall, this research indicates that casual dress is not likely to be an effective tactic for doctors to increase patient comfort or disclosure. Instead, it is clear that casual dress decreases perceptions of authority, regardless of the gender of the doctor or the patient. Casual dress also decreases perceptions of friendliness (compared to formal attire), trust (for male patients), and attractiveness. (Brase 2478) In the movie, Parch Adams trades in the traditional white coat for a more colorful and cheerful outfit with the same intention explained in the previous paragraphs-solely getting a laugh out of his patients. He wears massively bright floral shirts and a tie that occasionally makes noise. Unlike stated in Brase and Richmond's article, casual dressing appears to be an effective tactic for Adams to increase his patients' comfort or disclosure. His shirts with funny patterns don't seem to decrease the perceptions of friendliness or trust. His relationships with his patients are extraordinarily effective, obviously better than his fellow students' relationships with their patients. In other words, it can be said that Patch Adams and his way of dressing as a doctor disapproves the fact stated in Brase and Richmond's article. I personally do not think that doctors should follow certain rules such as impersonalization of the patient, or wearing the white coat. I believe that it is not only these factors which make doctors seem more credible, trustable or friendly to their patients, but the combination of their medical skills as a doctor and their intra-personal communication skills. There are instances where patients are nervous, and might need a little joke to ease their fears or they might be upset and a little humor can lighten them up. Also, if we code white coat as an indicator of a trustable doctor, we might oversee less-credible doctors with white coats, or underestimate doctors without a white coat. I agree with the Patch Adam's philosophy of 'treating the patient. not the disease', because it is a proved fact that the endorphine hormone has healing effects and its production is triggered with laughter. In other words, laughter produces healing as the body produces endorphins that has far ranging healing effects. And Adams' sense of humor and the personal relationships he builds with his patients enables this process.

Weakly written and weakly acted (by Britt Ekland) she gets by on her looks and somehow manages to not annoy me as much as other rubbish Bond girls despite being a completely useless klutz. Maybe it's the great performance of Maud Adams as secondary Bond Girl Andrea Anders balancing it out that keeps things tolerable. A special mention must go to the belly dancer Bond seduces to get information from as she is the ugliest girl 007 has locked lips with thus far in the series. Grace Jones would challenge her for that title 11 years later. Moore is again good as Bond, I especially love the scene where he smacks Adams to get information and threatens to break her arm &#x96; what a ladies' man! I don't know why but I really like a darker, edgier Bond and when Moore does it he does it very well. He doesn't even seem angry, like Timothy Dalton might be, good ol' Rodge is just like Yeah, I'll shag you, then batter you and possibly kill you if I don't get what I want from you all while keeping his poker face on. I love it. Scaramanga isn't a great villain but Christopher Lee elevates the material 100% - a true thespian. Hervé Villechaize as Nic Nac should annoy me to no end being as he is a gimmicky and silly henchman but he is actually genuinely funny and watchable. Lois Maxwell was always quite plain compared to her female co-stars but she was still somewhat attractive. Here, for the first time, she looks old. It's like watching you Mum flirt with the milkman. They should have sacked the character after this one but they kept on letting her embarrass herself for a few more years, poor old girl. M has my favourite moment of his in the series when Bond asks who could possibly want him dead; Jealous husbands, outraged chefs, humiliated tailors, the list is endless! Lee's delivery and Moore's reaction are priceless.The title song by Lulu is disgustingly bad, easily the worst of the series but John Barry's score is top notch, one of his best. The music playing in Scaramanga's fun house during the opening sequence (which is blindingly good by the way) is tonally almost certainly the best work he's done with the series since From Russia With Love.Of course, this is a Guy Hamilton film so there has to be some random dumb 'funny' jokes. Sheriff J.W. Pepper, that 'loveable' hick from Live And Let Die pops up to inject more 'fun' into proceedings and when Bond is attacked by Sumo wrestlers he defeats one by grabbing his bum cheeks really hard then giving him a wedgie. Yes, you read that correctly. Scaramanga's car that becomes a plane is also pushing it a bit too far for my taste.TMWTGG features one of the best stunts in any film ever, as 007 leaps a car over the gap of a broken bridge while doing a barrel roll. This stunt was down for real and it is phenomenal. Forget about the CGI highway scene in The Matrix Reloaded, forget about whatever daft Jason Statham movie you sat through last, THIS is the real deal. For some bizarre reason though they put the sound of a sliding whistle on the soundtrack as the car makes its jump but even the ridiculousness of that decision in the post production process cannot ruin one of the greatest moments in action movie history.I am a huge fan of TMWTGG, despite its many flaws it is hugely enjoyable and always entertaining.

There's a big debate regarding the films tendency to be factually wonky. I don't understand that at all. Do we ask that Herzog be tied down by the facts of his subjects when he's making non- docs?

Money is not the solve-all for Hollywood. As films are released today, big effects and big budgets, nothing can compete with the power of a strong story. Hitchcock was aware of this, and thus, The Lady Vanishes was born. Criterion has included it, with a plethora of special features, in their growing collection, and for me &#x96; it stays as one of my favorite films of all time. Like a jigsaw puzzle, Hitch gives you only small piece by small piece, not even telling you which lady is going to vanish, and with each viewing &#x96; the suspense grows deeper and stronger. As with most Hitchcock, it is not just about what happens in front of the screen (the introduction of the characters, the scenery, the time), but also what happens behind. It is this discovery which allows future viewings of The Lady Vanishes and proves Hitch's cinematic worth.As I sat down to write this review, draft after draft was tossed out because I wasn't sure what to discuss on a film that has been dissected by some of the biggest film critics (Geoffrey O'Brien, Charles Barr, Robin Barr) and discussed by another great film maestro, François Truffaut. What could I say that hadn't been said before (also ranked #235 of the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 Films), so why not pick three scenes and discuss why they impacted my decision to name this one of my top 10 favorites &#x85; a tough list to be on &#x96; especially today. So, here are the three moments in The Lady Vanishes that confirmed its honorarium in the Criterion collection as well as the accolades that Hitch has received for this body of work alone.The first scene has to be the brief introduction of our characters in the small inn. Upon first viewing, there was no indication which of the multiple ladies would not be the one vanishing, nor was there any direct way of knowing how these groups of different individuals would eventually come together on one train. Just sitting there, waiting for the avalanche to be cleared, we see adulterers, comedians, cricketers, wealthy Americans, musicians, and a little old lady who would eventually be at the crux of all this madness. It is this unknown upon first viewing, the sweetness with the second viewing, and the complexity of the third viewing that makes this nearly opening scene one that cannot be shaken from the mind. Hitch presents you with the early who of the film, but without that sense of direction, the darkness allows your mind to discover all possibilities, no matter how many times you watch it. Exactly how many were involved with the plot? Who knows, and that my friends, is only half the fun.The second scene that stood out in this film was the cult window scene. Without indulging in spoilers, early in the film the window dirt is used as merely a greeting, and later as a divergence from madness. It is during the scene where the name is revealed a second time that always sends tension through my veins. The word in question is just staring at you within the scene, it evokes the need to scream from your couch to look up, to see what we all see, like Hitch is toying with his audience &#x96; to say that the beautiful Margaret Lockwood's sanity may not be in question. With merely one word, Hitch has created audience involvement, a level of excitement, and tension beyond belief. It is as if he is flaunting it. It is an iconic scene, but also one of those that speaks for itself. This dirty word proved that with a small budget (and no special effects) that you could pull your audiences in deeper. I would challenge any modern film to do the same, alas; I don't think they would have the same result.Finally, the remaining scene that makes this film more than just print through a projector is actually not a scene at all, but Hitch's involvement of music into this entire film. Yep, it is a broad (and perhaps cheat) third scene, but from the beginning opening scenes a certain tune is flaunted in front of us as maybe just a mere theme music, but as the film continues we learn it is much, much more. Like the name on the window, the missing woman, the confused passengers, the music has a double meaning. It not only represents the mood of the film, but it also sends another message. What is that? Oh, I'm not telling, but Hitch smartly includes it whenever possible. Listen to the scenes, each one, there is a hint of this music throughout &#x96; almost including you within the overall story. The Lady Vanishes is not just a movie to watch, but also one that should be listened to. The score (if it can be called that) carries nearly more meaning than the characters. That, again, is the power of Alfred Hitchcock.If you haven't guessed, I love The Lady Vanishes not just because it is a great film, but because it best represents Hitchcock's work. There is something for everyone, young audiences and mature cineophiles alike. The characters, the sound, the visuals all blend together to make a phenomenal cinematic journey. Every detail within The Lady Vanishes is important &#x96; and this is a film that should be watched &#x96; again, and again, and again.

The takes were then 'stitched' together using the camera moving toward a black background so that the film reel could be reloaded and shooting could commence. The result, ROPE, made for an 'interesting' film. i don't believe it did supergreat box-office-wise, but it was an interesting innovation. the film was a bit like a clever play, and it seemed a bit long for its 80 minutes. However, this was Alfred Hitchcock, and the plot line and much of the dialogue kept audiences interested. I mention this earlier film as a comparative to Timecode. Timecode's basic technique is innovative. it's clever, stylish and carries its urban ambiance quite well. However, the technique of dividing the screen into four quadrants, and having our attention (presumably) manipulated to focus on certain sections at certain times, comes off as annoying and gimmicky. it is annoying partly because when the one panel is being auditorally underlined, at least one other panel is still having something important going on, which creates distraction. also, sometimes, perhaps because of the real-time and improvisatory aspects of the film, there isn't always something that interesting going on in one of the panels. I became really tired of watching jeanne tripplehorn listen and smoke. this isn't acting; at least not in a truly cinematic way. it reminded me of off-off Broadway plays in the VIllage or some kind of Andy Warhol film-art-commentary piece. The acting on the whole was fairly good..not overwhelming...the only standouts really were Selma Hayek as Rose, and Stellan Skarsgaard was good as Alex. A lot of the other actors seemed to be playing quirky instead of compelling..it reminded me of some of the actors in SLACKER. of course, in that movie, you were fully able to hear what was going on, and it did move in a calmer linear fashion. also, i don't think Linklater was trying to take his characters half as seriously as Figgis does for this film. Still, i can say that this film is an improvement over The BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. the one common trait both films share is that Mr. Figgis wants us to truly believe and feel for his characters. that is a bit of a challenge in BLAIR where everyone seems overcome with hysteria in what was hyped as a 'real' film about witches. this kind of manipulation doesn't make the viewer trust the director when it comes to his intentions.

I became really tired of watching jeanne tripplehorn listen and smoke. this isn't acting; at least not in a truly cinematic way. it reminded me of off-off Broadway plays in the VIllage or some kind of Andy Warhol film-art-commentary piece. The acting on the whole was fairly good..not overwhelming...the only standouts really were Selma Hayek as Rose, and Stellan Skarsgaard was good as Alex. A lot of the other actors seemed to be playing quirky instead of compelling..it reminded me of some of the actors in SLACKER. of course, in that movie, you were fully able to hear what was going on, and it did move in a calmer linear fashion. also, i don't think Linklater was trying to take his characters half as seriously as Figgis does for this film. Still, i can say that this film is an improvement over The BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. the one common trait both films share is that Mr. Figgis wants us to truly believe and feel for his characters. that is a bit of a challenge in BLAIR where everyone seems overcome with hysteria in what was hyped as a 'real' film about witches. this kind of manipulation doesn't make the viewer trust the director when it comes to his intentions. Overall, an interesting technique. i would be curious to know if it has been used in other modern films.

Don't get me wrong, it is still a movie, not just that good.It seems to follow historical events pretty much, even though some things have been changed for dramatic effect or to save time (even though it still runs over 160 minutes). The main events in Patton's World War II career seem to be there though. What makes me doubt is that Patton seem to have only one mode, all out attack, no restraints what so ever. That may be the truth, and a correct depiction of the real Patton, but it also makes the character a bit one dimensioned, something I am sure the real Patton was not.The story doesn't add much dramatic effect or suspense either, as it is seen from either Patton's or Bradley's view, i.e. the commanding officers, not the front line troops. It may also be very accurate, but not the typical war movie.Patton's speeches and remarks do live it up a bit though, as they always add some spice to the story. From the viewpoint of the movie it is those talks that drives the story. It is both a little funny, and maybe the most dramatic that's in there. The situations his words put him into are quite tense and lends some suspense to a story.In conclusion you could say it is a biographical drama.

There are two reasons this movie started and continues in this way. Firstly, it released in the year 1999. This end of a decade was quite the year for movies, with such highly popular or critically acclaimed as American Beauty, The Blair Witch Project, American Pie, Fight Club, The Green Mile, The Mummy, Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me, and The Sixth Sense, not to mention the international blockbusters The Matrix and Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace.The second reason is that Bringing Out The Dead is one of those rare films that causes viewers to be unsure of how they're supposed to feel about it. It is a difficult film to appreciate. With a title inspired by a skit from Monty Python And The Holy Grail and a number of scenes joining desperation and death with humor and an easygoing nature - a scene involving a suicidal man with a broken battle played to a popular radio tune from R.E.M. comes to mind - the film often seems to want us to see the hope in hardship, and sometimes vice versa.The story revolves around Nicolas Cage's character, a paramedic, serving calls of distress and medical attention across New York City. There is no real sense of a story, but instead a progression of Cage's mental condition as he strides and shambles through his life. The chief accomplishment and enjoyability of Bringing Out The Dead is in it's characters and their dialogue. Aside from Cage, who arguably gives the best performance of his career, every actor gives their best. The only performance that seems off is that of Patricia Arquette's as Cage's 'romantic' interest. In turn, however, this could be argued as purposeful, since the entire relationship between the two may have been meant to be slightly 'off'.one of the film's strongest points is its thematic elements. Humanity, being the most central theme, is given a unique perspective. while there is a strong emphasis on pain and regret, much of the time the film keeps a balance with less heart-wrenching scenes. Often, the role of the supporting cast leaves opportunity for laughter (or at least a smile) when the dramatic moments aren't taking place, effectively helping to create a film of close opposites. The other point of strength is its visual power. much of the film creates an atmosphere of gradual depression mixed with slight insanity. For example, in a fantastic segment played in pseudo-reverse, Cage's character is seen pulling seemingly dead people out of the ground.Despite some minor suggestions to the incredulity of New York's residents, the film never truly goes over the top, or bottom out.

When she discovers some unwanted cargo, things only go from bad to worse, in true Alien fashion.Alien³ is as undoubtedly famous for being director David Fincher's (Fight Club) first film, but also for its troubled production that resulted in a compromised and ultimately messy film.

Well, it works both ways. &#x96; NarratorWhile it flopped upon its initial release and received Luke-warm reviews at best, Fight Club has worked its way over the years to becoming perhaps the biggest and best cult film of all time. Directed by David Fincher (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) the film is as famous for its unique visual style as it is for its nihilistic and dark comedic tone. Its tale of anarchy was, in a way, a refreshing slap to the face of the mainstream, which is what makes it such a beautiful and unique film, and it still holds up just as well today, over ten years later.Starring Edward Norton as the Narrator, Fight Club tells the story of a man living in a sterilized environment, suffering from insomnia and yearning to unleash his pent-up angst. He doesn't know why he can't sleep and perhaps he is going crazy, but things only get more interesting when he stumbles upon an interesting character in Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who essentially resembles everything he himself is not. United, they take to the underground and form a fight club where grown men can come and pummel the snot out of one another in good fun. Things take a turn for the worse, though, when Tyler's plans get out of hand and a troubled woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) comes between the two conflicted personalities.The film is drawn from a bold novel by Chuck Palahniuk and is about as anti-Hollywood as a major studio film can be. Edward Norton breaks through in perhaps his finest role to date, capturing all the humor and melodramatic baggage that comes with the character exquisitely, while Brad Pitt gets a chance to go over the top in a way that few actors can handle. The film is over two-hours long, but is paced just right so that you lose track of time and feel immersed in the narrative each and every time. No doubt, it's one of Fincher's finest films and one of the best examples of film in the 1990's.

However, while subsequent entries in most horror franchises prove generally capable of matching up to the less than lofty demands of their predecessors, when following a film as universally revered as Spielberg's aquatic classic, inevitable shortcomings would seem near inevitable. However, shortcomings are one thing, but it would hardly seem too much to ask that a sequel at least muster the effort to generate a plot not exactly identical to that of its predecessor, but it would appear director Jeannot Szwarc somewhat missed the boat on said front, making Jaws 2 nothing more than a pale carbon copy at best.The real problem is that mirroring the exact narrative template of the first Jaws (shark arrives to terrorize Amity Island, Chief Brody's demands to close the beaches during busy tourist season lead to his isolation, but he is forced to protect the town against the shark regardless) comes across as ludicrous as well as lazy, making the town's unwillingness to take the shark threat seriously in the wake of the previous tragedy an almost farcical affair (a trope which could have been exploited for poignantly troublesome social critique in more capable hands). Furthermore, Swarc's plundering from Spielberg's film manages to neglect the original's interesting supporting characters (instead offering a tiresomely banal subplot involving the town teens, including Brody's sons), technical prowess and infectious sense of heart &#x96; in short, the attributes which made the original such an abiding classic. Instead, the flimsiness of the plot comes across as even more of an overt excuse for thrills, this time gorging on cheap shocks rather than the tastefully taut tension of its predecessor. Similarly, while Spielberg's unconvincing shark prop led to his genius innovation of largely hiding it from the audience, thus amplifying the sense of threat and dread, Swarc blithely exhibits his antagonist freely, undercutting any sense of threat by the sight of the visibly fake shark lumbering through the water like a rubber toy dragged by a string (particularly when drowsily attacking an aeroplane, an unfeasibly, 'need-to-see-it-to-believe-it' low point) and providing too docile and dopey an antagonist (apart from the fleeting excerpts of admittably thrilling real shark footage) to generate much fear, or much of a point.Nonetheless, in spite of such ample complaints, there remains a particular elusive charm about the film which remains somehow sufficient to continue to win the viewer's interest throughout. To his credit, Swarc gamely instills his film with a much needed sense of self-effacing humour (when Brody speculates on the latest shark attack being related to the previous incident at Amity, a marine biologist sternly replies sharks don't take things personally, Mr. Brody &#x96; if only she had been around to inform those responsible for the monstrosity that is Jaws The Revenge), and generates a scattering of actual thrills and scares in the midst of shoddy special effects and mishandled emotional directing. Similarly, the film's script is (surprisingly enough) a relatively quality fare, counterbalancing the action with human drama well (albeit at a tryingly sluggish pace) and coughing up memorable lines here and there in the midst of things. While the film falls easily short of conventional movie-making standards, let alone the standards of the first Jaws, it is this strange sense of quirky charm and scattershot quality which somehow keeps it from warranting outright dismissal, particularly in the wake of the two downright abysmal further sequels to follow.While his return as gruffly lovable Police Chief Brody may have been ill-advised, Roy Scheider manages to be the film's single best attribute, rekindling an impressive quantity of the charisma, cheeky humour and surprising potential for grave drama (his drunken 'celebration' turned miserable self-reproach upon his being fired is viscerally affecting and memorable)which made him such a compelling protagonist in the first place. It is a pity that none of the rest of the cast can match up to his level, as most returning characters such as Lorraine Gary as Brody's long suffering wife and Murray Hamilton as the slightly more sympathetic yet still greedily tourism oriented Mayor appear largely on autopilot, offering bland and listless reprisals of previously intriguing characterisations. However, the worst is the film's excessive focus on the town teens (likely vying for a 'young, hip' viewing demographic), as the collection of stereotypical and uninspired performances and writing alike prove one of the film's greatest disservices.While it is easy to imagine Jaws 2 functioning as a perfectly functionable and mildly entertaining disposable suspense\/adventure thriller in a cultural vacuum, its inexcusable re-hash of the framework of the first film make the rampant similarities far too irksome to properly appreciate the film's paltry collection of strengths. Nonetheless, the clunky but slightly more lighthearted retread of its predecessor makes Swarc's film an amiable watch nonetheless, but one in which the question why am I not watching the 'good' Jaws? is bound to inevitably surface countless times.-5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Just when you thought it was safe to trust that the newly founded 'blockbuster' film (a concept born from the incredible financial success of Steven Spielberg's classic Jaws) could justify its massive popularity by balancing a penchant for thrills and excitement with genuinely quality storytelling and vivid, compelling character development... of course there had to come the sequel.

The main villain of the film however is S.P.E.C.T.R.E.'s no. 2 Emilio Largo, played by Aldofo Celi. He is a relatively uninteresting villain but Celi's performance is satisfactory. Connery is again good as Bond and the character feels more like he did in Dr. No and From Russia With Love after feeling somewhat diluted in Goldfinger. This is the last time Connery would even appear interested in playing 007, so lap it up. Claudine Auger as Bond's squeeze Domino gets the job done and looks very nice indeed. Felix Leiter appears, again, and is played by a different actor than before, again. Rik Van Nutter contends with Norman Burton from Diamonds Are Forever as having the worst performance as the C.I.A. operative. He is completely useless and Bond even talks down to him and shuts him up. I don't know what it is with this character but the filmmakers just seem to want to make him look like a buffoon for the most part.Much of Thunderball's time is spent underwater as people dive and this is where the film really falters. The entire 20 minute action sequence leading up to the films' finale is nearly unwatchable as there is too much going on, too many henchman swimming around thus rendering it impossible to tell who is who and who is doing what and it is too damn dark to try and make any sense of it anyway. Young really seems to have lost his touch when it comes to action, although there is quite a good scene earlier in the film when Bond is thrown into a swimming pool full of sharks. All of the Bond films up until this point had utilised the idea of speeding up the film after the fact to make things (cars, fights etc) appear to be moving faster than they really are. It is an old fashioned editing technique which is sometimes distracting but I often find it charming for some bizarre reason I cannot explain. This technique is used far too much in Thunderball however, especially in the climax as Bond and Emilio scrap on the bridge of a boat. It really takes you out of the scene and to be honest, I laughed. It looks crap, enough said.It's not all bad though and Young's direction, while not as good as it had been previously, coupled with Connery's presence is enough to keep things moving along nicely during the first two acts.

Felix Leiter appears, again, and is played by a different actor than before, again. Rik Van Nutter contends with Norman Burton from Diamonds Are Forever as having the worst performance as the C.I.A. operative. He is completely useless and Bond even talks down to him and shuts him up. I don't know what it is with this character but the filmmakers just seem to want to make him look like a buffoon for the most part.Much of Thunderball's time is spent underwater as people dive and this is where the film really falters. The entire 20 minute action sequence leading up to the films' finale is nearly unwatchable as there is too much going on, too many henchman swimming around thus rendering it impossible to tell who is who and who is doing what and it is too damn dark to try and make any sense of it anyway. Young really seems to have lost his touch when it comes to action, although there is quite a good scene earlier in the film when Bond is thrown into a swimming pool full of sharks. All of the Bond films up until this point had utilised the idea of speeding up the film after the fact to make things (cars, fights etc) appear to be moving faster than they really are. It is an old fashioned editing technique which is sometimes distracting but I often find it charming for some bizarre reason I cannot explain. This technique is used far too much in Thunderball however, especially in the climax as Bond and Emilio scrap on the bridge of a boat. It really takes you out of the scene and to be honest, I laughed. It looks crap, enough said.It's not all bad though and Young's direction, while not as good as it had been previously, coupled with Connery's presence is enough to keep things moving along nicely during the first two acts. Despite having a rather boring finale and not much of a villain Thunderball still manages to settle somewhere midtable in my overall Bond rankings. Tom Jones' title song is one of my favourites, maybe that has something to do with it. Make no mistake though; this is 007 at his most mediocre.

Truly amazing. I know that the plot doesn't sound that interesting, but it's a great film. Paul Thomas Anderson has done some of the best films I have ever seen. I mean the man is a genius. His films are occasionally funny, very dramatic, and at times kind of odd.Boogie nights is one of those films. The film focuses on a high school drop out bartender named Eddie(played fantastically by Mark Whalberg). One night, a porn director named Jack(Played fantastically by Burt Reynolds) offers him a job. At first he doesn't accept it. Thewn the next day he gets to know the cast, and has sex. Then once he gets home his mom freaks out on him. So Eddie runs away. So after that Eddie goes to meet Jack and the cast. You get to know the cast. William H. Macy plays a guy who has been cheated on three times. Don Cheadle plays a guy who is trying to get into a stereo business. John C.Reilly plays an actor on set. Julianne Moore plays an actress that is fighting in a custody battle for her son. Eventually, Eddie comes up with his own porn star name Dirk Diggler. Also, Dirk becomes very famous. Winning many adult film awards including best cock and best actor. But as his career continues, his life begins to fall apart. Once everyone quits the business, their lives fall apart. Their lives are ruined by porn.I love the film's soundtrack. I also love how it shows how ridiculous the porn industry is. I also love how the film has a very happy ending. I still have yet to see Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard eight and Magnolia. Where I have I been for the past couple of years. These are amazing movies. how could this movie not be nominated for best picture? It was amazing.

Boogie nights A ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"26 January 2010","score":"","review":" Lewis Gilbert returns to the series and while his first effort, You Only Live Twice, was a bland and plodding affair he manages to keep things afloat in The Spy Who Loved Me. The opening sequence is probably the best of the series, with a fast and frenetic ski chase culminating in Bond diving off a cliff before deploying a parachute. Things do start to falter in final act however, the extended action scene feels slow and poorly edited although it features some impressive stunts. Possibly the most memorable image from the film is the Lotus Esprit turning into a submarine. This is typical of Gilbert's camp and over the top sensibilities although it isn't too bad here as it follows a rather good car chase on land before going underwater for laughs.Roger Moore is again on good form as Bond and has a particularly cold blooded scene as he essentially throws a man off a rood after interrogating him. He purposefully drops another henchman, Jaws, into a tank full of sharks &#x96; all good stuff. The aforementioned gigantic metal-toothed henchman, played by Richard Kiel, makes his first appearance in TSWLM and is quite threatening despite being somewhat ridiculous. Curd Jurgens as Stromberg is a great main villain with a particularly nasty streak. In his first scene he feeds a woman to sharks, it is a relatively disturbing scene for a PG action adventure, which is why it's so good! One of the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen,Barbara Bach , plays 007's love interest Anya Amasova, a Russian spy. It seems when they make Bond's female companion Russian they seem to cast the sexiest women imaginable, Bach and Daniela Bianchi from From Russia With Love are easily the two best looking leading Bond girls of the series. This is the first film in the franchise to feature Geoffrey Keen as the Minister of the Interior and Walter Gotell as General Gogol, both of whom would become recurring characters, although Gotell previously made an appearance in FRWL as a S.P.E.C.T.R.E agent.This is also the first film to directly address Bond's marriage to Tracy in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Amasova prods Bond with it as a way of sizing him up and Moore's 'don't talk about that' reaction is a touching, sombre moment from the man who all too often went for raised eyebrows and daft expressions.For all the good Gilbert does however, he is still the Bond director who stands out as lowering the bar when it comes to daft humour. From the 'comedy' music that plays as Bond and Amasova's van breaks down, to the double take and look at his bottle of beer a man does upon witnessing the Lotus exist the water, to the Lawrence Of Arabia music that plays as our heroes walk across a sandy plain, the film is chock-a-block full of groan-out-loud moments as the audience's intelligence is insulted with childish humour. While it is not enough to make the film as bad as say Diamond Are Forever, the sometimes grating attempts at comedy coupled with a disappointing finale make this Moore's worst entry in the series so far. Controversial that may be but I've always had a soft spot for The Man With The Golden Gun, which although I give the same star rating I feel is a more consistent and enjoyable film. TSWLM is a great outing for Moore and Bond and I feel with a more serious tone and well constructed finale it may have been Moore's best. Oh well.
