Pictures' Batman movie franchise, Batman and Batman Returns, were directed by Tim Burton and both turned out to be entertaining blockbusters for more than one reason, even if the first one is better. However, Joel Schumacher then took over to direct this third film, and unfortunately really brought the franchise down. I knew there was a movie called Batman Forever around the time it was released or very shortly afterwards, but never actually saw it until late 2005, shortly after watching its two predecessors. I can hardly remember my first viewing of this 1995 Batman flick, but can remember thinking it was mediocre, which didn't change with a second viewing nearly 4 ½ years later.Batman's latest foe in Gotham City is Two-Face, formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent. One side of his face was severely disfigured by acid, and he is now a lunatic who threatens the city and likes to make his decisions with the flip of a coin! He wrongly believes Batman is responsible for his deformation and wants the local superhero killed! After a battle between Batman and Two-Face, which ends with the villain's escape, it isn't long before another madman threatens Gotham City! Edward Nygma, a scientist who works for Wayne Enterprises, has invented a device which can manipulate human brainwaves, but the invention is too dangerous and is rejected by Bruce Wayne. This sends the scientist into frenzy, killing his supervisor, making it look like a suicide, and then quitting his job! He then creates himself an evil alter ego, the Riddler, and begins to use his invention to read the thoughts of other Gotham City residents and gain power and knowledge for his evil intentions! The Riddler also teams up with Two-Face!1989's Batman features Jack Nicholson as the Joker, a demented and comical villain portrayed very well by the actor. In 1992's Batman Returns, Danny DeVito doesn't do as good a job as Penguin, but is still impressive. After Batman Forever starts, we are quickly introduced to another goofy madman out to terrorize Gotham City, Two-Face, played here by Tommy Lee Jones. Jones' performance here is clearly supposed to be funny, but fails miserably! It seems to me that he tried too hard to be like Nicholson as the Joker, and the results were just pathetic! Sadly, Jim Carrey isn't any better as Dr. Edward Nygma\/the Riddler. This is also clearly meant for comic relief, but is also quite pathetic! I noticed a number of scenes in the film which I could tell were meant to be funny, but none of them even made me smile! Val Kilmer is okay as Bruce Wayne\/Batman I guess, but he's no match for Michael Keaton. Nicole Kidman does a rather poor job in the role of Dr. Chase Meridian, Bruce Wayne's love interest in this film, and the romantic aspect of the movie is generally poorly crafted. Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson\/Robin is another major problem. This character is an arrogant idiot who does some stupid things, such as riding around in the Batmobile and claiming to be Batman! He's SO much like the movie version of Johnny Storm in Fantastic Four, another lacklustre superhero film released ten years after this one! Schumacher might be largely responsible for the lacklustre performances in this particular film. In addition to the problems with the cast, characters, and humour, the script is also disappointing, rushing into the action too soon without properly introducing Two-Face to the audience until later, and it may sometimes be a little hard to follow.Tim Burton was one of the producers for this third installment in the Warner Bros. Batman movie franchise, but unlike the first two, he didn't direct it, and it shows. This first Batman film directed by Joel Schumacher, of two, is average at best, though some parts may be below average. There are some great visuals and sets, and I guess it is MILDLY exciting at times, but unfortunately, these are the only good things I can say about this mess, and they are far from enough to make up for everything that helps sink the film. Apparently, Robin Williams was considered for the role of the Riddler, and if that had happened, it may not have helped THAT much, but maybe at least SOME of the humour would have worked. While Jim Carrey is funny in some films, I could imagine Williams doing a slightly better job here, even with a weak script, and even if he wasn't as consistently funny as he has sometimes been. He can't save every film he appears in, but I think I would have found it hard to keep a straight face ALL the way through with him in the cast. Anyway, if you like good adrenaline-inducing comic book movies, I would say Burton's two Batman efforts are good choices, but not this one, and it only got worse with Schumacher's VERY poorly received 1997 follow-up, Batman & Robin!

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"1 April 2010","score":"","review":" Could Disney ever do wrong during their golden age? As far as their adaption of Robin Hood goes, not likely. This is an absolute gem of a film, both well-written, animated, cast and presented. It takes what is already a well-known tale and adds a real depth to it. The ageless story is presented (and the movie itself acknowledges it, to my delight) in an animal kingdom form. It follows the quest of outlaw Robin Hood as he robs from the rich and gives to the poor under the nose of tyrannical Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham. With a little help from his friends - amongst them Little John - he just might save them from the evil lion's tyranny. But of course it's not so easy - nor is his quest for the hand of the fair Maid Marian.The animation in this movie is absolutely delicious. In the leading hands of such geniuses as Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, I'm not surprised. The old-fashioned Disney style (pencil strokes quite evident) never fails to inspire me, and in fact is at its absolute height here, in my opinion. The character design and animation is all spot-on - Robin is a foxy fox, Little John is a not-at-all-little bear, Prince John is a lion, the Sheriff of Nottingham is an overweight wolf, Sir Hiss is a snake, the royal guards are rhinos and Prince John's squire is a crocodile. All these diverse characters are impeccably believable and entrancing to behold. Both Little John and Sir Hiss might be considered extensions of Baloo and Kaa in the Jungle Book (indeed, both retain their respective voice actors). However, this is only a passing reference, as both characters are strong enough to stand alone (not to mention is Little John more of a straight-man than Baloo, and much more responsible).For the animation itself as well as the whole animal setting, I'd say 5 stars are nowhere NEAR enough. The story is also fabulously written. Believabilty of the characters is stronger than in any Robin Hood incarnation that I've ever seen. You totally feel the despair of the poor people, and absolute hatred for Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham - in fact the latter is the character I personally love to loathe.However, while the story itself is quite strong, the ending is very disappointing to me. If you don't want me to spoil it for you, I strongly suggest you skip the rest of this paragraph. After a heist and a breakout of the royal jail conducted by Robin and Little John, the scene fades away from Prince John's frustration. Then when we take off again, King Richard has returned and our rooster narrator\/folk singer says that he sort of straightened everything out. Given the strong character- and story-build-up, this is NOT something I wanted to hear! The 'show, don't tell' rule that Disney were so good at following is broken here, to my immense frustration. Sure, we see the evil cronies in chains. But given all the loathsome things they do during the course of this film, I wanted to see them humiliated for all to see! By King Richard as well as the rest of the bunch. His return should have been emphasised much better, as a kind of symbol for the people that the bad days will end. The ending, as such, feels like a real anticlimax.But despite the disappointing ending, the movie itself is a quite impeccable visual work - fluid and eye-candyish 2-d animation with more charm than today's CGI-ridden features can even hope to achieve. Disney's Robin Hood signifies, to me, what animation is all about. And despite my faults with the ending, it remains one of my favourite films of all time - and a film which inspires me in my ambition to become an animator myself.

So yes, it does have some small flaws, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.OK, the good stuff now, first, there is something in this movie for everyone. It has comedy, it has romance, it has science fiction, it's a high school movie, there isn't much action, but that skateboard chase is pretty awesome. So basically if you want any of those types of movies, you will get it with this film.The characters are so much fun, and very memorable. Marty is extremely likable, Doc is hilarious, Biff is such an asshole yet you still can't help but enjoy him, Lorraine is hot, and George has some great moments. And I love the story, time travel is one of those things that has been around for years and will never get old. Everything works, and I love the little background jokes it does, like how Marty meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, goes back, knocks down a tree, and comes back and it's the Lone Pine Mall.The special effects are great, it's funny as hell, and it's just a lot of fun to watch.

(One half expects Fred the Hammer to strap one of the youths over his knee and dole out a spanking!) The young listen to horrible rap and the old listen to old soul songs. The old talk more white and the young are more into hood culture and talk slang. It may be valuable as an explication of generation gaps in black culture.The film itself is a pretty silly action film that lacks the inspiration of its 70's genre film forebears. The action takes place mostly in the dark and you cant see much of whats going on. There are some big explosions that look pretty good though. The soundtrack is made up of dated new jack stylings, not as lively or memorable as Coffy is the color of her skin or the Slaughter theme.Disappointingly, Pam Grier is given second banana status and doesn't kick that much ass, or sexily vamp it up like she did in her 70s classics. She is a dutiful member of the family\/crew.The movie explores issues of race, class, urban decay and gang violence in a ham-fisted, unconvincing way. Worth seeing for the blaxploitation completists out there, but not a priority for anyone with a passing interest in the genre.The DVD has a disappointing non-anamorphic transfer.

Take Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, two of the most venerable Hollywood stars, pair them with exciting young African-American actor Sidney Poitier, and place them in a quality film that tackles the serious subject of racism. Tracy and Hepburn portray a liberal older couple whose house is turned upside-down when their daughter Katharine Houghton shows up with her handsome physician fiancé Poitier &#x96; who she just happens to neglect to mention is African-American. Naturally, there is a lot of pontificating, hand-wringing, and misunderstandings, which only get worse when Poitier's parents arrive to discover their son's white fianceé. With all of this talent and the subject matter, it is truly sad that the first adjective one can think to describe it is quaint. For a film that consistently makes Top 10 Lists, either Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is not aging well or has always coasted on the talents on its cast and subject matter alone. There are a number of things glaringly wrong with the film, chief among them the film's insistence to play everything safe. Any time there is a risky moment, the film pulls its punches and glosses over everything with a wink and a smile, and then pats itself on the back and asks for a warm fuzzy for its effort. Racism is a very ugly subject, but no one would know that watching this film as everyone is just so darn rational and good at heart. Barring a very minor character &#x96; a co-worker at Hepburn's art gallery who tries to be snarky about the relationship while disguising it as concern &#x96; everyone is eminently reasonable. And even that woman is relatively tame, so that Hepburn's knee-jerk reaction to fire her rather than give her a simple tongue-lashing seems a bit over-the-top. How interesting it would be if of the respective parents that one of the women were dead set against the union. Yet the film plays it safe with both women (Hepburn and a dignified Beah Richards) almost immediately falling into support, while those stubborn dads just have all the issues. It seems strange that an Oscar was wasted on Hepburn for this performance in this year, which basically just requires her to smile and look beneficently on the couple with dewiness. Tracy fares much better although even he has limited notes to play with this role. Poitier has a powerful scene where he stands his ground against the antagonism, but naturally it is not to a white person (with whom he shows chronic respect) but to his father &#x96; depicted as the most unreasonable of the bunch. Speaking of Poitier, one really must credit him that he is saddled with a character so ludicrously perfect and noble, and yet still manages to deliver a first-rate performance. In the year that he also gave us career highs in this, In the Heat of the Night and To Sir With Love, exactly why did he not warrant an Oscar nomination for any of them? Cecil Kellaway shows up as a friend\/priest, and how interesting it would have been to see a representative of the Church preaching against the union (as many Southern pastors did), but naturally and predictably he is the spirit of support. Watching this film one would think that racism was an issue of great rarity. Even more damning towards the film is that the brilliant daughter played by Houghton comes off as a total dolt. It seems inconceivable that supposedly intelligent young people in the late 1960s in a relationship would never mention to their respective parents that their intended is of another race and would fail to anticipate the reaction of an older, less enlightened generation &#x96; yet that is what the film would have us believe. Tracy does make a strong point in that his concerns rise from whether his daughter has truly given thought to the obstacles an inter-racial couple would be facing &#x96; an issue with some merit since Houghton often comes across as mentally challenged. Any successful interracial marriages of the period certainly started with couples who knew the many obstacles facing them, but Houghton does not seem to acknowledge ANY obstacles, seems oblivious to the environment surrounding her and appears to have sprung that morning from a hermetically sealed bubble. It is incredible to imagine that she has engaged in any kind of serious discussion&#x85;on anything. So what we end up with is a quaint, pleasant film about racism with a tone so light and frothy that it about floats away featuring idealized people whose inherent prejudices can easily be overcome by the sight of two youngsters in love. Even in the 1960s it seems that only on another planet could this be characterized as daring.

The film is as beautiful as it is ugly, as hideous as it is intriguing, and without a doubt, will crawl under the skin of even the most desensitized genre fan. It's a film that is as much about the ugliness of death as it is about human nature and the evil that lurks within each and every one of us.In the film, Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves into a new house with his new wife, Julia (Clare Higgins), and daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), without knowing that the soul of his seedy brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), is trapped within the house after solving a mysterious puzzle box. Once he gets a taste of the red stuff, Frank starts to take shape again, resuming his affair with his brother's wife and unwittingly opening the doors to Hell in the meantime while simultaneously introducing a gaggle of bizarre creatures known only as the Cenobites. The Cenobites are led by Doug Bradley as Pinhead, who, despite not being given a name until the sequel, cemented himself as a horror icon along with the Freddys and Jasons of the time and gets perhaps the best lines of the entire film. Clive Barker is truly a Master of Horror in his own right, and Hellraiser is a brilliant testament to that fact. Not only are the special effects grisly and, well, gross, but still manage to hold up even today, 23 years later. The film is grounded in solid performances by its cast, and especially in the case of Clare Higgins, are more than one-dimensional horror flick fodder. All of this is achieved, of course, with stunning visuals (gore aside) and a foreboding and cruel tone that just can't be beat. Even after all these years and seven sequels ranging from entertaining to mediocre, its impact has yet to be lessened. Hellraiser is easily one of the best horror movies of the 1980's, but also of all-time.

The film is as beautiful as it is ugly, as hideous as it is intriguing, and without a doubt, will crawl under the skin of even the most desensitized genre fan. It's a film that is as much about the ugliness of death as it is about human nature and the evil that lurks within each and every one of us.In the film, Larry (Andrew Robinson) moves into a new house with his new wife, Julia (Clare Higgins), and daughter from a previous marriage, Kirsty (Ashley Laurence), without knowing that the soul of his seedy brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), is trapped within the house after solving a mysterious puzzle box. Once he gets a taste of the red stuff, Frank starts to take shape again, resuming his affair with his brother's wife and unwittingly opening the doors to Hell in the meantime while simultaneously introducing a gaggle of bizarre creatures known only as the Cenobites. The Cenobites are led by Doug Bradley as Pinhead, who, despite not being given a name until the sequel, cemented himself as a horror icon along with the Freddys and Jasons of the time and gets perhaps the best lines of the entire film.

A film that holds you tight in its embrace, and a film whose embrace you WANT to remain in. It's an intense, fascinating cinematic experience, one so exciting and oddly beautiful that I am finally ready to call it one of those movies I love most. Hopkins knew what he was doing, and this has to be one of his most underrated works. But then, the number of awards is not what speaks volume about a movie; it's the content, and The Ghost and the Darkness delivers it in volumes. Fourteen years on, only The Edge challenges it in the true fleshing out of terrifying animal personalities.In 1898, Irish Colonel John Patterson is sent to the river Tsavo, Africa, to construct a railroad bridge - forcing him to leave his pregnant wife behind in London. Upon arriving in Africa, Patterson learns of a rampant lion on the loose. He quickly manages to kill it, raising the morale of the workers. This, however, proves to be entirely deceptive. Soon after, two male lions start to prey on the workers - chillingly, they appear to kill for sport rather than food. All efforts to stop them are in vain until hunter Charles Remington arrives to help Patterson rid Tsavo, and the workers, of this threat. But the lions (called the Ghost and the Darkness by the workers) are smart, and disposing of them won't be easy even with Remington in league.This premise is based on a real-life account by John Patterson, and it was practically destined for a movie adaptation. While it is quite true that the movie differentiates on Patterson's account in many ways (Remington is entirely fictional), it's all for the benefit of this film. The actual lions were maneless, yet for the sake of the movie's aesthetics, the fully-maned lions (Bongo and Caesar) strike a more impressive image. The easiness with which the lions kill is also a tad exaggerated, but then, again, the film is all the more suspenseful for it.Quite frankly, I have never seen more beautiful filmwork on lions. The cinematography of this movie is fantastic. One of the scenes in particular - where we first truly see one of the lions kill and eat a worker before our very eyes - is fabulously staged and filmed. In fact, it's one of those movie moments that have edged themselves permanently into my memory - the most artistic, even beautiful piece of animal gore film-making you could find (nothing too queasy). The movie deservedly won an Oscar for Best Sound Editing (the lions's growls, roars and chomps send shivers down my spine for one), and the African-flavoured score by Jerry Goldsmith is wonderful.While it may not be as memorable as the aforementioned, the acting is more than acceptable. John Patterson may be Val Kilmer's most underrated and misunderstood performance; he delivers the role with an understatement that fits the brooding nature of the character. His very subtle Irish accent, possibly heavily affected by a long servitude of Britain, is another trait he gets across very well. Remington is endlessly entertaining and the two characters work together like magic. John Kani and Brian McCardie are both solid as faithful co-leader Samuel and missionary Angus Starling. Emily Mortimer's Helena Patterson cannot be overlooked, either; her few scenes are enough to demonstrate the strong relationship between her husband and her.It's the lions, though, who are the stars. It is about thirty minutes into the film when tG&tD really reels you in. One lion attacks and kills a workman in the middle of the day, in the middle of a group of working men. Patterson and his trusty associates rush to the scene, but by then it's too late. As they approach the lion, the lion is eating the man, viscerally and clearly, before our very eyes. This is a sequence that you would think would make you sick, but, frighteningly, it does the exact opposite. It is an intensely beautiful scene; the lion's roars, chomps and ecstatic growls make me tremble as I watch, glued in my seat. The sequence is hardly over a minute in length, and it's still incredibly strong. The visceral nature of the scene coupled with the lion's intense and undeniable beauty make him the undeniable attraction, even when you learn of the lions' more sinister nature later in the film, which even then is questionable. It's hard for the lions even to emerge as villains, and they remain enigmatic and frightening, yet somehow admirable. Few films have made me as torn about its characters as The Ghost and the Darkness. Starring as the lions are Bongo the lion (RIP) and Caesar, and they do it fantastically, the beautiful beasts they already are.If there is one thing I can criticise, it's the editing. Occasionally, quick shots are shared between two scenes at different points in the film. There are moments when the staging reveals itself to be flawed, in particular the hospital attack scene. The cutting disrupts the continuity and flow of the scene rather than supports it. Also, I think there were sometimes too many close-ups on the lions and not enough middle shots to make us really believe in their size and strength.Despite the savageness, the lions and their attacks are almost sophisticated to behold, and it's perhaps this that's the most thrilling aspect of the film. The Ghost and the Darkness is, on all accounts, a cool film - and there's nothing wrong with that. More than that, though, this is the best enactment of lion attacks you could find in a movie, and I myself have never seen more aesthetic filmwork on lions. Could be a little concrete, but definitely worth a view, for beauty as well as excitement.

The film is one of the most depressing, unsympathetic movies I've seen. There are maybe two comedic moments, the rest of the movie is just mean. Samuel L. Jackson has a disease that makes it so his bones break easily. Bruce Willis is stuck in a stupid job with a wife he is considering divorcing, and this causes major distress in their son. And then Bruce Willis is in a train accident, and this is all in the first 5 minutes. You see, this is why Signs works, not only is Signs one of my favorite movies of all time (don't listen to Doug Walker), but it's one of the best thrillers ever made, in my opinion. Because it added comedy to balance the horrible stuff that was happening. Like the author of the book being named Bimboo and the fact that they use aluminum helmets to stop the aliens from reading their minds. In my opinion Lady in the Water is Shyamalan's worst because that film also doesn't have much comedy, but that film has other problems. People say the Happening went too far on the comedy, but I think that film had an even balance, for a b- movie. In fact weren't people complaining that The Last Airbender took itself too seriously, Last Airbender had a few more comedic moments than people remember, and there wasn't as much horrible stuff happening, and that movie had an entire race of air nomads being wiped out. Going back to Signs, one of the problems people have is that the aliens were allergic to water, it was their poison, so why come to a planet in which the air is water? Personally I think that's a stupid argument, especially if you like any of the versions of The War of the Worlds. In which the aliens are killed by bacteria, which is also everywhere. But for those people (Doug Walker) why do you defend this movie. Bruce Willis' weakness is water, so since the air is water, why doesn't it weaken him, I'm not saying kill him, but why not weaken him so he is, well, Breakable? Like I said, doesn't bother me, but I know it should bother some people. I'm not going to say the twist ending stunk, but once again, it just depressed me. For a few minutes, Bruce Willis is happy, but then, nope, no more. One more thing, why is it that Willis sees a woman rob a jewelry store and a man rape someone and not do anything about it, I mean he saw that the drug dealer (played by Shyamalan himself), and tried to stop him before this, and saw that man break into a house after wards, so why not stop them. What really ticks me off is when people call this film underrated, I consider a film underrated when when it either doesn't make much money, it gets more hate than it deserves, or people don't talk about it. Well the film made over $200,000,000. It got a 68% and a 7.3, and people talk about it, a lot of people, calling it underrated. Shyamalan was never the best writer (even with Sixth Sense, seriously any one can not say SPOILERS Bruce Willis is dead, but it took a great director to hide that fact), but he is one of my favorite directors. The film overall looks amazing, the actings not bad, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the premise is absolutely amazing, but the story, while still OK is overrated.

Like the author of the book being named Bimboo and the fact that they use aluminum helmets to stop the aliens from reading their minds. In my opinion Lady in the Water is Shyamalan's worst because that film also doesn't have much comedy, but that film has other problems. People say the Happening went too far on the comedy, but I think that film had an even balance, for a b- movie. In fact weren't people complaining that The Last Airbender took itself too seriously, Last Airbender had a few more comedic moments than people remember, and there wasn't as much horrible stuff happening, and that movie had an entire race of air nomads being wiped out. Going back to Signs, one of the problems people have is that the aliens were allergic to water, it was their poison, so why come to a planet in which the air is water? Personally I think that's a stupid argument, especially if you like any of the versions of The War of the Worlds. In which the aliens are killed by bacteria, which is also everywhere. But for those people (Doug Walker) why do you defend this movie. Bruce Willis' weakness is water, so since the air is water, why doesn't it weaken him, I'm not saying kill him, but why not weaken him so he is, well, Breakable? Like I said, doesn't bother me, but I know it should bother some people. I'm not going to say the twist ending stunk, but once again, it just depressed me. For a few minutes, Bruce Willis is happy, but then, nope, no more. One more thing, why is it that Willis sees a woman rob a jewelry store and a man rape someone and not do anything about it, I mean he saw that the drug dealer (played by Shyamalan himself), and tried to stop him before this, and saw that man break into a house after wards, so why not stop them. What really ticks me off is when people call this film underrated, I consider a film underrated when when it either doesn't make much money, it gets more hate than it deserves, or people don't talk about it. Well the film made over $200,000,000. It got a 68% and a 7.3, and people talk about it, a lot of people, calling it underrated. Shyamalan was never the best writer (even with Sixth Sense, seriously any one can not say SPOILERS Bruce Willis is dead, but it took a great director to hide that fact), but he is one of my favorite directors. The film overall looks amazing, the actings not bad, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the premise is absolutely amazing, but the story, while still OK is overrated.

The film is one of the most depressing, unsympathetic movies I've seen. There are maybe two comedic moments, the rest of the movie is just mean. Samuel L. Jackson has a disease that makes it so his bones break easily. Bruce Willis is stuck in a stupid job with a wife he is considering divorcing, and this causes major distress in their son.

Regardless, the film is a strange beast; a piece that straddles a line between some rather absurdest material, of which additionally carries a genuinely comedic undercurrent with out and out farce blended in with sequences of rather unbalanced horror. It would be true to say the film feels a little longer than the runtime reads, but such is the achievement of this addition of Alice in Wonderland, that items and specific content such as those explored within would come across as broader than usual.The tale sees a young blonde girl named Alice (Beaumont), who sports a light blue dress that brings out her eyes underneath a white apron-like piece of clothing, go on a sporadic journey through a place of both unearthly delights and horrors, the beautiful; the unreal and the terrible of what this strange and distorting place has to offer. It would appear that Alice's Wonderland is, in fact, the real world, but diluted through the viewpoint of a ten or so year old girl of whom is still living within a pretty sheltered existence. We begin with the titular character sitting in a tree, daring to dream about another life; another existence away from the authoritarian rule of an elder relative and her reading of an educational book Alice must pay attention to. Alice lusts for escape, for adventure &#x96; I suppose a shifting away from the family and these authoritarian individuals; in doing so, dreaming of her own world of nonsense in which she can get away to. The rest of the film seems to be a process of humbling, a process that sees her at one point hit the lowest of lows as sadness and desperation settles in. If Alice's circular journey teaches her anything, it's that one's lust for individuality and release into another world away from one's peers is a bigger deal than one thinks and ought not be taken lightly.I'm unaware of the structure of the book and the process in which the interactions are unfolded, specifically in what order, but this 1951 adaptation includes a short piece very early on entitled The Walrus and the Carpenter, something that I read appeared in an altogether different Alice fable. In including so early this text-within-a-text, co-directors Clyde Geronimi and Wilfred Jackson capture the essence of the entire piece; something that can be read into as a frustrating laying out of the cards for all to see so early on or a clever inclusion from another piece altogether foreshadowing the arc of Alice's adventure. That is to say, a premature leaving of one's homely 'safe zone'; the ignoring of parental, indeed family-driven, advice as well as the allure of following something, or someone, of great exuberance and eccentricity into whatever rabbit hole or there-other. The emphasis on Alice's inability to quite understand the short story that the two Brummie twins deliver only highlights Alice's ignorance to her situation; something that will get worse before it gets better.In addition to this, it precursors Alice's interaction with The Queen, as the hapless individuals at the centre of the twins' tale documents their eventual decline in well-being to an over exuberant and powerful figure. Granted, the item that led Alice away from her natural state is a white rabbit, but the rabbit's association with The Queen and her quarters aids in drawing on parallels with the oysters and their doomed interaction with the Walrus. But a lot of Alice's flitting interactions are interesting, even if few of them carry as much substantial weight as the one with the two twins and their poem. The film will jump from content which emotes laughs to other such content that is just creepy and of an absurdest, horror driven nature; but it's a series of jumps that are handled deftly. The tea party scene, in particular, is a quite wonderful demonstration of physical comedy between two parties; one of whom is a lost wandering soul that doesn't belong where she is, with the other made up of two individuals in the shape of The March Hair (Colonna) and The Mad Hatter (Wynn), of whom are so wildly insane that they don't seem to belong anywhere.In its final throw of the dice, the film will use a newfound area of antagonism from the character of The Queen of Hearts (Felton) in order to propel Alice through a grinder and give her a reason to arrive at some peril. The stumbling into this final act driven purely by curiosity for what the white rabbit's purpose is, an introductory sequence in which Alice merrily joins in painting The Queen's roses with three minions and appears to be uncannily able to hear some instrumental music which the servants sing along to, yet gives us no reason to assume it ought to be diegetic. Regardless, the film services on a comedic level which in turn sits well with all the surrealist driven horror stuff such as smoking caterpillars and talking flowers; while Alice's own arc in realising that the coming of age process need not be rushed given the original circumstances she lived under, is satisfying in its own right.

The tea party scene, in particular, is a quite wonderful demonstration of physical comedy between two parties; one of whom is a lost wandering soul that doesn't belong where she is, with the other made up of two individuals in the shape of The March Hair (Colonna) and The Mad Hatter (Wynn), of whom are so wildly insane that they don't seem to belong anywhere.In its final throw of the dice, the film will use a newfound area of antagonism from the character of The Queen of Hearts (Felton) in order to propel Alice through a grinder and give her a reason to arrive at some peril. The stumbling into this final act driven purely by curiosity for what the white rabbit's purpose is, an introductory sequence in which Alice merrily joins in painting The Queen's roses with three minions and appears to be uncannily able to hear some instrumental music which the servants sing along to, yet gives us no reason to assume it ought to be diegetic. Regardless, the film services on a comedic level which in turn sits well with all the surrealist driven horror stuff such as smoking caterpillars and talking flowers; while Alice's own arc in realising that the coming of age process need not be rushed given the original circumstances she lived under, is satisfying in its own right.

I'm not really sure what constitutes a spoiler, but nothing is too shocking or otherwise obviously I don't think. Anyway, you've been warned if you haven't seen this, cool? I'm not a movie reviewer. I don't write at all regularly, so bear with me. This film is, frankly, a movie for dumb people. The villain is so obviously apparent from the VERY beginning of the movie, simply because they're a d*ck. they act in a super cocky and snide manner, peeps on the neighbour across the street; always thinking about themselves, blows up at the drop of a hat yada yada yada. Their 'descent' (I'll use that term VERY lightly.. ) into homicidal madness is as pre-ordained as a WWE match. This is the kind of movie were infinitely complex computer software are just simple graphics that make beeps and boops and displays huge notifications on whatever is happening on the screen for even the most passive viewer to notice. the FX blew us away back in 2000, but even then it was pure cheese. That was even before it devolves into a hackneyed hack and slash thriller, with a LOT of CGI, swingin' dong. Go off and watch it, turn your brain off for an hour and twenty. its good for you sometimes, I guess. Still very frustrating for one who likes to this that they're not a dumb people. -Biji 1\/\/04\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 April 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" POSSSIBLE spoilers below?

I can't even increase this mess above 1 star even with the somewhat creativity in the sets and the change of ideas\/scenery from part one. I won't allow any leniency to this piece of TRASH.Anyone that complains about the poor quality (including myself) of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels should know this takes the prize in rapid decent in quality. Sure, the movie's based on violence and the acts of the stupid (cannibalism is one thing, eating your own flesh from a hanger is just plain&#x85;dumb), but beyond the blood, there's absolutely nothing. This movie is just stupid and completely evil. And I am not referring to the characters.The plot involves the family moving across Texas to wreck havoc and collecting bodies to produce&#x85;chili. Originally, when I was younger and saw this for the first time, this grossed me out. Perhaps, I've become immune, but this viewing just made it look silly.Anyways, a radio disc jockey (Williams) hears a killing and is persuaded by a renegade officer, Lefty (Hopper) to continuously replay the killing on tape on her show to draw out the bad family. It works! But to the near death of said radio employee.She's quickly introduced to the family of saws and it's up to chainsaw wielding Lefty to take down the family in an underground fantasy land.Seriously, this movie, this turd, is so full of plot holes, so full of stench it should never have been made. I only forced myself to complete the movie (I don't write reviews on uncompleted viewings of movies I watch) so I can report people need to stay away from this. I cannot believe the director of the classic original returned to direct this.There is absolutely no reason to watch this. Even if you're into this sadistic genre, there's hundreds of other films to check out. Ones with plot, acting, somewhat good dialogue, character exploration&#x85;this movie contains none of those. SKIP&#x85;it's not even for the curious.

The script is so ridicuously cliché, with it's generic characters and romance, and it's scientifically inaccurate, but not isultingly inaccurate. Also it can be boring in a few places, not too many, but the disaster scenes are a little tame compared to disaster scenes we see today.But the special effects actually hold up pretty well. I say that the twisters in this movie actually look better than the twisters in the Day after Tomorrow. The acting is really good for this kind of movie, and make some really likable characters, as generic as they are. Dusty's pretty funny, I guess it's hard not to like someone who's crazy over tornadoes. The villain is such a douchebag that you can't wait for him to get his due. But the one thing I really liked is that the movie didn't villify Melissa. Think about it, they could have made her a horrible person that hated every member of the team, and maybe even gave away secrets to Jonas, but she didn't.Twister is another example of a flawed but fun disaster movie.
