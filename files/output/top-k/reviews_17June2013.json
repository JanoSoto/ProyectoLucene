[{"date":"17 June 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jason Schwartzman's performance as an overachieving prep school student generates a lot of laughs, more so than Bill Murray's role as a feckless, self-loathing school benefactor. Yet the social awkwardness and dysfunctional relationships that Wes Anderson films usually thrive on give Rushmore an atmosphere that is sadder and creepier than the director may have intended. The central relationship is between a male high school student and a female teacher, but the teacher is disappointingly reduced to a cipher and does precious little to discourage the inappropriate feelings of her pupil. Anderson would later hone and refine his craft in titles like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, movies with more colorful ensembles and less frustrating stories.
