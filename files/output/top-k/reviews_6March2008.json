As many have said before me, this film is seriously underrated and should have been given more credit than it did.It is a simple plot, really- A somewhat newly married man Bob(Micheal Keaton) has just learned that he has liver cancer in addition to the fact that his wife, Gail(Nicole Kidman), is pregnant with their first child. After dealing with the initial shock of the news of his death, Bob decides to do the best thing he could possibly do for his unborn son he makes him a video tape, going over random how-to subject matters and things relating to his personal life (i.e. how to walk in a room, how him and his wife met, how to play basketball, how to make spaghetti, etc.) Unfortunately, his doctor tells him that his death will probably take place before the birth of his son. Devastated by this news, he turns to God for help, asking him for just enough time to see the birth of his son.Also, he visits a Chinese healer, who explains to him that he is holding in some inner anger from his childhood, and that he must forgive whatever he is holding a grudge against. Turns out, his family seemed to be the main source of that anger. The best part is, it wasn't anything tragic he endured as a child. He was merely angry for things the majority of us had to deal with when we were kids- his dad always at work, his father making promises to go the circus and not carrying it out, etc. Therefore, the relationship between Bob and his family has seriously and sadly distanced over the years.I don't know if anyone will really find this comment useful, but i felt that i needed to give my input, because i felt so strongly connected to the film.In addition to the obvious message and conclusion to the film, minor aspects of it truly touched me as well. The relationship between husband and wife is picture perfect, one in which i hardly can see anymore among couples today. These two characters absolutely love each other, and they wanted to spend the rest of their lives that way. It is a relationship in which i am almost jealous of, one that i yearn for, and I hope that one day I might be able to experience such a subtle, yet devoting and loving marriage. (okay, kinda getting corny) Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman deliver amazing performances in this film. And as many have probably said before me, are very underrated. Both are capable of playing so many different characters, and each time I watch them, my admiration for them grows. Keaton, playing a man who is trying to deal with his illness and what little life he has left, trying to make the most of it, and attempting to give the best possible gift he could give to his son. Kidman, playing a pregnant wife, torn between trying to comfort her husband in his situation, but also dealing with her own sorrow and grief knowing that her husband will soon pass away.All I can say is, great movie. Not a tear-jerker w\/o any underlying message. Boy, does it mean something. This movie will connect to anyone who watches it and relates it to their own life. For me, it does in two ways- My father was gone for seven years of my childhood because he was in the navy. Therefore, as a child, I never had a father figure and maybe something as simple as a little tape where i can see him show me how to change a flat tire would have helped me. More importantly, my 6-year-old cousin died a few years ago. She was beautiful, fun, and could be annoying as hell.But just like Bob, her life was taken when it was just beginning. Just Like Bob, When she was starting to learn a few things about herself, it kind of came to an abrupt halt and she will never get the chance to continue it. I find it interesting how When Bob's life ends, his son's is just beginning. Mainly what really tugs at me about this film, just as it did with my cousin, is that life was taken from both of them when they were most happy, when everything seemed like it couldn't get better, and then their lives turned for the absolute possible worst. So....is it better that they died at one of the best times of their lives rather than the worst? sorry to get emotional, i might have gone a little further than i meant to, but I'm a 19-year-old female, and these things tend to happen a lot.

More power to them. Anyone else who actually goes out in public or has seen a real movie will laugh at this atrocity.People react to this movie the way they do another abomination, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, that is, since it looks like a good movie, and has talented stars in it, it MUST be good.Newsies has good cinematography, and the sets look realistic. So someone who has never seen a movie before would certainly be impressed, But that is all that is good about the movie.The accents are horrid, and drop in and out frequently.

Tolkien's fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings as three movies, one for each book (partitioned by publishers because of its girth), each made back to back. Usually, sequels are made only after the preceding movie has been successful. LOTR offers no such luxury, as the story is just too big for one film alone, which really left Jackson no choice but to make a block of movies at once, and pray that each one would make a profit (not to mention the fact that Tolkien's magnum opus could not be done well if squished together like ten tomatoes in a single can, and, as was the case in the publishing world, would have to be broken up so that people could take in all the detail clearly). As we all know, Jackson's gamble paid off; but are his movies as good as the massive media hype would have us believe?Of the three LOTR, The Fellowhip of the Ring is closest to Tolkien's book, and properly sets the stage for the next two stories. All of the main characters are presented smoothly, and the viewer becomes acquainted with them over time and comes to appreciate the struggles they have to go through. The novel is fat with extraneous scenes and constant references to Tolkien's broader mythology surrounding Middle Earth (Tom Bombadil is an obvious example, as are the poems concerning Beren and Luthien Tinuviel), and it is understandable that one would not want to add this as part of a movie adaptation. Jackson made a very wise choice in excising those parts in favor of a smoother, slicker pacing, and adherence to the main plot, which concerns the Ring of Power. Adherence to these otherwise superfluous scenes would have damaged the narrative on the big screen. The movie is three hours simply by focusing on the main plot, and Jackson thankfully spared us some of the more byzantine portions of Tolkien's narrative.Jackson's Fellowship is thankfully short on long, drawn-out action scenes, which was the main problem as far as fanatics of the novel and purists are concerned. This is less of the big-budget action movie the remaining two Ring films are, and more of an observation of the dark themes of the book. For this, Jackson's efforts are commendable.The acting is done quite well. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are the best in the movie as the good and evil wizards, respectively. The actors playing the hobbits are fairly decent, as are those playing the human, elvish, and dwarfish characters. They maintain their good acting skills throughout the other two films, which makes them watchable. Tolkien fans and average movie-goers will not be disappointed with this engaging fantasy movie.

Usually, sequels are made only after the preceding movie has been successful. LOTR offers no such luxury, as the story is just too big for one film alone, which really left Jackson no choice but to make a block of movies at once, and pray that each one would make a profit (not to mention the fact that Tolkien's magnum opus could not be done well if squished together like ten tomatoes in a single can, and, as was the case in the publishing world, would have to be broken up so that people could take in all the detail clearly). As we all know, Jackson's gamble paid off; but are his movies as good as the massive media hype would have us believe?Of the three LOTR, The Fellowhip of the Ring is closest to Tolkien's book, and properly sets the stage for the next two stories. All of the main characters are presented smoothly, and the viewer becomes acquainted with them over time and comes to appreciate the struggles they have to go through. The novel is fat with extraneous scenes and constant references to Tolkien's broader mythology surrounding Middle Earth (Tom Bombadil is an obvious example, as are the poems concerning Beren and Luthien Tinuviel), and it is understandable that one would not want to add this as part of a movie adaptation. Jackson made a very wise choice in excising those parts in favor of a smoother, slicker pacing, and adherence to the main plot, which concerns the Ring of Power. Adherence to these otherwise superfluous scenes would have damaged the narrative on the big screen. The movie is three hours simply by focusing on the main plot, and Jackson thankfully spared us some of the more byzantine portions of Tolkien's narrative.Jackson's Fellowship is thankfully short on long, drawn-out action scenes, which was the main problem as far as fanatics of the novel and purists are concerned. This is less of the big-budget action movie the remaining two Ring films are, and more of an observation of the dark themes of the book. For this, Jackson's efforts are commendable.The acting is done quite well. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are the best in the movie as the good and evil wizards, respectively. The actors playing the hobbits are fairly decent, as are those playing the human, elvish, and dwarfish characters. They maintain their good acting skills throughout the other two films, which makes them watchable. Tolkien fans and average movie-goers will not be disappointed with this engaging fantasy movie.

This movies is all about the Storaro's cinematography. Forget the politics of it, this movie could be about anything. In the director's commentary, Bertolucci says it was his first film he did in which he felt like an adult. However, the politics of it seem like those of a very young man, and just aren't all that relevant.Also the musical score is not remarked upon enough - utter melancholy grandeur. The highlight of it is how it is used right at the onset to the flashback to the main character's childhood.Everyone remarks about Dominque Sanda in this film, and of course you see her in subsequent Bertolucci films as well, but to me this movie is all about Stefania Sandrelli.Stefania Sandrelli dances the bossa nova (or whatever it is) by herself in her apartment near the beginning of the film. I don't know what it is about it but I could not stop watching it.Other noteworthy scenes -The ground-level shot of windblown leaves (remarked upon by many).-The static shot of the Eiffel Tower in the early morning fog as the main character is driving off to kill his professor (actually a flash forward near the beginning of the film). It only lasts like three seconds. It reminds me of an early scene in Braveheart, the first scene we see of the adult William Wallace, and he is galloping his horse in front of a mountainous background in the Scottish Highlands. That scene as well lasts like three seconds but it was when I first realized that Braveheart was a very special film (OK don't throw out the rest of this because of that comment - Braveheart Rules.) -Stefania Sandrelli and Dominique Sanda window shopping in Paris. Also I love that dog Robi, a giant Shnauzer I believe.I should also note that this is the best film dubbing I've seen in any film, and the dubbed version is to me superior to the subtitled version. I think the lead actor was actually speaking French and was dubbed anyway (not sure about that though) but dubbing is something the Italians have a lot of experience with. The dubbed version is very expressive, and also gives the film a slightly goofy attribute that I think is an asset for some reason. The film just seems much more serious in the natural languages.In all honesty, it seems as if Bertolucci kept trying to recapture the magic of this film for the rest of his career. Here is one of many examples In the final third of the film The main character goes to a dance hall with his old professor (whom he is thinking about killing) and their respective wives. The light emanating from the dance hall glows like a beacon in the dark blue Paris night as the two woman run ahead towards it. They enter and Dominque Sanda says, Its time to dance, and she and Stefania Sandrelli start dancing the Tango together. The whole sequence is incredibly beautiful and directly mirrors the final third of Bertolucci's very next film, Last Tango in Paris. So anyway, I think Bertolucci knew very well what he had in this film (as well as what he had in cinematographer Storraro). In my opinion Last Tango is so pornographic as to be unwatchable (for me anyway) but Conformist does not have that type of sensationalism we see in Bertolucci's subsequent works.Its amazing to me how in many cases a director's strongest film by far is very early in his career, and he never truly matches that accomplishment again. Another example of this is Taxi Driver which to me is by far Scorsese's strongest film, also the film of a very young man, and a film which he never really equaled again (although Goodfellas is pretty good.)

I think that Nature being Nature is often much scarier than anything the human mind can come up with (which is why the movie Outbreak did not need the Hollywood-esquire chase scenes later on -- the deadly virus was scary enough). Knowing that this movie had been made based on a story by legendary horror writer Stephen King about a rabid dog, I was intrigued. This dog wasn't possessed by evil or a mutant or of alien origin or anything like that. Just a friendly St. Bernard who got rabies and became a monster. How was King going to add his unique touch to this one? I was growing skeptical how compelling a villain could a rabid St. Bernard be and how scary a movie could they make about him?The answers are that Cujo is not a compelling villain and Cujo is not scary.Cujo is the most interesting character in the film, with the bunny he's chasing in the opening scene coming in second. (The kid was going to get an honorable mention, but I'll get to him in a minute.) The human characters are so artificial that the natural acting of the dog won my sympathy. I did not, however, ever feel scared of Cujo. I felt sorry for him. He's not mean-spirited or evil or anything like that; the poor dog has rabies and is only doing what he's doing because a bunch of tiny viruses are turning his brain into mush. He's a tragic villain, which horror villains can never be. Horror villains have to be menacing and EEEVIL or else we'll never fear them. Cujo won my heart though. Believe it or not, this movie actually made me like St. Bernards more. (Maybe I'll get one.) Now, about the characters and the story itself. First, this 95-minute film spends a solid 35 minutes setting up a bunch of stupid, clichéd subplots that serve no purpose whatsoever except to kind-of-sort-of provide a reason for a woman and her young kid to drive to the spot where Cujo happens to be. Once they get there, we're treated to an hour in which we see the same old scares over and over again. (Like I said, if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the movie. There's only so many times that a dog head-butting a window can be scary, although it didn't scare me once.) I think the film was trying to go for the claustrophobic scare, where terror is generated from the thought that the woman and her kid can't leave the car for fear of Cujo. But, we never feel that terror, mainly because Cujo simply is not EEEEEVIL. Also, having the kid screaming his head off each time the dog shows up started to feel exploitative after a while. Horror movies usually have kids in traumatic situations, but if you're going to traumatize a kid for this long, the kid better either be possessed or he better have the shining. This movie could have worked with better direction and perhaps some innovative camera-work and editing, but it lacks all of that and so it doesn't work. Frankly, had the filmmakers cut out the first 35 minutes and trimmed the rest of the film down, they would have had a decent hour-long episode of The Twilight Zone.

Richard and the books go on a quest to help return him home, and little Richard learns to face his fears.Very sweet story, wonderful casting (including the talents of Leonard Nimoy, Christopher Lloyd, Frank Welker, Patrick Stewart, and Whoopi Goldberg), and adorable animation, make this film a true gem.

It's subtle message about tolerance for diversity ought to be required viewing for those of us who make public policy and influence public opinion.Television of the Fifties seems to have fashioned an image of the American family that permeates our political views and social mores right down to today. Not that families were any better or worse during the Fifties, but the image that television created with families from Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It To Beaver, Father Knows Best, right through to the Brady Bunch seem to set impossible standards. Including a favorite of mine, the Donna Reed Show which I believe was the model for the Parker family in Pleasantville. Starting with your's truly, I don't know anyone who had an upbringing like in a TV family.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon play a pair of current teens who don't have the greatest of home lives. Maguire is a nerdy kid and Witherspoon is a very serious version of Kelly Bundy who thinks if she sleeps around, she'll be popular and hasn't much interest in education.One night while Witherspoon is running late for a date and Maguire is getting ready for a marathon showing of the popular Fifties family comedy Pleasantville the remote breaks down. As if by magic, a TV repairman played by Don Knotts shows up with a very special remote. As Witherspoon and Maguire fight over the remote by magic they are transported into the television set and become part of the self contained universe of Pleasantville. Oh, and they are in black and white as the show was taped back in the day. So with their new identities from the teenage kids of the Parker family with ideal mom and dad Joan Allen and William H. Macy, Maguire and Witherspoon seek to adjust to a new life in television land. But just the introduction of these two into this well ordered universe changes things, first in the most subtle ways and then as both realize the problems with this world in more direct ways. As the change comes, color comes slowly creeping into the black and white images. Pleasantville got Oscar nominations for Art&Set Design, Original Score, and Costume Design unfortunately not winning any. However it won Saturn Awards for Tobey Maguire and Joan Allen for Best Actor and Supporting Actress in a Science Fiction film. I prefer to think of it as a fantasy rather than a science fiction film, though I can see that science fiction certainly influenced the creation. It combines the best elements of a Star Trek TNG pair of episodes involving Data and LeForge with a holodeck character based on Professor Moriarty and how he's dealt with and an original episode involving Kirk and Spock and some of the rest of the crew landing on a planet where the philosophy of a former sage named Landru is enforced vigorously. There's a bit of the Stepford Wives here as well.In fact in the role of the head of the Pleasantville Men's Association is J.T. Walsh in a farewell performance. Such things that don't fit his ideas and those of an influential few are just not permitted in their paradise. Pleasantville is also the last big screen appearance of Don Knotts, an interesting choice for the TV repairman as he was a regular on the most wholesome Andy Griffith Show.Pleasantville is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century.

A bleak mood is all well and fine, but let's not get carried away...In fact, I checked out Hubert Selby's biography - and surprise yet another anti-American American. Last Exit To Brooklyn is also manic, laughable and designed to be controversial rather than intelligent. The fact that this talentless writer has been championed by people such as Allen Ginsberg and Henry Rollins really says it all... Henry Rollins has a brain the size of a peanut.As if it weren't bad enough that Aronofsky thought that no-one else had covered drug use in movies before - what with same-old-same-old clichés of junkies stealing, dealing, and drooling - but the movie actually uses drug addiction as a cover to criticize the medical profession and law enforcement in a way in which an ignorant, radicalized, and endlessly naive 17 year-old hippie normally would. America - as seen through the eyes of someone who is so very disillusioned with his country. That moves me to tears. Really touching. Please hand me a handkerchief, the tears are threatening to drown me! Maybe the writers should move to Zambia, Colombia, or Mongolia and see how they like it there... See what a cruel life is really all about, the spoilt whining ninnies...Requiem of a dream? Quite clearly it's the American Dream that is meant here.I have always been amazed how so many people, both Americans and non-Americans, misunderstand the idea of the American Dream. They think that in theory it guarantees everyone success and a happy and prosperous life. That's utter nonsense, of course. Only Marxists believe in such a JohnLennonian world. All four central characters in ROAD have sub-par intelligence, which is obvious from almost everything they say - and do (especially). America doesn't and cannot guarantee everyone to realize their potential, simply because some people don't have any! Every society is going to have its misfits, losers - and whiners.It's hard not to see the laughable irony in Aronofsky - a man living the America Dream, for all practical purposes - making a movie in which he proclaims the notion to be dead. However, as far as Selby is concerned, I can understand him to an extent this man had been bed-ridden and seriously ill for most of his life so I can understand how bitter that can make a person become... This is no excuse, of course.Sure the States has a health care problem, but to so one-sidedly portray all those involved in it as parasites and lunatics is going a bit too far. ROAD is also complete with the obligatory Southern racist cop who so very predictably hits Wayans for no reason and calls him a nigger. Selby's novel The Room is about evil cops imprisoning innocent people (according to liberals, a thing that happens 150,000 times a day).The only reason I gave this pretentious drama 3 points is because there was at least some attempt at experimentation (otherwise ROAT would have been an extremely dull movie) and for the very interesting soundtrack.I wasn't too thrilled with the cast picked here. Jared Leto, yet another bland androgynous midget, an always overrated Burstyn, plus I also have to question the intelligence in picking a Wayans brother - and Marlon at that! - to play in a heavy-handed drama like this.

Believe me i have seen this movie more than 25times and yet i never felt any seen as boring. For the people those who havin't watched this movie i have to say u have missed a masterpiece.

The original script for First Blood had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film, but this was changed to allow him to live, not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing. Nevertheless, someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste, because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties, plus the recently released fourth instalment.The official title of this film was Rambo First Blood Part II, but it is more commonly known simply as Rambo. It starts with the title character in jail, where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in First Blood, although this is never made too explicit. He is removed from prison by his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, for a secret mission. Rambo is to return to Vietnam to investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime. He is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy; his is to be simply a fact-finding mission.What Rambo does not realise is that he is being set up, not by Trautman, who is portrayed as brave, honourable and incorruptible, but by the organiser of the mission, a military bureaucrat named Murdock. Murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam, partly because that will improve relationships between the American and Vietnamese governments, partly because it will make his own life easier. Unfortunately for Murdock, Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner, they are also being kept in hellish conditions. Of course, he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate, and tries to rescue them. The rest of the film is more or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies (including a beautiful Vietnamese girl) and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies. Most of the evil commies, of course, end up dead, although I was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67. At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army.The tone of this film is very different from the first. In First Blood Rambo was unquestionably a criminal, even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability. In Rambo he is a bona fide all-American hero. A few years earlier the director, George Pan Cosmatos, had made The Cassandra Crossing, a biased piece of left-wing anti-American propaganda. Cosmatos, however, was nothing if not versatile, and Rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right-wing pro-American propaganda. The one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad.First Blood had its faults, but it also had its virtues. Its stance, that the anti-war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life, was a controversial one, but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war, social attitudes to war, and the roots of violence in society. Rambo, by contrast, has very few virtues, except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing. It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans who were still sore about the Vietnam war. Rambo re-fights the war single-handed, and this time the right side wins. Take that, Charlie Cong! By this point, no doubt, the film's admirers (and there seem to be plenty- more than 2,000 voters have already given it ten stars) will have concluded that I am a liberal commie-loving pinko. Far from it- in fact, I have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology. What I dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems, including ideological disputes, is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible. It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of South-East Asia or why not everyone in the region was pro-American. For all its anti-Communism, the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out themselves- except that they attributed all the world's problems to Capitalism, or Imperialism, or Revisionism, or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to. Compared to Rambo, The Green Berets was a masterly piece of political analysis. 3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2008","score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" By rights, there should never have been a First Blood Part II.

He doesn't have a good relation with his wife (Annette Bening) and his daughter (Thora Birch) hates him. After meeting Angela (Mena Suvari) his life suddenly change and he is going to feel the freedom again.American Beauty is definitely the most famous film of 1999, a year with many films that now are true modern classics. I really enjoyed this film and i think it has a great impact because it has common people as characters. A family of pretenders Lester is a good man but is really unhappy because he can't be free in his family. I think he is a good man because he feel worry about his daughter but he can't communicate that to her. His daughter his unhappy too because she can't accept herself and she is always insecure. And the mother, who has to pretend that she is happy to obtain success in her work. Finally when the three meet new persons, they feel the happiness again but those persons (Angela, Ricky and Buddy King) are three pretenders too that are having a confusing time. The scene when we confirm that Lester was a true good person in when he finally can have Angela, the girl of his dreams, but suddenly he wakes up from that dream and realize that Angela is just a child, the best friend of his daughter, and he doesn't abuse of her innocence, the innocence that Angela was afraid to show. And Lester did that because of the times when he was finally happy, the happiness that ends because of the most unhappy character in the story, Col. Frank Fits,USMC.About the cast a great performance of Spacey steals the film but the rest of the cast are good too. The performance of Mena Suvari is just memorable and Thora Birch is just good, in a minor but important character. It's a fact that Thora appears more than Mena but the scenes with Mena's character and just the most famous scenes of the film.Conclusion for me the debut film of Sam Mendes is a very well written and entertaining film with a memorable Spacey and great rock music. To call it the best thing to happen in 20 years is just overrate but definitely is a worth watching film that by now every film lover of the world have already check. 8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Lester (Kevin Spacey) is a disillusioned 40 years old man.
