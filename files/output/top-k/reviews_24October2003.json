Sure, there was Akira in 1988, but although it got a lot of mainstream support, the critics weren't at all convinced of the merits of anime. They considered it a violent cartoon for rebellious teens, nothing more. In a way, they were right too. Wings Of Honneamise never made it to the big public, and the critics disregarded it as another violent Japanese cartoon. Things didn't look to well. Along comes Ghost In The Shell. The golden trio from Patlabor 2 is present again, who thus set out to give their view on the popular manga from Masamune Shirow.Director Mamuro Oshii, who already claimed fame with the Patlabor franchise, and was already an established director in Japan, got back together with Itô and Kawai to bring one of the most popular mangas alive. The film became immensely popular, especially outside of Japan, and convinced the brighter critics that anime for the thinking man was not a utopia. Ghost In The Shell was the first arthouse anime that made it big in the West, and it would prove to be a pretty big influence for Western cinema in the future. When, in 1999, The Matrix was unleashed unto the audience, the Wachowski brothers openly admitted they were more than just influenced by Ghost In The Shell. With the coming of the final installment in the Matrix trilogy, it's a good time to take a look at where it all started.Not to say that The Matrix and Ghost In The Shell are similar films. In fact, the approach of both films is radically different. Ghost In The Shell is a slow brooding philosophical film, with only sporadic moments of action. The movie is reassembled from scenes coming from the manga. The film does tell the same basic story as the manga, but the scenes are often put in a slightly different context, to tighten things up. Not surprisingly, Oshii and company made it their own, disappointing quite a few fans from the manga, but ultimately making it a better work.The film follows the doings of Section 9, a special clean-up team that solves political problems in not so political ways. Aramaki, Kusanagi, Batou, Togusa and Ishikawa are all present again, and set out to catch the notorious Puppet Master. As a sidetrack, the film delves into the character of Kusanagi, and her struggles with defining and accepting herself as a living creature. Very little time is devoted to fleshing out the characters, and for those wanting to know all the background story, the manga is the only place to find it. Instead of focusing on character development, Oshii chose to create a world that is vaster then the operations of Section 9. A lot of time was spend on exposing scenery and outlining the possible future society.Visually, Oshii continued to explore the techniques he used to great effect in Patlabor 2. Overlaying 3D models with traditional 2D art to get smoother background scrolling and using filters to enhance certain scenes, are used to it's fullest potential in Ghost In The Shell. The traditional artwork itself is gorgeous too, with mature and detailed character designs, beautiful cityscapes and, considering the time and the complexity of the drawings, very fluid animation. Both styles are mixed seemlessly and will set the standard for many years to come.Equally impressive is the score for Ghost In The Shell. Kenji Kawai really excelled himself, and produced, arguably, his best work to date. More than just fitting the scenes, it defines them, and often forms the base of some of the better scenes. The making of a cyborg scene, the trip through the city, the car chase with the chopper and the battle against the tank are all classic scenes that are constructed on the soft ambient rhythms of Kawai. On many occasions, it feels as if the visuals were tailored to the score, instead of the other way around.The story progresses at a typical pace, with lots of dialogues and monologues, scenic shots and scarce but involving action sequences. Once the Puppet Master is caught, the film reveals it's themes, discussing AI, cyborgization and the line between technology and human life. For those who aren't really familiar with the manga, or sci-fi in general, it might be a bit much to take, and as in many of Oshii's films, there are no answers, only questions. The ending is nice, but might leave some of the viewers disappointed, as it doesn't end with a big bang, as is expected from a film.All in all, it's a typical Oshii film. Lovely atmosphere, gorgeous visuals and soundtrack, and plenty of time dedicated to exploring the theme, instead of developing the story or the characters. It's not the best anime around, although it's a much better ambassador for anime than Akira. It's not even the best Oshii film, considering the length and the fact that the end is a bit rushed. But it remains a true classic, that immerses the viewer in lush and slightly depressing future, and serves as the ideal entry piece for those willing to explore more mature anime. A must watch.

The original comic book was apparently inspired by the civil rights struggle in the U.S.A., and in the film version, there's also a hint of the McCarthy era.

The acting of the attractive characters who play the young X-men is wooden (or, more appropriately, metallic) compared with that of their elders.  The expensive special effects are also slightly cumbersome, they feel like inserted sequences.  'The Matrix' may have been empty-headed, but it set new standards for integrating computer-generated animation into the entire world of the film, and 'X-Men' rates poorly by comparison.

The cinematography was brilliant, the soundtrack was incredible, and the editing was superb. Everything fit together seemlessly.Secondly, people criticize Donnie Darko for its whole time travel thing that it has going on, and disregard it as complete rubbish. I think however, that the time travelling scenario was just a device to get across the message that the writer was trying to convey. Many times through the film we are shown the contrast between superficiality something deeper emotionally (i.e. Sparkle Motion vs. Autumn Angel, Jim Cunningham vs Donnie Darko).

I joined the West Virginia Army National Guard in the summer of 1985 when this film was first released and I have to admit I was caught up in the patriotic Rambo fever that was sweeping the country. Sylvester Stallone was sort of like a modern day John Wayne in creating a hero on screen that made us cheer for him and feel patriotic. John Rambo symbolized the Vietnam veteran that went and fought and did his all for his country and was spit on and left to stand alone when he returned. The first scene in this film is Colonel Trautman visitng Rambo in prison and offering him a chance at a pardon if he will participate in a special mission. Rambo accepts and says Sir do we get to win this time? Trautman says Its up to you. Murdock, the character that Charles Napier plays, represents the typical government beaurocrat that slept on clean sheets with a full belly while soldiers died in Vietnam because they were sent out to fight with one hand tied behind their back. He lies to Rambo about his combat experience and Rambo realizes Trautman is the only one he trusts. (Incidentally Charles Napier is a highly decorated Korean war veteran in real life). Rambo parachutes into Nam and finds there are POWS left alive, he even manages to help one escape and Murdock aborts the mission and leaves them to their fate. There is an intense scene where Trautman confronts Murdock and calls him a stinking coward covering his ass! He says you made one mistake leaving Rambo alive! There are some awesome sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. Stallone's approach to playing Rambo is like the one Clint Eastwood used in playing No Name. He uses a minimum of dialogue. However, you sense this man's inner pain that he has borne all his life. This film has some of the most graphic torture sequences ever committed to screen as they try to make Rambo talk. They get him on the radio with Murdock and he says MURDOCK I'M COMING TO GET YOU!!!! I have to admit, I cheered like everyone else when Rambo killed all the enemy and rescued the POWs. There is an intense helicopter chase before he finally fakes a crash and then blows the enemy helicopter away! (I wanted to mention one error they made in this film. Rambo uses a LAWs rocket to shoot the enemy helicopter, if he had done this in real life, he would have blown up his own copter as well because of the backblast effect.

He scares the (*&^ out of him by shoving him down on a table and stabbing his knife into it, but he only tells him There are more men out there, find them or I will find you The last scene in the film SPOILER ALERT is the best. Colonel Trautman asks Rambo what he wants and Stallone makes his longest speech I WANT WHAT THEY WANT AND EVERY OTHER GUY WHO WENT OVER THERE AND SPILLED HIS GUTS AND GAVE IT ALL HE HAD WANTS FOR OUR COUNTRY TO LOVE US AS MUCH AS WE LOVE IT THAT IS WHAT I WANT!!!! It was like he was speaking for all Vietnam vets. This is a film that makes you stand up and cheer in the end. Corny? maybe but I always remember the lyrics of the song at the end (Stallone's brother wrote them) Peace in our life\/remember the cause\/a cheer for my brothers think of them all\/home of the free, well never fall the strength of our nation belongs to us all.

As if it had to do with the primal fears of safety and survival that flow in depths of the minds of those watching the motion picture.Dirty Harry starts off with a girl diving into a swimming pool and then being caught in the cross-hairs of the sadistic killer in the film, Scorpio, and shot dead, The movie ends with Scorpio trying to go for his gun after Dirty Harry Callahan had blown it out of his hand a moment before and then being blasted by Harry's 44 Magnum and falling into the river dead. In between those two scenes director Don Siegle and actor Clint Eastwood constructed a morality play about whats wrong in America circa 1971. The criminals are too safe and the law abiding public are not thank to the liberals and the laws they passed in favor of the criminal element in this country. This was in 1971 before crimes in high places by CEO's as well as elected officials became common place in the news. If Dirty Harry were made today it would not have any impact at all on the public like it did back in 1971 and would have flopped in the box office because the public has learned a lot since then. What the public learned is that if you take the rights away from one person, no matter how guilty he may seem to be, you take the rights away from every one of us no matter how innocent we are. In the movie Harry could do no wrong, he's right in every one of his actions, in his war against the criminal element of San Francisco. His superiors, from the mayor on down, come across as gutless cowards at best or lying hypocrites at worst and make those watching the movie wonder just how they ever got elected and kept their jobs in the first place.With the danger to the public now gone Harry, in disgust, at the end of the movie throws his badge into the river where the dead Scorpio is floating, whom he had just shot. Like Gary Cooper in High Noon Harry turns his back on the society that he just saved from the likes of Scorpio and walks into the sunset leaving them to fend for themselves, because they didn't accept and appreciate what he's done for them.In short the movie Dirty Harry was really a propaganda film for less laws and more power for those in power. It was interesting to see that in only two years, at the height of the Watergate scandal in 1973, after Dirty Harry was released that it's sequel Magnum Force had Dirty Harry Callahan talking like the wimps and cowards in the first Dirty Harry movie. Harry is now in favor of letting the law and the system do it's job. Harry's enemy in that movie is a squad of vigilante cops who were nothing but Dirty Harry clones led by a corrupt police official and at one point in the movie they even invited Harry to join them which of course he refused. Thats what was the difference between the original Dirty Harry movie and the four sequels that followed it. The first took itself seriously and the others didn't. What we learned since 1971, when Dirty Harry was released, was what Benjamin Franklin said over two hundred years ago That when one gives up his rights for peace and security he ends up having neither, and so did the film makers of the Dirty Harry movies.

As if it had to do with the primal fears of safety and survival that flow in depths of the minds of those watching the motion picture.Dirty Harry starts off with a girl diving into a swimming pool and then being caught in the cross-hairs of the sadistic killer in the film, Scorpio, and shot dead, The movie ends with Scorpio trying to go for his gun after Dirty Harry Callahan had blown it out of his hand a moment before and then being blasted by Harry's 44 Magnum and falling into the river dead. In between those two scenes director Don Siegle and actor Clint Eastwood constructed a morality play about whats wrong in America circa 1971. The criminals are too safe and the law abiding public are not thank to the liberals and the laws they passed in favor of the criminal element in this country. This was in 1971 before crimes in high places by CEO's as well as elected officials became common place in the news. If Dirty Harry were made today it would not have any impact at all on the public like it did back in 1971 and would have flopped in the box office because the public has learned a lot since then. What the public learned is that if you take the rights away from one person, no matter how guilty he may seem to be, you take the rights away from every one of us no matter how innocent we are. In the movie Harry could do no wrong, he's right in every one of his actions, in his war against the criminal element of San Francisco.

While I'm not as fond of his raunchier performances, he is very endearing, otherwise, and this movie is no exception. While some have expressed dismay at his participation in this endeavor, I found his performance very refreshing as the comedic involvement, rather than Ned Beaty's whiny, unintelligible gibberings. The plot is much better than the first two installments, and actually raises this endeavor above the originals.Also, the part of Jimmy Olsen was expanded, giving Marc McClure a chance to better demonstrate his talents. Unfortunately, no one seemed to be noticing, as his movie credits are few and the parts rather obscure. And while Annette O'Toole's list of credits is much longer, her career has also been riddled with obscure, little-known parts. That is truly unfortunate, as she is a very talented and much under-rated actress. You may remember her from Stephen King's TV movie IT; she portrayed the adult character of Beverly Marsh. While this is by far my favorite of the Superman series, I am of a split mind about this movie in that the idea of a bad Superman just does not do it for me.Premise The bad guy has created a synthetic form of kryptonite, but has replaced the unknown element in the chemical make-up with tobacco tar. Okay, fine. Tobacco's bad. Got it. But it causes a split between the Lighter side of Kent and the Dark half\/Steely side of Superman and the steely side has no conscience, morals, nor empathy for anyone but himself. I found that whole episode to be rather distasteful. Yes, I understand the situation is a metaphor for the blackness\/sickness of cancer caused by tobacco, but it was still distasteful, and I was very unhappy with the whole idea.But in support of the premise, it was not exactly the fake kryptonite which split him into two distinct halves. It changed him, but it was not what divided him. That, too was a metaphor for the battle raging inside him; his better side trying to exorcise the evil side brought to light by the kryptonite. Quite intelligent, actually. I just hated seeing Christopher Reeve's character being drug through the mud like that. Aaaaand, the battle between the two was quite lame, but effective in ridding him of the dark half of himself.Meanwhile, Gus (Pryor) and the bad guy are creating a super computer in order to better utilize Gus's computer skills, to assure Ross Webster's (the bad guy's-Robert Vaughn's) success in his financial domination of the world. What? You didn't expect a world domination ploy? It's Superman! Of course there is a world domination ploy!Why, the same thing we do every day, Pinky! Try to take over the world! the Brain.I even loved the Demon Seed homage factor towards the end of the movie involving Webster's sister. Absolutely wonderful. The effects of this production are at least decent enough. This movie is a fun movie. Take off your thinking cap and just enjoy it.Fortunately, the evil twin part is over soon enough, and there are enough of the better parts of the movie to lift it above the sub-plot; ie Reeve, Kidder, and Pryor. In my opinion, this was the best Superman yet, for the inclusion of Richard Pryor! I didn't get enough of Margot, though. But in all fairness, she was also filming Trenchcoat and Pygmalion at the same time. There just was not enough of her to go around, it seems.

It cleverly makes use of interviews and sound bytes by John so that he's almost narrating the entire film. It does not dwell too much on his time after the Beatles and with Yoko. Instead its a pleasant balance on all phases of his most fascinating life.  There's a ton of stuff I had never seen before and even better, some complete takes of the familiar stuff we know too well. For instance, there is a comprehensive bit involving John and Yoko's bed in for peace that includes a nasty exchange with a pompous cartoonist. Also a terrific scene in a recording studio. The real stuff baby. I think its interesting that as time has passed, John's ideas just don't sound so ridiculous and drug induced as they once did. He instead really comes across as a visionary trying to make dullards and dimwits understand what are now extremely sane concepts. Very odd I must say.

The real stuff baby. I think its interesting that as time has passed, John's ideas just don't sound so ridiculous and drug induced as they once did. He instead really comes across as a visionary trying to make dullards and dimwits understand what are now extremely sane concepts. Very odd I must say.

John Lennon, The Beatles still loom very large in pop culture and may for quite some time. But as a fan, I find most film documentaries generally are either too lengthy and even preachy or too segmented and incomplete; with nothing really doing the trick. So much so, that I think their music or silly Hollywood movies are still the best and most candid contact we have available. Having said that, by concentrating on John Lennon only, I think this film is able to rise above the rest of whats out there. It cleverly makes use of interviews and sound bytes by John so that he's almost narrating the entire film. It does not dwell too much on his time after the Beatles and with Yoko.

It's safe to say when I saw it for the first time it changed my life. The experience was so breathtaking and powerful I knew at that very moment I was going to be a movie freak until the day I die. For years and years this was the greatest film in the world, I refused to believe that there could actually be better ones somewhere. This is just the type of a movie that's designed to appeal to young boys. Later on I've wondered why I chose this over Indiana Jones and the temple of doom because it had twice the action we got in this and when you're a little kid that's the quality you usually appreciate. But this was my favorite, the ultimate movie experience.I've seen Raiders of the lost ark a million times and I've often dreamed that if only I could forget absolutely everything about the whole film and watch it again with the eyes of an innocent little kid because although I still consider Raiders of the lost ark as a perfect, spectacular and phenomenal adventure film, masterpiece and a massive classic, topmostly I feel nostalgic when I see it nowadays. One thing's for sure if I'm ever going to get a son of my own this is the movie I'm going to definitely show him when he's in the proper age. I want him to have the same glorious feeling I had when I was young and I want to enjoy the movie once again through his reactions.

Now, like I said in my review for the TV series, I got into the original robots in the early 90's after seeing some commercials for the Generation 2, stuff and getting intrigued.  Some time later at a locale video store, I happened to find some old G1 videos, and easily fell in love with this series, with its excellent tale of good vs. evil, with robots!  After seeing, I don't know, about 20 or so episodes of the series, I was hooked, and later, at the same video rental store, my mom found something that easily excited me  Transformers the Movie.  An actual movie of the robots!  It was too good to be true!  I did wonder why I didn't recognize any of the robots shown on the cover.  Sadly, I would soon find out.When I first watched it, I thought it would be an all-new movie-length plot in which the Optimus Prime and the Autobots would once again battle the Decepticons in another riveting adventure.  My hopes widened during the opening scene, with an excellent rendition of the theme song by the band, LION, following with a nice scene with Optimus Prime and Ironhide discussing the Decepticon situation, along with Ironhide's orders to take a small Autobot group to Earth to get enough energon to prepare for an assault on Megatron's forces.  Also nice were the appearances by Jazz, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, and a now-adult Spike Witwicky, who now has a son(BTW, I never saw Carly until after viewing this, so I didn't now she was the mom)!  The film got even better, as we see that Megatron and his usual group of Decepticons, including the always-traitorous Starscream, overly loyal Soundwave, and the emotionless Shockwave, learning of Prime's plan, plot to once again attack the Autobots.  This well-scripted scene made me wondering what would happen next.Too bad what did happen next scarred me for life.In less than a minute, to the tune of NRG's Instruments of Destruction(which fit the scene, I might add), Megatron and the Decepticons easily KILL Ironhide and the other Autobots in only a few shots.  Yes, not injure.  Not capture.  They killed them.  Unlike in the TV series, where characters took some powerful hits head on, the shots fired here are 100% fatal.  What really scars the mind is when Prowl, fatally hit from a well-placed shot from Scavenger, falls to the ground, as his optics lose all their color and smoke starts emitting from his mouth.  I was shocked at the time of this scene, and I couldn't believe what had happened.  I actually rewound the video at least once just to make sure I had not imagined the scene before me.Things did not get better.  Many of the original Autobots and Decepticons were killed in the film, and I must admit I was tramuatized when Optimus Prime died, the flicker in his eyes going out, and his color fading away from red and blue to a deep black and gray.  It is easy to realize that even though the characters are the same, the film is very different from the television series.  It is much darker, and does not have as much of a clear view of victory as the TV series did.  On the TV show, you always knew that the Autobots would pull through.  In this, however, you begin to wonder if the Autobots will ever get out of their current predicament.  In fact, the deaths of the Autobots in this movie also affected the G.I.Joe film. Originally, Duke was supposed to be killed by Serpentor, but due to the upset children over seeing the deaths of their favorite Transformers, it was changed for him to be wounded and fall into a coma instead.The movie definitely exceeds the series in many points.  The voice-acting is topnotch.  The animation was ahead of its time, and it really helps when you see how well the deaths of your favorite characters were animated.  The music is another plus, as the techno soundtrack raves in the background, creating an absolutely haunting atmosphere.My only problem, of course, is that the originals don't get much screen time, except for the Dinobots and Perceptor.  Most of the Autobots only appear in small cameos, and quite a few of them die, but the only ones besides Prime to really have any roles are Jazz, Cliffjumper, Bumblebee, Blaster, and the late Ironhide.  Ironically, although Micheal Bell had lines in the film, he did not have any as Prowl.  Also, the late Don Messick, though listed in the credits as doing the voice of Gears(who briefly appears in the movie--- you REALLY have to look hard to spot him!), does not speak as either him or the equally late Ratchet, who also gets killed in this. Meanwhile, most of the newbies get most\/all of the screentime, and although a few characters like Kup can be somewhat interesting, characters like Blurr and Wheelie make you wonder, Why WEREN'T these guys killed too?But still, despite its flaws, Transformers the Movie is an excellent animated feature.  It is still worth viewing, especially for hardcore fans of those robots in disguise.BOTTOM LINE  I for one am waiting for the Transformers Live Action movie recently announced.  Hopefully it will be as entertaining as this one, but not as depressing.
