That was how I first knew of this 2001 comedy's existence, a couple years after its release, but it would be years before I would actually see it. Weird Al Yankovic's song, Close but No Cigar was released in 2006, on his Straight Outta Lynwood album. The song is sung at the point of view of a guy who has been through three romantic relationships, all of which ended when he found the slightest excuse to break up with each of these women, and he dumped one of them when he discovered she owned a copy of Joe Dirt on DVD. However, even that reference didn't make me really want to check the movie out right away. It's been nearly four years since the release of that song, and about seven and a half years since I first saw that poster, but I've finally seen the movie. I saw Dickie Roberts Former Child Star, another comedy starring David Spade, earlier this year, and unlike that film, I did find some laughs in this one, but still didn't think it was very good.Joe Dirt is a hapless idiot who currently works as a janitor for a Los Angeles radio station and lives in a studio boiler room. Dirt is the surname his father gave him, and he cannot remember what his real surname was. His mullet is a wig that is stuck on his head, and the mullet haircut has long since gone out of style, but he can't get rid of his. Zander Kelly is a shock jock who has a show on this L.A. station, and Joe is sent in to talk on this show so people can laugh at his expense. On this radio show, Joe begins to tell his life story to Zander and all the listeners tuned in to the station, and viewers of the movie see it in flashback. When Joe was eight years old, he went on a tour of the Grand Canyon with his parents and was somehow separated from them. He hasn't seen his parents since losing them on that trip, and still doesn't know what happened to them. After being raised in several different strange foster homes, he came to the town of Silvertown, Idaho as a young man, where he met a young woman named Brandy and fell in love. Unfortunately, he also had to face a bully there named Robby, who was also intent on winning Brandy's heart, and did not appreciate Joe's presence. After Brandy's dog was shot and killed by her drunk father, Joe felt the need to leave Silvertown and search for his long lost parents. Even though Zander continues to make fun of him, Joe tells the story of his search for his parents and his adventures along the way.When it comes to the gags here, there certainly are some highlights, such as Joe Dirt finding out what the meteor he found actually is, and the lead character using what he thinks is an atomic bomb to scare the Grand Canyon tour bus company into giving him the list of passengers from the day he lost his parents. There were times when I laughed thoroughly and other times when I laughed very lightly or maybe just smiled. However, there are also some memorably unfunny parts, such as certain scenes showing Joe being bullied. These include more than one scene with Robby, played by musician Kid Rock, and also the way Zander Kelly, played by Dennis Miller, picks on Joe while on the air. I also found the part where Joe finds the dog with his testicles frozen to the porch a little uncomfortable, even if I didn't keep a straight face throughout that sequence. I didn't care much for the part where what Joe thinks is an atomic bomb turns out to be a septic tank and pours sewage all over him, though I did find the fact that the police didn't arrest him because they thought that was punishment enough fairly amusing. Other parts I didn't find very funny include the Buffalo Bob\/skin lotion one and Joe getting food thrown at him in a school cafeteria. So, there are a number of funny parts in the movie, probably more than I originally expected, but there are also some fairly lame ones, and the humour is just mediocre for much of the film's ninety minute run. There were times when I felt like I would be giving this 2001 Happy Madison production a 6\/10, but by the end, I decided I couldn't do that. Yes, there are some funny parts and likable characters, plus there certainly are fairly touching moments towards the end, but if they had done a much better job with the humour, Joe Dirt would have turned out to be a much more entertaining movie.

First of all it is refreshing to see a brother and sister relationship instead of usual boyfriend\/girlfriend territory. Its a dynamic that I think has a heavier impact in the closing stages. Gina Phillips and Justin Long are both very good in their roles, and for a movie to be carried by these 2 actors, they do very well. I always remember feeling disappointed with the creeper itself, but in the cgi heavy days we are in now its just nice to see a dude in a suit. The genius in the movie is that you don't really get to see the creeper properly during the film and only clearly at the end, also it does not explain what the creeper is. The film starts as the siblings are travelling home to see their mother who they are worried about, bickering, playing games as brother and sister do. They are then nearly run off the road by a black van. Later down the same road they see the van parked up and a man in black stuffing what looks to be bodies down a drain. After being chased and run off the road again, the duo go back to the drain and find a stack of bodies and proceed to tell the police. The Creeper now having picked them out is now on their tail and it is basically a chase movie afterwards. There is a sense of dread during the whole movie. As the movie goes on they meet a psychic woman who predicts something terrible happening to one of them and how that person will be screaming in the dark. This adds to the feeling already that something bad is going to happen. When the movie finishes it is very down beat and disturbing. I am quite surprised at how much I enjoyed Jeepers Creepers and I think as a creature feature it is entertaining, creepy a little sick at times and has the sucker punch ending that earns its place in horror history.

In the hands of writer and director Christopher Guest it is a strange comedy with very traces of originality, after all he goes back to the recurring documentary style filmmaking with all the main characters getting interviewed, and the whole thing takes too long to become a enjoyable film. Christopher Guest plays the director of the play; Eugene Levy plays a dentist with notable singing skills; Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara play a couple who is going to be part of this show, along with Parker Posey, Matt Keeslar, Bob Balaban and others. The movie begins with the selection of the participants and countless interviews with the people involved in this play. Then it evolves to the first rehearsals and the first problems involving budget, and a actor who couldn't perform on the day of the presentation. Along with it we know this eccentric town and its peculiar habitants telling stories about the city and their lives. The biggest happening for these people with this play is that a guy named Guffman will come to watch it and this guy happens to be very famous for producing plays on Braodway. So everybody wants to make their best and perform the best show ever made. Guest is known for a strange and sophisticated sense for comedy, and sometimes it's a good thing when everybody really knows what's happening in all the scenes. In the case of Waiting for Guffman the comedy took too long to be funny and the interviews once the greatest thing created by Guest in This is Spinal Tap was boring and unfunny. The scenes where the characters had dialog with each other worked way better, but some things could have been used more, explored more, developed to be funnier as it were e.g. the scene at the dinner where Fred Willard's character says that he made a penis reduction because the thing was too big. The joke went so fast that I was expecting more of it and then nothing.But I must say that this film didn't disappoint me in the so awaited play. It was the best thing in the whole film, it wasn't a disaster as it might seem predicted (after all it's a show of amateurs). It was interesting, creative and very amusing. The casting was great (both in the play and in the movie). It is one of those films that in the beginning doesn't offer much but you must not give up, just keep watching and you'll be glad for it. Among the funniest parts my favorite is near the final credits when Guest character shows lots of toys based on films (a lunch box of the film The Remains of the Day, Andrew McCarthy and Anthony Michael Hall little statues, and the tiny toys recreating a scene of My Dinner With Andre).

I loathed Kill Bill, was bored stiff by Death Proof and unimpressed by Inglorious Basterds. I was starting to wonder if I was being unfair. Perhaps my standards for Tarantino's work were too high and I was being overly critical. Then I rewatched Jackie Brown and remembered just how great Tarantino can be. This movie is so good it completely validates my view of how crappy everything he's done since has been.Based on a book by Elmore Leonard, this is probably the least showy and ostentatious of all Taratino's films, but it's also the one where he's most trying to grow and mature as a storyteller. It's about a loquacious and murderous gun dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) who's set himself in inner city Los Angeles like a spider in a web. Ordell has women set up in houses all over town, an ex-con buddy named Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) helping him out and 500 thousand dollars stashed down in Mexico. To get access to his money, Ordell relies on an 40something flight attendant working the last airline job she'll ever have on the worst airline in the business. Her name is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier). When an ATF agent named Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) catches Jackie coming back into the country with drugs and an envelope filled with 50 thousand dollars, he gives her a simple choice. Go to jail and lose everything she has or turn on Ordell. It's a simple choice but Jackie Brown isn't a simple woman. With the aid of a bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie hatches a scheme to get her out from under the cops, Ordell and her own run down life.This movie looks, feels, flows and even sounds different than anything else Quentin Tarantino has done. It dispenses with slick attitude and embraces and earthy and compromised reality. These characters are real people living real lives and when they talk, they say real things. They live in a world that looks lived in and unpolished. When these characters act, they don't do anything cutely clever or stylish but move and perform with a mesmerizingly plain directness. Jackie Brown is an effort by Tarantino to become more than the flashy shtick he executed so brilliantly in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He's not trying to make that same sort of film again and he wonderfully succeeds.There's a lighter touch to the whole movie. The violence is less grotesque, the dialog is less contrived, the performances are less theatric and even the music that defines Tarantino's direction is less intrusive. Most of the songs we hear are a part of these characters' lives, not a soundtrack slathered over them.Now, that does also mean that Jackie Brown doesn't have quite the energy or intensity of Tarantino's previous work and the pacing of the story is maybe a bit too luxurious. But there are no serious flaws to the movie. There's nothing in here you have to overlook or excuse. There's never a point or a moment that you have to accept that you wouldn't accept if you saw it in the work of a lesser filmmaker.The performances here are uniformly strong with the actors filling out the depth of each and every character. None of these roles are just here to serve The Almighty Plot Hammer. They do what they do because of who they are.Jackie Brown is a really good film. Sadly, though, I fear that when Tarantino's career is over&#x85;Jackie Brown will still be the third best movie he ever made. True, that would mean he made three films that were better than most people ever make. It would also mean he spent decades throwing away one of the greatest talents of his time.

In spite of its unusual genre trappings the film is still very much of a piece with the director's other work Kieslowski's visual style is immediately recognizable, particularly in the way he uses the camera to represent the viewpoint of his characters-here most noticeably with flashbacks to a wedding.The color white is used in the film to symbolize purity-specifically purity of a sexual nature. After seeing his wife in her white wedding dress Karol Karol loses his ability to perform sexually with her; it's implied that he can't stand the idea of soiling her in spite of her clear desire for consummation. Ashamed of both his desire for her and his inability to fulfill his husbandly duty, Karol flees her homeland of France to return to his native Poland where he manages to gain a fortune because of a series of crooked business dealings. Karol may be afraid of doing something to ruin his wife's purity but he has no such scruples when it comes to his relationships with anyone else. Basically, he has to rid himself of virtue before he's willing to take any part of hers.While Farces aren't normally known for their emotional resonance, Kieslowski had become so adept at conveying his character's feelings that it's impossible not to feel sympathy for Karol even when his actions seem least relatable. Although I have negative memories of my viewing of Kieslowki's previous film Three Colors Blue from three years ago I wouldn't hesitate to call this film a masterpiece and its director one of the best of the 1990s on the strength of this film and 1991's Double Life of Veronique.

It's very, very rare for a screenwriter to write specialist language into a script and pull it off. Chayefsky does this in Network, The Hospital, and here in Altered States. How many times have you watched a movie where the actors say sh1t that pretty transparently communicates a bungled (if well-intentioned) attempt to have the actors sound authoritative? Man, that hurts!

Also, there are several other lesser other Eastwood works that I'd pop into the DVD player before this one, ones that I find to be provocative, immensely entertaining, or re-watchable or all of the above (HANG EM HIGH, THE GAUNTLET, THE ENFORCER, SUDDEN IMPACT, TIGHTROPE).With UNFORGIVEN, I think a recurring word I find when I watch it is monotony. At the end of the day, I think everything is too one-dimensional. On repeated viewings, I find nothing really deep or provocative about this film. I don't pick up on anything. It's a well-made, professional film with decent-to-good acting, but that's about it. The only 2 characters that I find to be interesting are the ones played by Gene Hackman (Little Bill Daggett) and Richard Harris (English Bob). Everyone else just is kind of there. Not to mention that virtually all the characters seem like the SAME person! There is no uniqueness about any of them.Save for Daggett and Little Bill, they all have the same mannerisms, mood, and tone. I've seen many so-called lesser films with better developed, written, and performed characters that allowed me to latch onto the film the more and more I watched it. With UNFORGIVEN, these characters (and there are tons of them) fall way too flat. Examples The scene where Munny, the Kid (played by Jamie Woolvett), and the (totally unnecessary!) Morgan Freeman character track down the first of the 2 men they are to kill is totally devoid of real emotion and resonance. I feel nothing when watching this scene. The acting by all involved is strangely similar (Freeman ironically being the weakest link in this scene). Eastwood did Freeman no favors by casting him in this film. Seems like stunt, friendship casting as far as I'm concerned.Eastwood (as former vicious killer, but now reformed family man William Munny) strangely evokes very little as the lead. It is hard to buy that this man was once a vicious killer simply because Eastwood gives himself the same singular tone as most of the rest of the cast. Then all of a sudden at the end he is a badass again. I think the intent was right, but the execution (pardon the pun!) is rather unbelievable. This ending scene is in it's own right pretty spectacular as it demystifies the mythology of gunslinging that so many films before (ironiclly including many early Eastwood Westerns) had glamourized and I find it (and the Daggett-English Bob scenes) to be the only good ones.At the end of the day, a great film ought to draw you in, not push you away.

It is hard to buy that this man was once a vicious killer simply because Eastwood gives himself the same singular tone as most of the rest of the cast. Then all of a sudden at the end he is a badass again. I think the intent was right, but the execution (pardon the pun!) is rather unbelievable. This ending scene is in it's own right pretty spectacular as it demystifies the mythology of gunslinging that so many films before (ironiclly including many early Eastwood Westerns) had glamourized and I find it (and the Daggett-English Bob scenes) to be the only good ones.At the end of the day, a great film ought to draw you in, not push you away. UNFORGIVEN, sadly, does the latter. ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"29 August 2010","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" \/SPOILER\/ Is this comedy or drama?

Populist films nowadays do move at a relatively faster pace, but if you are willing to be just a touch patient and absorb the story it's a superb combination of fantasy, mythology and sci-fi, with a thrilling and absorbing climax.Performances are not really the point of this film, but Lucas's penchant for naturalistic acting seen in both THX and American Graffiti is very much present. The young cast works well, with the sparring between Harrison Ford and a young Carrie Fisher particularly notable. In fact Harrison Ford's roguish character plays off very well with all the characters he interacts with. Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing both bring gravitas to their roles and add contrast to the younger actors with a subtly more theatrical style to their performances. James Earl Jones's vocal performance is excellent and really makes Darth Vader work.Lucas's style of directing, which meshes classical composition with a more reality based European verite style of film making, actually works very well and gave the film a freshness when it was first released, supported by Gilbert Taylor's gritty photography . Even now, with some effective digital embellishments, it holds up against today's releases remarkably well. This was helped by the tremendous design work by production designer John Barry, mechanical effects maestro John Stears, and customer designer John Mollo, the former two being Bond movie veterans of the time. This was of course based upon Lucas's fantastic imagination. Lucas's nascent visual effects outfit, ILM produced ground breaking work that was brilliantly edited into the film by Lucas and his editorial team of Richard Chew, Paul Hirsch and some part time help from his wife at the time, Marcia Lucas. They got the right balance of real location footage with excellent production design with miniature optical effects. While the added digital effects are noticeable, (though some blend with the film flawlessly) their modest number added allows the film to maintain this reality based quality, something that the subsequent prequels lost sight of to some extent.Deservingly the film won 7 Oscars, for Art Direction John Barry and his Art Directors Les Dilley , Norman Reynolds and Roger Christian, the former 2 went on to be outstanding production designers in their own right, the latter becoming a film director as well.The landmark visual effects and special effects artists contribution was led by John Dykstra, who was the overall supervisor. He went to work on many more films including Star Trek &#x96; The Motion Picture, 2 Batman films (the Joel Schumacher directed ones), and 2 Spiderman films, winning his second Oscar for his work on Spiderman 2. John Stears won an Oscar for his on-set effects. Richard Edlund was the main effects cameraman, and would go on and win 3 more Oscars for his work on Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the Jedi while at ILM and would later run his own effects studio. Grant McCune, a miniature specialist, also runs his own effects company. Robert Blalack won for his optical compositing work and would go on to win an Emmy Award for his work on the famous TV movie The Day After.Building on Lucas's pioneering sound design work on THX 1138, the sound effects team contributed fantastic work in giving this film a reality based feel, with the use of real life sounds. The sound team was Don McDougall, Ray West (who would go on to win 2 Emmy awards for his sound work), Bob Minkler and Derek Ball. Ben Burtt won a special technical achievement award for his sound effects work and would go on to be a regular contributor on many high profile films, winning Academy awards for his sound work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.However, for me the stalwart technical contribution has to come from film composer John Williams, with a truly landmark, Oscar winning score &#x96; it was his third Oscar at the time and for me has gone on to produce a magnificent body of film score work &#x96; present day included.

A down-of-luck man named Richard (Jon Finch) is accused of killing , he frees for his wrongful conviction and is helped by his lover (Anna Massey). Covent Garden wholesale fruit merchant is the real serial killer who strangles women with a necktie. Meanwhile a Chief Inspector (Alec McCowen) along with his sergeant helper (Michael Bates) are investigating the grisly murders . And the strangler killer going on his murder spree . The panic expands on the city by the necktie murderous and Richard becomes a prime suspect . Bewildered Richard chased cross London by the police who think he is an assassin as his ex-wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) has been also murdered and all caught by the circumstantial evidence . Later on , Richard learns the real murderer and he's headed to seek revenge against him.All typical Hitch themes are here as a man wrongly accused of murder , his Quintaessential issue , numerous amazing camera shots and slightly black humor . Hitchcock was encouraged to return to England and promptly made this unusual film for his eventual British period. The picture packs tension , thriller,suspense and excitement. The intriguing story written by Anthony Shaffer -Sleuth- is one of the splendid thrillers with 'false guilty ' as its theme, achieving the maximum impact on the audience and containing numerous exciting set pieces with usual Hitchcock elements . The movie is full of lingering images as when the camera shows the astounding killings , the strange fighting with a corpse in a truck load of potatoes , the camera descending from a first floor flat , the Inspector 's mealtime along with his wife Vivien Merchant , among others .

Someone else to see how brilliant you are, just like at school.Hitchcock tackled the idea of the perfect murder quite often in his films,  both directly and indirectly. Rope is the fourth movie of his that I've seen where the murder IS the story, or in this case, the murder's immediate aftermath and repercussions.The movie opens with two young men murdering an acquaintance in an apartment, and hiding him inside a chest. They did it for no other reason than that they could, and they follow the philosophy that their innate superiority over inferior men such as the victim gives them the right to do what they did. As the icing on the cake for their murder, they have a dinner party planned immediately afterward, where the hiding place of the deceased will serve as a macabre dinner table for his father, aunt, girlfriend, and others.Rope is at its best when the uncovering of the misdeed of the duo seems imminent. James Stewart plays an authority figure from the pair's younger days, who is partially responsible for their warped ways of thinking. He slowly begins to become more and more suspicious, as the two killers each make revealing mistakes in their own ways, and the usually punctual victim remains nowhere to be found.This isn't among my favorite Hitchcock movies, but it's likable enough. It's set in one location like Rear Wondow and Dial M for Murder, and it's always interesting to see Hitchcock work within the confines and challenges of that scenario. The movie is also quite tense at times, as it becomes clear that it's only a matter of time before the secret is outed. See it for the interesting premise, if nothing else.  ","genre":null},{"date":"29 August 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is what you wanted somebody else to know.

Yeha it's from the 80's, but the first couple of movies in the series were awesome and original horror films. By the 5th one it gets old and there's nothing left to make a movie about except a new batch of teens, more of Freddy's super corny punchlines (don't dream and drive!), and some sort of hare-brained plot about what Freddy's up to this time (hint still tormenting and killing people via the dreamworld).The one really cool thing about this movie, as with the other Elm Streets, is the haunted houses\/ boiler rooms\/ places of torture the kids enter when they dream. This is the whole basis of Elm Street that sets it apart from other horror movies, it really is like a nightmare, and even when you're thinking don't go in there!!! you still can't blame the kids for going because you know that's what you do in dreams and that's the kind of crazy places that appear in dreams.The rest of the movie is pretty dull and corny to a ridiculous extent. Like when Alice's fridge starts decomposing in front of her eyes, or Alice's friend who was obsessed with comic books becomes a comic himself and Freddy literally shreds him to pieces, or when Alice sees her own womb and the baby and it's all sci-fi flashing and flickering.. way too corny and not scary at all.In fact that pretty much sums up the problem with The Dream Child. Way too many corny effects in this movie and not nearly enough horror. Nothing interesting to see here other than more of the dark and haunted places Freddy cooks up in the kids' dreams. The little girls playing jump rope and chanting that one, two, Freddy's coming for you.. rhyme gets really old at this point because it's just a rehash of the older Elm Streets and has no place here. And how exactly did Alice and her friend free Amanda Kreguer? That was never made clear, but I guess it must've gotten a little rushed towards the end because they were already planning the next movie involving Freddy and a half-ass plot to bring him back.At this point I think they made the movie just because they could, NOT because they had the intent to make a good and worthwhile movie like they must have with the first installment of Elm Street because that is one cool, totally un-corny movie (and made earlier in the notoriously corny 80's I might add). Stick to the first two Elm Streets, even the third one's pretty good even though everything's already been figured out by this point (Freddy can't really be killed and will continue to kill people in the next movie).

The film has become the stuff legends are made of. Not only did it launch the career of a noteworthy director (as did its sequel) but it also spawned two separate remakes, with the latest being what looks like this summer's biggest guilty pleasure film. But before all that was the little film that could, an unlikely b-movie underdog that does its job surprisingly well. Because of this movie, you will believe that fish on sticks can be threatening.Before he would go on to become a big name in the horror genre in the 1980's, director Joe Dante (The Howling, Gremlins) let loose on this shoe-string budget b-flick. Although the film has little style, it gets by with a strong sense of humor and its oddball assortment of characters. Heather Menzies plays Maggie, a video game obsessed insurance investigator who is thrust into the arms of Bob Vila look-alike Paul (Bradford Dillman) -- a bitter drunk with a dry sense of humor -- when she sets to the wilderness in search of a missing couple. The two inadvertently stumble upon a military experiment, letting loose a school of blood-thirsty fish into the local lake where a delicious feast of fat tourists and innocent children awaits them.Although sorely dated, Piranha is not without its charm. A young Rob Bottin provides some surprisingly decent special effects and make-up, while Dante keeps the pace of the film moving effectively, especially in its ridiculous final act, which just so happens to feature an explosion so random it probably keeps Michael Bay up at night in fits of jealous rage. Seeking a silly yet solid horror spoof? You just can't go wrong taking a midnight swim with Piranha.
