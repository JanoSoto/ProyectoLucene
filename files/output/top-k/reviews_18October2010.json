[{"date":"18 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem for a Dream is a 2000 film by Daron Aronofsky which deals with one of todays many problems in society, drug & Heroine addictions. The movie its self actually centers around 2 separate story lines one of which deals with an older woman chasing her dreams and does anything to do it, and second of her son who hit jackpot with drug distribution loses it and tries to get it back. Throughout both story lines there addictions become more and more of a key role, too the point where its causing them too lose sense of reality and whats morally right and wrong , but at the same time they cant live without it.The Cast does a brilliant job delivering these characters and the Director definitely makes the mood of the story as haunting as possible. Throughout the movie you care about them even through out the the things they do that will normally make a person cringe. But this is where Requiem of a dream Most definitely Excels.But through out the sheer Brilliance of the story and atmosphere itself its almost impossible to recommend it too everybody. This movie is downright depressing beginning to end which will turn some people off. Also its worth noting that it Definitely deserves is R rating. This isn't a film too watch if your having a good day because it will leave you depressed for the rest of it. But if your in a mood to sit down and watch a extremely well made modern day Shakespearian like tragedy, then I see no reason why you will not find this anything less then a modern classic ","genre":null},{"date":"18 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Requiem for a Dream is a 2000 film by Daron Aronofsky which deals with one of todays many problems in society, drug & Heroine addictions.

The problem with Amores Perros (also with 21 Grams and Babel) is you just can't ignore it. Or, to put it better, you'd feel some kind of terminal guilt (appropriately&#x85;) if you did. The three intertwining stories revolve ambitiously and high-poweredly around the theme of fatalism, on love's a bitch (more or less the title), on brother against brother religious motifs, on Kieslowski, Poe, a bit of Mexican-period Bunuel, and on a to-the-point requiem on Viva La Revolucion. In short however, this is a salute to the idea of God laughing when people make plans. (To be honest, God laughs when people make movies about God). In any case, the only one laughing in Inarritu's humorless universe could be God, though I don't really see why He'd be so pleased in seeing his creatures miserable as hell (&#x85;). Obviously this is a vengeful divine presence overlooking the production of Amores Perros, a production stately (while recalling Mr. Babenko's 1981 Pixote) and, occasionally, inspiringly unpleasant. Undoubtedly a masterpiece for those who get their ideological kicks in non-American speaking filmmaking, an intriguing torture for the rest.
