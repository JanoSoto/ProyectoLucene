This movie will--strange to think--rank up there with Stop Making Sense as a classic concert film. Interesting that 1) they're not really comparable, since SMS is real concert footage and TTYD is a mockumentary, and 2) Jonathon Demme is in TTYD!Is this a timeless movie? Close. Darn close. What's great? Actually--almost enlightening--Hanks' writing is really quite wonderful. The dialog is almost a rare example of direct, effective, connecting film writing. The casting, directing, and acting is great. The editing is very effective. The sets, costumes, general look is a delight. The music is very, very effective. So much subtle craftsmanship goes into stuff at the right levels of detail, that you might accuse the film of failing to be like a genuine rock 'n' roll experience because it's almost too crafty. But I think they pull it off.What's wrong with the movie? Not much. The ending flags a little. The pre-credits posting of thumbnail future bios of the characters is a cheap device; but again I think it doesn't eclipse the power of the mythic payload (the moral) which ultimately has to do with the power of love. And I don't say that in a wishy-washy sense. What is love? According to this movie, it's that multi-dimensional experience which includes not just finding that special someone, but also finding your path. It reminds me of an exchange I had with a work buddy who hoped to write that big hit tune and retire early. I loaned him a record by Fred Frith, which put him off entirely. This guy won't ever get anywhere, he said. But I patiently explained that he (my friend) and I get up in the morning and go to our corporate jobs. This guy (Frith) gets up and goes to the studio. Who's the success? That's a big life lesson, and I think this movie nuances that very effectively. It can even translate to any of life's pursuits, not just music.I found myself being continuously delighted by this film. At the risk of sounding like a green ass, I want to plug this film's attention to a time-honored aesthetic virtue Hard work. This film is a labor of love, with equal attention to the inspiration AND perspiration.I can't believe how much I like this movie! I feel like a bobbysoxer saying it! I resonated with this movie on many points. Let me give you one example. I was in a little band once and was something of the muse of that band. Something I always marveled at was how the creative process people talk about is actually a very simple and practical reality when you're actually being creative. One of the sweet, simple high points of working up a number is the act of picking the tempo. If you've ever done this, you know what I'm talking about. Picking the tempo is a profoundly rewarding act, and of course that's just one small aspect of the process. So the scene near the beginning of the flick where the drummer overrules Jimmy and establishes an uptempo beat to what was supposed to be a ballad is a profoundly resonant moment for me. And the direction and editing bring together an almost perfect picture of the very real and profound joy that this brings to people.There were many, many moments in this movie that affected me in much the same way.

Although in many ways the Hindu culture is highly erotic, eroticism is not normally featured in domestic Indian films and the Director had to recruit two British born actresses for the starring roles. It is a beautiful film which was quite successful in parts of Europe and it is unfortunate that it had only a limited release in North America.\tUltimately the film is a Feminist Tract, which is said to be based on an Indian legend from the early sixteenth century - the period immediately after the foundation of the Mohgul (Mongol) empire in India. It is a story about an intelligent woman born  into a low cast who is the servant of a high cast compatriot betrothed to the local Raj. In most parts of the world the subservient status of women at the time of this legend made it very difficult for them to establish a satisfactory lifestyle except in the traditional role of wife to the master of a family and mother to his children. In India the difficulties were greatly compounded by the additional limitations imposed by the cast system. The film basically records the efforts of this woman to use her sexual attractiveness to develop a lifestyle that would be acceptable to her. In modern parlance Maya has the moral standards of a guttersnipe, but in the context of the period in which she lived she merely manipulated the weapons available to her to try to establish what any modern woman would describe as an acceptable independent lifestyle. Ultimately her plans basically fail and the film ends with her walking confidently towards an unknown future after losing her lover and every support that her former life had provided, but with a confidence that she could face the future, whatever it might bring, thanks to the lessons in life that she had learned during her period at the Royal Court. Women can clearly identify with this story - although IMDb users in general have only given this film fairly average ratings, the demographic breakdown of these ratings shows that younger women rate it most highly.\tThe title Kama Sutra - A love story poses a problem, Many western viewers expected a near pornographic sequence of orgies with sexual encounters involving highly convoluted positions - their disappointment can be seen both in some of the viewer comments featured in this data base, and by the low ratings many viewers have given to this film. (One IMDb reviewer has made the interesting comment that the film might have been much more successful if it had simply been titled  A love story.) The film has also been derided as an Indian version of a modern soap opera. The common feature of soap operas is probably their limited characterisation and a shallow one track story line; but if we look at European stories and legends from the same period we find that they mostly show similar features - think only of the Decameron or such works as Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill. I have never been a fan of the modern soap operas- perhaps because they cut too close to home- but I am a sucker for those such as Dangerous Beauty or Black Venus which have the ability to temporarily transport one into life during an earlier period. Consequently I greatly enjoyed this film which not only successfully recreates a long past period, but also provides a realistic glimpse of life as lived in a totally different culture to my own. Most soap operas are rather melodramatic, but despite its exotic locale and period, the film Kama Sutra - a love story remains somewhat underplayed. The Raj showed a fairly unsavoury character, but none of the petty vindictiveness we associate with European royalty of the period. The arrest and execution of the sculptor, Maya's lover, was clearly inevitable but it was not carried out with the oriental barbarism I expected to be displayed, and this Indian royal court was shown as both more civilised and more humane than say its European equivalent in the English court of Henry VIII.\tFor a film to be a success there are basically two requirements, it must have something worth while to feature and it must be sufficiently competently made to hold the viewers attention whilst watching it. In my view this film fully meets both these requirements. Although the story line was a little trite and the characterisation was somewhat shallow, the camera work was superb and was a delight to the eye throughout. It is hard for a Westerner to judge how authentically the sixteenth century Mohgul royal court was represented, but as shown its visual impact was both exotic and exciting. A important part of this film was the outstanding score which contributed much to the mood and atmosphere. This score, the sets, the costumes and the camera work were outstanding throughout and provided a continual feast for both eyes and ears. What more can a viewer expect? I give this film a rating of eight out of ten, much higher than the average rating recorded in the IMDb database, and I do so deliberately not because it was a great story but because both the score and the camerawork justify this rating. This is at least as valid as giving a similar rating to films with a great story to tell, but with very indifferent camera work. After all the cinema is essentially a visual form of entertainment and any film which can, like this one, keep our eyes glued to the screen throughout has to be recognised as way above average.

But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting cast &#150;Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience.

I would highly recommend it.Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances (Baby) Houseman. She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character. This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life. Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie.Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive. He gives his character a comprehensive personality, strong appeal and great depth. The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film. The other members of the supporting cast &#150;Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here-also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience. The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved. The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion. The plot, although exceedingly predictable, is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful. Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes.`Dirty Dancing' is a truly powerful, magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance.

So was the case with Bedazzled, reading a rather spoiling review in a magazine when it was running its first week in theaters. (Allthough it wasn't until its DVD release that i sat down & giggled )The 7-wishes-in-exchange-for-the-soul plot immediately offers more possibilities to build a comedy on than, for instance, the classic triple feature used in every Aladdin movie. First of all, the number is greater and second, its not as much about wishes than it is about interpreting them & filling up the holes with satanic twists. The whole premise takes but a small quarter to develop, followed by the series of acts, strung together by the enthusiastic yet stylish performance of lovely Liz Hurley, in which we get some minor storyline development. That is where i locate my sole grief  i didn't really want to see Brendan Fraser get smart & apply the contract rules towards a truly 'happy' ending. Hurley was likable enough to let her win. But what are you going to do about it ? America requires it.For those who demand a critical note of weak points, i took a step back and noted some. One, Brendan Fraser is by no means necessary to this movie, even if he does a decent job playing the nerd. It just requires someone capable of playing the nerd. For instance Tom Hanks could have done it back in his Dragnet days. Two, not all portrayals of Frasers wishes are that good, the 'emotional man' being the most tedious yet luckily also the shortest of them all, possibly cause that two-word formula wasn't much to work with in the first place. Then again, it is nicely fitted between the strong Columbia opening & the basketball fantasy ( pay attention to that appealing instrumental piece we all know from the Full Monty's dress rehearsal, 'na-na-na-nah HEY na-na-na-nah' ). Three, that stupid hamburger-&-a-large-coke joke was far too predictable not to look stupid in the whole of the comedy.All in all, what have we got ? good story, good interpretation, rocking female lead and all that put together cleverly enough to cover the major weaknesses.

Kevin Andrew Walker and David Fincher appeared out of nowhere - B movie productions, actually - and took audiences by surprise with a gritty story that mixed urban loneliness, musings on contemporary life, the buddy cop genre, an unprecedented villain in cinema, a violent message against modern society, an intelligent plot with good dialogue and characterisation, and an unforgettable twist at the end that launched a thousand imitations. Indeed, the effects of the marvelous twist are still visible today, in horrible movies like Secret Window, Identity or Godsend.

There's a scene in this, his first go-round as 007, where Bond is tied up and his arm is cut to draw blood and attract some hungry sharks swimming below. Moore twitches his eyebrow and asks Perhaps we can try something in a simpler vein.Those sharks don't need any frickin' laser beams on their heads to get you to smell the Austin. Moore gets a lot of blame for turning the Bond movies into weakly-plotted farces, ignoring that the series had been moving in that direction since Goldfinger and that the previous installment, Sean Connery's final EON bow Diamonds Are Forever, was every bit as goofy. Also, Moore could deliver a more serious Bond when the script allowed, and two of the finest Bonds ever, The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only, were his.But there's no getting around this, Live And Let Die is a dumb movie. The gadgets are silly, the villain's scheme is ill-defined, the storyline is frenetic and unengaging, the action is plodding and overlong. Moore starts out not quite know how to play Bond here, while the movie requires him to play the fool sauntering through Harlem in a double-breasted suit like the Prince of Wales waiting for some natives to show him around.But this film makes me smile, in part because I'm young enough to remember what it was all about when it came out. If this was Bond for the cheap seats, it at least delivered the goods, with some vivid supporting characters, a knockout visual style, amazing title music from Paul McCartney, and most importantly for Moore's future in the series, drop-dead quips. My favorite is when the nasty Tee Hee twists his pistol muzzle out of shape with a metal pincer arm, then giggles when he hands it back Funny how the least little thing amuses him.Julius Harris is menacing but charming as Tee Hee, mostly mute except when he sticks Bond in a gator pond and suggests the best way to disarm the beasts is to try and pull out their teeth. Chief villain Yaphet Kotto has his moments, too, but with odd shifts of character. In the beginning, he's stone-cold Ron O'Neal in Superfly, and at the end, he's plummy Charles Gray in Diamonds Are Forever. Jane Seymour is Bond's love interest, and why she goes off with him is another of those things best not thought about long.There are two great characters in this movie, though, bigger than just about anything seen in a Bond movie before who kind of work in tandem in overhauling any objections about this film being too cartoony. Clifton James is redneck sheriff J.W. Pepper, who throws off one madman line after another while Bond is off on one of his long silly chase scenes. James mugs through every scene he's in, rolling his tongue around, playing off everyone and everything, and delivering every hackneyed Southern stereotype to such righteous perfection it's enough to make cotton sprout out of his ears. Bond purists who whine should just take their vodka martinis shaken not stirred and let the rest of us enjoy the craziness. The series is supposed to be fun; if you want serious espionage go watch Smiley's People. (I grant you Pepper shouldn't have returned in the next Bond film; that was a mistake.)The other great outsized character is Geoffrey Holder as perhaps the most mysterious figure in the whole series, Baron Samedi. Is he supernatural? Is he just crazy from the heat? He's certainly different, a guy who sides with the bad guys without quite being one of them. The always-eerie quality of his appearances, either dancing in a big hotel production number or quietly sitting in a cemetery playing a flute, make you question whether there ain't something to that voodoo after all.It's silly bashing Pepper but praising Samedi, they are both equally so unreal, in a way that's in tune with the rest of the movie. The best thing to do is enjoy the different kinds of fun on offer. Frankly, not having these guys around might push this film on the bad side of Spinal Tap's fine line between stupid and clever, the side where A View To A Kill and Moonraker are on.But Live And Let Die is a winner. It's a fun movie that brings me back to younger days, when my heart was an open book. It's a nice transitional film for the series in that Moore managed a mostly smooth entrance to the role of Bond.

In fact, ideological bias arguments are easy when there's no real news coverage in the first place (recall Holly Hunter's character at the conference in the beginning angrily criticizing an indifferent crowd of career journalists for airing something about a dominoes competition while some foreign countries were involved in nuclear disarmament talks). This is a significant commentary about how broadcast news, desirous of profits, becomes unimportant infotainment. Though, it makes this point less violently and harshly than does the terrific 1976 movie, Network, which provides a good preface, as that was already the late 70s when the beast started to creep in to the networks and take over. Although, you could probably pass on the dramatized version via Broadcast News, and witness it in a more modern setting (late 90s\/early 2000) with Michael Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' and again in the follow-up, 'Farenheit 9\/11.' All of these movies reveal how significantly dangerous the practice of commercialized news is, and how insignificant the smokescreen of ideological bias really is. Bottom line when you control the news, you control information!This one seems to hit on many faults of broadcast news as a result of commercial ownership using just three main characters. The first is top news producer, Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), who seems somewhat neurotic, but noble, in her desire to hold the network on one path, in one direction--for real news, not infotainment (not too much anyways, since even she was guilty of this with the way she and the stageman puts the story together) and with real, important stories to tell. She is matched by her best friend and coworker, the hopeless dufus reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) who plays something like a Bill Murray type character from 'Groundhog Day,' though not as darkly cynical as Murray's character first was. He's witty and knows how things work. He's less idealistic as Craig, and probably less optimistic, since he is more effected by the trends in the network news arena than she is. That's because his career is threatened by a newcomer soon-to-be-star, Tom Grunnick (William Hurt). Grunnick epitomizes what networks want and Craig epitomizes what they should be. Grunnick comes wining to Craig about how he's not a very good reporter, and wants to know how to reform himself. He says, for example, sometimes he doesn't understand the news he reads. Basically, what it boils down to is that he has no real qualifications for being a reporter. But that doesn't stop the incredible love affair the networks have with him, as he soon rises to stardom on complete nothingness while Craig, reluctant to teach remedial journalism to him, tries to steer him in the right direction such as strict adherence to journalism ethics, for example. None of which Grunnick really takes to heart. He's a real loser character because basically all he wants is people's approval without every doing the right thing. He is the bain of real news, and the prize of broadcast news. And it is his character that dominates the system. That's what is so dangerous. Craig nor Altman seem like very sympathetic characters (Hunter is so nagging and Brooks is rather pathetically idiotic) but they are certainly not as despicable as Grunnick (Hurt). You might walk away from this movie with a different opinion of corporate news networks, as you should. It is not as much of a comedy as it is social commentary.

Probably to focus too much on this would be to lose sight of the whole damn thing (like 'The Year of Living Dangerously' does in some ways).

Great fun. Twenty or so of us spent a whole Sunday afternoon-to-late-evening discussing and arguing the merits and demerits of both versions. I recommend the exercise for other Shakespeare fans and film fans. (Holms vs. Scofield as Lear, Zefferelli's Romeo & Juliet vs. the one with Caprio, etc. Try it; you'll like it). Henry V has been read as English triumphalism so often that this bad-war era version was probably NECESSARY in order to show folks how subtle Shakespeare can be even when he seems to be tooting a patriotic horn! We are shown a very complicated (and very disturbed) king in three fine scenes in particular (1) Henry slouching on his throne as he hears his ecclesiastical minions telling him what he wants to hear and feeding him the long-shot arguments that speciously justify his claim to the throne of France; (2) the subtle demonstration that his French obsession is partly a way of displacing his guilt about abandoning Falstaff; and (3) his maniacal behavior at Harfleur as he rides around waving his sword and making himself a perfect target with his surcoat decorated with the royal arms! Shakespeare makes it impossible to doubt Henry's courage and military genius, but he also appalls us My God, we think, it's nuts like this who still rule the world and cause most of the problems thereof!I have a few bones to pick. Branagh is trying to keep the film from getting too long, and he is sometimes sloppy about what he cuts. Here are a pair of examples (1) The film movingly depicts a French atrocity, namely the killing the youngsters who guarded the English luggage (Directly against the laws of war as the lovable fussy legalist Fluellen puts it). But Shakespeare puts this in perspective by highlighting Henry's equally atrocious violation, when he orders the mass killing of French prisoners. BRANAGH IGNORES THAT, AND LEAVES OUT THE British ATROCITY WHILE INCLUDING THE FRENCH ONE! In the play as Shakespeare wrote it, Fluellen (displaying his unconquerable admiration for the king) has to force himself, in his Alexander the Pig scene, to rationalize Henry's atrocity as a response to the French atrocity which hadn't happened yet. The stickler Fluellen, in other words, is disingenuous with himself as the price of keeping Henry in the right. Ouch! But the ouch would actually have strengthened Branagh's interpretation.(2) Branagh is gorgeous in his handling of the scene where Henry disguises himself as a common soldier in order to hobnob with his men, and loses his cool--throws a tantrum, in fact--while listening to soldier Williams' good and honest anti-war talk. But another sequence, without which the foregoing scene can really not be understood properly, is cut!!!! The scene in question, which isn't in the film, shows Henry revealing himself to the honest (or lippy?) Williams and demanding satisfaction for the latter's supposedly insubordinate and disloyal talk. Williams stands his ground like a man, and tells Henry respectfully but firmly that if he wants to be treated like a king he shouldn't disguise himself as a buck private. The King, thus put in the wrong in front of his officers (and shown the flip side of the thoughts he himself expressed in his Upon the King! soliloquy a few scenes earlier), cuts his losses, tells Fluellen to make up for the deception by giving Williams his (Henry's) glove filled with money, and hurriedly exits. Williams refuses the money along with Fluellen's patronizing b.s., and we are left to contemplate the fact that we have just seen an unpleasantly catty side of Henry. As in the other case, Branagh's cutting of one scene rather makes hash out of the other.There is one scene where Branagh unnecessarily remains in Olivier's shadow. Branagh was quite aware that he couldn't speechify like Olivier (nor could anyone else, actually), and that he would therefore inevitably suffer if he tried to declaim the Once more to the breach Harfleur set piece, he somehow couldn't resist trying, which resulted in the only lame acting in the film. Branagh would have made more sense if he had just allowed the mounted, renzied Henry to shout himself hoarse, almost unheard over the noise of battle, while urging his men to this crazy suicide attack, and to eschew such stagey hamming as we end up seeing here (and nowhere else in the film). Finally, a bow should be made toward the supporting cast (especially Holms, Blessed and Scofield), who are splendid. About Scofield the history books say that Charles VI was subject to migraine headaches and fits of depression, and that due to the absolutist nature of the French state, the whole mechanism of government ground to a halt when the King was suffering in this way. Scofield's brilliant performance shows that there is no such thing as a minor role.I don't know what one of the IMDb reviewers means by the complaint that Emma Thompson as Princess Katherine looks too English.

The story is ok but having took little bits off other works like 'V' it isn't too original. This has to be watched at least once but i take my hat off to an amateur director with little money and getting a bunch of mates together and producing something that seems very professional. I doubt any of the big named hollywood directors could have done half as good as this with what Peter Jackson had to work with. Braindead is definitely better than this but still watch this at all costs. 6\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"24 July 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  While I really admire the film-making and creativity in this movie, its story telling technique becomes rather tedious after the first hour. Even though Memento breaks the story-telling mold by showing you events in reverse order, the plot is quite linear. By the halfway point I found there were no surprises left; and after being dragged through every scene twice in the course of a single viewing I felt as if I'd sat through a 3 hour marathon. The acting is superb however. Guy Pierce and Carrie-Anne Moss have amazingly twisted chemistry that unfortunately doesn't run throughout the whole film. The interaction between the characters and the intriguing script keep the viewer involved even through some lugubrious scenes. Overall over-rated, but worth watching.

Well, I guess maybe I saw Morgan Freeman and thought it had potential. The people writing, producing and directing this probably don't even realize they have very little creative talent. They probably haven't even figured out that they are stealing all of their ideas from other films. All of the plot lines, all the character types are completely unoriginal. Please people, try thinking outside the box little and actually create something. I didn't hate the film but there was not one memorable scene in it and so many plot holes that my eyes are soar from rolling them back in my head so much. A few years from now this film will probably pop up on T.V., I'll watch a little bit, eventually change the channel and not even remember that I have already seem it.
