In my opinion then answer is no and after first seeing Pearl Harbour I thought he actually did quite a good job. The action was excellent, the sets were very standard and expected, some actors were better than others, I'm talking about Josh Harnett acting the pants off Ben Affleck. Kate Beckinsale was very good as Eve but after viewing it twice there was something definitely concerning me, the script.This film portrays America as people who don't like to admit to their history and what's happened to them in the past. The ego of this gradually gets bigger and bigger the more the film s goes on. One scene in particular that really rubbed me up the wrong way and others that I have consulted with is when Rafe is writing Eve a letter home and a British pilot comes up to him and commends him on his piloting and then says or something along the lines If Germany goes to war with America, god help them, I'm sure there was a point the screenwriter was trying to make but I sure as hell didn't get it, there are other scenes which I could go on about but I'm sure you already know of them so I will now judge the film on other points.As far as action goes like I said before, it is amazing and the bombing of Pearl Harbour is really a cinematic experience. Everything apart from the Pearl Harbour invasion is very badly directed. It shows that Michael Bay doesn't really have a connection with his actors like Scorsese and De Niro do. The script is nothing but god awful. The dialogue apart from being cheesy is just terrible, it really makes the actors not do a good job when you got someone saying lines like Japan realised they were no match for America and turn their forces back, what's that all about, it maybe true but there's no need to rub it in, that's just careless and not really something you should put in to a film like this. I was hoping to see a film that would show how much WW2 destroyed so many lives but it just seems to show how great America is and how well they can.This is also the downfall of Ben Affleck. Armageddon was very enjoyable and his cheesy performance was just manageable by Bruce Willis stealing the show but here there is no forgiving him for his bad performance. Towards the end of the film he starts to act well but right up to the moment the Pearl Harbour invasion happens I thought he was poor, Kate Beckinsale wasn't far behind and poor Josh Harnett must have been black mailed into this because I think his performance is the best though has a few moments which I would rather turn my head in embarrassment.Michael Bay's action sequences do save the film but his direction in other places is needed by somebody who knows how to deal with his or hers actors and actresses and get the best of them, Pearl Harbour sadly does not have any sign of that ever happening. It's fair to say that no one's career has gone on to better things since apart from Jerry Bruckhimer and at least he can say I never directed and starred in it so don't blame me, clever these producers aren't they?

It ended up with a 9 out of 10 from me. Those who like the film probably enjoy absurdism, have a familiarity with various facets of African American oriented pop-culture going back to at least the early 1970s, and do not mind silly humor delivered in compact packages primarily for entertainment value.Pootie Tang is basically a spoof on various stereotypical (though rooted in reality) aspects of African American pop culture, ranging from Parliament\/Funkadelic-styled goofiness and blaxploitation films to rap\/hip-hop films, music videos, and other cultural items embraced by stereotypical African American pop culture, such as westerns, superhero films, and martial arts films (although the martial arts is also sourced from blaxploitation flicks). The bizarre vocabulary that Pootie Tang uses has similarities to George Clintonisms, which are found on Parliament\/Funkadelic records (some of the best music you could listen to, by the way), and which have similarities to jive talking'. All of that has continued in the culture and is currently most well known with the jargon used by rappers.I mention all of this not to clue you in to how serious the film is--it's a wacky comedy, after all, but to help quell some of the criticisms that just take the film as stupid, without any basis in or relevance to the world at large.

When a door-to-door salesman shows him a high-tech remote control, Ritter listens to his pitch, and buys into it when he discovers that it's for a new television and satellite system that offers 666 channels of programming--much of which is not available anywhere else. However, the salesman may not have been what he seemed to be, and Knable soon discovers that he may have agreed to a contract that obligated him to give up more than money.Oh, how I loved this film! Director Peter Hyams and the writing crew of Tom S. Parker, Jim Jennewein and Richard Siegel definitely had my number on this one. Stay Tuned is a very clever horror comedy that is extremely underrated and perhaps was a bit mismarketed. Although I'm a huge horror fan, and love horror comedies, I'd never heard of this one before (however, later I did find references to it in a couple horror sources, so it seems it wasn't completely overlooked by the industry and fans). But the horror aspect of the film doesn't appear to be advertised anywhere. I watched this on HBO's Family Channel. Even though Knable's son is important to the plot and there are strong fantasy aspects, this is not really a family film. Not that kids might not like the film, but they'd have to be kids who like horror (comedies) and whose parents let them watch horror (comedies). Enjoyment of the film is also helped by having a familiarity with the material that is being spoofed, and the references are broad enough that it would take years of experience to acquire that familiarity.Why spoofed? Well, on one level, Stay Tuned is just a long series of crafty takes on film and television programs and genres, giving many well-known classics a more immediate horror twist--immediate because they all put our heroes, Knable and his wife Helen (Pam Dawber), in peril in some way. There are many more subtle jokes, as well, and the film even pokes fun at film students\/film geeks. The spoofs range from silly to poignant, and can be as quick as a title or as long as ten minutes or so. One of the best is a classic Warner Brothers-styled animated segment. The style and the quality should not be surprising, as Chuck Jones designed and supervised the animation.Under different hands, maybe this material wouldn't be quite as good as it is. Hyams' direction is spot-on throughout the film, the script (including the dialogue) is very intelligent, and in addition to Ritter and Dawber being as good as I've seen them, Stay Tuned also features Jeffrey Jones (one of my favorite character actors) and Eugene Levy. Both are fantastic.Stay Tuned deserves much wider recognition. It is funny, suspenseful and seems to draw from a well of endless inventiveness. It's as good as any other horror comedy I've seen. There is also a surface message of turning off the television and living your life, which is a worthwhile sentiment, but perhaps a harder sell when it is packaged in a film as excellent as this.A 10 out of 10 from me.

Enjoyment of the film is also helped by having a familiarity with the material that is being spoofed, and the references are broad enough that it would take years of experience to acquire that familiarity.Why spoofed? Well, on one level, Stay Tuned is just a long series of crafty takes on film and television programs and genres, giving many well-known classics a more immediate horror twist--immediate because they all put our heroes, Knable and his wife Helen (Pam Dawber), in peril in some way. There are many more subtle jokes, as well, and the film even pokes fun at film students\/film geeks. The spoofs range from silly to poignant, and can be as quick as a title or as long as ten minutes or so. One of the best is a classic Warner Brothers-styled animated segment. The style and the quality should not be surprising, as Chuck Jones designed and supervised the animation.Under different hands, maybe this material wouldn't be quite as good as it is. Hyams' direction is spot-on throughout the film, the script (including the dialogue) is very intelligent, and in addition to Ritter and Dawber being as good as I've seen them, Stay Tuned also features Jeffrey Jones (one of my favorite character actors) and Eugene Levy. Both are fantastic.Stay Tuned deserves much wider recognition. It is funny, suspenseful and seems to draw from a well of endless inventiveness. It's as good as any other horror comedy I've seen. There is also a surface message of turning off the television and living your life, which is a worthwhile sentiment, but perhaps a harder sell when it is packaged in a film as excellent as this.A 10 out of 10 from me.

When a door-to-door salesman shows him a high-tech remote control, Ritter listens to his pitch, and buys into it when he discovers that it's for a new television and satellite system that offers 666 channels of programming--much of which is not available anywhere else. However, the salesman may not have been what he seemed to be, and Knable soon discovers that he may have agreed to a contract that obligated him to give up more than money.Oh, how I loved this film! Director Peter Hyams and the writing crew of Tom S. Parker, Jim Jennewein and Richard Siegel definitely had my number on this one. Stay Tuned is a very clever horror comedy that is extremely underrated and perhaps was a bit mismarketed. Although I'm a huge horror fan, and love horror comedies, I'd never heard of this one before (however, later I did find references to it in a couple horror sources, so it seems it wasn't completely overlooked by the industry and fans). But the horror aspect of the film doesn't appear to be advertised anywhere. I watched this on HBO's Family Channel. Even though Knable's son is important to the plot and there are strong fantasy aspects, this is not really a family film. Not that kids might not like the film, but they'd have to be kids who like horror (comedies) and whose parents let them watch horror (comedies).

Opening with family tragedy, it then takes necessary time to introduce its characters, really introduce them and give the audience time to get to know them and care about them. During the character study portion, there are only rare implications that something sinister is in the offing.Other reviews have stated that the movie is slow, that it drags, that it's padded out with perhaps unnecessary exposition, but I must disagree - to believe THE BELIEVERS, one must believe a bit oneself. A film that drops the viewer into a breakneck chase from the outset has its place and its advantages in storytelling, but almost invariably such movies are about the chase, rather than the people. THE BELIEVERS is about the people, which separates it from the typical batch of supernatural thrillers.

As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of Friends cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama).

After deeply understand the character-Mia, Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Mia,which is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Mia's smile remind me of another famous actress-Julie Roberts, who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eye-catching and also memorable. Oh,I remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Amélie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But, a great story about grandmother and granddaughter, a education-valued story about mother and daughter, a special story about father and daughter,a ever-sweet story about first love, a beautiful story about friendship. Above all, it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary, the motion picture make her characters believe-like in another artistic way. Just like having read Margaret's story (Gone With The Wind), you then watch O'Selznick's GWTW movie. Your feeling will be like I seemed to be a part of the story. Those characters are just and always around you! Clarisse The Sound of Music is recognized as a movie that is priceless, so, this also recognized the supporting actress's performance is priceless. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. The governess,the grandmother or on Broadway, etc. Helen (Caroline Goodall) played a vital role is Mia's growing period. This daughter and mother is a good role model. Because they show the grand respect for each other. Anyone can't grow without friend, the princess,too. From the friendship with Lilly, Mia knows how to tell the truth, how to apologize and how to deal with something that is uniquely occurred in teenager, which is called Growing Pains. Like other reviewers, I also feel the last sentence Mia told Michael is Soooooooo...... Cool ! -O You saw me when I was invisible. Why we feel cool ? Because that's what true love is. And, especially, that's what true love is to a princess !! Joe is a person we can't ignore. He acted as a imitate friend to Mia. He told her what she should be. And he is virtually the bodyguard. Oh, by the way, he is a very very special one ! Some of the songs in The Princess Diary is also memorable. A Summer Song remind me of those romantic school kisses. The final song Miracles Happen is special designed for this movie, for Mia and also for all of us. Now, I am recommending this movie to YOU from my heart.

One day, on the contrary, she was told to be the Princess of a country, which is very opposite to her former expectation. What a big turning to her life ! What she will undergo ? Mia is my very first and memorable impression about this movie. Anything about her comes from Anne Hathaway's virgin performance. After deeply understand the character-Mia, Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Mia,which is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Mia's smile remind me of another famous actress-Julie Roberts, who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eye-catching and also memorable. Oh,I remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Amélie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But, a great story about grandmother and granddaughter, a education-valued story about mother and daughter, a special story about father and daughter,a ever-sweet story about first love, a beautiful story about friendship. Above all, it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary, the motion picture make her characters believe-like in another artistic way.

Most of the film is an extended backstory telling us how she got there. The backstory starts with Ballou headed back home to Wolf City, Wyoming. It seems that her father, Frankie (John Marley), is having problems with the city, which wants to take over the water rights on his land, and which is prepared to do anything necessary to get it. On the way, Ballou meets and enlists the aid of two crooks, Clay Boone (Michael Callan) and Jed (Dwayne Hickman). Even with the additional aid of Frankie's ranch-hand, Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), they're not enough, so she also sends for famed gunfighter Kid Shelleen (Lee Marvin).Cat Ballou is a good example of comedy in the classic literary sense. Comedy doesn't mean a work that is funny, just like horror doesn't mean a work that is scary. Genre terms do not imply particular emotions. Rather, they're about content and how content is handled. So comedies need not make you laugh, as this one did not make me laugh very frequently, even though some other people found it very funny. That might be one key to enjoying the film, especially for younger or newer audiences--do not watch it expecting to laugh until you cry, or even necessarily laugh at all.Cat Ballou is worth watching, but it's not excellent, at least not until Marvin makes his appearance, and that doesn't occur until about 40 minutes into the film. If Cat Ballou were primarily Marvin's performance, it would be at least a 9. The other material is at best a 6, and dominates enough to bring my overall score down to a 7 out of 10.The problem, for me, is that the other performances are just serviceable. To an extent, most of the actors do not seem to know what to do with the material. The story is much more serious than you'd expect--the same plot could be lifted wholesale and put into a non-comedy western. It wouldn't likely be a very good serious western, though, as the plot is also formulaic and uninspired. None of the characters, with the exception of Ballou, are established very well, and I never really cared what happened to any of them. On the other hand, as a comedy, that might not be so important, and the comic approach somewhat saves the otherwise generic story.Director Elliot Silverstein's pacing tends to be off, and even after Marvin appears, the film occasionally seems to drag. This is one of those films that's just barely over 90 minutes, but it seems like it's three hours long. That's not always a bad thing (I like long films), but in a lighthearted satire, it may not be the best quality.Cole and Kaye are promising when we first see them, but the intermittent songs tend to go on too long, and most of them are the same song with different lyrics. I enjoyed them quite a bit at first, but after I while, my reaction to them was more, Oy, now the film is going to stop for five minutes while they sing over and over about plot points that we've just been shown.However, as I mentioned above, Marvin's performance is excellent (the discussion about whether he should have won the Oscar he did for this role is inconsequential to me--I strongly dislike the Oscars, never watch them (I dislike awards shows in general), and think that they routinely acknowledge poor films and ignore good ones; I have no respect for the Academy). He is amusing as an alcoholic gunfighter. I wanted to know more about his character, to follow him instead of Ballou. He brought depth to the role, easily implying a character with a complex backstory. The scene where we're introduced to Shelleen is easily the best in the film. The only really captivating scene where Shelleen is not the primary focus is the extended scene on the train.Again, Cat Ballou is worth watching, but lower your expectations and have patience.

His acting is very solid and captivating, and he is very convincing as the bad guy. I especially like the part when he tell them about bombs. Bombs must blow, if they don't they're not bombs, they're gold watches. That was cool. And the way they get the hostages out is amazing and cliffhanging, and full of suspense, find out yourself, you'll find it cool.

And not to mention Sandra Bullock of While You Were Sleeping, Ms. Congeniality, A Time To Kill and many others. And not to say the least, the villain Dennis Hopper. His acting is very solid and captivating, and he is very convincing as the bad guy. I especially like the part when he tell them about bombs. Bombs must blow, if they don't they're not bombs, they're gold watches. That was cool. And the way they get the hostages out is amazing and cliffhanging, and full of suspense, find out yourself, you'll find it cool. Recommended to all fans of action, adventure thrillers and to those who love Dennis Hopper.

Apparently an urban legend abounds that this killer known as the Candyman will come behind you when you say his name five times and gut you with his hook. A grad student and friend investigate the legend and find some tangible evidence of his existence. From there on, we, as the audience, are treated to some plot twists involving Virginia Madsen(as the grad student)seeing Candyman - perhaps in reality that only she is privy to or in her dreams or in some other psychological state. What we do know is that murders take place and Madsen is involved somehow. My take on the film is a somewhat mixed one. As with much of Clive Barker's work(this film is based on his novel The Forbidden), I am always a step behind understanding what is exactly going on. Some viewers don't seem to mind that and even embrace it as some type of genius or something. I must confess I do not. Barker's story definitely has flair and there are many memorable scenes in the movie - many of which will make you take a good jump. Director Bernard Rose is a good director creating some truly innovative and evocative scenes. The Chicago tenements are treated with a most frightening realism. Tony Todd makes a scary bogeyman as he portrays the Candyman. And Madsen does a nice job(with a needless nude scene thrown in just in case you lose interest). But I just found the plot too far out there for me to really enjoy the film. Bees were filled in a toilet seat in a disgusting filthy restroom outside...why? I had lots more questions along that vein. The ending did not match the first three quarters of the film in terms of continuity or realism. The film has quite a following, and in large part I can see why - but just don't agree. For me Candyman is neither a good film nor a bad one. Just average.

A lot of people have been writing off this film saying that it copies from lots of films, well get this, Tarantino worked in a video shop before making it big and so he would have had plenty of time to watch the many films on offer. He probably grew to love those films, especially noir, and decided to include the best scenes from those films in his films. Note the plot is like City of Fire or, less obviously, the Asphalt Jungle. Both films are about botched robberies and it's aftermath. I could spend all day defending Tarantino and his alleged copying of films but I don't want to do that. Instead, I want to talk about the actual film itself. Great acting, especially from Harvey Keital, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen among others. The dialogue is witty and fresh not to mention incredibly foul-mouthed but it's foul-mouthed in a good way. Exceptional pieces of dialogue is the 'Like a Virgin' meaning discussion and the commode story by Mr Orange. Sure, the story has been used loads of times but Tarantino breathes new life into it in a way that you can't describe. One of the brilliant factors of the film is the music. 70's music isn't exactly popular in films made outside of the 70's but in this film it doesn't sound out of place and the choice of music is unsurpassed. 'Stuck in the middle with you' during the cop torturing scene and 'Lime in the coconut' at the credits have a relation in some way to what goes on in the film but I'll let you watch and decide for yourself to see if Reservoir Dogs is as good as I say. Watch it and your viewing experience won't be the same.
