How petulantly dissatisfied we are when our fictional characters don't act the way we think they should.

We righteously sit back and say, I see everything so clearly! I have such good taste. I make all the right decisions. I would never behave that way. I would never fall into that trap. I would never come up with such a wild rationalization to torture someone I love. I would hide that evidence, close those blinds, lock that door...  Right. Keep telling yourself that.Initially, this little movie seems to have the deceptive sweet and sour flavor of a romantic comedy, but it delivers more of the sour to those who want their fictional characters flawless as well as beautiful--or comical as well as homely. But that desire is cowardly as well as cliché.The flaws the characters in The Good Girl exhibit are painfully human, and only those blessed with compassion and kindness can look upon the agonizing manifestation of these flaws and appreciate the depth, humanity, realness, and compassion the actors bring to the roles they play. You can open yourself to heartbreak as well as horror when Bubba pleads for Justine to save him. You can cringe at Holden's pretentiousness when he tells Justine that Tom is his slave name. The Good Girl can, if you let it, give you the rare chance to love human frailty.This movie is startlingly real, depressingly real, comically real. That is not to say it is not flawed. Occasionally, it drags. Its ending is curt and somewhat contrived. But the cast is brilliant, funny, pathetic, and charming. Likewise, the writing and directing that evoke such strong performances deserve kudos. (They evoke boring suburban Texas wonderfully.) It is small, intimate, and lovingly made.

It becomes ridiculous. Stuart, the man who brought Leopold to the 21st Century, finds himself detained in a psychiatric ward through a contrived series of events that isn't worth the effort of describing (and it's all played for laughs, even though it isn't the least bit funny), yet for a long, dead stretch of time, the film simply ignores him, in order to concentrate on the courting of his ex-girlfriend Kate, who comes across as the most irritating, shallow, self-absorbed and mean-spirited woman in New York - in addition to being physically unattractive (the plain debutantes we see throwing themselves at an unresponsive Leopold at a Nineteenth-Century ball are far more pleasing to the eye) and not very bright. This woman had nothing to offer Stuart, has nothing to offer Leopold, and has nothing to offer us. She's a waste of everyone's time.

Not enough is made of the vileness of Kate's job. The inevitable scene in which Leopold tells her off for her moral blindness is badly mishandled.

Not enough is made of the vileness of Kate's job. The inevitable scene in which Leopold tells her off for her moral blindness is badly mishandled. What she does may be clearly less wrong than designing weapons for the Pentagon or setting up loans for the World Bank, but it's no less clearly wrong.And what about the time travel? Not only is it (as you'd expect) inconsistent, it is (unlike Back to the Future) inconsistent in a dull and unimaginative way. The immediate effect of taking the inventor of the lift out of the 19th Century is that the lifts stop working. (Yes, I know.) But then, they start working again, and the incident is never referred to again. It's as though the director feels ashamed to have even introduced this plot point in the first place. Rightly so.

In fact, occasionally, I was even impressed.Although none of these teen movies really present an accurate view of high school life, as far as I'm concerned, this one at least faced the fact that sometimes 'cliques' aren't as rigid as they are often presented, that 'popular' people aren't all jerks (and they aren't even happy, much of the time), and that the biggest barrier to enjoying other things is usually the fear of trying something new, not the activity itself.The biggest problem with the movie was not the storyline or the acting - I just didn't feel like I got to know the characters very well. At the end of most romantic 'teen' movies, I feel really happy for one or both of the main characters, but not so much this time.

This movie has been critisized for having too many characters and a rediculous ending, but in fact considering the movie is twice as long as most movies, it fits everything in nicely. This is a character film pure and simple, a chance for some really fine actors to show their chops. For the most part the performances are excellent, although some of them come close to vearing into overacting territory. Everyone talks about Tom Cruise and Juliane Moore but I felt their performances were too over the top for me. Watch for John C. Reilly and Melora Walters (Reilly must have studied Cops religiously because he nailed the condescending police officer rant perfectly), they shine in this movie, and their story is the one I kept rooting for, so nice that Walters' smile is the last thing you see in the movie. And what can be said about William H. Macy? Brilliant and  understated as always, although he seems to be play the same character over and over again, he's like the Joe Pesci of pathetic losers, yes you've seen him in this role before, but he's so damn good at it, why not? The one story I didn't like was the Kid Show, that was a little over the top (no kid would be allowed to swear like that fat kid, especially since he didn't even answer any questions, what's so special about him) and the perfectionist uncaring father was just a little too predictable. But it all made up for it when the kid sees the frogs falling outside his window and says this happens.Which brings me to the much maligned frogs.

Contrary to popular belief, I don't think Anderson gave up on his story and just through it in there out of desperation for an ending to tie it all together. First of all, you don't write something so cleverly and expertly and then give up as people have suggested, secondly, it was Earl Partridges name as producer of the Kid's show that really ties everything together, the frogs is a reference to the beginning prologue stories about coincidental bizarre occurences. Strangely, these events told at the beginning actually DIDN'T happen, yet we believe them because they are presented as fact, yet the frogs falling from the sky was laughed by many people as silly and rediculous when in actual fact, there have been several documented cases of frogs, fish and other things falling from the sky.

It was almost as if he originally wrote the song singing scene as the uniting event and then decided the frog raining was more effective.

That scene in the restaurant did make me lose control of my bladder.The struggle with his father throughout the movie is hilarious.People on this board say you'll only like this movie if you're a Tom Green fan..
