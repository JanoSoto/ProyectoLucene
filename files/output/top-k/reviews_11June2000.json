It is a symphony of destruction created by Director John Woo.When I first found out that Woo was at the helm I knew it would be a completely different film than the first.  I was right.  MI-2 carries about as much flare from Woo that can be allowed for an American audience. MI-2 is an action flick with a very minor plot.  Critics claimed that the first was horrible because the actors were nobodys, the plot was way too much, and there wasn't enough action.  The Mission Impossible universe carried by Tom Cruise is a completely different spy movie than what everyone compares every spy movie to...Bond, James Bond.Bond is an smooth, wealthy, stylish action hero.  Hunt is a rugged, cunning wit.  MI was major plot with enough action to meet the desire.  MI-2 is minor, minor plot with a tremendous amount of action.The sequel is about ten technical steps above the first one due to it's 125 mil. budget (more than The Phantom Menace).  It all really depends on what you prefer in a spy film.Here are my picksMission Impossible---Great plot that takes multiple viewing to grasp the concept.  Eliminates the romance factor that every Bond flick has. Introduced Luther as a renegade hacker who is obviously the best in the world.  Created an environment where Hunt is out on a conquest against practically every important organized jurisdiction in the free world.  It Had character conspiracies that weren't revealed until the awesome final sequence.  Puts you immediately in the movie with the Embassy situation. Is a lot more suspenseful than any movies I've seen in a while.  Has the already-timeless classic scene in the CIA terminal at Langley.  And it ends with the all-too-good feeling that the characters are creating their own separate paths and starting their lives over again.  A new beginning. But, when looking for action it doesn't lack, it just doesn't go beyond the quenching thirst that is present in Woo's pieces.  If you like big name actors you won't like this European rhapsody.  If you refuse to think in a theater you will also not like this intellectual flick.Mission Impossible 2---Writing is not bad.  The directing and every production-related objective is excellent.  A number of scenes were very entertaining to watch, namely the end of the first scene, the car chase, and the last scene on the peninsula.  But, the plot is way overdone in previous atrocities.  maintians the romance factor.  The villain is known throughout the film despite a shallow attempt within the first ten minutes on the plane when you think it's Dimitri but it's not.  They try to explain that he was an ally and he turned but it's painful that they didn't play it along the whole movie.  I personally prefer a European stting in these kinds of flicks.  I don't care too much for Australia.  John Woo made this an action spectacular and I like action but this is Mission Impossible and the piling on of the plot and situations and characters was what made the first one so great.  Hopkins has no influence on the film which is sad to say.  It's a suave, romantic tale with a long-haired, smiling hero and that is the biggest difference.  While the first one was more professional and witty. I'm a music man, and the theme was so great, just awesome, except when Fred Durst comes stumbling in with his weak rapping style so I can't respect MI-2 at all on a music level.  It ends with that new beginning feel but it's got the romance factor.  Ethan Hunt is supposed to be a lone ranger who does it for himself and is basically a renegade pilot who knows what to do at all times.  It has no soul within the relations between MI-2 and the show.  MI, however, only had this with Jim Phelps.  Let's not forget the ending of MI; it indicated a sequel, but in Aruba not Sydney.  The glasses gig was a little outrageous as was the overuse of the facemaker.BOTtOM LINE MI-2 is a stylish Woo, action masterpiece.  If you  prefer Face\/Off to, well, MissionImpossible then you will like MI-2.  I myself like MI-2 but the first one is so great that it overcomes the sequel in a millisecond of consideration.

The Mission Impossible universe carried by Tom Cruise is a completely different spy movie than what everyone compares every spy movie to...Bond, James Bond.Bond is an smooth, wealthy, stylish action hero.  Hunt is a rugged, cunning wit.  MI was major plot with enough action to meet the desire.  MI-2 is minor, minor plot with a tremendous amount of action.The sequel is about ten technical steps above the first one due to it's 125 mil. budget (more than The Phantom Menace).  It all really depends on what you prefer in a spy film.Here are my picksMission Impossible---Great plot that takes multiple viewing to grasp the concept.  Eliminates the romance factor that every Bond flick has. Introduced Luther as a renegade hacker who is obviously the best in the world.  Created an environment where Hunt is out on a conquest against practically every important organized jurisdiction in the free world.  It Had character conspiracies that weren't revealed until the awesome final sequence.  Puts you immediately in the movie with the Embassy situation. Is a lot more suspenseful than any movies I've seen in a while.  Has the already-timeless classic scene in the CIA terminal at Langley.  And it ends with the all-too-good feeling that the characters are creating their own separate paths and starting their lives over again.  A new beginning. But, when looking for action it doesn't lack, it just doesn't go beyond the quenching thirst that is present in Woo's pieces.  If you like big name actors you won't like this European rhapsody.  If you refuse to think in a theater you will also not like this intellectual flick.Mission Impossible 2---Writing is not bad.  The directing and every production-related objective is excellent.  A number of scenes were very entertaining to watch, namely the end of the first scene, the car chase, and the last scene on the peninsula.

The villain is known throughout the film despite a shallow attempt within the first ten minutes on the plane when you think it's Dimitri but it's not.

But you don't want to know about me, just what I think of the movie.This movie is a thoroughly funny film about being dumped, and being a slacker (having once lived in the Hyde Park section of Austin, I know all about the latter, too).  Cusack plays Rob Gordon, a record store owner in Chicago whose girlfriend Laura has just left him.  He spends the film brooding as to why he is always getting dumped by women, usually for other men.Particularly hilarious are the folk-comedy duo Tenacious D as Cusack's loser employees who spend all their time insulting would-be customers and making top 5 lists.

It was cinema number 7. 77 seats only, so it's one of the smallest in Stavanger (Norway). BE has only been shown in this cinema since it had premiere June 2. Today it was only half full and I took place on the first row where I could sit alone to enjoy the show.My first impression was the incredible lousy titles at the start. One of the great things with major sci-fi movies has been their extravagant use of great introductions with apocalyptic music to get the audience in just the right mood before impressive battleships or massive explosions are folded out on the big silver screen. In Battlefield Earth it looked like the title were made using the built in features of a Sony Handycam. I strived hard, but I did not manage to get in any galactic mood.I've seen a lot of bad movies that I've enjoyed. Sure they did not deserve an Oscar, but when it comes to adventure and sci-fi I'm easy to entertain. I guess that would be my reactive mind. ;) I'm still at 35 a big fan of cartoons and as most of us know there isn't a big demand for a story line if just the story telling and craftsmanship is good enough. The same goes for a movie. I treasure movies like the Star Wars and ID4 because of the entertainment value, they gave me something exciting and I willingly let down my critical guard just to be entertained. This never happened during the two hours watching BE, even though I really looked for an opening. In ID4 for example the human air fights with the aliens was rather silly, but still enjoyable to some extent. We all knew the president of America would save the world and the drunken father would give his life to save the day, but at least it had some charm. When cavemen grunted while flying jet planes in BE I was just stunned by how silly a 80 million dollar movie could be.I mean, they start off walking into this city that is supposed to have been left to erode for 1000 years, still the car wrecks looked like they were left there not more that 20 years ago. That's not cute errors, that's an insult to my intelligence when in a movie presented to be a major event. Having been spoiled with the special effects used in the previous century I can't help that I expected something better than what BE offered. Even Brasil had a better scenery than this so this is not a budget thing.After a while the ill-placed grunting by the humans and the put on laughter by the psychlos just became silly and you smile with them in pity. I've never liked Travolta very much as an actor but he's had a couple good roles where the directing and character has fitted his talent. Since this movie was Travolta's pet project the only excuse I can make for him is that it was probably difficult to direct him to make a good appearance in this movie.The story line was basic enough, nothing to write home about. Aliens take over the world and the small group of helpless humans that are left wins it back when they get the right leader. If this is the best Hubbard fiction book then he wasn't a very inventive writer. You know all along how it will end so what could have made it a good movie would be how surprising and inventive the makers bring you to the known ending. There are few, if any, news or surprises in BE. After Planet of the Apes and ID4 I can't understand why they bothered to make BE based on this script. If you can't do it better or very differently then it's good advice to drop the whole idea. In retrospect one can only laugh when reading how people defend their decision to join the making of this tragedy after reading the script.There are many things to get annoyed over. Make-up and costumes that are just plain bad and effects that wouldn't convince anybody unless it was made before 1980. Like the double chin on the guy that ruled the psychlo colony on Earth. When you turn your head it doesn't move with the head like it was a baby's bib. They had done a lot of effort making the details look realistic because of all the close-ups, but it only worked to a certain point as long as the actors did not move a muscle.The use of echoing voices and slow motion in the action scenes was so put on it looked silly. Tons of debris falling and people running in slow motion is boring after awhile. They have not succeeded hiding the very poor cutting of the movie by adding splitting scene effects all over like it was an episode of a TV detective episode from the seventies.Can anybody explain to me why Terl let Jonnie spend time at the human library catching up on human history when he was in a hurry to mine the gold? Or how come the psychlos claims they know everything about humans but still they had no idea about what they liked to eat? Where's the logic in Jonnie learning human mathematics when pumped full of information in the psychlo learning machine, but still psychlos knew so little about humans? The rat thing and the human mathematics were just stupid and didn't have any meaning for the story. Psychlos lived in an old city with skyscrapers built by humans, but still they laughed when talked about humans operating machinery. And what about they finding the door to the vault at Fort Knox open so they could just walk straight in?A 1000 year old storehouses with military equipment is of course all intact, even the walkies and the flight simulators are full of power ready to use. Learning lots of cave men to fly jet planes in 7 days is of course no problem and in the end a whole planet is blown up with a bomb so small it can be carried by one man. Get out of here! That might almost have worked in a Marvel comic, but this movie is aiming much higher than that and that is why the result is a joke. Had Christoffer Reeve showed up in a blue suit I might have at least found the story funny.Another scene that is strange and evidence of the lack of logic in the movie happens in the cages where psychlos keep the humans. Someone shouts that one of the humans know the psychlo language and plan to fight them. Then all the humans suddenly goes ecstatic, shouting and climbing up the grates like crazy monkeys. The characters in this movie aren't even suited for a cartoon, that's how shallow and unreal they appear.Someone should count how many times the word leverage is used, I felt like shouting Use the damn leverage, Jonnie! several times. Poor Barry Pepper had the leading part but Travolta stole the show as the villain. His character was not suited to take over that role and Travolta lacked the talent to get even close to fill the misadjusted role.There might be a good twist in the rest of the story, since this is only half. I can't say. But when it comes to this movie things just didn't add up. It surely didn't do much good for the reputation of L. Ron Hubbard when his name was shown with green letters early in the end credits. If that is how he is to be remembered by the masses (assuming this might haunt us on national TV for years to come) then he does not need any critics.People started walking out after one hours but I stayed to the end. I don't agree that it was a big pain to sit through it all, but it wasn't any pleasure either. Also sat through all the end credits to see if I could spot any interesting names. Found nothing I could recognize, except that the guy responsible for the 2D effects was called Steve Fishman. ;)Do I recommend it? Yes, for people on ARS who have been following BEs release it should make a great excuse to invite some fellow critics over for some snacks and beers when it is released on video. Knowing what you will get I guarantee a fun evening, though probably not in the way intended by top Scientologist chill John Travolta.This truly is a miscarriage of a movie.Well, this is my layman opinion, as a sci-fi and movie fan.
