He's a promising law student with potential to do great things, but all that takes a backseat when his old friend and gambling addict Worm (Norton) is released from prison, only to resume his reckless ways and draw Mike back into the high stakes. Smart, intriguing story with hip dialogue and well-drawn characters played to perfection by an excellent cast. The target audience is obviously those who love to gamble, but there's enough twists and surprises to satisfy a few others as well.

This stars Burt Reynolds as old time Burglar Ernie Mullins. Although Burt is not one of my favorite actors he has made some good movies (Deliverance), (The Longest Yard), (Heat), (The End), and (Boogie Nights) . This is Probably one of his best movies. Along with Reynolds, Casey Siemaszko does a great job as a young Mike Lafeve who runs into Ernie (Burt Reynolds). Brilliant Writing by John Sayles and Great Direction by Bill Forsyth. A great guy flick you shouldn't miss.
