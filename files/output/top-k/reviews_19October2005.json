The actors were just pathetic(what kid would say, This is for my Dad, you no good son-of-a-*****), and the death\/action scenes just sucked. I honestly felt they just wanted certain elements, like a blood splat scene.First off, the people hardly seemed surprised that machines were taking over, I know that just Woah doesn't cut it.Only 2 other machine things harmed people(soda machine(THE SODA CANS KILLED ALL THE CHILDREN????) and meat cutter), the rest were ALL trucks. I, personally, would like to see a paper shredder devouer an infant or something much more creative than just trucks sloooowwwllyyyy driving into someone who just waits there and flails his arms like he's not in a giant open space. Seriously, those truck drivers and actors did NOT want to do stunts.Also, LAME ENDING!!! That king truck didn't even put up a fight!! Dude shoots a rocket launcher(oh, come ON, heck, the owner of the gas station had a whole freaking cellar full of guns!! But a rocket launcher? Where do you get that??)from half a mile away, and just that shot takes it down. WTF??? OK, short summary, do NOT watch this movie if you want a How will they get out of this situation??, or a Those are some great actors!! movie.Alpha~ ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2005","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Absolutely horrible(as a movie, of course).

Specifically, it's more creative than most of them, due to the fact that Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) has to go inside peoples' dreams to kill them. His blade-fingers are like a character in and of themselves. This is one movie that no horror-fetishist can afford to miss.

While too many horror flicks have relied on gore, this one relies on the subconscious, and other things that we don't realize. And of course, there's the ending. I literally did not see that coming, although there were a number of clues throughout the movie. All that I can say is, you are going to have your mind blown. M. Night Shyamalan truly created an impressive piece of cinema history here, and of his later movies, only Unbreakable came close to equalling this one's quality.On another note, I think that it was appropriate that The Sixth Sense came out in 1999, when I was 15. It was named by Entertainment Weekly as one of the many movies that year that revolutionized the movie industry (along with Election, The Blair Witch Project, American Beauty and Being John Malkovich).
