Soon horrible things begin to happen to them.This does get a reasonable boost from talented Geoffrey Rush's delicious Vincent Price imitation, and the delightful bitchiness delivered by Janssen.

Some remakes are very good like the Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong of 2005, or William Friedkin's remake of the French film, Wages of Fear, Sorcerer. The Blob fits well, but not great. The original Blob came out in 1958 and it told the story of a meteorite from outer space crash landing in a small, quiet town. In that movie, the Blob ate everyone who got in its way, slowly and quickly getting bigger and bigger as it kept devouring people. 30 years later, a remake was born. Instead of Steve McQueen playing the leading role as a teenage rebel, who tries to warn the townspeople, Kevin Dillon plays the teenage rebel and he is convincing as the leading man. Like in the original, the meteorite crashes into the ground and quickly starts to devour the teens. Meanwhile, the police thinks that Dillon killed the first victim, but they realize that what they are dealing with is something worse than a punk kid. Dillon's character realizes that a scientific government team is investigating the remains of the meteorite and tried to cover up the trouble and focusing mainly on the creature, rather than worry about the town. Soon enough, the Blob goes a wild rampage devouring everyone that gets in its way. It eats up teenagers at a movie theater, wreaks havoc on the town and destroys the entire scientific government team. The Blob has a good premise and has a nice touch on the science-fiction\/horror element. But, the movie is not as great as the original because this time, it's set in 1988, where teenagers are the main movie-going audience and behave a lot more different than the teenagers in the original. Instead, the movie shows a parody of slasher films, whereas in the original, the movie showcases a B monster movie. I also like how the humor is present in a movie like this. In one scene, the supporting character played by Shawnee Smith, goes out with a guy that was in her father's drugstore. Of course, his buddy has to buy him condoms and the father realizes that it's the same kid that didn't want to buy the condoms himself. (His friend had to paid for them). There's a parody of routine slasher films, in which a local movie theater showcases a parody of what looks like a Friday the 13th rip-off. There are a lot of fine performances by Shawnee Smith, who also plays a teenage girl, who also tries to warn the town. Her relationship with Kevin Dillon's character in this movie is very good and sort of sweet. I like the special effects in The Blob, which is cheesy, but that kind of set-up is what I like about this movie. It doesn't push itself as hard and it's structure and story-telling makes it fun to follow and enjoy. The Blob is a good natural sci-fi remake that does work. ★★★ 3 stars.

It just kept on keeping me guessing and on top of that, the special effects work was absolutely incredible. Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) is an intelligent but somewhat eccentric scientist and he meets Veronica (Greena Davis), a journalist for a science magazine at a press event. He takes Veronica back to his lab where he shows his invention, a teleportation device. It uses two different pods that can transfer objects back and forth. Although, Seth has yet to make anything but inanimate objects transport, he wants to be able to do so with humans. Stathis Borans (John Getz) is an editor at the magazine Veronica works at and he is still in love with her from a previous relationship, he is trying to get in the way with Veronica's private work with Seth that she is doing completely on her own.Eventually, things go wrong during his human experimentation and Seth begins to become mutated. He becomes essentially super human but little does he know that it isn't as good as he thinks. Jeff Goldblum gives an amazing performance, at first, he is an eccentric scientist but he completely transforms his performance halfway through into a man with an ego and eventual sad realizations. The special effects work is one of the best parts about the film, with extensive make-up work on Jeff Goldblum later on and things of that nature, it's pretty damn incredible to look at, and it stills holds up very well today. Each time more special effects were used, I just continued to get blown away each time as they continued to impressive throughout the entirety of the film.It isn't just special effects and good performances though, the story is a tragic one. The very last part made the movie for me. In fact, the last 30 minutes itself is incredible as things keep on twisting and turning. The very last minute of the film kept me gripped till the end and leaves you with things to think about as well as an incredibly memorable film. Overall, this is a great science fiction\/horror piece that is most definitely worth a watch considering nearly everything in it works.

It fires our imagination, and keeps us on our toes. And even in the lighter moments when the intent is not to horrify, we keep watching because we can get invested in the characters. The dialogue is intelligent and the house itself is remarkably effective. Filmed in England by the versatile Robert Wise (because the MGM studios in London were willing to provide a slightly larger budget), it's got the kind of atmosphere you can only get in these classic black & white thrillers.Charismatic Richard Johnson plays Dr. John Markway, an anthropologist eager to obtain some sort of verification that the supernatural exists. He believes that the ancient Hill House, constructed in the previous century, is likely to provide him with evidence, given its sad and sordid history. Death has always occurred in or near the house. He gathers two people, lonely and pathetic Eleanor (Julie Harris) and sassy Theo (Claire Bloom), to the house, convinced that Eleanor's history and Theo's abilities make them receptive to supernatural phenomena. Also tagging along is Luke (Russ Tamblyn), a young skeptic motivated by profit and hoping to inherit the place.Before long, the group does have strange experiences. There are loud banging noises in the night. Eerie whispering voices. A door that bulges inward. And *something* or *someone* holds the terrified Eleanor's hand during the night. And that's the beauty of something like this, although of course some horror fans might not see it that way. We don't have to see any actual ghosts to get the chills. Wise manipulates us with skill, and it's the little things that make us squirm in our seats, like doorknobs turning. Excellent cinematography by Davis Boulton and spooky music by Humphrey Searle also help matters a lot.Harris delivers a true tour-de-force performance as the unstable Eleanor. We hear a lot of her inner monologues and realize just how tormented she is, and how desperate she is to escape from the reality of her life outside this house. Bloom is a delight as she eggs on Eleanor and ever so subtly comes on to her. Johnson is fun to watch; his fascination with his subject matter and his experiment is infectious. Tamblyn isn't as good as the others, but he does provide a more practical attitude to contrast the open-minded Johnson.

It is very advanced for its time regarding set design and visual effects. I may not have watched it at the time when it was out but I can imagine how it would impact the audience at that time. It's also filled with gore and violence that will make one flinch. It will also send ones pulse racing as the intense moments filled in. However, apart from all the action there's barely an adept dialogue to follow through making some scenes tedious.

Unfortunately, he finds that anybody who gets close to the dog gets targeted by a big hairy brutish animal, the result of the same kind of genetic testing that created the dog.

The music is by Joel Goldsmith, eldest son of fellow composer Jerry Goldsmith, and his score does sound similar to what his dad did for First Blood a few years previous.

So this original film was the spark that ignited a whole genre of classic TV.Yet despite all that...holy crapenstein this film was errrr...crap!. Now I've seen a lot of these old fantasy flicks from the 60's but this has to be the most boring sci-fi I've ever seen I kid you not. The plot is nuts, something about a meteor shower that is on fire threatening the Earth with an extreme rise in heat temperatures. So the Captain of this fancy ass submarine comes up with a plan to extinguish these flaming meteors by firing a nuke at them on a certain day and at a certain time. It has to be this exact time and day so the nuke will put out the flames and blast the meteors back into space. Wut?? say again? repeat all after the plot is nuts.The 'excitement' comes from the fact that this plan is rejected (really?) and only the US President can authorise it. So the devious Captain ignores this, gets his sub into position and tries to get in contact with El Presidente before the time slot is missed, of course there is a saboteur on board which makes things even more exciting!.I mean seriously there is nothing happening in this film! the plot is too stupid for words and makes no sense.

So right away that compromises the films semi realistic approach, at first I thought it was sort of serious, outlandish sci-fi but kinda serious with sensible elements. The giant squid kinda turns the whole thing into complete fantasy and ruins that feel, I mean what next? mermaids saving the crew?.I think one of the main issues for me was the fact the film just looks totally dull, the action is lifeless and visually its just bland and plain. All the sets are clearly sets (they used the same sets for the TV show), the colours are stale, the costumes are drab, the sub model looks like something you'd see in 'Flesh Gordon' (a dildo with a windscreen) and most of the film is set within this monochrome tin can. I get the feeling the sub has been designed like a spacecraft, sleek, smooth and intimidating like a shark, as apposed to the steampunk-like design of the classic Nautilus. A wondrous and fantastical craft ready to set sail into unknown deep sea adventures...so what happened?. There are a few scenes outside the sub but nothing much inspiring goes on, the only sequence with some life is the squid attack naturally...but don't go expecting anything of Disney standards now.Imagine the original Star Trek show but without any planet hopping or alien encounters, just the crew on the ship having mechanical issues and chats...constantly. Yep well this is pretty much this film to a tee, a tonne of blokes on a sub with the obligatory blonde female sidekick doing virtually nothing but talk, with the odd shaky cam action sequence for good measure (with obligatory red flashing emergency light).

All bad jokes aside however, 1982's re imagining of Cat People is a pretty entertaining erotic thriller that borrows the general concept from the original '42 version but manages to stand as its own film. Set in the seemly magical city of New Orleans, it all begins when Irena Gallier (the stunning Nastassja Kinski) arrives in town to meet her long lost brother, Paul (Malcolm McDowell with his usual devilish charm). But the happy family reunion doesn't go as planned as she soon discovers that she and her brother are members of an ancient line of cat people who transform into larger than normal black panthers when excited or sexually aroused and can only mate with one of their own, that being Paul. As you can imagine, this comes as quite a shock to Irena who comes to realize that she cannot make love to kindly zoo keeper Oliver Yates (John Heard, the father from Home Alone) without the possibility of killing him. The film does a very admirable job of bringing the old story into the 80's while injecting it with a certain erocticism and dream like quality that the '42 version probably was not allowed to do. Part of this infusion comes from Nastassja Kinski's seductive charm who, with her catlike eyes and vulnerability, would be enough to entice any man (it also helps that the producers could show Ms. Kinski without clothes in a good many scenes). But it's also the over all direction of the film by Paul Schrader that gives People a dream like quality, with brilliant shots and cinematography of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou set to the electronic synth sound of Giorgio Moroder (the brains behind such memorable scores like Scarface and Midnight Express). There are some noticeable lapses in realism, such as why wouldn't Oliver be a little bit more concerned when Irena comes home naked and covered in blood in one scene! But the over all look and feel of the film more than makes up for these draw backs. To sum it up, for anyone who holds the original near and dear to their heart and can't bear to think of it being remade, then you probably want to avoid this. But for anyone who is open to seeing a decent re imagining or who hasn't seen the original and is in the mood for a good erotic thriller, then I'd say go for it. Also featuring Annette O'Toole, Ruby Dee, Frankie Faison and a very cool theme song in the form of David Bowie's Putting out the Fire. Enjoy!

All bad jokes aside however, 1982's re imagining of Cat People is a pretty entertaining erotic thriller that borrows the general concept from the original '42 version but manages to stand as its own film. Set in the seemly magical city of New Orleans, it all begins when Irena Gallier (the stunning Nastassja Kinski) arrives in town to meet her long lost brother, Paul (Malcolm McDowell with his usual devilish charm). But the happy family reunion doesn't go as planned as she soon discovers that she and her brother are members of an ancient line of cat people who transform into larger than normal black panthers when excited or sexually aroused and can only mate with one of their own, that being Paul. As you can imagine, this comes as quite a shock to Irena who comes to realize that she cannot make love to kindly zoo keeper Oliver Yates (John Heard, the father from Home Alone) without the possibility of killing him. The film does a very admirable job of bringing the old story into the 80's while injecting it with a certain erocticism and dream like quality that the '42 version probably was not allowed to do. Part of this infusion comes from Nastassja Kinski's seductive charm who, with her catlike eyes and vulnerability, would be enough to entice any man (it also helps that the producers could show Ms. Kinski without clothes in a good many scenes). But it's also the over all direction of the film by Paul Schrader that gives People a dream like quality, with brilliant shots and cinematography of New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou set to the electronic synth sound of Giorgio Moroder (the brains behind such memorable scores like Scarface and Midnight Express). There are some noticeable lapses in realism, such as why wouldn't Oliver be a little bit more concerned when Irena comes home naked and covered in blood in one scene! But the over all look and feel of the film more than makes up for these draw backs. To sum it up, for anyone who holds the original near and dear to their heart and can't bear to think of it being remade, then you probably want to avoid this.

Some Altman films are too quiet for my taste, but in a western genre usually built around action and drama, Altman's choice to construct a film around a day-to-day business that treats the Western as a party trick, sliced away from reality - this alone distinguishes this film from most other Westerns.It's hard to know if the film is fair to the real character of Buffalo BIll, as the film was produced during the revisionist post Vietnam Hollywood of the 1970s, but this film benefits from that ear's large freedom to go where it wants to.it's critiques of American history and US treatment of American Indians are as withering as in any film, but this film focuses as much on the myth of the West as the usual topic of the mistreatment of Native Americans.It intersects these observations on the reality of American history with exposes of show business itself, and turns it into a multiple-angle mix that provokes thought the way good art can.People criticize Paul Newman's performance as over-the-top and phony, but he offers a less glamorous but possible interpretation, eminently watchable as a man who thrills at putting on a show, and yet rails that he is common in comparison to the great Sitting Bull. He's a man stuck in a traveling show about a topic he has real nostalgia for, the great outdoors adventures of his young life. This film is a very effective statement on the gnawing loss and emptiness of growing old, especially when peddling what made one great in youth. It also shows a character driven mad by guilt for his part in destroying a world he greatly admired. People may say the film makes Bill look like a man who couldn't care less about the West nor the Native Americans, but I think he's shown to care and admire them. He just can't get over his own lack of worth or personal responsibility. You could even say he's driven mad by guilt over the conquest of the West.The climax is not superfluous - in it, Newman as Bill says 'it's hard being white, putting on shows for people with no lives.' and 'God chose me to be white'.

So Mary isn't all rosy cheeks and prim and proper with a sense of fun in addition to the much needed discipline. In certain eyes, she was a bit crusty, but for the stage musical what did they choose? The Julie Andrews look, of course!That disappointing musical made the rather dark story even darker by the inclusion of Mr. Banks' former nanny, an evil harpy who feeds her wards brimstone and treacle in one of the worst new songs heard on Broadway since the beginning of the millennium. The movie was appropriately dark for what it was all about, and the night scenes of London are perfect for the gaslight era of Jack the Ripper and other sordid criminals. Here, Mary pops in out of nowhere when exhausted nanny Elsa Lanchaster walks out with barely a goodbye. Suffragette mom Glynis Johns is too busy fighting for votes for women to take care of the kids while pop David Tomlinson is a stuffy account manager at an even stuffier bank. Chimney sweep and all-around Mr. Fix-It Dick Van Dyke is Mary's old pal who sings like a dream, dances with Ray Bolger like rubber legs and encourages the kids thanks to his uncle Ed Wynn to laugh their way to a tea party on the ceiling.There are so many delightful moments in this, partially animated, and the Oscar-Winning Supercalafragilisticexpialidotious is certainly memorable, even if I prefer Feed the Birds as the best song in the film.

The Jolly Holiday dance is certainly one of the most memorable sequences ever on film, and the Step in Time! number, while well choreographed, seems pointless towards the plot.

The best I can tell is that Pokemon are naturally aggressive despite the majority of them seeming pretty nice and will fight each other in the wild with or without humans involved. This theory is backed up by later movies, usually from Legendary pokemon. So I guess one day some people were like, hey lets make this a sport.The Ugly Luckily nothing in this movie is ugly, future films won't be so lucky...looking at you Movie 9....Overall this movie is a must watch for anyone that has ever played Pokemon, watch the anime, or even seen a card. 10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure"},{"date":"26 October 2013","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is fantastic!

A romanticised re-telling of the celebrated romance between English soldier John Smith and Indian princess Pocahontas, it entertains in the main even if it occasionally panders a little too much to the pre-teen market with just too many cute animals whose presence you think may, in true JarJar Binks style, have had more to do with spin-off merchandising than enhancing the narrative. The overly-idealised images of the dashingly handsome, heroic and muscular Smith and the gamine and exotic beauty of Pocahontas for me somehow manage to somehow belittle their characters, at the expense of credibility and I suspect, true audience sympathy, but in its favour, the film arrives at a not completely happy-ending which is to its credit.Of course, being a Disney film, there has to be an identifiable bad guy for our hero and heroine, here personified by the greedy, avaricious figure of Lord Ratcliffe who has commissioned the expedition in a last-gasp attempt to strike it rich with the discovery of gold and also enhance his failing social position at court back home. Again however, he's too broadly painted for my taste, massively corpulent and duplicitous from the start. Likewise the contrast between the uncaring colonialists and the innocent native Indians comes across as clumsy and clichéd too.Maybe I'm being too severe, as all Disney animated films seemingly must posit, for the kids as much as anyone else the big moral of good versus evil, but being based this time on a true story and not a fairy tale, felt more subtlety could have been observed in the telling.On the plus side, the songs are good, with clever lyrics, even if you're not exactly whistling them after the film is over and the animation is fluid and engaging, although again i didn't recall too many Wow! stick-in-the-memory moments immediately afterwards. The voice acting too is mostly good although Billy Connolly's too-old and overly-recognisable broad Scottish accent jars occasionally.Maybe I'm being over-critical and it's easy to slightly denigrate the film with reference to previous Disney classics, but while pleasant enough, this didn't feel like one of the studio's very best outings.

It is about a lot of things. Multiple themes and open to interpretation in many ways. Themes of suburban life, the meaning of life, death, pedophilia, the American family, obsession with physical beauty, etc. I find it very rare to find a film that can actually deal with so many themes and not feel like a humongous mess (see films like Prometheus and you'll get what I mean in terms of humongous mess). It has ambition that pays off in nearly every way. I came into this movie with no real expectations, I knew nothing about it and it surprised me. I didn't expect such a sprawling film that managed to deal with so much in just two hours. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged office worker who hates his job, it opens with his wonderful piece of narration, which typically, I would hate but when it's so well-written&#x85;I just can't hate it. I compare the narration of this film to many of Scorsese's films where it is just so good that I can't hate it or it just doesn't feel cheap or lazy like most narration should. Lester is married to Carolyn (Annette Bening) who is a real-estate broker and wants to be nothing but successful. Jane (Thora Birch) is their daughter and hates her parents with a passion, and has a low self-esteem. Most of this sounds like a stereotypical set-up, nothing really out of the ordinary but it is so far from that. It just keeps building up with exploration of themes in a unique way especially with the performances from the entire cast, most notably Spacey who delivers each and every line with absolute perfection, whether it be sarcastic, dark, serious, or completely insane, Spacey does it perfectly. The Burnham's family also have a new neighbor, a family of three including Frank Fits (Chris Cooper), his wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), and their teenage son, Ricky (Wes Bentley). Frank is a retired member of the Marine Corps and is a strict man who can't trust his son. Regardless, the catalyst of the plot is when Lester sees Jane's friend, Angela (Mena Suvari) and he becomes obsessive about her, planning aspects of his life around her. This film is ambitious in the best way possible. Everything feels like it was worth it in the end. You'll leave it thinking, thinking a lot, and not just about a single thing, about many, many, things. It's a film hard to put into words, it's different even if it doesn't seem so at a first glance, if anything, it may seem like something typical but is so far from it. It isn't a film that every person who watches it will have the same interpretation, it'll be subjective to your own life and what you have gone through yourself. For example, as someone who has a serious distaste for suburban life, I love the way it portrays it in a dark, fairly disturbing manner. But, it still has plenty of universal themes that really apply to everyone regardless of the mist of insanity the movie gives off. Overall, this is a sprawling, ambitious, film that has so much to offer just in a total of two hours, it'll leave you with so much just about life in general and on top of that, the ensemble cast is incredible.

I first saw this film as a child and thought it was terrifying and now I just think it's...terrifying in a completely different way. I find the majority of the characters surrounding Ripley bland. James Cameron, for whatever reason, decided that it would be a great idea to add a child into the mix that Ripley could feel motherly to. I think he assumed this would make women connect more to the film somehow, by saying women are at their best defending children, or something? Yeah, no.I think the child was just an annoying, cheap distraction attempting to pull at the heart strings, which for me just became a hindrance to Ripley's character rather than advancing her. I get that Ripley's daughter dies because it is the future, but Cameron did not NEED to try to convince us she was oh so motherly by giving us Newt. Hick's is not only so bland, but he is oddly one of the few male characters out there that's sole purpose in a movie is to be a romantic interest for a female protagonist. Newt and Hicks are just there to create this paper family dynamic with Ripley. I don't know the last time I rolled my eyes so much.As for the rest of the characters? All of the marines are nearly the same, save gender difference and the somewhat entertaining and sometimes annoying whiner of the group MAN!, who is differentiated only by his cowardice and catchphrase. Some may say to change my mind... But it's an action film, not a horror film...it's a different tone... As an action film, I believe it is a poor one. There was a lot of off screen fire and when the aliens were shown it either didn't look menacing or there was just a lot of flashing lights where you could hardly see them.The soldier gear was clunky and illogical... predicting that sometime in the future, rather than going smaller in technology we would strap clunky cameras to helmets and large obnoxious looking flashlights to the shoulder rather than make them discreetly smaller or more convenient. Neither of those pieces of technology would be convenient for a scientist OR a soldier, one swipe of an alien claw would knock those cameras and flashlights out.Oh and let's talk about the ending for a moment which is supposed to be a callback to Alien where a suited up Ripley knocks that pesky alien off into space through an airlock. Wait, wait, wait...back up for a second. In Alien, she suits herself up, but in Aliens, she not only doesn't consider how this would effect Bishop and little Newt, but she OPENS AN AIRLOCK INTO SPACE WITHOUT A SUIT. SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFOCATED OR SUCKED OUT...or more than likely BOTH. It doesn't make sense as awesome as it looks. It is actually QUITE stupid, but yay, the alien is dead and SHE doesn't get sucked out and BISHOP doesn't get sucked out and NEWT doesn't get sucked out...and ...that doesn't make sense.Any redeeming moments were few and far between for me, but those moments simply move this film from one star to two. Yes it was the film that introduced the Alien Queen, but this iconic moment wasn't enough for me to enjoy the film as a whole. I consider this film one of the most overrated films out there undeserving of it's overall rating. So of course, at the end tralala, family dynamic survives along with the android and... blegh. I really did not like this film.
