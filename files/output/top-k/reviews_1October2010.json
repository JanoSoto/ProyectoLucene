Universal Studios and James Whale were gods who created life with this film.After watching Dracula (1931) and being disappointed, I thought that Frankenstein wouldn't be too much to my liking either, but I was wrong. There were no parts in this film that didn't keep my attention. At times, though, I felt that this was a mediocre movie, but as soon as those thoughts arose I always came across a scene that would take the film to a new level.Before talking of specific scenes, I want to mention the obvious things that I must talk about. The writing for this film was very good. Nothing like the book (but I knew that before going into the movie thankfully) but it at least grasps the idea and themes of the book and portrays them quite well. James Whale also did some great directing on his part. One of the two of the most impacting scenes in the film were displayed fantastically and without a doubt perfect. The acting by the more villainous characters of the film (Dr Frankenstein, the Monster, and Fritz) was phenomenal, while the rest of the acting was quite average in my opinion.The writing for this film took many specific themes from the book, especially the 'God-like' theme that is the most important. It isn't portrayed very well in this movie, at least not nearly as much as in the book, but it is still there. The book is much more subtle in showing it's themes of 'God' and 'creation'. The film has these, but not as many, and not as subtle either. I didn't see many thought of 'God' and 'creation' up until the scene where Frankenstein's Monster comes to life and Dr. Frankenstein exclaims Oh, in the name of God! Now I know what it feels like to be God! That scene shoved into your face those two themes, but they did it in a more polite way than just forcing them on you.James Whale's directing seemed very mundane at times, nothing to extraordinary. He would just shoot the scenes and nothing seemed too unique to me. But, as soon as I would start thinking the film is mediocre, he would come across and take another scene but shoot it in the most fantastic way. One instance of this is the most hard-hitting scene of the film, when the farmer is holding his daughter, little Maria, after the Monster had accidentally drowned her and is sullenly walking through the village. What a very sad and upsetting scene as the camera takes one shot to show him walking past all of the partying villagers with the deepest of emotionless faces a man can show.I must also give Whale credit for shooting the scene where the Monster throws Dr. Frankenstein off of the building. At the time of the film, back in 1931, to show someone being thrown off a building, hitting a windmill, and then falling to what looks like his death, must not only have been controversial and surprising to see but also very difficult to shoot without the use of the effects we have now. Two thumbs up to you James; you are indeed a master of your craft.As for the acting, most of it was bland, except for the portrayals of Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Fritz. Colin Clive's performance of Henry Frankenstein started out as mediocre as the rest of the characters but increasingly got better throughout the film as the character and characters around him developed and changed. Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster gave a great performance. All he really needed to do was wobble around and give out groans and moans, but Karloff brought much more to the character than the average person could have and he made the Monster feel much more human than he was, which was perfect. Last, but certainly not least, Dwight Frye's performance as Fritz was stunning. Maybe it's just me, but Frye seems to be one of the greatest actors of all time that could portray such dark, disturbing, and insane characters. Probably the most disturbing scene of the film is when Fritz is showing his 'power' over the Monster with fire by scaring it over and over again with the torch he is carrying. It shows just how terrible human kind can be and how we can go from mere human to terrible monster just by having power over others. That is still something that exists in societies today and is still a thought that is as terrifying as ever.Overall I must say this film greatly exceeds my expectations and is now one of my favorite horror films of all time. A timeless classic with themes that are still relevant today and some of the earliest stunning acting and directing in horror film history that could still be watched and learned from today.9.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Dr. Frankenstein was a god who created life with his monster.

The Invisible Man throws up some rather obvious technical ones, which are craftily solved by an adept special effects team. However he also gives his creators many further difficulties, which have more to do with the nature of the horror genre itself. Luckily, producer Carl Laemmle Junior and director James Whale were two of the best creative minds when it came to the horror format.First of all, how do you make the picture adequately scary? This isn't really a science picture &#x96; it's supposed to be spooky. Of course, there is tension from the fact that when invisible he could strike anywhere, but this isn't just a thriller, and strong imagery is needed for that eerie touch. However when he is clothed and bandaged the titular man is necessarily macabre. Whale emphasises the shadowy sets, ceilings visible, heavy with foreground clutter, to enhance the atmosphere. But the trouble is really bound to start when it begins to cross the minds of audience members that, whenever the invisible man is completely unseen, he is of course also completely naked. Naturally, one or two viewers will begin to titter.So how do you stop your horror from descending into a farce? By allowing it to do so, of course. Like Frankenstein, an earlier Universal horror also directed by Whale, The Invisible Man is at times gleefully silly. We have Una O'Connor shrieking like a fishwife in an exaggerated sketch on the role she was playing around the same time in Cavalcade, and the rarely-seen E.E. Clive is just wonderful as a bluff cockney copper. The star himself Claude Rains simply has fun with the part, playing The Invisible Man like some mischievous kid. The scene in which several people are pushed over a cliff by his unseen hand is almost like something out of Monty Python in tone.And yet the whole production is anchored in horror roots. Rains's performance also has some disturbing touches to it. There is an animalistic snarl to his voice, and his most childish moments are punctuated by a creepy maniacal laugh (interestingly, Rains's original cockney accent is quite perceptible, especially in his first scene with William Harrigan). Whale's continual balancing of the two elements is, if anything, more delicate and skillful than it was in Frankenstein, even though the earlier film is marginally superior. The action veers continually from slapstick into genuine menace. Whale's use of close-ups is superb. They aren't there for dramatic impact &#x96; they aren't held for long enough &#x96; but for shock value, whether that be comedic (Una O'Connor popping up like a jack-in-the-box) or gruesome (cutting down the line on the bandaged face of Rains).It's not easy to get this all right, and The Invisible Man is a kind of horror that only really ever thrived at Universal Studios in the early 30s, thanks to the clever team they had at their disposal. It's probably why the genre has ever since been more or less relegated to trashy B-movie status. Now and then has come the very occasional truly terrifying classic in which great care has gone into every element. And then there are deliberate comedy-horrors, most of which are appalling.

Now he's released from the hospital, thanks to his caring doctor Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia). Norman returns to his former life, but very soon... He starts hearing his mother's voice again. Since he has an job at the local diner, he becomes friends with an seemingly nice young girl (Meg Tilly). But not everything, what it seems... When Norman is been receiving mysterious phone calls claiming to be his mother, seeing strange notes and seeing his mother by the window! Slowly Norman is going crazy again but it seems that, there is mysterious strangers are playing with his life.Directed by the late Richard Franklin (F\/X 2The Art of Illusions, Clock and Dagger, Link) made an surprisingly good sequel with some terrific suspenseful sequences and dark humour. The highlight of the sequel, of course, is seeing Perkins reprising his famous role. Perkins brings humour, strangeness, creepiness and oddly affecting in his performance. Tilly gives an strong performance in this. Loggia is fine, i wish, he had an bigger role. Vera Miles reprising her role from the original and Dennis Franz seems to be having an great time with their roles.The new DVD from Universal has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 4.0 Surround Sound. DVD's only extra is a teaser trailer. It would have been nice, if there was an commentary track by the filmmaker or by screenwriter Tom Holland (The Beast Within, Class of 1984, Fright Night). Psycho 2 was an box office hit back in 1983 with well received reviews. Fans of the original seemed to love it as well. But there is an few flaws from otherwise first-rate script. Some fans were not happy with the unexpected conclusion. Some see it as being extremely silly or not being faithful to the original. Still Psycho 2 is one of the most underrated sequels ever made.

Now he's released from the hospital, thanks to his caring doctor Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia). Norman returns to his former life, but very soon... He starts hearing his mother's voice again. Since he has an job at the local diner, he becomes friends with an seemingly nice young girl (Meg Tilly). But not everything, what it seems... When Norman is been receiving mysterious phone calls claiming to be his mother, seeing strange notes and seeing his mother by the window! Slowly Norman is going crazy again but it seems that, there is mysterious strangers are playing with his life.Directed by the late Richard Franklin (F\/X 2The Art of Illusions, Clock and Dagger, Link) made an surprisingly good sequel with some terrific suspenseful sequences and dark humour. The highlight of the sequel, of course, is seeing Perkins reprising his famous role. Perkins brings humour, strangeness, creepiness and oddly affecting in his performance. Tilly gives an strong performance in this. Loggia is fine, i wish, he had an bigger role. Vera Miles reprising her role from the original and Dennis Franz seems to be having an great time with their roles.The new DVD from Universal has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 4.0 Surround Sound. DVD's only extra is a teaser trailer. It would have been nice, if there was an commentary track by the filmmaker or by screenwriter Tom Holland (The Beast Within, Class of 1984, Fright Night). Psycho 2 was an box office hit back in 1983 with well received reviews. Fans of the original seemed to love it as well. But there is an few flaws from otherwise first-rate script. Some fans were not happy with the unexpected conclusion. Some see it as being extremely silly or not being faithful to the original. Still Psycho 2 is one of the most underrated sequels ever made.

I'll start with the films flaws. Firstly, the main character is very weak, I'm not sure whether it's poor writing or bad acting but he just comes across as an idiot rather than the deep, flawed, entrepreneur that the film wanted to portray. Secondly, even in the year 2,000 floppy disks were an ageing technology, without giving much away there's a scene where an entire companies data is copied to a floppy disk. The film includes a lot of central characters and doesn't provide any back-story for any of them, this wouldn't be so much of a problem if the central character wasn't so weak but by the end of it you feel as though you haven't seen a single character develop or even begin to understood any of the characters but you have just seen a good film.Praise This film is amazing. The film really captures the desires of society and gives them a face. The characters really convey the shallow two facedness you come across every day where they're happy and pleasant until something happens that could even remotely damage their cash flow. Every person you've ever met that wanted to make a quick buck is in this film, the consumerism and lack of social conscience that constantly plagues society is so prevalent in this film. It also approaches the topic of share trading from a much more accessible angle, they don't put much effort into adding the right industry terms or showing scenes of the NY stock exchange - they show the consequences of share trading, the lack of understanding of the average consumer and give you a better understanding of where the money comes from. If you're anything like me then this film takes you on a ride where you are the main character every step of the way until finally you return to life with a much deeper understanding of the desires people succumb to in modern society. This film includes very young appearances by a lot of famous actors, Ben Affleck, Vin Diesel etc. who all pull their weight to give life to the film. I'm explaining the film in a very stale way but I can't help it, it's on par with 'fight club' - you can't explain why the film is good in a way that does it justice, just watch 2 hours of cinema that will improve your quality of life.

Houseboat director Melville Shavelson inked and helmed this ambitious but muddled biography of World War II military hero Colonel David 'Mickey' Marcus (Kirk Douglas of Spartacus) who served as an adviser to Franklin Roosevelt. Marcus behaves likes an insubordinate S.O.B. when he ignores the orders of his superior officer and bails out over Normandy. He carries on a love & hate relationship with a two-star American general. After the war, Marcus trades in his uniform for a lawyer's Homburg and an attache case but he is persuaded to act as an adviser to the fledging Israeli army. Yul Brynner, Frank Sinatra, Angie Dickinson, and John Wayne co-star in a war movie that has more soap opera than shooting. Mind you, it is inspirational stuff, especially when you consider the David versus Goliath predicament in which the Israelis found themselves. Shavelson's screenplay establishes the character of our protagonist as a man who would rather fight than love. The battle scenes are rather tame, but the explosions are well done. Angie Dickinson plays the wife of Colonel Marcus, while voluptuous Israeli freedom fighter Senta Berger cannot take her eyes off him after her own husband dies in the war. The prologue of the semi-fictionalized Cast A Giant Shadow struggles to reinforce the film's authenticity The major events in this film actually happened. Some of them are still happening. The major characters actually lived. Many of them are still living. Although it was not easy. Reportedly, Douglas feuded with Shavelson throughout the production. Neither Wayne's production company nor Douglas' Bryna Productions scrimped on production values. Cast A Giant Shadow looks well-produced with no end of extras trudging off to fight the war. Unfortunately, Shavelson doesn't conjure up much momentum. When he does get things moving, they inevitably bog down in long dialogue sessions. Nevertheless, the film presents a realistic enough view of the problems that faced an army without any ranking officers, soldiers who didn't know how to switch off the safety switches on their weapons., and an army that spoke in many different languages. Matters are not helped by a downbeat ending after the underdog Israelis construction a road out of solid stone to relieve the besieged town of Jersualem. The ending is a downer and Cast A Giant Shadow didn't cast a giant shadow at the box office. Composer Elmer Bernstein contributed one of his least memorable orchestral scores. Filmmaker Otto Preminger fared much better with his earlier epic Exodus that covered similar ground. The action was lensed on location in Israel and Rome. Douglas provides his customary bravado, but all he really does is stand around and give orders. Shavelson's direction is barely competent and only one battle sequence when Sinatra flies over an Egyptian tank column tossing home-made bombs is memorable. Naturally, John Wayne is cast as 'General Mike Randolph,' but he appears to be a composite of General George Patton and other American generals.

Director Kubrick puts into use many of the devices that would turn up later in the films of Quentin Tarantino, especially Reservior Dogs, which is also similar in plot. Rewinding the scenes and going at them again from different angles and perspectives probably was not completely new in Kubrick's day...just that it had never been fully exploited then, and was not exploited again until the 1990s. This film tells the tale of Sterling Hayden as a loser, who just got through doing a stretch in the pen, trying to pull a race-track heist in conjunction with a number of other underworld slugs who come out of the woodwork and lend their talents for just such an occasion. $2 million bucks is just short of peanuts in today's world, but it was one heck of a lot of dough in 1956, and a lot of guys, even a crooked cop, were willing to cast their lots in with each other just to get a share. If you have not seen this film...and I think everyone should...I won't jump the gun and give away many vitals. The performances are good, very credible, and the cast is outstanding. Jay C Flippen, Elisha Cook, Marie Windsor, James Edwards all give outstanding support to Sterling Hayden. In the race track robbery scene, I think I spotted an aged Robert Emmett O'Connor (of Sunset Blvd and Public Enemy fame), but I cannot be sure. Also, the uncredited narration of the film sounds, to my ear, like the voice of Art Gilmore, who also narrated the TV series Highway Patrol, and was a staple on radio and TV in the 50s and 60s. One point where I differ...though Marie Windsor's character pumps info from her weak kneed husband, Elisha Cook, it has no real bearing on the robbery...but it has quite a bearing on the aftermath. A pre-Ben Casey Vince Edwards tends to that, in a somewhat grisly fashion. But Hayden's ultimate undoing were circumstance and faulty planning. He sees the handwriting on the wall, and knows that running would be to no avail. This caper ends his criminal career for once and for all. I had never seen the film before. It is an incredible watch, more than a watch, actually, but an accurate study in human nature. I recommend it very highly. It is also very entertaining.

If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and.....The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous.I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good.For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)

Star Trek IV The Voyage Home, of the six Original Series films, takes me back to what it was like to see a new Star Trek episode when I watched them in the 60s.Even though the fate of planet Earth in the future rode on the success of Kirk and crew's mission to the past, the movie didn't have a serious tone. There was plenty of the light comedy and entertaining character interaction that made Kirk, Spock, Bones, and Scotty such beloved characters in the first place. Sulu, Uhura, and Chekov round things out, and after all, these seven were what made the TV series popular.The overall plot is almost irrelevant. Sure, the Earth is threatened with total destruction (again). Sure, the Enterprise crew goes back in time (again). Sure, of course Kirk and company save the day (again). But all of that is just a vehicle to get the stars we came to respect and the characters we came to love on the screen interacting in amusing and entertaining ways. We have Kirk charming a woman. We have Spock as dizzily out of touch with slang as in A Piece of the Action. We have Scotty mastering the areas of technology, yet failing to comprehend a computer mouse. We have a truce between a concerned Bones and a reemerging Spock, yet still with an entertaining interaction between them. Chekov's session of being questioned by Naval officers is hilarious, and would have pleased Abbot and Costello.Instead of The Voyage Home you could virtually name this movie The Trouble with Whales. In this case the problem is not too many tribbles, but too few whales. And the story should keep us humble. Here, Earth, technologically advanced in so many ways, and the Capitol of the United Federation of Planets, is helpless before the arrival of a yet more advanced technology from the endless depths of deep space. Not even the Borg would want to mess with this baby ... and if they'd found and assimilated a world of intelligent whales, once this probe came across them the Borg problem would have been solved the easy way. LOL yet the probe is not of evil intent, just interested in finding the species it had been assigned to be caretaker.This is Star Trek as I grew to love it, and I thank the people responsible for giving me a look back through the same magic mirror through I saw the series in the 60s.

Much imitated but never duplicated. A true classic of the action genre.Pvt. Joe Armstrong (Dudikoff) is a troubled loner sent to an American army base in the Philippines. He doesn't say much, and he really doesn't want to play hackysack with his fellow officers. On a routine truck convoy, baddies kill some of Armstrong's fellow officers, and Armstrong escapes with Col. Hickock's spoiled daughter Patricia (Aronson). While Patricia falls for Joe, the remaining officers on the base blame him for the tragedy. At first, they disparagingly call him karate boy, but he eventually wins their respect and the friendship of Cpl. Curtis Jackson (James) due to his excellent fighting skills. He has been training since he was a boy, but has amnesia and doesn't remember a lot of his past.As it turns out, an evil gun runner, Ortega (Don Stewart) is in cahoots with some of the army brass (including the Fred time to make the donuts guy lookalike John LaMotta as Sgt. Rinaldo), and there is only one obstacle to his newest million-dollar deal Armstrong! Fortunately for Ortega, he has a large Ninja training camp on his vast estate. So he sends his army of Ninjas after Armstrong, Jackson and Patricia. When Patricia is kidnapped, Joe goes into full ninja mode and it becomes ninja vs. ninja in a fight to the finish.

Its curiosity from that fact that drove me to finally watch this movie 15-years after its original release and is probably why most of you are here reading this review. Curious to how a movie involving pirates with a ~100$M budget and a seemingly attractive name like Cutthroat Island could fail so spectacularly. Below are my impressions- Geena Davis (main actress) B-list quality. Relatively physically unattractive, ofttimes robotic in delivery of lines (sometimes the result of poor dialogue by the writers), emotionally detached (seems to lack facial expressions except when smiling), and amateurish acting in a lot of the earlier scenes (being out-acted by a monkey is not a good way to start off a movie). She also had the weight of stigmas regarding the believability of a female captain commanding ship and crew to contend with (see Keira Knightley's later performance in Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean; awkwardly unbelievable doesn't begin to describe her attempts to play captain). However, against these odds a more convincing female captain I cannot imagine (when she isn't forced to deliver corny one liners). She manages to retain a feminine quality while simultaneously displaying tomboyish and oft crude mannerisms that make her character very believable whether issuing commands, wielding a gun\/sword, or performing one of the movies many stunts. She quickly makes gender a non-issue (no easy feat) and I actually found myself having a great time watching this movie and her role as it went on.- Matthew Modine Bottom-of-the-barrel actor as many reviews describe him when compared to whom the director preferred to play the leading male (Tom Cruise, et al). Personally, I found him to be one of the easier characters to like, often providing some humor to an otherwise serious cast. His performance and appearance reminds me of Cary Elwes in Princess Bride.- Cinematography The movie is shot with a raw-like quality that seems to be lacking polish or post-production touch-up. Released in 1995, but feels like your watching something from the late 70s-early 80s. Relies on traditional pyrotechnics and stunt work as opposed to fancy CGI effects. While originally apprehensive I soon found this style a bit refreshing as it gave a more ad-hoc feel akin to things like The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular (Youtube it!). In addition, it made for a few unintentionally funny moments like Modine getting clubbed over the head during an escape sequence with a flying barrel from an ill-planned explosion effect? Unfortunately, this form soon showed its limitations. The naval battle at the end is a prime example. Beyond belief is probably the best way to describe it. Two ships at pointblank range broadsiding each other for 5-mins and no visible damage aside from a few makeshift fire-pits on the deck? Yikes! It destroyed the mood and brought my excitement level to a screeching halt, which was finally beginning to recover after the disappointing treasure discovery scenes (scenes where unrealistic extravagance was sorely needed). To say the entire ending was botched is an understatement. It was embarrassingly executed visually and continuity-wise especially considering its budget and 1995 release date. A lot of the blame can be placed on poor script and stunt planning. Watching Captain Morgan and Dawg awkwardly climb the mast for dramatic effect or conveniently place ammunitions topped off with an out of character, Bad Dog! one liner was just one of many things that left me scratching my head.In the end I'd say some of this movies most endearing qualities were the very things that limited its potential to attract an audience or deliver in key moments. Its truly a shame as this movie had the potential to be so much more. Despite its shortcomings, however, I was entertained and impressed far more than I ever imagined when I sat down to watch the biggest box-office bust of all-time and would recommend at least one viewing even if it means having to sit through its cheese-ball ending.

She quickly makes gender a non-issue (no easy feat) and I actually found myself having a great time watching this movie and her role as it went on.- Matthew Modine Bottom-of-the-barrel actor as many reviews describe him when compared to whom the director preferred to play the leading male (Tom Cruise, et al). Personally, I found him to be one of the easier characters to like, often providing some humor to an otherwise serious cast. His performance and appearance reminds me of Cary Elwes in Princess Bride.- Cinematography The movie is shot with a raw-like quality that seems to be lacking polish or post-production touch-up. Released in 1995, but feels like your watching something from the late 70s-early 80s. Relies on traditional pyrotechnics and stunt work as opposed to fancy CGI effects. While originally apprehensive I soon found this style a bit refreshing as it gave a more ad-hoc feel akin to things like The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular (Youtube it!). In addition, it made for a few unintentionally funny moments like Modine getting clubbed over the head during an escape sequence with a flying barrel from an ill-planned explosion effect? Unfortunately, this form soon showed its limitations. The naval battle at the end is a prime example. Beyond belief is probably the best way to describe it. Two ships at pointblank range broadsiding each other for 5-mins and no visible damage aside from a few makeshift fire-pits on the deck? Yikes! It destroyed the mood and brought my excitement level to a screeching halt, which was finally beginning to recover after the disappointing treasure discovery scenes (scenes where unrealistic extravagance was sorely needed). To say the entire ending was botched is an understatement. It was embarrassingly executed visually and continuity-wise especially considering its budget and 1995 release date. A lot of the blame can be placed on poor script and stunt planning. Watching Captain Morgan and Dawg awkwardly climb the mast for dramatic effect or conveniently place ammunitions topped off with an out of character, Bad Dog! one liner was just one of many things that left me scratching my head.In the end I'd say some of this movies most endearing qualities were the very things that limited its potential to attract an audience or deliver in key moments. Its truly a shame as this movie had the potential to be so much more. Despite its shortcomings, however, I was entertained and impressed far more than I ever imagined when I sat down to watch the biggest box-office bust of all-time and would recommend at least one viewing even if it means having to sit through its cheese-ball ending.

Not only is the story great, the storytelling is fabulous (which ARE two different things, mind you....you can have a great story, yet poorly execute the telling of it), and the kid actors are all incredible. However, I would recommend seeing the original version without all the added scenes and such. To me, there is something significant about seeing a movie the way it was first made. Adding CGI stuff later I think takes away from the cinematic history the movie holds. Plus, the CGI makes E.T. look too cartoony, and less real. It's like at first there's an actual thing there with the actor, being lit by lights and filmed by the camera, and then all of a sudden it switches to something intangible. A digitally created imposter trying to pose as the once real character. Yes the movements and expressions might be slow, or choppy, since it is a puppet, but I'd rather see a movie and say Whoah, check out what cool effects they did back then with the technology they had at the time! than say, Well, I have no idea what they were capable of back then because it's all been altered and overshadowed by present technological advances in special effects... (come on, you all know that's exactly what you think too!). But, even so, the movie itself is still great one way or the other, because regardless of the level of special effects, what matters most is the story!

The story is awesome and very smart, the way it unfolds and the pacing is excellent. The soundtrack is really good and definitely helps. It's one of the coolest movies ever, it's just a little flawed. The characters here are hit or miss, and unfortunately the main character, George Jung, is a miss. It's not by any fault of Johnny Depp; he probably gives the best performance of anyone. The lines are just bad at times. The writing of dialogue is just bad at times. It makes characters lack depth and respond in unnatural, unbelievable ways. I don't know how else to say it other than it makes for an overall 'cheesy' vibe. You could say it lacks proper dramatic moments. Penelope Cruz is so underused in this movie too. Her character is so dry, I don't think she had any effective lines. Ray Liotta is great, but just like Depp his character suffers from bad writing. Bad acting isn't the issue here. A few of the characters completely work though. Jordi Molla as George's connection, Deigo Delgado, is just great, maybe the best in the movie, and Paul Reubens as Derek Foreal is well-written. Nick Cassevetes has a gift, clearly, but the characters all seem to personify his attitude in a sense. They need more variety. But the bad doesn't outweigh the good with Blow; it's still an awesome movie and certainly one of my 50 favorite films. You just have to enjoy Blow for what it is, one of the best drug\/gangster movies ever, a cultural classic.

I loved this, repeatedly. The pacing is very delicate, at first it almost feels kind of slow. Camera is sitting tight, it has a kind feeling of being in a theater and the actors must enter to each scene. This may sound boring, but it has a vivid imagination and each scene is a masterpiece itself. The scene at a railway station is pure genius, the hue and dialogues are somehow more than a life - the drama is painstakingly hilarious. I'd prefer this one a comedy, scarcely black, but oh so entertaining. If you decide to sit this through, I'll tell you'll never look at normal life in a such manner anymore. These kind of films really make movies worthwhile, just because they are deeply touching and are taking a viewer to another level of understanding. If this film seems a bit boring at first, stop watching and return when you feel more receiving, because you need that emotion. Excellent film, which requires a 100% non-disturbed viewing, but will positively deliver a remarkably experience. I bet this one will make you a better person, because I believe it made me too.

In fact it wasn't very funny (or interesting) at all.Maybe if you were with a large group of people and you were all drunk and\/or stoned, then maybe you could derive some cheap laughs at the expense; but really that has nothing to do with the film and a lot to do with the individual experience. A large enough inebriated-audience would probably laugh and joke wildly through Schindler's List if the mood was right; but that doesn't change the objective quality of the film.I just found this to be a rather dull, below average '50s B-movie. The worst thing about it is the editing; the discontinuity and the use of the same footage three or four times during different parts of the narrative (the shot of the police car driving by the cemetery is used four times; the shot of Lugosi flapping his cape is used twice, etc).Other than that it was badly plotted and suffered from some rather flat, lacklustre performances from a mostly amateur cast. But at no point would I call it so bad it's good; more like so mediocre it's boring.
