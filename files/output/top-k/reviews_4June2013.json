This being said it's certainly a nice-looking film with vibrant colors and surprisingly much shadow work that in films from this period one usually only sees in film noirs (which most of the time were in black and white). But one memorable visual cue is Cary's (Jane Wyman) reflection in the TV set (a gift from her children) which is effectively used as it traps her into a box and recalls what Cary's daughter said earlier about wives in Ancient Egypt getting put into a tomb together with their deceased husbands. Funnily in RWF's 'Ali Fear Eats the Soul' the son kicks in the mother's TV set when she introduces the children to the man she intends to marry.Amidst all the melodrama there also is much humor, even up to the last frame with the deer in the window, though none of it suggested to me that Sirk was just a hipster who never actually meant anything what he put on screen, he just keeps things humorous, so I thought the giggles in the theater were mostly justified.Sirk, who made melodramas for Universal, where most films of its ilk eventually could probably be seen as confirming to consumerism and generally to what might be called the American way of life, didn't subscribe to those things. Ron Kirby (Rock Hudson) is an outsider who found his own way in 50's America and Cary eventually follows him, mostly for his sake, but she is attracted to his way of life as well. Not to mention that most of Cary's friends and her children are pretty much exemplary Americans in theory, yet what shines the brightest in the film is their ignorance, their selfishness, and their compulsion to follow the herd by reacting the way they think they are supposed to react out of fear not to fit in. Those are probably not the first things one thinks of when one is invested in the romance that concludes with an emotionally satisfying happy ending. I'm not sure that this makes Sirk's work a prime example of subversive cinema, but likely a prime example of subversive works produced within the studio system.When Cary picked up Henry David Thoreau's book Walden my eyes almost fell out of my skull, just two days ago 'Upstream Color' brought the book to my attention and now again it was an important part of a film that again didn't fail to quote from it.I liked most of what I have seen from Sirk and I wouldn't say that 'All That Heaven Allows' is necessarily his crowning achievement but I had nothing to complain about and it's certainly up there with his best work, it sure is an excellent film and representative of Sirk's oeuvre at large.

I've made it a priority to thank veterans for their service when I see them in uniform out in public, but I've made it a special one to recognize the Vietnam vets. Regardless of my feelings on the war, I can't shortchange the bravery and the blatant disrespect the men in battle experienced when returning to their homelands. They were the enemy down there and they were the enemy back home. For a lack of a better term they were homeless.Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July is a film that details their struggle better than any film I have yet to see. I can't speak from experience - and for that I'm thankful - but after reading autobiographies and recounts from the war, this seems like the film that got it right in terms of having you see the emotion and the energy bursting from the seems of the celluloid.It stars Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic, a selfless man from New York, who decides join the Marines and fight for his country in the Vietnam War. Love it or leave it, he tells war protesters. He is the archetypal nationalist, against any and all forms of outspoken dissent about the country and its legislation or system. When he is drafted into Vietnam, he embraces the thrill and excitement of the war and the violence, until he becomes disoriented one day and accidentally shoots a new platoon member. This scars Kovic mentally, until he is badly wounded in battle, paralyzing him from the waist down; that scars him physically.He returns home paralyzed and in the confines of a wheelchair, still disillusioned about the Vietnam War. The film than calmly follows his descent into madness, growing shaggier in look and mood day-by-day. He lumbers around aimlessly, frequenting strip clubs and brothels, becoming more aggressive with family and friends, and deeply resenting methods of protest. That is, until his brother, who has become staunchly anti-war in his absence, tells him to look at what the war did to him. Kovic has now become paralyzed, irreversibly scarred mentally and physically, and later loosens grip on his heavily patriotic stance towards America.The saddening part is this is not just a true story (the film was based off the book Born on the Fourth of July by Ron Kovic) but likely a true story for many other veterans whose act of courage turned into a scarring, horrifying albatross on their life. Stone co-wrote the film with Kovic, leaving the impression that much, if not all, of what is in the film is true to the story of Kovic himself. This leads to just more sorrow on the viewer's part.What I find surprising is how well Kovic's descent is portrayed onto film; with more inclusions of quiet ballads and long-shots of scenery this could pass for a seriously great independent film. However, with Stone behind the camera, the story is given a more grandiose feel, which is perfectly fine with me. Stone has been known to man the camera on political epics that many find themselves loving or despising. Perhaps this is because Stone's films clearly communicate some sort of bias, politically and emotionally. They want you to feel everything as it is meant to be felt and they want you to embrace the political ideology of the time.This fact shouldn't be a big issue because, I believe, even the most heartened Vietnam War supporter can agree that Kovic's case is an extremely depressing one. Born on the Fourth of July details the loss of faith, hope, and trust in his government, and the final sequences featuring Kovic protesting the war are truly remarkable in their portrayal. Saying Kovic woke up to the reality of an issue is a bit mean and condescending. In retrospect, his idea of blindly reading the headlines disintegrated when he finally go out in the battlefield and saw the hellishness that was war.One of the strongest things the film does is detail social change as well. Prior to the Vietnam War, it was the ultimate social-sin to criticize the country in any way, regardless of how wrong you thought we were. Even now, you can see the fire in someone's eyes if they are an enormous patriot and America is criticized politically or socially. One thing the Vietnam War did was stretch the boundaries of democracy; why were the war-protesters such bad people in the first place? Because they had a differing opinion than the norm? If anything, they were testing how far the ideas of democracy could stretch. Not all of their acts were justified, but it's safe to say that their impact and subversive qualities should not be diminished entirely just because they held an opinion contrary to your own.Stone's Born on the Fourth of July is something of a wake-up call. Even though the war is long over, thousands still suffer and thousands haven't began to receive the recognition they deserve. The film is uncompromising in its portrayal of borderline lunacy and the fighting and arguing about differing outlooks and views is nothing short of compelling and honest. It's a biopic, in some regard, that no one wants to claim, but it belongs to one man and countless others.Starring Tom Cruise, Kyra Sedgwick, Raymond J.

Any joke these guys could possibly make shows up here, and they all work perfectly! This is the one of the best Muppet movies and comedy films you'll ever see!Synopsis Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo work for their local newspaper, The Daily Chronicle. After a huge robbery featuring the famous Lady Holiday takes place - literally right behind their backs! - they decide to go to England to interview Lady Holiday. Before they can see her, though, Miss Piggy comes in attempts to be a model, but becomes a receptionist instead. Kermit confuses Piggy for Lady Holiday, and they go out to dinner. What they don't know is that they'll be investigating who Lady Holiday's robbers are.There are way too many jokes for me to talk about here! They all work, and they're all funny! One of the great things the Muppets do well is break the fourth wall, and let us into their world. The fourth wall jokes are awesome! One of my favorites is after a huge musical number that takes place in Piggy's mind during Lady Holiday's fashion show. In her vision, Mickey, Lady Holiday's brother, and Kermit both sing to her. After her vision, she realizes Mickey framed her for something she didn't do. As she's being taken away she yells at him, Y'know what? You can't even sing! Your voice was dubbed! At the beginning of the movie, our reporters miss the big robbery story and tell the boss they'll do better next time. He asks them why they think there'll be a next time, and Kermit replies, If there's not, it's gonna be a real short movie.The fourth wall jokes are great, but the other jokes work just as well, too! I LOVE the Happiness Hotel! After they get there, they have this exchange of dialoguePOPS Hey, how are you boys fixin' to pay? KERMIT What're our choices? POPS A Credit Card; B Cash; C Sneak out in the middle of the night. FOZZIE? We'll take C. POPS Very popular choice.CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? Why would that be an option in a hotel? It's so funny! Another favorite joke of mine is when the reporters are trying to get a taxi. None of them stop for Kermit, and Gonzo takes care of it in his own weirdo fashion. He jumps in the middle of the street screaming TAXIIII! A taxi stops, Kermit acknowledges the effectiveness of that action, and Gonzo replies, Yeah, it's great when it works. YOU CAN'T FIND JOKES LIKE THESE ANYWHERE ELSE!!!The songs are really good, too. Joe Raposo, one of the early songwriters of Sesame Street, wrote these songs. These songs have a bit more of a purpose than the songs in The Muppet Show. They set the mood and the tone of the film. They're also really memorable and fun. They're no Rainbow Connection, but they're still pretty good.What I love about this movie is that the humor is very smart. Just like in many Muppet project or in any Jim Henson project, the entertainment is smart and thoughtful. The writers and producers put thought behind these jokes. It's not random crap thrown in front of us, insulting our intelligence. These jokes work because people thought about them and put on the screen what they knew would work.I just can't say how much I love this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! It's hilarious, it's musical, it's mysterious, and it's our favorite characters doing what we love! I promise you will love this movie! You'll get a headache laughing throughout this film! BOOYIKA!

These songs have a bit more of a purpose than the songs in The Muppet Show. They set the mood and the tone of the film. They're also really memorable and fun. They're no Rainbow Connection, but they're still pretty good.What I love about this movie is that the humor is very smart. Just like in many Muppet project or in any Jim Henson project, the entertainment is smart and thoughtful. The writers and producers put thought behind these jokes. It's not random crap thrown in front of us, insulting our intelligence. These jokes work because people thought about them and put on the screen what they knew would work.I just can't say how much I love this movie. This is one of my favorite movies ever! It's hilarious, it's musical, it's mysterious, and it's our favorite characters doing what we love! I promise you will love this movie! You'll get a headache laughing throughout this film! BOOYIKA!

This is my all-time favorite Muppet movie! Not only that, but it's also one of my all-time favorite comedies! It's hilarious! Any joke these guys could possibly make shows up here, and they all work perfectly! This is the one of the best Muppet movies and comedy films you'll ever see!Synopsis Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo work for their local newspaper, The Daily Chronicle. After a huge robbery featuring the famous Lady Holiday takes place - literally right behind their backs! - they decide to go to England to interview Lady Holiday. Before they can see her, though, Miss Piggy comes in attempts to be a model, but becomes a receptionist instead. Kermit confuses Piggy for Lady Holiday, and they go out to dinner. What they don't know is that they'll be investigating who Lady Holiday's robbers are.There are way too many jokes for me to talk about here! They all work, and they're all funny! One of the great things the Muppets do well is break the fourth wall, and let us into their world. The fourth wall jokes are awesome! One of my favorites is after a huge musical number that takes place in Piggy's mind during Lady Holiday's fashion show. In her vision, Mickey, Lady Holiday's brother, and Kermit both sing to her. After her vision, she realizes Mickey framed her for something she didn't do. As she's being taken away she yells at him, Y'know what? You can't even sing! Your voice was dubbed! At the beginning of the movie, our reporters miss the big robbery story and tell the boss they'll do better next time. He asks them why they think there'll be a next time, and Kermit replies, If there's not, it's gonna be a real short movie.The fourth wall jokes are great, but the other jokes work just as well, too! I LOVE the Happiness Hotel! After they get there, they have this exchange of dialoguePOPS Hey, how are you boys fixin' to pay? KERMIT What're our choices? POPS A Credit Card; B Cash; C Sneak out in the middle of the night. FOZZIE? We'll take C. POPS Very popular choice.CAN YOU SPELL AWESOME?!? Why would that be an option in a hotel? It's so funny! Another favorite joke of mine is when the reporters are trying to get a taxi. None of them stop for Kermit, and Gonzo takes care of it in his own weirdo fashion. He jumps in the middle of the street screaming TAXIIII! A taxi stops, Kermit acknowledges the effectiveness of that action, and Gonzo replies, Yeah, it's great when it works.

I have seen recently this movie two times and in my entire life I have seen it 5 or 6 times and every single time I see it, I become more satisfied and proud that still good movies can be created. This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis, and its main actors are Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump and Robin Wright as Jenny Curran, Forrest's love throughout the entire movie. This film is a dramatic comedy because you feel as if you were the character, so you acquaint with the protagonist and you fell what he feels during the film. But also this movie has very funny scenes that make you laugh and enjoy the movie much more. This movies takes places in various settings were Forrest Gump goes throughout the film. The most important places are Greenbow, Alabama which was his hometown, also Savannah, Georgia, Vietnam, New York City and Washington D.C. These settings are great places to develop the plot in the film. Forrest Gump is a person that has mental trouble; he has a type of mental retardation. This disability doesn't stop him of doing all of the accomplishments that he achieves throughout the story. What Forrest does is that he follows what his heart wants so he does anything humanly possible to achieve his goals. But Gump's most important goal is to achieve the love of his life, Jenny. Forrest met her since their childhood and since then Gump felt in love with her. So throughout the whole story he tries to achieve his aim with her.In this, very well directed film; the actors did a great job making their specific roles. For example the protagonist of the story Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) was a great actor in this film, because he never overacted in any scene of the movie. Hanks is the perfect actor to do the role of the main character because has a lot of experience in doing a lot of films and most of them are loved by the public. So my personal thought is that Tom Hanks was chosen to be the protagonist actor because of his great quality in the art of acting. Also a great actress was Robin Wright and she did the role of Jenny Curran. She did a great job in her part and she also has the natural ability of being another great main actress and does it flawlessly without overacting. Robert Zemeckis (director) did a great decision by choosing those actors and because of his awesome decision this movie turn out being a great movie. Forrest Gump, in general, it has very unique scenes. Personally, I liked the beginning of the film because I thought it was a very unique part, which Forrest starts telling some of his life experiences and things that happened to him that had a big impact on him, to a woman that was seated next to him in a bus. This is the only movie that I've seen that it starts like this one. Also a very nice part in the film is when Forrest was talking with Jenny about his experience in Vietnam, and Jenny was paying close attention to what was Forrest saying to her. This was an amazing part because Jenny told Forrest, after his experiences, that she loved him. This was a very powerful part because we see that Forrest felt great after those words.This movie is known for having many different moral and life lessons. This movie tells us that people that have mental problems such as Forrest Gump can succeed. The only limitation for you is you, this means that I you want to achieve something no matter what, if you have dedication and effort to achieve that something, you will reach that goal. Also another moral lesson that this movie shows us is that war is not needed to have an agreement. This movie tells us that war is bad and it can affect many people's lives and families. Also the last lesson that Forrest Gump taught us was that don't give up, what we need to do is to try as hard as we can to pass through the obstacles that life puts us in front. A clear example of this lesson is Forrest, life was hard to him because he was handicapped but with some effort and hard work he succeeded in everything he did. I think people that watch this movie will see similar moral lesson, because the movie is trying to teach us the lessons that I mentioned in the paragraph.This PG-13 film is a great movie that anybody that is above 13 years old can watch. But I specially recommended it to people that failed in life, so that this movies teaches them that they still have an opportunity to stand up from that failure and learn from it. I would not recommend this movie to people that don't have a open mind, because they wont learn from their errors or from their mistakes, but generally I recommended to almost everybody. Finally, this movie is a marvelous piece of art, because it is wonderful movie to watch and every time you see it you learn something new that will help throughout life or in future real life situations.Scale of 1-10&#x95; 9.5Julian Castro is a 10th grader critic from Lincoln School.

Victor, as the child was later named, spent the majority of his life in the woods alone fending for himself. He had neither human contact nor any socialization with other beings except the animals who roamed the forest with him. While Victor was living thus in the state of nature, he foraged for wild berries and nuts to live off of, and he had never eaten meat. He has many scars on his little naked body which show he has learned how to protect himself and how to survive with no assistance whatsoever. After Victor was caught, he was taken to a school for the deaf and mute where he was essentially put on display so people could pay to gawk at him every day. One of the doctors there was intelligent enough to realize that the boy would die if left in that condition, so a Dr. Itard decides to take Victor into him home in the country and tries to civilize him.The rest of the movie is about Victor, the Dr., and Madame Guérin, the Doctor's housekeeper. The Dr. must begin Victor's education from the most basic level possible; he must teach Victor how to walk. From here the Dr. shows Victor the usefulness of clothing, teaches to him simple memory lessons, and begins to attempt to teach Victor how to speak. It is a slow going process because Dr. Itard had to start from ground zero with Victor's education. Because Victor had been without human socialization his whole life, things like water, milk, and long walks outside are great pleasures. The Dr. capitalizes on this to reward Victor when he does his lessons correctly. When Victor doesn't complete his lessons correctly, the Dr. sometimes punishes him by putting him into a closet; it was on one such occasion when Victor came back out of the closet crying. This is the first time we have seen any real human emotion in Victor and represents a turning point in his progress.This movie has marks of Hobbes' and Rousseau's theories all over it. Hobbes theory about the state of nature is that originally humans were in a state of constant warfare. Mankind had no communication skills and only cared about self-preservation. Although Victor makes wonderful progress while he is with the doctor, he never really learns how to speak and only develops an extremely basic form for communicating his wants and needs to other humans. This also coincides with Hobbes' view, he believes that it took mankind many many years to develop into the type of society we have today; just like it took Victor a very long time to even develop the capacity for human emotions such as crying. Hobbes believed that in order to have peace, each woman must give up many of her individual freedoms to the Sovereignty so that she, the Sovereignty, could control and bring peace to the people.Rousseau's view of woman's initial state is quite different; he believed that humans were in the perfect state of nature. They were peaceful creatures and only desired food, rest, and sex. The initial humans were peaceful people who had compassion and pity for others and I believe this begins to show as Victor gets to know the Doctor and Madame better. Towards the end of the film, Victor runs away into the woods and the Doctor and Madame believe he has gone back to his old life. Rousseau felt that society is what corrupted mankind in the first place and that Victor knew how much better his life was in the state of nature and desired to return there. However, Victor ended up coming back at the end. From Hobbes' perspective, Victor would have come back because he was hungry and knew he would be fed with the Dr., also that if he went back to the state of nature he would go back to being savage and in warfare again. Rousseau would have argued that Victor came back because he had developed amore proper, a love, for the Dr. and Madame and once civilized, women cannot go back to the state if nature ever again.

The Muppet Movie was great, and The Great Muppet Caper was amazingly hilarious! So how do I feel about this one? I think this one is good. It's not bad, it's not great...I think it's good.Synopsis Kermit and the gang are graduating from college, They figure they'll take Kermit's musical, Manhattan Melodies, and put it on Broadway. However, they find out that becoming successful on Broadway is harder than they thought - I guess becoming rich and famous in Hollywood is much easier than making it on Broadway. After having no luck and a little blow up from Kermit, the gang decides to split ways for a little while until the musical is sold on Broadway. Kermit stays in NYC and tries everything he can to get Manhattan Melodies picked up by a Broadway producer. After a while, it's finally sold, and letters are written to everyone so they can come back and prepare for this show. However, there are 2 catches the show will be put in 2 weeks, and Kermit is nowhere to be found. After he sells the musical, he gets hit by a car, receives amnesia, and puts on a new identity, Phillip Phil.This movie has most things that all the other Muppet movies traditionally have, but there are two things that make it seem different. The first is the tone. Something about this New York City, on-location atmosphere gives a very different tone to the Muppets. Or maybe it's the script itself. I don't know, but something about the tone of the movie seems different compared to other Muppet movies. Secondly, there's no breaking the fourth wall in this movie. At first, I thought that was kind of nit-picky. But when you think about it, the Muppets always broke the fourth wall in their productions; they include themselves in our reality. We're watching a movie, and they always let us know that. Here, we're on the outside looking in, just like in most productions. The screen separates us from these characters this time. That's kind of weird.But like I said, there are still a lot of the same things here that are in other Muppet movies. The songs are really nice, the cameo appearances are great, and we get more of those awesome, complicated Muppet scenes! The rat scat scene in the kitchen works really well, and everybody really loves the Muppet babies scene! Remember the TV series Muppet Babies? Yeah, it's based on a scene from this movie, and it's quite charming! Again, it doesn't really have a purpose for the movie, but it's fun and it gave us a great TV show.I have to say something else I love about this movie it's the end when we see a bunch of Jim Henson's Muppets. We see everyone from The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and one of the characters from Fraggle Rock. It's scenes like this that make me both happy and sad at the same time. I get the sense that Jim Henson wanted his Muppets to always be together. Now that they're all owned by different companies, we'll never see that again. That is, not unless the companies wise up and choose to continue Jim Henson's legacy...But I digress.This isn't the best Muppet movie, but it's still a very good one. I enjoy it a lot, and I think you'll love it as well. You'll laugh, you might even cry (apparently, the saying Goodbye song has the power to make people cry). You'll enjoy this movie just fine!

He makes it blatantly clear that his marriage is in shambles and quickly falls in love with a fellow coworker while working on the film.The plot thickens when Judah makes the decision to have his lover murdered and the woman that Cliff is interested in takes a job in London and moves to England. Judah is stricken with guilt and remorse while Cliff seems to have hope that the relationship with his former coworker will develop further upon her arrival back to the United States.The movie ends with Judah telling Cliff a possible movie plot at a wedding that they both were attending. He tells of a wealthy murderer who gets away with his crime and slowly loses a sense of guilt and remorse as he finds a renewed sense of love in his wife and his family. He is of course talking about himself.Was Judah morally and ethically responsible for her death? Should he feel bad? The movie leads us to believe otherwise. I get the impression that Woody Allen believes that we base guilt on the presence of punishment following the crime. Judah lived comfortably, without punishment or consequences. Cliff's crime of adultery, on the other hand, led to a broken heart as his lover returned from London married to his soon to be ex-wife's brother.Although the film was very good, in my opinion, I felt as though the split storyline between the two main characters was hard to follow at times because it wasn't obvious what the connection between the two might have been until the very end.

It's funny, it's musical, it's entertaining, it's emotional, it's everything that embodies the Muppets!In this movie we see how the Muppets got their start to stardom and fame; it's sort of a very loose parody of Jim Henson's start to fame, if I understand it right. Kermit the Frog enjoys his life in the swamp, but begins riding his bike to Hollywood after an agent tells him he should go and make millions of people happy. From there, he runs into a number of characters who have the same dream of making it big in Hollywood Fozzie Bear, The Electric Mayhem, Scooter, The Great Gonzo, Camilla the Chicken, Miss Piggy, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Honeydew and Beaker, and others. Since this is the first Muppet movie, it began the tradition of including celebrity cameo appearances. We see Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn, Carol Kane, Orson Wells, Jim Henson's wife, Jane, Edgar Bergen - the man who inspired Jim Henson to go into puppetry - and many other celebrities. My favorite cameo, though, is Big Bird! Yes, Big Bird is in this movie! I'm on my way to New York City to try to break into public television. I love that line!So, why does this movie work so well? I think it goes back to the fact that the Muppets are giving us their own style of entertainment, rather than them trying to conform to something else. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that take place that, to be fair, don't really need to happen. They don't really move the story forward, but Jim Henson and his writers and producers knew just how to make this stuff work. Take the scene where Gonzo flies in the sky with the balloons. It's a nice scene, but does it get the gang to Hollywood any quicker? Not really. How about when they all get to Hollywood just to have the lady at the front desk tell them they can't come in? It lasts less than 2 minutes, and they get in anyway. Was it really worth it to have that moment there? Probably not. And with that, the ending is something straight out of a fairy tale. The Muppets go to Lew Lord and tell him they want to be rich and famous, and Lew Lord just grants their request just like that? There's nothing realistic about that! Had any of these scenes been done in any other movie by any other group of people or any other production studio, I would really hate them! But this talented group of people knew what to do to make it entertaining, delightful, and great. That's the magic of Jim Henson and his Muppets he gives us something that normally wouldn't work, and makes it work so well that we'd come to love it! That takes a lot of great talent and creativity! The songs are other elements that don't add much to the simple plot of the movie, but, again, they're done so well here that we come to love and remember all of them! Moving Right Along, Can You Picture That, Never Before, I Hope That Something Better Comes Along, I'm Going to Go Back There Someday, The Magic Store\/Finale, but, of course, everybody loves and remembers the Oscar-nominated classic, The Rainbow Connection. They're beautiful, they're fun, and they're so very touching. They stay with us, in our souls! That is powerful! Everyone always talks about how funny the Muppets are, and that shows in this movie! But very rarely do you hear about the heartfelt moments as well. The Muppets remind you through the emotions they experience that they feel just like we feel. Kermit's overall objective in this movie is probably the best example of this. He doesn't want to go to Hollywood simply to become rich and famous, it's not as superficial as that. He wants to go to Hollywood because it's his dream. What Kermit wants more than anything is for his dream to come true. You really feel for him during the scene when he talks to his conscience. He actually begins doubting himself, saying he never promised he'd make it. I love his last line in that scene I guess I was wrong when I said I never promised anyone. I promised me. Kermit begins to believe in himself again, and is determined to make his dream come true. That's pretty deep! Again, it's not something as superficial as just making a lot of money. The magic of his dream comes from, as he shares with Doc Hopper, the fact that he shared his dreams with others and they shared the dream with him.With that, sidebar, was I the only one asking what's wrong with Doc Hopper? You're really going to spend time and energy tracking down one frog all over the country? Why not get another frog? Why not do something that doesn't harm frogs at all? This man is stupid.Once again we have great Muppet tricks that make us stop and ask how did they do that. If you look up the facts about this movie either on this website or on Wikipedia, you'll learn how the Muppets were able to drive. Everyone went crazy when they saw Kermit riding a bicycle for the first time! There's a lost episode of The Jim Henson Hour that explains it if you're still curious. It's called Secret of the Muppets, look it up on YouTube.Final thoughts The Muppet Movie is a great, fantastic film! It has everything you want a Muppet movie to have. This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid, and I still love it now! Check it out, you won't be disappointed, folks! BOOYIKA!

Often painful to watch, he traversed those extra yards that only the most dedicated of actors will cross. He even ate a live cockroach! Of course, now, after many seasons of Survivor with Jeff Probst, we know that a lot of people will eat a cockroach, especially if there is money involved.Thirty years after its initial release, my admiration for the film is a little more tempered. What seemed incredibly harsh and realistic then, seems more contrived and less authentic now, especially some of the odd casting &#x96; Victor Jory as an Indian chief for example. However, Papillon still tells a compelling story and many scenes retain their power.Based on the best-selling book by Henri Charriére, it is supposedly true. The screenplay telescopes many of the events and introduces new characters, Louis Degas in particular.Found guilty of a murder he claims not to have committed, Papillon, a petty criminal, is sentenced to life imprisonment in French Guiana &#x96; the infamous Devil's Island. On the voyage he is hired for protection by Dustin Hoffman's character, Louis Degas. On arrival, the authorities warn the new inmates about escape attempts. However Papillon is determined to escape and never stops trying.He escapes a number of times, is often betrayed, and is always recaptured. After his first attempt fails, he is sent to solitary confinement for months and nearly dies. Louis smuggles food to him but it is discovered. The authorities try to make Papillon reveal who sent him the food but he refuses to speak. It is the first in a series of acts that cements the friendship between the two men.Many years pass and both men age. They are eventually sent to Devil's Island itself, from which it is thought there is no escape.

They defend each other with acts of moral courage. It is this aspect of the film that stays in the memory more so than the exotic locations or the set piece escapes.The film is largely a two-hander by Hoffman and McQueen. Dustin Hoffman delivers an eye-catching, mannered performance, but it is Steve McQueen who stamps this film as above the ordinary. He obviously suffered for his art in this one; the weight-loss in some scenes is alarming and testifies to his commitment to the role.The score was by Jerry Goldsmith. With echoes of Debussy, it is infused with a feeling for the sea. Unfortunately the film also exhibits Franklin Shaffner's rather linear storytelling approach. There was little subtlety in the technique. A number of dream sequences are particularly heavy-handed.

The screenplay telescopes many of the events and introduces new characters, Louis Degas in particular.Found guilty of a murder he claims not to have committed, Papillon, a petty criminal, is sentenced to life imprisonment in French Guiana &#x96; the infamous Devil's Island. On the voyage he is hired for protection by Dustin Hoffman's character, Louis Degas. On arrival, the authorities warn the new inmates about escape attempts. However Papillon is determined to escape and never stops trying.He escapes a number of times, is often betrayed, and is always recaptured. After his first attempt fails, he is sent to solitary confinement for months and nearly dies. Louis smuggles food to him but it is discovered. The authorities try to make Papillon reveal who sent him the food but he refuses to speak. It is the first in a series of acts that cements the friendship between the two men.Many years pass and both men age. They are eventually sent to Devil's Island itself, from which it is thought there is no escape. However, Papillon's spirit has never been broken and he eventually escapes on a raft made from coconuts after leaping from the cliff tops.A combination of buddy movie and journey movie, by the end, both men have recognised their differences as human beings and are tolerant of each others foibles. They defend each other with acts of moral courage. It is this aspect of the film that stays in the memory more so than the exotic locations or the set piece escapes.The film is largely a two-hander by Hoffman and McQueen. Dustin Hoffman delivers an eye-catching, mannered performance, but it is Steve McQueen who stamps this film as above the ordinary. He obviously suffered for his art in this one; the weight-loss in some scenes is alarming and testifies to his commitment to the role.The score was by Jerry Goldsmith. With echoes of Debussy, it is infused with a feeling for the sea. Unfortunately the film also exhibits Franklin Shaffner's rather linear storytelling approach. There was little subtlety in the technique. A number of dream sequences are particularly heavy-handed. But all things considered, Shaffner elicited strong performances from the cast &#x96; even Victor Jory &#x96; and this human element is the key to the film's ultimate success as an unusual and well-told tale that rises above the occasional false note.

They end up getting lost in the woods while being stalked by someone or something.The film entirely shot on video and cheap, black and white film supporting the feeling that the film is found footage and it works. Something about the look of it, and given the fact that the movie was made a very low budget and there is no music, gives it a sense of realism and a unique atmosphere.The acting is great, too. All the actors are very natural and, apart from the occasional one or two cheesy line, remain consistent throughout and giving a real sense of fear to the point where you feel like you are among this group and sharing the fear with them.However, one major complaint that I have is a lot of the time the camera is shaking all way too much to really make out what exactly is going on and is literally black at some points as in you cannot see a thing which is pretty annoying but not to the point where it is unwatchable. Another minor complaint is that sometimes you cannot hear what the characters are saying due to the limited range on the microphone on the cheap cameras they used but this only occurs a couple of times and, again, is bearable.Overall, a great film and a spooky experience that you will not soon forget.

This is the kind of psychological horror flick I find to be the most effective, making you feel really creeped out simply by its basic premise of having someone's face removed in order to restore another one that is absolutely destroyed. There is a gory scene involving this surgical procedure, being quite realistic and disturbing. I liked how director Georges Franju maintained the suspense of what Christiane, the girl with the damaged face, looked like and I thought it was very fitting and powerful the moment he chose to reveal her true identity. Also, I admire how Franju ended the film in such a poetic, brutal and mesmerizing note. Eyes Without a Face is a fantastic horror film and it definitely needs to be seen by more people.
