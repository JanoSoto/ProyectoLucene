I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film.

I said all adventure movies left me feeling a little hollow - adventure movies tended to abandon story, really, in favor of plot (important distinction stories are interesting, plots boring; consequently a film with a story to tell is better than a movie with a plot to move forward). I think he hurled the disc at me out of pure frustration with my point of view. In doing so, he also won the argument.The Man Who Would Be King is the single greatest adventure film I've ever seen. It's a story - It's a tale - It's not a series of plot developments (to me, to go further with this plot\/story dichotomy, a plot is mechanical (and sometimes that machine is well-oiled) while a story is organic and feels less contrived (though the story, as organic matter sometimes is, can be rotten)). It's a very good story at that. The Man Who Would Be King (I believe as a result of its derivation from Kipling) has a depth and development of character that is foreign to most adventure tales. Few films are as rousing as this and few films that are this rousing have nearly as much to say about mankind.John Huston, of course, is a master of instilling greatness into traditionally tedious genres. He transformed the mystery, the western, the swashbuckler. Why not the adventure story too? As evidenced in The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Huston can take what might wind up a plot and transform it into a story. He understands that characters - human, conflicted, devious characters - are essential to creating genre pictures that transcend their genre. Without Huston, this film would have undoubtedly faltered; his steady and determined hand guides this film from the hazards of superficiality without sacrificing entertainment and adventure.He does not create a great film single-handedly though, as Connery and Caine, who both give tremendous performances, bestow upon Peachy and Daniel immense likability despite their scoundrel airs. Caine proves again why he may be the greatest living British actor and Connery reminds us that there's more to him than 007.As I said, this is one of the greatest adventure tales brought to the screen.

Apart from the end bit.December 7 1941 is a fairly important date in American history. The Japanese launched a surprise attack on the entire US fleet as it lay at anchor (read 'parked up') in Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian islands. As a result, President Roosevelt brought the USA into the war, and that was more or less that, according to people who aren't British. And that's 'harbour', anyway.Our story follows two friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, as they grow up obsessed with planes and flying, and then the war comes and they get drafted as cooks. No, wait&#133; Rafe &#150; Affleck &#150; falls in love with a nurse &#150; Kate Beckinsale &#150; and then gets shot down over France and disappears and Danny &#150; Josh Hartnett &#150; falls in love with her himself, and they end up naked in Pearl Harbor together. Phew. This takes about 4 days of screen time and you're wishing the Japanese would hurry up, when guess what? Yeah, Rafe turns up, not burnt or anything &#150; he was, like, hiding with the French for a year or something! Amazing! The same guy wrote this wrote Braveheart, so if you swallowed Willy Wallace speaking French and knocking up the Queen of England, this is nothing.So the love story comes to a head, and then the bombs start falling and the budget just triples, man. The critics hated the slush and okay'd the bangs, and some folks reviewing the DVD on Amazon obviously liked both and gave it 5 stars. This, in my opinion, would presumably make something like Runaway Bride into a work of immeasurable genius. What do they think is a BAD film?What is wrong with this film? Almost everything. Casting, plot, pacing, length, breadth, spelling... It's full of really off-putting cameos. Examples include boffin-typecast Dan Ackroyd as the Navy 'Intelligence' man who thinks something's up because 40 billion tons of dangerous shipping has gone off the radar. Yeah, we know. Why didn't you? One of the one million Baldwin boys &#150; the old one &#150; strolls around in Indiana Jones's leather jacket preening his hair-do and fingering his cheque as some horrible psychotic pilot person, who resurfaces to lead us into the most startlingly irrelevant ending I have seen since the 1999 European Cup Final. Almost as meaningless is Cuba Gooding's cameo, as a frustrated boxing cook who beats up honkies from other boats. You can imagine my profound shock when he turns Real Sailor and shoots down some Japanese plane attacking His Ship. Bring back Jeff Chandler and back projection if this is progress.The last hour is frankly unbelievable. The bacon sandwich dropped from my numbed fingers as the film resolutely refused to end. You see, after the Japanese go back to their ships &#150; (Navy radar people 'Oh, There they are!') there's what seems to be an entire other movie stuck on the end. We haven't finished with Rafe and Josh and Kate and that stuff yet &#150; and not enough foreign people of dubious religious conviction have been sent to meet their particular maker of choice, obviously. 183 minutes is an awfully long time to spend watching people who you don't care about sort their problems out. Even if they do have guns.The love story is a bit silly, something akin to the Titanic romance, except longer and with quiffs, and the action scenes are interesting from a technical point of view but do not disturb like Ryan or rouse like Braveheart. The film looks like they didn't really care &#150; one of those times when the hype gets you into your seat and the producer runs to the bank before you can figure it out and ask for your money back. The best thing I can say about the whole thing is that at least it gives you the opportunity to re-tell the one about the half-black, half-Japanese bloke who every December 7 would attack Pearl Bailey.

","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"29 November 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Jerry Bruckheimer's latest large film - tipping ships over sideways, elevating Ben Affleck to Big Chin Leading Man, and not being as rude to the Japanese as perhaps one might have expected. Apart from the end bit.December 7 1941 is a fairly important date in American history. The Japanese launched a surprise attack on the entire US fleet as it lay at anchor (read 'parked up') in Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian islands. As a result, President Roosevelt brought the USA into the war, and that was more or less that, according to people who aren't British. And that's 'harbour', anyway.Our story follows two friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, as they grow up obsessed with planes and flying, and then the war comes and they get drafted as cooks. No, wait&#133; Rafe &#150; Affleck &#150; falls in love with a nurse &#150; Kate Beckinsale &#150; and then gets shot down over France and disappears and Danny &#150; Josh Hartnett &#150; falls in love with her himself, and they end up naked in Pearl Harbor together. Phew. This takes about 4 days of screen time and you're wishing the Japanese would hurry up, when guess what? Yeah, Rafe turns up, not burnt or anything &#150; he was, like, hiding with the French for a year or something! Amazing! The same guy wrote this wrote Braveheart, so if you swallowed Willy Wallace speaking French and knocking up the Queen of England, this is nothing.So the love story comes to a head, and then the bombs start falling and the budget just triples, man. The critics hated the slush and okay'd the bangs, and some folks reviewing the DVD on Amazon obviously liked both and gave it 5 stars. This, in my opinion, would presumably make something like Runaway Bride into a work of immeasurable genius. What do they think is a BAD film?What is wrong with this film? Almost everything. Casting, plot, pacing, length, breadth, spelling... It's full of really off-putting cameos. Examples include boffin-typecast Dan Ackroyd as the Navy 'Intelligence' man who thinks something's up because 40 billion tons of dangerous shipping has gone off the radar. Yeah, we know.

I say 'appears' because the message is rather cloudy...that's if there's even a message at all. However, when a film is this entertaining; it doesn't really matter what the message is. Geoffrey Rush stars as the Marquis de Sade; the main character of the film. His performance is delicious; over the top and fun throughout. He draws you into the performance with a mixture of charisma and good heartedness (despite his character being a madman, we are still able to care for him). Starring opposite Rush is Kate Winslet. Winslet is a great actress that doesn't get nearly as much credit as she deserves. With the obvious exception of Titanic, Kate has turned in good performance after good performance and yet she's still something of a side-lined actress, that gets more supporting roles than the leads she deserves. She's also incredibly beautiful, but that's another story. Excellent support is given to these two leads courtesy of Michael Caine and Joaquin Phoenix.

The film leans on the actors throughout and it is the over-dramatic performances that will stick in your mind once the film is over.

I loved the plot twist at the end as well, in that we find out Toulon was merely using his puppets, he never cared for them, only that they carry out his evil plans of killing off all of the lead heroine's friends to extract the brain matter needed to create the re-animation fluid, that he promises to give them, but is only saving it for himself & the lead heroine, whom he is dead certain is the reincarnation of his late wife (though she strongly disagrees & tries to escape the madman) Toulon needs the serum to enter their new bodies Creepy tall mannequins. This is quiet a turn around for that smiling elderly Toulon we seen in the first. Toulon (ths time played by STEVE WELLS) makes his appearance on camera about midway, calling himself Erik Chaney, while dressed as the Invisible Man (in fact FULLMOON would have another character of theirs to dress like the Invisible Man in Invisible The Chronicles Of Benjaman Knight, a few short years later) & Wells does a fairly good job of bringing the character to life (no pun intended). FULL MOON also introduces a new puppet in TORCH, (who's name should give you a good idea of what his speciality brand of killing is!) a really good & scary looking puppet, that sadly would only make one other appearance in this series (PUPPET MASTER 5) it's such a shame, since he's my favourite of all the puppets, but at least he gets plenty of screen time here. The film also goes deeper into Toulon''s past & finally answers the questions that went unanswered in the first, such as how Toulon discovered the formula that re-animated lifeless objects. It all happened in 1912 Cario Egypt (told via flashback) during a touring of a failed puppet show of his called FAUST. With the formula given to both him & his wife Ilsa, by an ancient sorcerer named AFZEL. The characters are better here & far more interesting than the bland psychic characters of the first (& not as obsessed with sex) the direction by the late David Allen is really good, he builds suspense & tension beautifully & thanks to what was obviously a bigger budget, there are more & better stop motion animation puppet effects! the puppets fit the plot much better here, than they did in the first. We see them more & they have more to do here. Plus, the film moves much faster & hardly has any, if any, slow spots in it. The story is very interesting & very easy to get hooked into. The film also delivers on the requisite nudity & gore that fans have come to expect in the series & the notion of the puppets extracting human brains from the heads of their victims was a nice ghoulish touch (The puppet oddly have a demonic snarling sound to them as well?) we also learn the history of the motel, in that it was built by an elderly woman mystic & that the land contained great power. Information given to her by an Egyptian. Although interesting, this theme was never brought up in any of the subsequent sequels or prequels.On the downside the film fails to answer some questions such as this The film claims Toulon died in 1941 & yet in the first film, it's 1939 when he shot himself, so which was right? Plus I had a hard time buying into the idea of the puppets needing Toulon to help them make more of the serum to keep them going. I say this because they waste what little serum they had, re-animating a glass bird statue! We also hear Toulon using a chant like in the original before he killed himself, but the film never tells us what it's for? also Toulon assumes the lead heroine is the re-incarnation of Ilsa his late wife & the film seems to be toying with the idea that she just might be, but were never told weather she is or isn't (it is notable that the lead heroine says to the hero, if she didn't get up by six a.m. she felt the day was wasted, something Toulon's wife also claimed & the fact she looks like Ilsa, Toulon's wife) & why didn't the group call the cops after the heroines brother is murdered? they just stash his corpse in some freezer in the motel?! I also recommend you see (the truly bad) PUPPET MASTER LEGACY for a complete chronological order of how & when each film should be watched, since this as we learn from that film, this one does not take place until well into the series & not after the first film. Look for the MR. PUNCH (DOLLS) doll sitting on top of a shelf in Toulon's room & watch when Jester goes to give the character of Camille's corpse the serum to resurrect her at the end of the movie, you can clearly see a hand holding him up, if you look closely. All in all, PUPPET MASTER II, is faster, scarier, weirder & more energetic film than it's predecessor.

Not that this is a negative review of Vertigo (its not really a review as such, just a little musing), but its just that I don't think it quite deserves its title as one of the Top 100 films of all time. While I admit I have only seen the film once, that one viewing is more than enough for this type of movie.Firstly, I found the storyline a bit over-dramatised and at times confusing. While the basic plot is fairly simple, the various plot twists and turn can often one wondering where the film leaves off. For example, when the main character John 'Scotty' Ferguson (played by Stewart) meets 'Judy' who was playing 'Madelline' the whole time. The viewer is not told whether Stewart knows Judy is Madelline or not as if would seem pretty obvious they are the same person. I also don't get the end scene, how is 're-enacting' the scene supposed to cure Detective Ferguson's vertigo? But that's probably my lack of understand.In addition, the characters were often inconsistent. Why does Judy suddenly become so trusting of Det.Ferguson? In the first half of the film, there's a sense of unreality of the whole story that's quite hard to pick. As if the entire movie is a whole dream. Stewart's character of a hard-nosed detective is played out well, although he quickly becomes obsessed and paranoid later in the film. Indeed, his character is multi-layer and in many parts of the film we see a darker side to his nature. The character of 'Madeline\/Judy' obvious differs from the first part preceding the 'real' Madelines death, and the second scene. In terms of technique, the movie was perhaps typical of detective type movies of the period which used music scores to add drama and suspense. I thought the score was a bit much at times, and could have just been toned down a bit. What I mean is that what was actually happening on screen was not sufficiently suspenseful to require such a soundtrack.Anyway, I'll give it 7\/10 stars.

For example, when the main character John 'Scotty' Ferguson (played by Stewart) meets 'Judy' who was playing 'Madelline' the whole time. The viewer is not told whether Stewart knows Judy is Madelline or not as if would seem pretty obvious they are the same person. I also don't get the end scene, how is 're-enacting' the scene supposed to cure Detective Ferguson's vertigo? But that's probably my lack of understand.In addition, the characters were often inconsistent. Why does Judy suddenly become so trusting of Det.Ferguson? In the first half of the film, there's a sense of unreality of the whole story that's quite hard to pick. As if the entire movie is a whole dream. Stewart's character of a hard-nosed detective is played out well, although he quickly becomes obsessed and paranoid later in the film. Indeed, his character is multi-layer and in many parts of the film we see a darker side to his nature. The character of 'Madeline\/Judy' obvious differs from the first part preceding the 'real' Madelines death, and the second scene. In terms of technique, the movie was perhaps typical of detective type movies of the period which used music scores to add drama and suspense. I thought the score was a bit much at times, and could have just been toned down a bit. What I mean is that what was actually happening on screen was not sufficiently suspenseful to require such a soundtrack.Anyway, I'll give it 7\/10 stars.

One of the best films I have ever seen, Reservoir Dogs combines action, suspense, and even a hint of comedy to create one of the greatest films of all times. This film is centered around a robbery that is never even directly shown in the film. In my perspective, this proves Tarantino's genius. Reservoir Dogs is the number one best movie on my list.The film is about a group of strangers with a common goal. They are trying to pull a simple diamond heist. With their headquarters in an abandoned warehouse, the five are confident that nothing will go wrong. All of them following the command of their leader Joe Cabot, the code named strangers go by Mr. Pink, Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blue, and Mr. Blonde. The robbers suddenly realize, in the climax of the film, that their plan is flawed. They figure out that one of their own is a cop. They just don't know who.The cast is great. My favorite actor in the film was Steve Buscemi, who played Mr. Pink. Though it may have been how well his character was written by Tarantino, I believe that excellent acting contributed to his success in the film. He was not only able to add comic relief in the 'Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?' scene, but he also did an excellent job playing the only character who kept his cool in the final, action packed scenes. The other actors were great also. Tim Roth also did considerably well as Mr. Orange as he slowly died throughout the film. Quentin himself appeared briefly in the film as Mr. Brown. The cast, writing and the plot make Reservoir Dogs my all time favorite film. Quentin has yet to fail.

Not much happens, and when it does it's with horrible non-actors at the center. Mostly you go crazy with boredom watching this lifeless, unbelievable mess. At least it seems to have a point, unlike Shining, which is completely pointless. And it is art, unlike Full Metal whatever, which is simply a mirror of reality, completely artless. For 18th Century costume drama and authenticity, I prefer The Duellists, a small, unpretentious film by Ridley Scott, who can make a movie move, or Amadeus, with a real script, acting, and edgy performances and directorial choices that enlighten. Barry Lyndon is some kind of phony experiment that sacrifices the audience on behalf of Kubrick's vision. Was he trying to say that acting is nothing but moving a few dummies around in front of the lens? Is this movie all about the lens? Who cares. That's not enough. Ryan O'Neal is so bad, and Marisa Berenson so blah, that all the high-falutin photography and fancy dresses fade into meaninglessness. O'Neal's character is an Irishman who climbs through English society with a brogue and goes to Mass? In the 17th Century Catholics were being hung for going to Mass - the Penal Laws weren't repealed until the 1830s. Certainly the native Irish had no entree into colonial English society, period, end of story. So much for Kubrick's vaunted fanatical management of historical detail. The story is simply unbelievable. In France they call a model a mannequin, and Berenson, an It-Girl of her era, is truly is as lifeless as a stuffed dummy. Maybe she had some lines originally and was so bad, worse than O'Neal even, they shut her up. Her face is a beautiful mask - literally. Lifeless, stiff, inexpressive.

This adventure lasted a paltry two days, but, in that time, I viewed, for the first time, a handful of Hitch films I'd theretofore avoided. I hadn't avoided them because I'd heard they were bad; simply put, Hitchcock, after the brilliance of Vertigo, let me down. Vertigo introduced me to the man and it made such an impression that I promptly went out and watched his other major works. Yet, every new film I watched was a great step down from the previous film (Rear Window was a much lesser film than Vertigo, Psycho a lesser film than Window, and then the Birds and Rope sitting there at the bottom of the barrel). I couldn't believe that the man who had made a masterpiece such as Vertigo could also create the, pardon the pun, lame-duck Birds. In any event, I ignored my past and dove back into his oeuvre, watching Strangers on a Train (excellent), The Lady Vanishes (absolutely brilliant), Rebecca (fantastic), Notorious (superb) and Spellbound (decent). At the top of my list of Hitch to view, though, was Frenzy which I was unfortunately unable to locate at the local video store. Well, in the library last week, while trying to decide whether or not I should watch Fanny and Alexander for the third time this year, I saw Frenzy not too far away. I grabbed it, happy with my choice, and left. Of the several films I borrowed from the library that day, I saved Frenzy for last. I'd like to say I saved it because I knew it would be the best film of the bunch; in truth, I had no idea what to expect. Let's say I was more than pleasantly surprised. In my humble estimation, Frenzy may just be Hitchcock's second greatest film. Why? Mostly because its blend of terrifying violence and gallows humor is brilliantly inter-mingled - also because he reveals the murderer within the first 45 minutes. Your standard mystery\/suspense yarn typically waits until the last fifteen minutes to un-mask the murderer\/thief\/saboteur. Hitchcock, and writer Anthony Shaffer (working from an Arthur La Bern novel), let us in on the secret early. That they keep our interest for the rest of the two-hour film is incredible. That, though, is prime Hitchcock for you because it's not what the man's films are about - it's how they're about them. In fact, this entire film is prime Hitchcock. It contains beautiful camera technique (the tracking shot that reveals a murder occurring in the hub bub of daily London life is gorgeously chilling) and the steady, but brutal, hand of a master in control. Case in point the first on-screen murder represents the most uncomfortable, yet terribly engrossing moment in any film I've seen in a long time. (For an interesting counterpoint to this scene - which is absolutely taxing upon the audience - see the rapes in A Clockwork Orange, made a year earlier, which titillate rather than horrify). ( Also see the scenes with Scottie remaking Judy in Madeline's image in Vertigo for another example of this uncomfortable\/engrossing quality). Oh, but did I mention that it's a riot too? Yes, that's right - Frenzy is very funny. The domestic scenes involving a police inspector and his wife's newfound affair with Continental cuisine will make anyone laugh, but the truly brilliant humor is much more subtle and much more dark. Not to give too much away, but rigor mortis has never been so amusing. I know it's atypical to call Frenzy one of Hitch's greatest works, but my belief in this fact is sincere. The master uses an R-rating to show us what, exactly, he is capable of doing. This is Hitchcock unleashed, letting all his darkness and absurdity flow forth in a sharply satirical, horrifying, and brilliant film. It takes the piss with Psycho, North by Northwest, the Birds - anything post-Vertigo. And, for me, it challenges his brilliant, early career as well. The only film it cannot touch is Vertigo, but to expect that it could is silly. It's a late masterpiece and would have been the brilliant end to a brilliant career (Family Plot is all right; but it's no Frenzy).

'The Philadelphia Story' is a magnificent romantic comedy, being very theatrical in many parts, but with great dialogs, including about fight of classes, and never boring. The cast is splendid and the black and white photography is wonderful. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil) 'Núpcias de Escândalo' ('Nuptials of Scandals') ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"29 November 2004","score":"9 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Godzilla 2000, actually completed in 1999 (and was released during the summer of 2000 in America), was the first Toho-backed kaiju-eiga film to receive a major theatrical distribution in the U.S. since 1985. I saw Godzilla 2000 at the theater and wasn't disappointed, even though a lot has changed since Toho killed off their iconic monster at the end of 1995's Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah.I'm 19; I've been a hardcore G-fan since I was four years-old and of course, I was quite hesitant about seeing a new Godzilla film, being that the Americanized 1998 version wasn't that good. The Toho logo that appears during the opening credits reassured me that Godzilla 2000 was taking me back to the good old days when Godzilla wasn't afraid to knock down a building or stomp down the military when they threatened him.With their third generation of Godzilla films being kicked off with this flashy new movie, Toho continued a trend that was seen in generation two, where they discard the events of the previous Godzilla incarnation and instead start with the original 1954 Godzilla and work from there.Toho took full advantage of this new series by designing a distinctly reptilian Godzilla, who as the film opens, has already popped up on the radar of some brainy scientist who argues that Godzilla should be studied, instead of destroyed.And Toho didn't skimp on creating a new monster either, which is a giant UFO that yields something a lot more than just martians. This new foe is actually a nasty little creature that's never given a name, though subsequent debate about the film has concluded that its name is Orga, who proceeds to try to consume Godzilla and his powers, thus creating one powerful monster.Godzilla 2000 has a lot of problems too, which may or may not mar an otherwise decent stomping experience. Though on the whole, it's nice to see Godzilla back in form (somewhat) and this Toho production firmly returns their most beloved creation to dominance, it also suffers a lot from the problems that have plagued its predecessors, and some of those problems may have been due to Roland Emmerich's 1998 Americanized version of the big green guy.Of course, since I never really cared for the people in a Godzilla movie and those feelings haven't changed, it must be pointed out here that the people have been drastically short-changed in favor of the all-out monster showdown that is the film's climax. You're really given a reason to not care about humans in this picture, whereas any previous Godzilla movie may have made you have an inkling of feeling for them.Godzilla himself has changed a lot, with massive plates that line his back and he's also been given a pretty nifty set of fangs. But the thing is, this Godzilla looks and behaves quite... different. Though it's evident with this production that Godzilla is the bad guy (pending on your view), this was one of the things that really struck me as unique about the previous generation of kaiju-eiga films - in that you never really knew if he was the bad guy or not - this movie makes that pretty clear to you, even though the new monster Orga is clearly the bigger problem for the people of Japan.The special effects in this third generation Godzilla film seem to actually be a step back too. The previous generation (the first two movies at least) had really beautiful and thoughtful effects that put you into wonder about how they were achieved. This series doesn't have that level of wonder for some reason. You'd expect their effects to improve over five years or so, but these effects look rushed and unrealistic.Aside from these quibbles, Godzilla 2000 doesn't suffer a whole lot, but I was glad to see that it firmly reestablished Godzilla back to his good old, stomping self.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 November 2004","score":"9 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Godzilla 2000, actually completed in 1999 (and was released during the summer of 2000 in America), was the first Toho-backed kaiju-eiga film to receive a major theatrical distribution in the U.S. since 1985.
