The original is so good and tough, lean and stark, short and to the point. This laughable mess goes on for an unbearable three hours, and has as its centerpiece, it's anchor, its star, Al Pacino who is simply dreadful. What has happened to this once exciting actor who gave so many memorable performances in the early seventies. His downfall may have begun with this very film, and he has gone downhill ever since. All his recent roles & performances seem the same, they blend and melt into one. His performances have become lazy, fat and dishonest. At times it seems as if his performances are yelled at us, and this is usually mistaken as intense and powerful acting. When he tries to be subtle and quiet,he comes off as insincere and all method. He was fun in Dick Tracy, because he was playing a cartoon, and his overacting was exactly right for a comic strip. His performance was all make-up. His Oscar for the cheap & sentimental Scent Of A Woman was undeserved, but as Oscar saw it he was long overdue. So in Scarface we have Al playing gangster with a bad Cuban accent which comes off as a bad Mexican accent. DePalma & the screenwriter Oliver Stone have change the Italian criminals of the original to Cubans, and instead of booze we have coke, instead of the fine subtle Hawksian direction of the original we have De Palma's over the edge misdirection. To be sure DePalma has made some terrific original films. Carrie, Sisters, Dressed To Kill and The Untouchables immediately come to mind, but Scarface is not one of them. There is however one top notch DePalmian sequence and thats the chainsaw in the motel bathtub scene, but thats only a few minutes in a three hour flick. The violence and gratuitous cursing wears us out, and after awhile it all becomes meaningless and stupid. I envy Michelle Pfeiffer who in the film gets to walk out on this mess. Also in the cast is F. Murray Abraham, one year away from winning a best actor Oscar and oblivion, & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who in the flash of a snort goes from being a good sweet girl to a raging party girl,unconvincely I might add.  The film also looks ugly and the recently deceased John A Alonzo's cinematography is muddy and common. Not exactly a highpoint of American cinema.

Just how many more stupid auxillary characters must we put up with before Disney.money decides to become Disney.art again?

At least with Hercules or Aladdin, the whole movie was kind of goofy and unreal, but to do that to Hunchback (and worse, Eddie Murphy's dragon in Mulan) is nearly intolerable.  If it gets worse before it gets better, I almost expect the filmmakers to start emulating the insultingly stupid gross-out comedy of the Farrelly brothers and Tom Green (please, God, no! We already have Heavy Traffic).It would have been one thing if the gargoyles were actually imaginary friends of Quasimodo, as my old roommate and I had hoped when we first saw this movie.  That would have made more sense and given Quasimodo's predicament more urgency--not to mention, the choice would have been totally his instead of being more-or-less dared into it by friends who apparently spent their winter days in New York, for all they understand about Quasimodo's situation.  After all, would real friends try to convince someone to incur the wrath of his abusive father just for a little afternoon fun, or would they try to help him escape the situation?Thankfully, scenes with the gargoyles amounts to a relatively small portion of this otherwise terrific movie.  The scenes between Esmerelda and Phoebus (Demi Moore and Kevin Kline) are full of witty, dry, almost Hitchcockian wordplay (imagine how much better the movie would have been simply if this type of humor had been used throughout, instead of that silly (and worse, unoriginal) slapstick).  Tom Hulce, as the bell-ringer does the movie a tremendous service by being able to elicit emotions even with the gargoyles on screen.

He has emotions, he has mixed feelings about things.  He feels guilt, he has to make decisions--even if they are bad ones.  He is a human being.

His co-horts are untrustworthy and (gasp!) lazy, and his two girlfriends are both horrid in their own special ways.The movie is an action comedy...but not in the way we might expect (a la Rush Hour or its ilk).  It is obvious the budget was low, so the makers of the film obviously decided the whole tone of the film should be cheesy.But almost everyone in the movie gets into the style of silliness, and thus a non-finicky viewer has an amusing 90 minutes.  Here's one example of the ever-shifting tone  Mark Wahlberg (our likable hit man) is coming home to his fiancee (Christina Applegate...a jewish princess with an over-the-top accent and really tight pants).  He is driving with a chopped up body in the trunk, and pulls into his suburban driveway...except its not his house, just one that looks exactly like all the other houses in the neighborhood.

A sequel to Buckaroo Banzai, a Western with Chinese magic, re-written (against the original writers' wishes) as a modern movie, tampered with before, during, and after production. It certainly wasn't an easy project for John Carpenter. Fox had no clue how to promote the film and just dumped it into theatres for the audiences to make up their own minds. Unfortunately it didn't find much of an audience until it hit VHS (in horrid pan-and-scan format).It's a great film for kids, filled with action, humor and remarkably slick special effects. Upon watching it as an adult you'll probably be less entertained. Kurt Russell plays Jack Burton, a bumbling, overly-confident hero who is all hot air and swagger. He's unwillingly recruited by his Chinese friends to venture into the catacombs beneath San Francisco to rescue a girl who is about to be sacrificed to a demon in return for granting flesh and life to a 2000-year-old Chinese emperor. Wow! That's pretty out there. And the fact that the plot is so self-aware of its wackiness prevents it from getting boring. We're constantly bombarded with weirdness and surreal moments. David Lynch once said that audiences would rather be confused than bored. BTILC proves him correct.The action is a let down. There are a few bland, bloodless, badly choreographed rumbles but Carpenter's slick anamorphic Panavision photography makes the rest of the film look so good it nearly makes up for it. His score has its great moments, but is too dated. Really, this is Russell's film.

","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"4 June 2001","score":"","review":"  This is the meanest, nastiest, most vicious we've seen Woody Allen.  And so much of it is directed towards himself.  We certaily all know that Allen's films are very much about himself and his persona, but this one is filled with a heavy dose of self-loathing.  It also has very little good to say about anyone else, particularly women.  It's just a bit frightening how much vitriol Allen has.  His character only seems to like his son and a prostitute.But as the movie progresses, he gets little telling glimpses of the effect he has on others, and how this has helped make him so unhappy.  Will he change...doubtful. But at the end, we feel like maybe we've gotten a fairly unsugarcoated look at how Woody Allen really feels about himself, his art and the women in his life.The movie is really, really funny.  It's extremely foul-mouthed  (do not let kids near it...it makes Mira Sorvino in MIGHTY APHRODITE seem quite tame).  You also get to see some familiar actors doing some pretty down and dirty things...Julia Louis Dreyfuss in a rather explicit scene with Richard Benjamin...that alone is an eye-brow raiser.  The normally sweet Tobey Maguire is a sex-crazed younger version of Allen...to comic effect.  Judy Davis (one of the best actresses anywhere, period) is funny as a pistol-wielding former lover of Allen's, spouting intelligent (and extremely obscene) insults at him, while slowly coming unglued.We see a number of Allen's character's short stories acted out, and those are often amusing little ditties, although the one with the old Jewish couple is just silly.One excellent scene has Allen surprising his sister with a visit while he's on a drive to upstate New York to get an award.  She's married to a very conservative Jewish man, and has really turned her life over to a life some might call zealot-like (certainly Allen does).  The pain of Allen's and his sister's relationship is palpable...there's real pain on both sides...and real love.  Something we don't see often in Allen's glib, cynical world.The cast is unformly great (with one exception...in a moment).  Allen, Davis, Dreyfuss, etc.  Robin Williams makes a brief, amusing appearance, along with Julie Kavner.  Imagine those two married!!  Demi Moore, in a tiny part, is tolerable, and Billy Crystal is amusing as the Devil (yep, Allen's character goes to hell towards the end, and the conception of hell is pretty funny and pretty elaborate for a Woody Allen movie).  The exception to all the praise is Elizabeth Shue.  I'm sorry, but she seemed to have spent all her talent with LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  She is simply terrible in this film (and others, like THE HOLLOW MAN & COUSIN BETTE), playing the part of Allen's current love interest.  Although seeing Allen with all these young beautiful women is always hard...they usually come across as intelligent and perhaps it is the shared intelligence that Allen and this young beauties share.  Shue, on the other hand, comes across as vacuous.  She almost looks like she's reading cue cards.  The few scenes she is in totally grind the movie to a halt.But, that flaw aside, see this movie if you like Woody Allen, and frankly, maybe if you don't like him.  He might agree with you! ","genre":null},{"date":"4 June 2001","score":"","review":"  This is the meanest, nastiest, most vicious we've seen Woody Allen.  And so much of it is directed towards himself.  We certaily all know that Allen's films are very much about himself and his persona, but this one is filled with a heavy dose of self-loathing.  It also has very little good to say about anyone else, particularly women.  It's just a bit frightening how much vitriol Allen has.  His character only seems to like his son and a prostitute.But as the movie progresses, he gets little telling glimpses of the effect he has on others, and how this has helped make him so unhappy.  Will he change...doubtful. But at the end, we feel like maybe we've gotten a fairly unsugarcoated look at how Woody Allen really feels about himself, his art and the women in his life.The movie is really, really funny.  It's extremely foul-mouthed  (do not let kids near it...it makes Mira Sorvino in MIGHTY APHRODITE seem quite tame).  You also get to see some familiar actors doing some pretty down and dirty things...Julia Louis Dreyfuss in a rather explicit scene with Richard Benjamin...that alone is an eye-brow raiser.  The normally sweet Tobey Maguire is a sex-crazed younger version of Allen...to comic effect.  Judy Davis (one of the best actresses anywhere, period) is funny as a pistol-wielding former lover of Allen's, spouting intelligent (and extremely obscene) insults at him, while slowly coming unglued.We see a number of Allen's character's short stories acted out, and those are often amusing little ditties, although the one with the old Jewish couple is just silly.One excellent scene has Allen surprising his sister with a visit while he's on a drive to upstate New York to get an award.  She's married to a very conservative Jewish man, and has really turned her life over to a life some might call zealot-like (certainly Allen does).  The pain of Allen's and his sister's relationship is palpable...there's real pain on both sides...and real love.  Something we don't see often in Allen's glib, cynical world.The cast is unformly great (with one exception...in a moment).  Allen, Davis, Dreyfuss, etc.  Robin Williams makes a brief, amusing appearance, along with Julie Kavner.  Imagine those two married!!  Demi Moore, in a tiny part, is tolerable, and Billy Crystal is amusing as the Devil (yep, Allen's character goes to hell towards the end, and the conception of hell is pretty funny and pretty elaborate for a Woody Allen movie).  The exception to all the praise is Elizabeth Shue.  I'm sorry, but she seemed to have spent all her talent with LEAVING LAS VEGAS.
