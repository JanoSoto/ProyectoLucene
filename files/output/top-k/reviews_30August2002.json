He would NOT (in his prime, or perhaps ever) have made something as turgid, and for the most part as dead, as this.From the moment Peter Appleton bangs his head to the moment when the two separate plot strands (finally, FINALLY) curl around and meet one another, there's not a single scene with any life - okay, to be fair, there's maybe one or two, but it comes to the same thing. Unconnected scene after unconnected scene, we're thinking to ourselves Why are we being shown this? I mean, why THIS? And why is it taking so long, and why is it so curiously dull?(Some spoilers follow.)And yet there's also too much material. I have no quarrels with the overall shape of the story; I can see the connection (not meant to be obvious at first) between Luke fighting in Europe and Peter standing up to HUAC, and I must admit I enjoyed basking in the two consecutive moments of triumph towards the end, even if they sit ill with one another (the ending, so far as the plotting went, needed a LOT of work, just as the rest of the movie so far as the pacing went needed a lot of work). But was the father and son stuff really necessary? Neither director nor writer really seemed to think so, since the moment the father looks as though he might get in the way of the plotting, he's packed off with unseemly haste - that is to say, he has a sudden heart attack, which DOES get him out of the way, but results in yet more material that's purely utilitarian in purpose, and NOT utilitarian in the sense of providing pleasure. Then there's that story conference at the end, where we hear a voice-over ask while the camera focuses on Jim Carey's face But has our hero suffered enough? and we groan heartily as we realise that we're now going to have to endure some supposedly clever self-reference, on top of everything else.I'm being harsh on The Majestic because it COULD have really been good. Frank Darabont, despite the impression I may have conveyed, is actually a good director; he just needs to divest himself of his habit of staring in the same rapt way at EVERY SINGLE MOMENT, as though they were all equally important or interesting.

(By way of comparison, even the lush, expensive A-movie with which The Majestic opens - An American in Paris - did not have so wide a screen. Its ratio was 1.371.) In almost all other ways as well, Sand Pirates of the Sahara is a pretty poor pastiche. And what was wrong with the suggestion made at the story conference at the end, involving the dog?

It was like Schumacher took the corniness of Adam West's Batman, and then tried to make it an integral part of the Batman theme.  The only problem was that in the case of West's version, nobody took it seriously; it was more of a spoof of Batman that was around just for a cheap laugh.  I really don't know what possibly went wrong in production that could create a movie this terrible.The biggest problem, and one that repeats along with every single unneeded one-liner is the acting.  I have tremendous respect for Arnold Schwarzenegger and still feel he is the best action hero Hollywood ever produced, but in this movie he performs as badly as he did in his early films.  The best part of Arnie's action movies were his one-liners, they were only said at certain moments in the films at the right time, which made them OK to enjoy and laugh at.  To have him yell out puns about his villain gimmick kills that little enjoyment.  Other actors that nearly saw their careers, which they spent years building up, are Clooney & Thurman. George Clooney makes a horrible Batman and Thurman's even worse as Poison Ivy. Other actors that didn't really have much of a career before this disaster were O'Donnell & Silverstone; Robin spends way too much time whining and complaining while Alicia Silverstone couldn't act if her very existence depended on it.The direction is also just as wretched; highways towering over high-rise buildings, neon lights being blasted onto every single skyscraper in town, observatories being held on statues, folks, I can only stretch my imagination so far, OK? Gotham must have one hell of an electric bill to keep those neon lights going all night long.  The action scenes are just as cheesy; Freeze driving his vehicle onto the arm of a statue and jumping off the end back onto the freeway? Come on, plus the fight scenes are akin to what I would expect from Looney Tunes (characters throwing people 20-feet into the air?).Other glaring errors only point towards this movie's soul purpose to bring more merchandising dollars to the studio.  Like when Batman, Robin & Batgirl race to the observatory in a Bat-glider, Bat-hovercraft and a Bat-cycle (I made those names up based on what I saw), I honestly thought the only reason they introduced those vehicles was to license some more toys to sell.Surely B&R did something good, right?  They did develop Alfred a little better (I always felt he was the most underrated of all the Bat films) and show his relationship to Bruce Wayne, albeit very poorly.  I guess it's the thought that counts and the fact that they chose to include that little development was welcome.Burton had a good idea with the first two Batmans; nice, dark, gothic, with strong characters and well-developed villains.  Batman Forever hovered above the level that B&R resides on by providing some decent acting and the fact that Burton was on the crew (as producer).

That's as much as the writers seem to have grasped; even though I wouldn't have the first idea how to construct a screenplay, I think I could write a more pointed parody, of ANY viewpoint at all, while half-asleep and drunk. And this lazily sketched woman will turn out to be a major character.For the first forty minutes or so we're served nothing but old leftovers from the bottom shelves of the larder of popular culture, so stale and musty and unappetising it's impossible to tell when they were put there in the first place, or why. The guys are rowdy (that's it, that's all they are); the chicks sit around in a circle and talk chick stuff. It's excruciating.Towards the end there's the odd touch of humour and the story turns unexpectedly sweet, sort of, in a kind of a way; and this feels good, even refreshing, as you'd expect mediocrity to feel after a painful ordeal of laboured badness.But comparatively good isn't the same thing as good. Is there anything REALLY good about the movie? Yes, there is the poster. It has an unusually clever design as movie posters go. I like it. I also like the fact that it doesn't constitute false advertising it doesn't make the movie look as though it will be anything other than a dog. Or as the screenplay so wittily puts it in Greek letters, a delta omicron gamma. Ho ho.

Almost as if there were more street lights than the night before, or perhaps the headlights on the cars were brighter.  Whatever the case, by the time I got home, I still hadn't decided whether or not I liked this movie.I did like Jennifer Aniston's performance. Of that I'm positive.  As Justine, she portrays a woman torn between her head, heart, and her soul with an elegance and depth that viewers of Friends never get to see.  I was impressed with her ability to stretch so far from what some might see as her `customary' character.  Without the makeup and fancy clothes, you see Justine, as she's meant to be seen - simple, trapped, looking for escape, with a twinge of mischief in her eyes.  And it's worth mentioning that Aniston seems more comfortable in this role than in any other I've seen.By no means a `new' type of character; Aniston brings a freshness and grace to the screen for what may have otherwise been the death knoll for this movie.  There are other semi-notable performances, John Reilly as Justine's husband Phil, and Tim Blake Nelson as Bubba offer viewers a pleasant relief from the main story line, that of Justine and her affair, Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Gyllenhaal's performance is to say the least, sophomoric, flat and rather difficult to sit through.The story line is predictable, leaving little to the viewer's imaginations, but there are a few poignant moments, and if you really want to know what they are, I will tell you.  But I don't want to spoil it for those that may see the movie.Having thought about it some more, I have decided that I did am not all that wild about this movie.

I've kind of wanted to see this movie since I was a kid, but it's taken me a good three decades to realize that goal.  It had all my little kid friends abuzz in the '70s -- those who'd seen it, somehow -- and I can see why.  This, really, is your basic macho war movie.  It's a kind of film that doesn't get made much any more, or -- at least -- not released theatrically.  It's got fewer redeeming qualities than war movies (or movies set during wartime -- there's a difference) made since the mid-'70s, basically in light of the American experience in Vietnam and the domestic reactions to that experience, and it's more a straight shoot-'em-up that almost glorifies violence.  It has a few subtleties, however, that set it apart from the truly mindless violence of some films that I could name (many of them from the '80s).  The film touches upon class, race, and other social structures and its diverse cast does a great job of creating and resolving conflict as kind of a microcosm of any multicultural society.  Justice and the idea that officers might sometimes be the last people that you'd want to have running things also belong as major themes, though they've been more fully and effectively developed before (e.g., What Price Glory, All Quiet On The Western Front) and since (e.g., Apocalypse Now, Gallipoli, Hamburger Hill).The cast works really well, and includes some unlikely candidates such as footballer Jim Brown (who did a great job in this, his second movie, by the way) and musician Trini Lopez (who even gets to sing a song).  Lee Marvin is excellent, as always, as the gruff but not humor-free (and, in his own right, subversively insubordinate) major who's charged with the team of criminals that become the Dirty Dozen.  I don't know who thought of casting the prototypical Noo Yawker Telly Savalas as a southern religious maniac (emphasis on maniac) but it does work and he's scarily and creepily good in the role.  Charles Bronson plays it straight in one of his better roles and does a good job.  John Cassavetes delivers the most intense performance (if I recall from seeing him in other films, I think that he _always_ did) as a troublemaker and his is a standout performance.  Donald Sutherland's character isn't fleshed out much, but he does get to act the fool in a couple of memorable scenes, including one in which he's passed off as a general.  The massive Clint Walker, who looks like a 70s-era Big Jim action figure come to life, is also great as a backwoods giant who's gentle until pushed too far.  Richard Jaeckel also acquits himself well as an MP in what I expected to be a short role, though he ended up going on the mission and was one of the three that survived.  George Kennedy and Ernest Borgnine don't have huge roles in this film but each is good in their part.  Of note perhaps is that both Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas were WWII veterans, both wounded in combat.This bunch of misfits are eventually whipped into a unit and they're such underdogs that most viewers will probably revel in their victory over Lee Marvin's priggish superior officer (played to arrogant perfection by Robert Ryan).  There's a fair bit of humor in this film, too, at least until the attack is launched.This is a violent movie and I found one particularly interesting moment to be when one of the Dirty Dozen is told to execute some Germans -- he obviously doesn't want to do it but the script doesn't belabor the point, it merely makes it obvious without him saying a word.  So, too, do some of the soldiers seem to harbor some qualms about obliterating Germans that they've trapped in a cellar.  The Germans herded below are slaughtered -- looks like a war crime to me, friends and neighbors.  In this respect, the film pulls no punches and, although otherwise not a particularly realistic film, it shows quite nicely (i.e., disturbingly) the ugliness and brutality of war. It's also commendable that this film never dehumanizes the Germans.  For that matter, if anyone are brutal thugs here it'd have to be the Dirty Dozen.I guess the bottom line for me is that I basically like this film, though I'm quite disturbed by some elements within (dumping grenades and fuel on trapped German officers and their ladies being the biggie) and I'd be a bit worried about someone who was a rabid fan of the movie -- at least if he giggled like Telly Savalas' character while watching Germans bite the dust. Maybe, on second thought, I just like the first half of this film.  By the way, Lee Marvin's character has a German name, that I'm sure was not unintentional ('rice man,' I think...I'd speculate that this was an oblique reference within an oblique reference, related to the Southeast Asian conflict that the US was embroiled in during 1967, but I'm not sure to what extreme these kinds of things need to be taken).

He is sort of where most of the comic relief comes from in the movie. That is another thing about the movie it is very funny. Typically, movies that try to be funny AND scary end up being a big mess. Signs is genuinely hilarious. But then it will turn around and be absolutely horrifying and sometimes disturbing. It succeeds. Many have complained about the film's religious undertones overwhelming the sci-fi premise. This simply is not true. The two themes go hand-in-hand with eachother as one story. Shyamalan has eased a bit off the artsy camera angles, something I kind of miss. The dialogue and characters are more realistic in Signs, and therefore makes your feelings for the people much stronger. Howard's music is not very versatile, but he has many variations of the theme and it is very effective and makes the movie even creepier. Signs is probably the most pop-culture-friendly Shyamalan movie, but considering how good this one turned out, maybe the other two needed some of that. I loved this movie.

This undertaking proves to be much more entertaining than his other two endeavors, The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable. And although I loved these two films, Signs surpasses them immeasurably. The basic plot is that a family living on a farm discover crop circles in their fields, the first of many bizarre occurances.

But in the city he is Earnest &#150; a young wag, a dastardly reputation and a good friend in the shape of fellow bachelor Algy.  However when he wants to marry his urban love Gwendolen he meets opposition from her guardian Lady Bracknell.  Jack tells Gwendolen where his rural home is &#150; and Algy overhears.  Enticed by Jack's description of his ward Cecily, Algy travels to Jack's home and poses as his made up brother Earnest.  However the arrival of Gwendolen puts the cat among the pigeons in a most frightful way that can only be resolved with delightful charm and wit (and some good fortune).It's been a few years since I saw the original and I've never seen the play or anything like that.  So I went to this unsure of what to expect.  Would it be a match for the wit of Wilde or would it pander to a lower sense of humour to try and win an easy audience?  The answer to me was somewhere in between.  The plot is as light and absurd as it should be &#150; but it's all done with such a great feeling of whimsy that you really don't mind the various twists at the end.Wilde's wit is used well and the whole thing is delivered in the manner befitting the material.  However it is the variations that don't quite do it.  Some of the wit has been watered down to the point that it feels a little flat &#150; indeed for 15 minutes I did struggle to get into it because it felt slightly dry at times.  More comical than witty scenes are still amusing but I wanted more clever word play etc.  However what there is is still better than the spate of crude teen comedies that seem to be never ending.  Wilde's wit comes through whenever it is given a chance.The cast are all good.  Everett grated on me at the start as I felt he didn't fit the role but he grew on me very quickly.  Firth also seemed strange at the start as the strict Jack but I very quickly got into him and he was suited to his role.  O'Conner is a delight and, with a good Witherspoon, works her facial expressions well to betray the longing behind her words of rejection.  The scene where the two ladies meet over crumpets to discover both love `Earnest' is hilarious!  Wilkinson is good, as is Massey but actors like Fox should never be underused in such a fashion!  The prize is Dame Dench.  She plays the most unpleasant and unsympathetic character but is easily the best.  In her Wilde's wit is the best transposed and she has many, many killer lines.Overall this is several miles below the classic and does feel a little like Wilde watered down a little to provide more humour that is universal (tattoos etc).  Some of the updates don't work as well as they should (all those fantasy scenes get tired after the first few times) but the wit is still better than much of the dross that passes as comedy recently.

Well, let me amend that.  For the first half hour I waited for it to get good.  After that my husband and I began to realize that it was never going to happen, and we began to try to salvage something from the two hours plus committed to this piece of junk by laughing at its idiocy and counting cliches.  We lost track somewhere around the shattered plate on the kitchen floor... or was it the it's me on the answering machine? I don't remember.  Not surprising, since this movie is utterly immemorable.  Was there supposed to be some sexual tension there?  Maybe any chemistry?  I can honestly say that the level of sexual tension is higher between Barney and Baby Bop, and Oompa Loompas have more chemistry than Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas did in this film.On top of all that, the script and timing were absolutely wretched.

I can honestly say that the level of sexual tension is higher between Barney and Baby Bop, and Oompa Loompas have more chemistry than Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas did in this film.On top of all that, the script and timing were absolutely wretched.

It is animated, but uses a technique called rotoscoping, which is drawing the animation over the top of live action footage. You can clearly see the live action is some scenes, such as Bree. Bakshi obviously wanted a unique look to the movie, but it ended giving a uniquely bad look. It was made back in the 70's and of course compares to todays standard, the movie is technically pretty bad. The sound isn't so great and the pictures quality (besides the rotoscoping problems) could definetly be better.Now I've said my technical problems, now onto the story adaptation. I'm not going to complain about things taken out of the story. Tom Bombadil was of course a sensible deletion. He wasn't important to the story, it would have made more important parts have to be taken out or rushed even more, and his singing all the time wouldn't have been very cinematic. The gripe I have is the heart of the story. Characters in this film have little,if none, heart. Gandalf in the books, and in the new Peter Jackson movie, has a heart. He cares greatly for the hobbits and has a wonderful twinkle in his eye. But is this movie, he has a rather edgey, almost scary personality. He talks to Frodo in Bag end almost as though he's glad Frodo's life is at risk. At the Council of Elrond, he evils yells, pounds the table and pushes Bilbo into his seat. Where's the heart? Adapting both Fellowship, and half of Towers into a two and a half hour movie, causes the story to considerably be cut. The Council of Elrond, which is the longest chapter in all the books, passes by in far too short of time to even be considered important to the story. All the scenes are rushed and pass by as though Bakshi was bored with every scene and wanted to move onto the next as quickly as he could. A lot of the interesting parts of the story aren't even told. The inscriptions on the Ring are never seen, Galadriel almost comes across as a ditsy, rather un-serious woman, and Saruman is sometimes called Aruman and sometimes called Saruman! Bakshi obivously made a mistake when he decided to throw in half of Two Towers on the end of Fellowship. Luckily Peter Jackson didn't fall to the same trap.I did see this movie after I saw Peter Jackson's movie. I knew that it was made in 1978 and was animated. I actually continued to enjoy this movie as a telling of the story, even though it was a thoroughly bad adaptation. Any thing that is about Lord of the Rings has to be good in some way. For people who haven't read the books, it's a good introduction to the world of Middle Earth, but you have to realize  theres a lot of information missing. Watch the new Peter Jackons films to get more of the story.Over all, this movie is good, but bad. I like it, but not even close to the same level I enjoy the new New Line Cinema films on. If you like old animated films with a good story (could be way better)then pick this movie up.
