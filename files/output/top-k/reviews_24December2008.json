Films where the plot takes a backseat to the set-pieces. Films where the dialogue isn't so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose. There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones.It's an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares that picture's ethos, but not quite it's execution. Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined. Whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget. Often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster - see the pug-ugly remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds.The plot and much of the dialogue isn't much to write IMDb about. Often you'll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each of whom will voice it with different inflections. A lot of people found this annoying; I find it raises a smile. Each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it's also amusing to see Mrs Pitt not given first billing here). The chemistry between good ol' Saint Nick the stalwart (see date of review) and Angelina leads to a couple of nice moments.The villain is not even a little scary - I've seen Chris Eccleston play tough-guy roles before so I know he can handle them, but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action. We know the heroes are going to succeed, somehow; we're just sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. I think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far in-cheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating. In fact, I wouldn't have minded some fourth-wall breaking winks at the camera it's just that kind of movie.All this style and not so much substance - something that often exhausts my patience if not executed *just* so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part, it is. Wonderfully so. I've noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fast-cut extreme close-up shots to direct action these days. I personally find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time. I've been told that Cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance (in real life I mean - his character clearly doesn't care) and it shows. The man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slow-burning climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish - and FUN - way possible.So yes, this movie isn't an epic, life-affirming post-9\/11 picture with obligatory social commentary effort. The pacing is uneven, some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line. But car movies rarely come better than this. So if you hate cars... why are you even reading these comments?!I'd take it over the numerous iterations of The Flaccid And The Tedious (guess the franchise) any day. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 December 2008","score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" As much as I like big epic pictures - I'll spare you the namedropping - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes.

Every action-scene reminds me of something in Pulp Fiction, but only a lot more crappy. The acting is dull and uninspired, and a lot of the lines of the actors sound like they are reading cue-cards or something. What I also thought, is that a lot of the action seemed out of place sometimes and even kinda random. I don't know why, but this movie just tries too hard to be ultra-violent I think. Willem Dafoe does a miserable job of trying to portray a detective that desperately needs some vacation. Some scenes with him are just plain ridiculous, and thats a shame because I know Willem Dafoe is a good actor and I enjoy a great deal of other movies he has played in.The plot (if there even is a plot) is also a big problem. Its just so damn random. The only thing this movie is about are 2 Christian brothers who are out to kill every 'evil' person in the name of god. Thats it. Other then just being a ridiculous concept, its just unrealistic in every way. Maybe some die-hard christians will love it, but even they have to admit how utterly uninspired the plot is. I'm not going to spoil any of it, but I can tell you that the film doesn't have any type of development in the story what so ever. The whole movie just seems to be random a lot of times. The 2 brothers find somebody who is 'evil' in their perspective, they kill him, and detective Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) tries to solve who the murderer's are. Paul Smecker also does a shitty job as a detective seeing how much of a mess the 2 brothers are leaving.The Boondock Saints is a popular title nowadays and I can definitely see why it got so many hype, but the truth is that it really isn't all that special and the content that is worth watching I can bet that a lot of people have seen already in either a Quentin Tarantino movie or in some other movie.

I had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. And it rightfully holds that title.This is a spectacular film. Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. This is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as the bandits and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film slow-motion, a fade wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original source&#151;not by a long shot&#151;but considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time. And now that it's been released in a wonderful three-disc collection here in the United States, its audience will continue to expand and its legacy will live on. That's the only kind of fate a masterpiece should have.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"24 December 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" At the time I wrote this review, Akira Kurosawa had recently, and very quickly, become one of my all-time favorite directors. I had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. And it rightfully holds that title.This is a spectacular film. Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. This is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as the bandits and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film slow-motion, a fade wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original source&#151;not by a long shot&#151;but considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time. And now that it's been released in a wonderful three-disc collection here in the United States, its audience will continue to expand and its legacy will live on. That's the only kind of fate a masterpiece should have.

As another reviewer pointed out, the whodunit aspect takes a back seat to the spontaneous interactions of the characters, which are split between the filthy rich and the hired help. The story is completely non-linear. The script is literally wall-to-wall character studies, with the players moving from scene-to-scene like real people moving from room-to-room. What they do and how they got to this place is revealed only incidentally, leaving the audience to speculate as to the characters' back stories. And there is plenty of overlapping dialog to add to the ambiguity. It feels more like the viewer is spying on these people rather than watching a typical movie presentation.In true Altman style, two dozen characters are thrust together by way of a holiday weekend at a large English manor. The aristocrats are very busy, dressing, gossiping and shooting harmless birds by day, eating luxurious meals, playing games, and enjoying entertainment from a Hollywood movie star by night. They probably need some relaxation from all that work. All the while the servants are preparing food, washing clothes needlessly at night, and polishing their employers' watches with barely a moment to enjoy a meal or other extra-curricular activity themselves. But the servants and aristocracy share something in common they all have their own little stories which are revealed in bits and pieces through unselfconscious dialog.Both sides enjoy equal screen time. However, as the events progress, the viewer realizes that the hired help is not viewed in quite the same way as their aristocratic counterparts. Even from the beginning, when two of the upper-class characters are squabbling about their problems, one of the servants overhears their discourse. When one of the aristocrats realizes that eavesdropping is occurring, the reaction is rather unexpected, Don't worry, it's nobody. The servants don't really count as people, probably the prevailing view in 1930's England which had much of the same view of commoners as it had in the 16th and 17th centuries. And yet this attitude toward servants as lesser people has a profound impact on the quite unexpected ending of the film. One of the worst of the snobbish aristocrats is Countess Constance, played with perfect over-bearing stiltedness by the incomparable Maggie Smith. And of course she has one of the best lines I haven't a snobbish bone in my body. But of course she has her employee on bended knee throughout the film. You wonder if she may be a just target of the murderer's weapon! Later in the film, one of the servant characters moves up a few rungs on the hierarchical ladder literally overnight, much to the jealousy of the rest of the hired help.Part of what transpires seems very unscripted. Even by half-way through the film, the viewer only has a vague sense of who these people are. It is akin to certain science fiction films where aspects of futuristic life are presented without explanation. In Gosford Park, the stories of the characters are never announced but only hinted. Even by the moment of the murder, which occurs about 2\/3rds through the story, the viewer is only beginning to understand some things about the characters, but much is left unsaid and unrevealed. One of the interesting features of the film is that the story is entirely cast-driven. The ensemble is made up of name talent, but no big Hollywood stars, which is quite a breath of fresh air from the typical star-driven offerings that Hollywood is constantly cranking out. Instead, the cast is comprised of recognizable character actors who are often in supporting roles in the larger-budgeted Hollywood films. These people are some of the best actors in the business. It's somehow fitting that they would come together for this project.One other notable aspect is that some of the best actors play the servant parts, such as Helen Mirren (academy award-winner) who plays Mrs Wilson, the head woman servant, the late Alan Bates (renowned British actor) as Mr Jennings, the head of all servants, and Derek Jacobi of Caedfel fame as Mr Probert, another butler\/servant of the Lord's manor.An outstanding film, with an unexpected and sobering ending that forces you to think rather than feel fully satisfied in an escapist sort of way, like an Agatha Christie presentation might. This is a major achievement and a fitting swan song to one of the most innovative directors who worked in Hollywood, the late Robert Altman.

One wants to take his chances jumping into the river, the other wants to shoot it out with the posse and they bicker with each other like an old married couple, partially forgetting about the bounty hunters coming up behind them.That's just one example of many classic moments in this memorable Western a slightly fictionalized retelling of the true story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the two leaders of the Hole in the Wall outlaw gang that gained notable notoriety during the 19th century and into the early 20th century as they robbed trains and banks, fled from lawmen, tried to evade captured by fleeing to Bolivia, and just finding themselves wrapped up in the same mess again. Not very much is known about the personalities of the real Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, but Newman and Redford's performances bring to life two of the most memorable characters in film history.Basically, we Butch, who is the brains of the outfit. He plots, his scams, he comes up with the wildest ideas to get out of their seemingly never-ending predicaments. He's also quite pacifistic, having never shot anybody before. And then there's Sundance, who is just the opposite. Quick on the draw, bulls-eye with the aim, pessimistic, ready to fight any day. There is no moment of true friendship seen between the two of them and we can't imagine how there ever could have been since they are constantly being locked up in arguments about what methods of escape they should take next.

The plot it's nothing special. Just the basic, outlaws-on-the-run conventional tale but the talents of these three men make it work above others. There is also director Hill's effective blending between moments of silence and serenity and constant, ominous brooding omens of the worst kind. Such as the rumbling, storm-like sound effects used for the approach of the 'super-posse', which really heighten the efficacy of their presence since we seldom see them up close.It's also a very well blend of action, adventure, humor, drama, and comedy all into one motion picture. No, it's not perfect and there are a few elements and scenes in the film that I am not in favor of, such as this sequence where nothing is shown on screen except a slide-show of photographs that really overstays its welcome at least for me.

The human nature (bad or good) of these wizards is extremely well shaped and their performances extremely charming. Well this is true for the first part of the movie which shows, so to speak, the presentation of Hogwarth, the wizard school and its masters and students with a special prominence of the main character of Harry Potter (a well chosen charming child actor) and his two companions Hermione and Ron. However the second part in which the main plot of the searching for the sorcerer's stone develops itself, is much less brilliant in terms of imagination and special effects, becoming sometimes a bit dull and commonplace.

The plot about Kathy Bates marriage is more interesting compared to Ruth and Idgie. The portrayal of Evelyn's failing marriage and her being bullied by almost everyone around her is excellent. Her character really connects to me, and I would have loved to see her more. In fact, I think this plot could have been expanded to become a separate film.I also think the plot about Ruth and Idgie occupy too much screen time. It is too long and not engaging enough, and it bores me. It would be better to see more of Evelyn, and her transformation through her friendship with Ninny. In addition, the two plots are too thinly connected to each other until the very end. It was as if I was watching two separate films at the same time. By the time the twist is revealed, I have already lost patience.
