While admittedly a work of fiction, Payback shows us more of the real world than the average Hollywood flick.  In the real world, there are few instances where this guy is good, and this guy is bad.  Gibson in Payback is a villain, to be sure.  Not the first guy you'd want to send a Valentine to. But in the shades of gray painted in this gritty, underground crime world, is Mel better or worse than the Big Crime bosses he pursues?  I really don't think the question is relevant.  We root for the bad guy, Mel, because he's the guy telling the story.  It's all in the slant you view the film on. Payback is harsh, violent, and filmed in a manner that makes it feel, overall, like a noir detective movie.  But it also is a movie that is not afraid to let us know exactly what we could find in the real world, if we wanted to look.  Take, for instance, the family man\/crime boss played by Kris Kristofferson.  Is his family aware of his dealings in organized crime?I don't believe Payback can be discounted as trash, or labeled as a contributing factor in the sorry state of our world.  It is not the aim of the filmmakers to corrupt moviegoers or instill the idea of a life of crime. There is no gloss or glorification of what Mel, or any of the other actors do to advance the plot.Simply put, Payback is a terrific film that isn't afraid to show the viewers everything, and to that I give it great credit.

A particularly good performance is offered by Gary Cole, whose depiction of the studied West-Coast-cool managerial style will resonate up and down Silicon Valley and beyond. It is interesting to see how the evil boss archetype has evolved since NINE TO FIVE's Dabney Coleman. Another well-executed character is Lawrence, a drywall hanger whose happy acceptance of his role in the working world frames the occupational disaffection of just about everyone else in the film (at this writing, IMDB does not give the name of this actor).While the dialogue and character depictions in OFFICE SPACE are top-notch, and plenty of laughs are to be had, the film fails as a caper movie, which leadens the last half. Jennifer Anniston is as easy on the eyes as ever, but her character, while well played, is window dressing.

In this way, DARK CITY stands apart from films like the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS or 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY.  Unlike these venerable sci-fi classics, DARK CITY is a mystery and, sooner or later, like most mysteries, there needs to be an explanation.  The difficulty is that here it comes sooner, and frequently.  But aside from this, and an overzealous use of explosive effects at the film's climactic duel, DARK CITY is interesting and entertaining.The story is fascinating and ironic in the best `Twilight Zone' tradition; and it has the makings for honest sequelae.  DARK CITY also manages to be complex and gorgeous to look at -- and (along with The Fifth Element) the best production design since BATMAN and DICK TRACY, darker still than the former, and more inventive than the latter.  Costumes and makeup are first class, completely in harmony with this eerie other world a city without daylight, where no one can quite remember their past.The startling and elaborate physical transformations of the city itself, which recur like clockwork, are surreal rather than believable; but then nothing about this story is meant to be realistic.  These transformations are so well choreographed and orchestrated that the drama of the moment holds sway.

But of course, there's also Harpo and Chico in their peanut stand routine. All three of them in the immortalized mirror sequence. In addition, this is one of the few movies that actually gives Zeppo something to do (not that it really helps the picture, but hey, I'm just trying to be nice.) And of course, Magaret Dumont, whose flustered manner has become shorthand at my house for pointing out the pomposity of our social betters. MIS-ter Hammer, indeed. (So it's from The Cocoanuts. So what.) How many classic lines could I steal from this movie? More than would fit in 1000 words, I can tell you that. One of my favorites- Pick a card. What'll I do with it? You can keep it, I've got fifty-one more. This movie only wants to entertain you, and it will DO so, regardless of whether or not you want it to. Woody Allen found a reason to live in watching Duck Soup in Hannah and Her Sisters, and I think that just about sums up the importance of this movie. Nonstop comedy from start to finish, courtesy of four of the undisputed masters of vaudeville. It's the kind of movie you should watch at least once a year, if only to remind you of what comedy should be. An absolute joy.

How can anyone say Opera is better than this? How many unnecessary musical interludes did that one have? Duck Soup is a pure hit of undiluted Marx Brothers madness. It deservedly holds a place among the finest comedies of our time, even if only for the brilliant one liners the script keeps handing Groucho.

When Leon is asked to open the door and he fights his conscience he not only saves our young heroine but can reclaim his own humanity. The contrast between violent action and touching, characterising interaction between the leads and corrupt DEA is great it is a film everyone should watch a classy piece of film which felt like it actually had a message, rather than a Tarantino style flick (which i like). The ending is bittersweet enough for me to love it and the film's general moral ambiguity.
