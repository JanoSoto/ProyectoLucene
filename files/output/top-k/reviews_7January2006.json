Many of these criticisms have merit. However, once I saw it (on VHS, long after the hype had died down), I enjoyed it quite a bit. The fact that I first saw it on VHS, on my living room television, may have had much to do with my positive reaction to it. Even though it is mostly set in the woods of Maryland, BWP's tiny cast and rough, grainy, under-lit feel lend it a curiously intimate quality, as of a ghost story told around a campfire at night...and I think this quality comes across better in a dark, silent living room than a large movie theater with dozens-to-hundreds of people in the place with you. I also think the grainy, cheap, hand-held feel translates better on the small screen. It's better than it deserves to be...you might think of it as one of those 'accidents' of film making like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In fact, I am pretty sure that the editors and the choices they made were what 'saved' this film from obscurity. Many slick film makers have tried to duplicate TCM, including its director, and no one has ever completely succeeded. I think the same is true here...the film makers got lucky and they knew it. Mostly, I think I enjoy BWP because I have a understand the true impact of the phenomenon that rangers and outdoors-men refer to as 'woods shock' - the devastating impact of being REALLY LOST in the woods. Modern urban dwellers can easily underestimate this impact and dismiss it because we've never been truly 'lost' in our lives. But many fit, experienced hikers and campers actually given up, laid down, and died from the stress of being lost in the North American forests and mountain ranges, often less than a day's hike from civilization and with supplies and rations still in their packs. The original meaning of the term 'bewilder' is to take someone out in the woods and get them lost, and leave them there...and it was first coined hundreds of years ago, by people who were much more comfortable in forests than we are now. So I think the basic story idea, of three callow film students going for a 'simple', ordinary overnight trip into the woods and stumbling into disaster makes for compelling viewing if it is handled right...and I feel that BWP use of the plot device of hand-held cameras (documenting their growing unease, bewilderment, and finally hopeless terror), is a brilliant stroke that sidesteps the issues of slick production work , professional sound work, 'good' acting, etc.Yes, there are some contrived elements that don't hold up to serious examination (especially the 'editting' of the film found in the cameras, which is much more 'dramatically apt' than a simple presentation of what happened), but that's true of almost any ghost story or horror story told around a campfire at night (And there, on the handle...was a HOOK!!!, etc. Like, I am sooooo sure...). But I found the casts' reactions to their growing predicament credible and enjoyed the way the plot kept turning the screws on them tighter and tighter. And while the payoff may have been annoyingly ambiguous, jumbled, and hard to decipher, it was plain that something Very Bad Indeed had happened to the film students. The glimpses provided of the walls of the house where everything comes to an end are the materials for good old fashioned nightmare fuel. What WERE those markings on the walls???

This is surprising, because I usually do know, but because the film did not go anywhere, I was a bit confused.Two people move into a somewhat communal household setting. Finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders to each other. After a platonic love affair, the male lead played by Tony Leung Chiu discloses that he has a mistress on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung is hurt, even though their love affair has not been physically consummated. Chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later, when everything has changed.For the cynic's part, the film is correct. By never actively or actually touching the part of love, but only approaching it, the film, admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair. At least that's the feeling I get.If we are to believe it, however, when Garica Marquez writes that ...love is a state of grace; not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself, then this film falls miserably short of this, as do all others. Or, if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism, hits it right on the mark. What films in history have achieved, approached, or sustained this phrase, if for only a short while? My honest feeling in memory is that about two. When Harry Met Sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection; and the getting is all in just getting there. It is interesting that in When Harry Met Sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in its attainment. Can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? Nicholas Spark's recent film The Notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film; are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension, or, more true perhaps, becomes latent vehicle for other ends? In the Mood for Love is an honest film,with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that Almodovar has to offer, yet all it manages to say in the end is that Life is sometimes like this. Now this is by no means a diffident thing to say, especially if said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to round out the film by relating, only for the second time, a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place. This is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the theme's relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, leaving the viewer to split the difference, a mistake in any film. A director should know where he is going, and how to get there. But in all honesty, it is only one wrong turn. However, as anyone knows, all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey.The effort, though, is definitely worth while; trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real foreshadowing, it is the crucial mistake. In a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. It is also, I think, too much of a challenge for the non-Asian viewer not familiar enough with China's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"7 January 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" For a long time I did not know weather I liked this film or not. This is surprising, because I usually do know, but because the film did not go anywhere, I was a bit confused.Two people move into a somewhat communal household setting. Finding their spouses constantly working or away on business trips, their attention, out of sheer loneliness, wanders to each other. After a platonic love affair, the male lead played by Tony Leung Chiu discloses that he has a mistress on the side. Su Li-Zehn, played by Maggie Cheung is hurt, even though their love affair has not been physically consummated. Chiu leaves the country, only to come back years later, when everything has changed.For the cynic's part, the film is correct. By never actively or actually touching the part of love, but only approaching it, the film, admittedly says more than so many others have on the subject. It is also true, I think, that nothing good could have come if they did go on to have the affair. At least that's the feeling I get.If we are to believe it, however, when Garica Marquez writes that ...love is a state of grace; not the means to anything but the alpha and the omega, an end in itself, then this film falls miserably short of this, as do all others. Or, if you are inclined to entirely incomplete minimalism, hits it right on the mark. What films in history have achieved, approached, or sustained this phrase, if for only a short while? My honest feeling in memory is that about two. When Harry Met Sally suggests effectively this romantic perfection; and the getting is all in just getting there. It is interesting that in When Harry Met Sally, this is done in the course of wooing, rather than in its attainment. Can't anyone say anything good about love after it has been achieved by two individuals? Nicholas Spark's recent film The Notebook comes closer to this perhaps than any other film; are we to believe that once love is achieved it flies of the radar only to exist in perfection in some other dimension, or, more true perhaps, becomes latent vehicle for other ends? In the Mood for Love is an honest film,with gorgeous and generous cinematography worthy in all respects of the best that Almodovar has to offer, yet all it manages to say in the end is that Life is sometimes like this. Now this is by no means a diffident thing to say, especially if said well, but the problem really comes at the end of the last act when Kar Wai Wong tries to round out the film by relating, only for the second time, a broader historical theme that plays in the background of the relationship which has just taken place. This is a worthy effort, and the variation on the musical motif played throughout the film is rather brilliant, but the theme's relatively spare indictment plays too little to have much more than a superficial effect on the holistically inclined audience, leaving the viewer to split the difference, a mistake in any film. A director should know where he is going, and how to get there. But in all honesty, it is only one wrong turn. However, as anyone knows, all it takes is one notable imperfection to spoil the perfect barrel of honey.The effort, though, is definitely worth while; trying to let a historical theme broaden and round out the film and raise it beyond the micro-meaning of the couple, but without any real foreshadowing, it is the crucial mistake. In a word, and unfortunately, it is too little too late. It is also, I think, too much of a challenge for the non-Asian viewer not familiar enough with China's history to appreciate completely this sweeping stroke.

Generally I do not necessarily expect a film with an historical content to be a piece of cinematic non-fiction but merely a source of entertainment, so I score it on this basis. If the distributors claim it as a true historical record then that is another matter. Enigma has a fairly good plot but suffers from poor direction and frequently indistinct dialogue. It centres around a young man and a young girl working at the Government's code deciphering establishment at Bletchley Park and their involvement in the breaking of the German U-boat cipher SHARK (or TRITON to give it its original German name). As the mechanics of the breaking of SHARK has little story value a sub-plot involving a femme-fatale as German spy is introduced. During 1941 our Atlantic convoy losses were becoming unsustainable so the ability to read SHARK was imperative. The film has a section in which the code breakers are shown helping a naval lieutenant to pinpoint the position of U-boats in the Atlantic based on wireless direction finding information. This was not the work of Bletchley Park so is historically wrong. In fact,convoys and U boats were tracked by the Admiralty in London. The film also purports that breaking SHARK was the sole factor in helping to bring down convoy losses. The truth is somewhat more ironic. Whilst we could not read TRITON\/SHARK the Germans could read the Royal Navy Cipher No. 3! However it took us a year to find out. It was this cipher which was used to transmit the rendez-vous points for departing convoys to RN escort vessels in the North Atlantic. The Germans picked this up at their listening stations and promptly re-transmitted it to their U-boat wolf packs who were then able to proceed to the rendez-vous ready to pick off their prey. This information was sent in SHARK so once it was broken we knew that RN Cipher No.3 was being compromised and had to be changed. As a result convoy losses decreased. The reason for the weakness in Cipher No.3 was that when WWII started the Royal Navy was essentially still using code book methods from the Great War and were very slow to adopt mechanical encipherment, similar to Enigma. On the other hand the RAF introduced it in the 1930s for use on the Defence Teleprinter Network run by the GPO. For this the Type-X machine was developed and was featured in the film for reading German enigma code. The German Enigma machine itself features prominently in the opening sequences of the film with several close-ups and supporting dialogue explaining how it worked.Did the Germans know that we could read their enigma messages? This is a moot point as officially they did not but both Rommel and Doenitz, the U-boat commander, were highly suspicious; Rommel because convoys from Italy to North Africa were frequently sunk and Doenitz because U-boat code changes only gave him a short term advantage against convoys. In both cases the leakage was blamed on spies, although it has been suggested that Doenitz's staff were very possibly convinced but dare not tell Hitler that Enigma was compromised, so they just contented themselves with improving the system. Unlike the British centralised Intelligence centre at Bletchley Park the Germans had separate intelligence staffs for each of the three services with the inevitable rivalry between them. This weakened their counter intelligence operations which, coupled with the extreme secrecy surrounding Ultra, meant that our success against Enigma went undetected.The film is well worth seeing for its entertainment value and just a wee peek at the work of Bletchley Park but for anyone interested in learning the truth about this fascinating story I suggest that they read the official history entitled British Intelligence in WWII by Professor Sir F. H. (Harry) Hinsley (himself an alumnus of BP), or just Google Bletchley Park.

There's also moments when the script examines if there's true evil(?), that when you free yourself you take sudden risks without a flinch and blah, blah, yeah there's more to it, but the film might think it's answering that query, but it's far from it. Although it tries for such more, by thinking, lets question ourselves at the end to make sure it looks like there's a deeper meaning to it all&#133; no thank-you! Not bad but not terribly good either.

Truly this doesn't happen in real life, but in REEL life we call it entertainment. I enjoyed it as a quirky comedy. I probably would not have been so entertained if it didn't have some of my favorite stars, some before they hit it big -- Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Debi Mazar, and Anthony LaPaglia. I was not familiar with Rory Cochrane, but his character Lucas was one of the best here.So, what's the story? LaPaglia is the manager of this Eastern US record store, Empire Records which has been in business since 1959, the sign tells us. On this fateful day employee Lucas is asked to close the store at midnight, and count all the money, twice. He does, and also observes that plans are in place to sell the business and convert it into a rather dull record store. So, he does what any good employee would do. Instead of putting the $9Thousand in the safe, he gets on his motorcycle and heads to Atlantic City with it! That begins a rather hectic 24 hours, involving all the employees of Empire Records.SPOILERS. Rory is so confident, he bets all $9Thousand at the craps table, rolls 7, and doubles the money. He leaves it on the table, rolls again, snake eyes, and loses it all. Much of the movie involves what to do about this. Other activities include one girl who decides to shave her head, a punk shoplifter who is chased down by Rory, and a stuck on himself recording has-been. They hold an impromptu party at the store, get enough to pay the $9Thousand back. In the end the owner gets fed up with everything and tells LaPaglia he can keep Empire Records, he will sell it to him at a very good price.Nothing Earth-shaking, just a fun movie to watch.

I saw it for the first time on TV last week. I sat up to watch it and as the credits rolled I immediately found myself wanting to watch it again. Two days later I bought the DVD and I've watched it four times in one week - partly because I've been looking for distractions from studying for exams, but mainly because it's endlessly entertaining. It really is a gem, one of my favourite films now.The script excellent. There is a perfect balance between hilarity and pathos. It's darkly funny; however, some scenes are just dark without being funny and are merely engaging. All the actors are very good but of course I can't review this without commending Richard E Grant's amazing turn as Withnail. He manages to make a belligerent, selfish drunk come across as lovable. I read that Grant is in real life a tee-totaller. Simply a great performance, no doubt about it.In a nutshell, it is a film about life, friendship, love (I'm sure there is love), dependency, and above all, I think, being wasted - and by that I mean both excess of alcohol and the waste of talent like Withnail's. That powerful closing scene is brilliant and saddening. I've started spreading the word about this film since nobody I know has heard of it and already I've made my brother and one friend love it too. I just wish I'd watched it before now, because it seems to get better with each viewing.

There isn't some madman trying to take over the world with some diabolical weapon; Robert Davi plays Franz Sanchez who's a criminal drug-lord that actually has values loyalty above everything. He only hires trusted friends and this is how he manages to succeed. Bond and Sanchez's paths cross after Sanchez maims Bond's long time comrade and friend Felix Leiter and kills Leiter's new wife. Bond takes this personally and resigns from MI6 and begins his quest for vengeance.Dalton's interpretation of James Bond has always been my favorite. Hardnosed and dedicated to staying alive and completing the mission rather than the lighthearted playboy nature of Roger Moore or the suave Sean Connery, who always seem to be ready for 'action'. That said, Dalton as Bond in this movie is superb. You see how bitter he is and how rash and dangerous his actions are as he goes into situations alone and using only his own intelligence since he doesn't receive any help from MI6. Eventually he befriends and protects CIA Agent Pam Bouvier played by Carey Lowell, and it's nice to see a Bond girl with some independence, character, and attitude. Not to mention she's easy to look at.Her counterpart is Lupe Lamora played by Talisa Soto, who's also very beautiful, and manages to help James Bond because as Sanchez's girlfriend she wants out but as evidenced by the opening sequence, there's no escape for her. Bond then becomes her way out of a life of crime and being Sanchez's pet (symbolized by the iguana Sanchez has) and he then acquires a side mission of helping her out. Another thing I like about this movie is the fact that there are so many key characters that get development. It's not Bond v. Villain + Main Henchman, as so often seen in past movies. Sanchez's crime syndicate is quite complex and you see Benicio del Toro as Dario, Anthony Zerbe as Milton Krest, Anthony Starke as Truman Lodge, Don Stroud as Heller, and Wayne Newton as Joe Butcher all make significant contributions towards the solidarity and completeness of this film.Also welcomed is the subplot of Bond accidentally meddling with a third party take-down of Sanchez. Bond tries to assassinate Sanchez and he gets captured by ninjas and questioned by one of Sanchez's drug buyers but Sanchez's team quickly finds them and Bond plays the whole situation off very coolly as if he was trying to protect Sanchez and calls them a freelance hit team. After that, the movie unwinds and Bond, with the help of Bouvier, Lupe, and Q (on his own accord), takes down Sanchez in style.The soundtrack to this film is quite good. The opening theme performed by Gladys Knight also happens to be my favorite Bond theme, and the rest of the soundtrack is appropriate, unlike Eric Serra's soundtrack for GoldenEye which was a disaster and sucked some life out of the film. And don't forget Patti LaBelle's If You Asked Me To, which is a very nice song to listen to.There are lots of memorable lines in it, too. One of my favorites being when Dario tells Felix Leiter about his wife We gave her a nice honeymooooooooon!!For me this has become one of those movies that I could pop in at any time and enjoy myself, and that's something special that I don't find in too many films.

It can stun you, with ten or twenty minutes of incomprehensible silence. It can deprive you of any certainty in the laws of nature - such as, people only die once - and thus leave you vulnerable and naked.I know that many friends to whom I've shown this move did not understand it. So I'm not saying you'll like it. But this is possibly the best (non-action) sci-fi movie ever made.Watch it at night, alone, when everything out of your home is dark, silent, and cold.

The reviews at the time were silly and relied on memories of the previous version while ignoring the fact that this was not a remake. Not to mention how ET was the darling of all involved (I will never understand how ET made so much money, It was a minor bit of confection) This film is not a remake of The Thing From Another World though it does use elements of that version of the story as an homage. This is an adaptation of the story Who Goes There? which the other film also used as source.The '51 version is a great film worth watching, but it is a very different movie with an approach based on the time it was made and should not be used as a comparison to Carpenter's The Thing. Well, now that I got that out of my system...This is a gory film in the sense that it shows all sorts of bizarre and gruesome events in astonishing FX sequences, however they are not there simply to be grossouts. The scenes are essential because they demonstrate the nature of the alien and are actually fascinating. Seeing how the creature is formless and just a mad collection of what it has infected can only be expressed through the scenes some find so repulsive.When the dogs are infected how they begin to morph makes me think about where the creature came from and what other previously absorbed creatures alien dna is influencing the process. Every time an infection\/transformation takes place it is so bizarre and seems to meld different species and biology. When the humans get infected I wonder does the creature have intelligence? Does it retain knowledge or simply mimic? Where did the creature originate and how many others has it infected? What if it eventually infected everyone? The actions of the team are understandable and realistic to me, they have no clue what is going on most of the time and some of the complaints I have read tend to come from people who are looking at this as if the characters should have known what the viewer of the film does.The characters split up numerous times but each time it is obvious why they do. Either they don't know the things the viewer does or the situation demands it.I have read some comments about how the characters are not fleshed out and the FX take it over, the people who say this saw a different film than I did. I remember each character distinctly. They all have scenes where they become individuals we recognize and their characters nature are essential to the progress of the plot. Watch the movie once and each character is memorable. At no point are the characters interchangeable fodder like in so many other Horror\/SF films. The actors are all distinct fully realized and the performances are memorable and unique.The film doesn't spell anything out, it is a great example of both SF and Horror. It is thought provoking and truly scary and it also has a perfect ending.Great Ennio Morricone score, great cinematography, the best performance by a dog ever, great mystery, and the list just goes on. This film, with precious few changes (some computer scenes date it), could be released today and would be hailed as a masterpiece and make a fortune.Was Childs infected? Was MacReady? What happens next? Great film.It also has my favorite line in history. Palmer's reaction to the spider-head... You Gotta be F**king kidding me!
