[{"date":"29 May 2009","score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" There are certain films which have become famous on account of one sexually provocative scene. From Here to Eternity is an excellent film, which deserves to be remembered for many things, but it lives on in the public imagination as the film where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr make love on the beach, even though that scene only occupies a short part of the film's running time. Similarly, The Seven Year Itch is remembered mostly for Marilyn's skirt billowing around her legs. And Wild Things, of course, is best known for That Kiss between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell, although to be honest it has so few intrinsic merits that it deserves to be remembered for little else. Sam Lombardo, a Florida high school guidance counsellor, is accused of rape by a female student, Kelly Van Ryan, the wild daughter of a wealthy family. Things start to look bad for Lombardo when a second student, Suzie Toller, comes forward to say that has also raped her. Lombardo is arrested and engages a lawyer named Kenneth Bowden to represent him. (Is it a coincidence that Lombardo has the same Christian name as, and his lawyer the same surname as, the hero of Cape Fear, another thriller set in the American South and which also involved allegations of rape?) When I started watching this film, I had no idea of the plot (except that it involved two girls kissing) and at this point I was still assuming that it would be either a traditional courtroom thriller or an issue movie about sexual abuse, but it turns out to be neither. There is an unexpected turn of events during the trial. Under cross-examination Suzie reveals that Lombardo did not rape her and that Kelly, who has a grudge against the counsellor, persuaded Suzie to join her in fabricating charges against him. Lombardo is triumphantly acquitted. Now I have long learnt to be wary of crime films which involve the sudden and unexpected acquittal of the defendant about halfway though, as this is generally a sign that a major plot twist is in the offing, the twist normally being that the supposedly innocent man is in reality as guilty as hell, if not of the crime of which he was accused then of some other felony. (There was a twist of this nature in Just Cause, another nineties thriller set in southern Florida). And so it proves here. Following his acquittal Lombardo brings a lawsuit seeking compensation and is awarded $8.5 million. The twist proves to be that he, Suzie and Kelly planned the entire incident in order to split the compensation money between them. That, however, is not the end of the story. Ray Duquette, the police officer who investigated the original rape allegations, becomes suspicious of Lombardo, and keeps him under observation. Moreover, this is not the end of the twists either. Most twist thrillers only have one main plot twist. Some, like Reindeer Games, have two. Wild Things has so many that I lost count. The whole of the second half of the movie amounted to little more than one twist after another. I haven't got space (or the inclination) to list them all here, although they all involve variants on the two most popular twists, namely-1. That a character believed to be dead is in fact alive, and 2. That a character believed to be a hero is in fact a villain. Denise Richards will never be my favourite actress; her performance in The World is Not Enough means that she must go down as one of the worst Bond girls of all times. Nevertheless, her looks and her combination of innocence and sensuality make her just right for the role of the wanton rich girl Kelly (even if, at 27, she was about a decade older than the character she was supposed to be playing). Neve Campbell was also convincing as the sluttish white-trash Suzie, but few of the other actors make much impression; the likes of Kevin Bacon, Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner are all capable of much better work than this. The real problem, however, is not with the acting but with the plot. The result of all the twists is a plot which has been twisted out of all recognition. The story, at least on a first viewing, is virtually incomprehensible, even with the assistance of a series of flashbacks intercut with the closing credits. Eventually the viewer may realise what is supposed to have happened, but this does not help much, as it means that the film simply becomes incredible rather than incomprehensible. One of the characters- I won't say which- has devised a scheme to dispose of all the others, a scheme of such baroque complexity that it bears no relation to the way in which any real human being, even the most fiendish criminal, would behave in real life. Films like this one serve little purpose other than to show off the supposed cleverness of the director and scriptwriters. Comparisons to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, a noted student of psychology, and to the best films noirs, which have a much more realistic view of human nature, seem to me to be very wide of the mark. Wild Things- I don't think I love you. 3\/10 (2\/10 for the story, with a bonus point for That Kiss).

The central character is Suzanne Vale, a drug-addicted actress who is the daughter of Doris Mann, a leading cinema actress of the 1950s and 1960s. It is based on a novel by Carrie Fisher, an actress who at one time suffered from drug addiction and is the daughter of Debbie Reynolds, a leading cinema actress of the 1950s and 1960s. Despite these similarities, Fisher has denied that her novel was autobiographical. (Some, including Minnelli herself, have also seen parallels with Liza Minnelli and Judy Garland).The main theme of the film is the relationship between mother and daughter. Suzanne's drug habits have been affecting her career and even after treatment in a rehab centre she is warned that the studio's insurance policy will cover her only if she lives with a responsible individual, such as her mother. Suzanne, however, finds it difficult to live with Doris, who is about as irresponsible an individual as they come, and has her own substance dependence problems, in her case with alcohol. Doris is loud, selfish and manipulative, never missing a chance to interfere in Suzanne's life. There is also a sub-plot about Suzanne's relationship with movie producer Jack Faulkner, who professes passionate love for her on their first date, which she believes until she discovers that he is also sleeping with one of her co-stars in her latest picture.I watched this film largely because it stars Meryl Streep, one of my favourite actresses, and she is the best thing about it, even if I would not rate her performance quite as highly as the one she gave in Silkwood, her earlier collaboration with Mike Nichols. (I have never seen Heartburn, another film on which they worked together). Meryl even manages to do something which I would have thought beyond the capabilities of a first-rate actress- to give a convincing impersonation of a second-rate one. It is clear from the scenes where she is shooting her movie that Suzanne Vale is not meant to be an actress in the Meryl Streep class. Streep even gets to sing, and shows us that at one time she had a far better voice than the one she displayed in last year's awful Mamma Mia!. I wondered what has happened to it over the last couple of decades.I also liked Shirley MacLaine as Doris, which is strange as I disliked her in Terms of Endearment, another film in which she played a domineering mother who interferes in her daughter's life. I think that the difference is that her performance as Aurora in Terms of Endearment was such an over-the-top caricature that it seemed quite out of place in that lugubrious tearjerker. Her performance in Postcards from the Edge is no less a caricature, but then the film is less serious and lighter in spirit than Terms of Endearment, and Doris is written as the sort of larger-than-life character who is such a drama queen, offstage as well as on, that her whole life almost becomes a deliberate self-caricature. It is the two women who are at the centre of the film, but there are also cameos from three major male stars, Dennis Quaid as Jack, Gene Hackman as a film director and Richard Dreyfuss as Suzanne's doctor, who also seems to be romantically interested in her.What I didn't like about the film was that it was, at times, too static and that it never finished what it seemed to be starting. It starts off as what seems to be a serious film about drug addiction, but this theme is never really developed. It then turns into a satire on the ways of Hollywood, but this theme is not developed either, and the film then becomes a study of a mother-daughter relationship, without approaching that subject too seriously. It has been described as a comedy, although I am not sure that is the right description if by comedy is meant a film primarily intended to make people laugh. (I doubt if many of the lines in Postcards from the Edge would have had audiences rolling in the aisles).

I thought it was such an interesting idea for a film plot, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) and Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meeting on a train and the Bruno character coming out with his idea of a perfect murder which has two people who want to murder someone in their life and getting away with it by swapping murders so there would be no obvious motive for that person closest to the victim.Robert Walker for me really stands out in this film and I can understand why he got so many good comments for his performance in this, he plays the role just right, not over the top which would have been the easier way of playing him. A few scenes that really stand out for me where you can't stop watching him is the scene where he follows Haines estranged wife around a fair, the way he stalks her, like a Lion waiting patiently for the moment to strike. It was very creepy and had me on edge, wondering when he was going to strike and if he would get away with it. The second scene is when he crashes a party that Haines is attending, while in conversation with a lady at the party about the perfect murder and how he would do it, places his hands around the lady's throat but when he see's Haines' future Sister-In-Law standing behind the lady, he is shaken to see her look like the woman he murdered and he nearly strangles the woman by accident. It is a very scary and shocking scene to watch. I had chills watching the way he looks at the girl while he has his hands around the woman's throat. He really deserved the recognition he got for this role and for me deserved an Oscar.Alfred Hitchcock is amazing at getting the timing right for the tension, he has this nack of knowing how long he should keep the tension and suspense up and with this, he really knew how to keep the audience's attention from when Haines' wife is murdered to the thrilling ending where the old man is underneath a carousel that is out of control with Haines and Bruno fighting. It is brilliant sequence and is well worth watching and I can't see Hollywood making a better version and let's hope they don't try.

This movie did not capture my attention at all, especially with the first scene being a whore and a client. I don't approve of any form of prostitution so the fact that Eastwood' s character and his cohorts were trying to get revenge for them only sickened me more. You know why this is a classic movie? Because out of the two cohorts, it's the African American one that dies. The only parts I found funny were when the blonde prostitute got her face cut up, and when her assailant gets shot. Scenes that were supposed to be funny but made me want to roll my eyes were when the writer pees his pants, the guy that gets shot while he's in the outhouse, and when Kid cries about his first kill. This film had absolutely no point and a very strange conclusion. There was almost no part of this movie that I actually liked. The fact the Munny comes off as this laid back peaceful kind of guy, while we all know he has a bad past, makes for a very predictable movie. Why else would Eastwood play this role if he didn't get to shoot people and fake an anti-hero? My neck hurt so bad after watching this movie because I couldn't stop shaking my head at the cheesy-ness of it. One question I have is, how do people find these kinds of movies even remotely interesting? The only way I kept from cutting my wrists while watching this movie was from the knowledge that it had an ending. To give the move some credit, the use of the terrain and natural lighting did make the movie easier to watch, other than that I found the acting and plot as a disappointment.

Firstly, the script is horribly corny and tedious. Everyone speaks as though they're one day out of acting school, over-emoting even the simplest, most minor of thoughts. I never felt anything genuinely warm or tender between the two stars. For a 3+ hour movie, there's ridiculously little time spent on character development. And the shallow clichéd narration of the old lady gets extremely tedious.Secondly, the effects do not hold up today, in 2011. You might say that's an unfair criticism, to hold a 14 year old movie up to modern technical standards. The effects, it turns out, are the only part I originally liked back in 1997. At that time I would have given the movie a 6 or 7 just for the visual spectacle. It now looks dated and awkward, and it's just not enough to justify any effort to watch it today. Finally, and most importantly, the story just falls down by not playing up the doubts and fears that many people had at the time of the ship's construction. There were experts in maritime engineering that forewarned of such a possible catastrophe, but neither the owners nor the public were concerned. The notion of being able to safely maneuver such a Leviathan was loudly challenged by nautical men, but the Great Ship is presented as an unquestionably positive, glorious achievement. The film conveys that it was entirely the fault of chance&#x97;an act of nature, a freak accident, a stray iceberg&#x97;that downed the ship, and not ignorance, pride, hubris. As it is I was waiting eagerly for it's inevitable demise, I almost felt everyone deserved it. James Cameron should have gone down with his tremendous, beautiful beast.And it certainly is beautiful. We are treated to near pornographic views of gleaming stacks, sumptuous accommodations, and throbbing mechanical drives. The best of society are so eager to participate in this obscene orgy of excess, but Mr. Cameron wants me to feel sympathetic with these self important gluttons. OK, so Leonardo and Kate are different, but still they are deluded. Their only crime, perhaps, is their youth, so yes, their story is a tragedy. Their standing on the bow of the mighty ship is an iconic image that's truly impressive, but there's no underlying sense of conscience to give it high contrast. It comes off as just a shallow, slick promotional ad for the cruise line. My point is that I feel it's so sad to see how seemingly convinced people were that technological marvels were proof of man's superiority and divine place on Earth. We now know that such absurdly over-sized endeavors truly only serve a very few at the great expense of very many. And it's happening today right now at an at even more frantic pace. We are doomed if we stay the course, but Titanic celebrates the choice to not reconsider our way. By intentionally creating such a tremendous sensation in our culture this movie, Mr. Cameron, and every one involved in some way took on a responsibility to reward our attention with something worthwhile and substantial. It does not. It purposely avoids any such responsibility or awareness. It is pure escapist fantasy of the highest order that defies it's viewers to question any of it's splendor. I find this insulting to be expected not to think for myself. That's just so depressing, and so tragic in ways which James Cameron is apparently oblivious. I feel that this film is just too much fluff and glitter, not worthy of it's efforts and costs. We are supposed to be smarter today about not living for such trivial wasteful excess.

For my money, it is Vertigo, the masterful story of a man who finds a woman, loses her, and attempts to bring her back with harrowing results.What makes this film so engaging, even after multiple viewings, is the way in which Hitchcock is able to bring us to sympathy with the protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, an ex-detective with some serious psychological issues. As Scottie begins to follow the wife of one of his college friends, he becomes fascinated by the icy, alluring blonde. We feel the same way. When something terrible happens to her, we feel the anguish and guilt Scottie does. Of course, none of this could be possible without the incredible performance of James Stewart, perhaps his best after the role of George Bailey. And Hitchcock makes the most of this evocative first half, told mostly in long shots and soft lighting.The second half is more of an attempt for Scottie to rebound and when he finds a girl similar to the mysterious blonde, he finds himself trying to recreate that which is gone. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this may be the strangest with themes of necrophilia, voyeurism, and sexual obsession. Matching Stewart's incredible performance every step of the way is Kim Novak, in my mind the best of Hitchcock's blonde actresses, so beautiful yet almost forbidding in a way.

For my money, it is Vertigo, the masterful story of a man who finds a woman, loses her, and attempts to bring her back with harrowing results.What makes this film so engaging, even after multiple viewings, is the way in which Hitchcock is able to bring us to sympathy with the protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, an ex-detective with some serious psychological issues. As Scottie begins to follow the wife of one of his college friends, he becomes fascinated by the icy, alluring blonde. We feel the same way. When something terrible happens to her, we feel the anguish and guilt Scottie does. Of course, none of this could be possible without the incredible performance of James Stewart, perhaps his best after the role of George Bailey. And Hitchcock makes the most of this evocative first half, told mostly in long shots and soft lighting.The second half is more of an attempt for Scottie to rebound and when he finds a girl similar to the mysterious blonde, he finds himself trying to recreate that which is gone. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this may be the strangest with themes of necrophilia, voyeurism, and sexual obsession. Matching Stewart's incredible performance every step of the way is Kim Novak, in my mind the best of Hitchcock's blonde actresses, so beautiful yet almost forbidding in a way.

His performance as Will Hunting - a genius who just doesn't fit into society and ends up as a janitor at MIT instead of a student - was fabulous, and made the movie worth watching. Unfortunately I personally didn't think there was much else fabulous about this. The story was modestly interesting, and the viewer certainly does want to know what eventually happens to Will. The ending was, strangely, both appropriately and unfortunately ambiguous, as Will leaves behind an opportunity to make it in order to pursue love. I say appropriately because the lack of resolution seemed to fit with the rest of his life, and unfortunately because it left me with no clear knowledge of what happened to him. The movie also raises valid questions about what it means to fit in. Will didn't, because he wasn't doing what everyone thought he should do with his life, but - on the other hand - maybe that was just Will. Do we have to fit into a preconceived notion of what we should be doing? Fair question.So, there was a lot of good stuff in the actual story. Now, I know this is a minority opinion, but I wasn't take with the rest of the cast Steven Skarsgard as the professor who discovers Will and tries to mold him, Ben Affleck as Will's best friend from South Boston (who co-wrote the movie with Damon), Minnie Driver as Skylar - Will's burgeoning love interest, and Robin Wiliams as the counsellor who helps Will confront some of his past demons. None of them were bad, but they also didn't really grab hold of me. Frankly, I also found the movie dragged dreadfully at times and at a little over two hours was a bit too long as a result. Damon's standout performance helps this get a 4\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Matt Damon was great.

As I explain in the summary that The Dark Knight is very dark and violent, you have not seen a true violent Batman movie until you watch this one. The story for the movie is pretty confusing, and from what I remember, the movie takes place after Batman's encounter with The Joker, until the Penguin is terrorising Gotham city. There is also another villain who is with Penguin, and Batman's girlfriend dies and becomes Catwoman. This can get confusing to remember all the villains after watching the movie as there are three different ones, all with their own story. I don't want to spoil much of the movie, but I must tell you there are some violent parts, especially the beginning which you will know all about if you watch the film. McDonalds made some toys for the movie to release in happy meals, but it was so violent that children will want to go see it and it would cause a bad influence on them. The movie has you glued to your seat, trying not to go get a drink or go to the toilet, because some of the action scenes are the best in any super hero movie. The Penguin could only be played by Danny Devito as he does an excellent job as him. The movie could have got 9 stars but it was let down at the end where it just got way to silly for me and overall stupid. Some fans say that it is not the original story of the Penguin so they don't like it, but it doesn't even matter as the movie is so damn good! Not as good as Batman 1989 or The Dark Knight, but give it a watch and maybe you will enjoy it.

What he stumbles on is not just any murder, but an ongoing killing spree of epic proportions.Anyone who is familiar with Tim Burton's work is going to wonder why he doesn't do more horror films. Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Sweeney Todd, and others have that dark vibe... even his Batman films were rather dark compared to other incarnations. How can this be his only true horror flick? It is done so well.And, of course, he wasn't alone... this is the product of skilled people across the board. It was written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Brainscan, Seven, 8MM) and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, two horror veterans that are never bad to have around.The cast? Ricci, Depp, Walken, Lee, Jeff Jones... each one could get a paragraph of praise. I don't know that this is the best work of either Ricci or Depp, but even their less than best work is better and more entertaining than most others in the acting profession today. And together? A dream come true, if you're a Ricci fan -- Depp already knows how to interact with Burton, so that's a given.The film itself is great in the art department, lighting, cinematography... more or less in every way. It's a very polished, very artsy film. What you may not notice is the use of forced perspective, which I think they hid very well. Most of the outdoor shots were actually shot on set, so if you pay close attention you'll notice that you can never see too far back or too far in the sky... and camera angles were chosen to skew distances. It's a clever tactic and works.The film's audio commentary with Tim Burton is slightly disappointing, and not nearly as good as the film itself. He talks about the difficulty in finding cardinals, and jokes about Dutch masters, but doesn't offer as much insight as you may expect from a director. Many commentaries have a steady discussion going, but Burton seems comfortable to stay silent often and just watch his own film. If this film ever gets deluxe treatment, hopefully a second commentary is added because Burton -- as soothing as his voice is -- can't do it alone.

Of course, one can never follow a novel completely since what can be conveyed to the minutest detail in a 600 page novel definitely cannot be packed in a two hour movie. But still, when you do not miss out the essential aspects of the movie, only then can you satisfy those who have read the novel. Coma is one of the fine examples of how a movie can be made out of a good novel.Coma is based on the novel of the same name by Robin Cook. Robin Cook, being a man of medicine himself is able to present to us with great amount of realism as to how the profession of medicine can be used for commercial selfish gains. Most of his novels are set in a premise where the men of medicine are misusing their powers in order to gain wealth. The story of Coma is about a hospital where something suspicious is going on, as discovered by our lead character &#x96; Dr. Susan Wheeler.The movie then shows how her suspicions prove to be right but she gradually discovers the complexity of the plot and is then faced with a dilemma as to who can be trusted and who cannot be trusted. The best part of the movie, as is the best part of the novel is that it works in a smooth flow and makes us believe that what is being depicted is a surreal possibility and who knows &#x96; somewhere in world, it just might be the truth.For a movie that is made in 1976, the direction, screening and scripting is simply beautiful. It keeps us on the edge of our seats and gives our gray cells plenty of exercise as they try and anticipate as to what is going to happen next. The whole cast does a wonderful job in creating a movie that will for me remain one of the most defining movies in the genre best described as medical thrillers'.

It offers goofy fun, and a satisfactory form of closure to the series.We pick up from where we left off in Evil Dead II. Ash has been transported back to Medieval Europe. In the course of eighty quirky minutes he goes from being one of King Arthur's chained slaves to the leader of his army. According to the prophecy of the book of the dead, he is destined to save mankind from the army of darkness.

Many people feel that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is just a meat head and is incapable of making a truly authentic cinema masterpiece. This film proves exactly the opposite.This film set the standards for swords and sorcery films. The combination of directing, script, and acting are what set this apart from other films of the same genre. John Milius was clearly the right person to direct this film. Arnold's performance is also exceptional and his acting in this film is among the top performances he has had. The rest of cast is exceptional as well and met the necessary standards for a film of this caliber. What makes this film so unique and great is that most of the actors are novices with exception to James Earl Jones, Rob Cobb, Mako, and Max Von Sydow. Although the experienced actors have limited rolls, they play important rolls and their performances help support the overall feel to the film. I like this movie because the main actors were all new and worked very hard to create an extremely distinct and true film.For the era and time that this film was produced, the effects that the film had were outstanding. Although there was no CGI at this time, the production crew did a great job creating the giant snake and the transformation sequences with James Earl Jones. I think what made this film so unique was how it was done. I liked the fact that their was very little dialogue from the actors themselves and that the audience was mostly addressed through the voice-over of Mako. This gave the movie a feel that it was a grand story being told to the audience and that we were in essence being read an adult bedtime story.It is extremely difficult to explain how great this film is on such a limiting platform, but I think that once this film is watched, it can then be understood how incredible it truly is.
