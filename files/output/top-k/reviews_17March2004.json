In comparison to some of his films such as Smokey And The Bandit II, Cannonball Run, and Stroker Ace for example, The Longest Yard is not only a gem, it's the Hope Diamond. Reynolds plays down on his luck, ex-NFL quarterback Paul Crewe.  Seems he was kicked out of football for shaving points in the game, and is now relegated to servicing his rich girl friend.  One afternoon, when the girlfriend makes the mistake of interrupting his football viewing, Crewe steals her Maserati and drives it into the nearby bay.  After a quick car chase and a funny scene when Crewe is arrested in a bar, he is sent off to prison.  As it turns out it is just not any ordinary prison.  It seems Warden Hazen (Eddie Albert)hires the guards on their ability to play football.  It also seems Hazen has arranged for Crewe to be sent to his particular prison so that Crewe can organize a football team of the inmates, quarterback them, and play a game against the guards.  A totally preposterous plot it is, but that's part of what makes this film so enjoyable. The Longest Yard works so well is not because the acting is Academy Award stuff, it's because Producer Albert Ruddy and Director Robert Aldrich seemed to have found the perfect cast for the roles they inhabit.  Having played football in college, Reynolds fits the role of quarterback Crewe perfectly.  Eddie Albert as sleazy Warden Hazen, will make you forget about that thing he did called Green Acres.  James Hampton, who has floundered around in Hollywood as a character actor, has his best role ever as Caretaker.  Crewe makes Caretaker his manager because it seems he has a knack for obtaining certain contraband that would otherwise be out of Crewe's clutches.  Some of the items he acquires are not only funny, but there's also a certain service Crewe has to perform to get some of them.  I'll not tell you what it is but leave it to you to see the film.  Michael Conrad, who plays aging ex-football player Nate Scarboro, also joins in the fun when he agrees to help coach Crewe's team on the slim chance that the inmates might pull an upset.  Let's just say some of his coaching ideas are unique, as our many of the coaching ideas in this film.  That's OK because it only serves to add to the fun.Harry Caesar as Granville, the first black player to join the team, shows there are more than enough reasons for him to play football.  It takes Granville being humiliated by the guards trying to discourage him from playing before the other black inmates join in the fun.  In the scene where the guards are demeaning him, he doesn't get rattled, yet we can sense his rage beneath the surface.  There's also Pop(John Steadman)who has been lingering in prison for a few extra years because he once punched a certain guard who became a Warden.  He becomes the team's trainer, and has one brief but memorable moment with Crewe during the football game.What most people remember about The Longest Yard is the big game, but everything leading up to it is just as enjoyable.  There is the favor that Crewe has to do for the Warden's secretary (Bernadette Peters with the strangest hair do I've ever seen).  The scenes where Crewe is recruiting the inmates are classic, especially when he interviews a couple of inmates named Samson(Richard Kiel), Shokner (Robert Tessier) and Indian (Sonny Sixkiller).  When the team begins practicing, how they go from being really really bad to fairly decent is as entertaining as the rest of the film.As for the football game itself, it is undoubtedly one of the most hilarious sporting events of any kind to be put on the big screen.  Aldrich takes each moment of the game and makes it count.  If you have never seen the film, it'll have you rolling on the floor.  If you have seen it as I have many times, just thinking about it will bring a smile of recollection to your face.  You'll see things in this game you'll never get the chance to witness on Monday night football.If there are any missteps in this film, they are minor.  One is a detestable slimy inmate named Unger (Charles Tyner) is introduced into the story when it is not necessary. He is here only as a plot device to do two things, the first is to carry out a despicable act, and the second is because of Unger, Crewe is forced into a bad decision late in the film.  It would have been easily to find a way to do this without introducing Unger into an otherwise enjoyable film.  Despite that, there is no doubt that you'll enjoy The Longest Yard, even if you don't like football.  Aldrich, Ruddy, and Reynolds have scored a touchdown and a two point conversion.

That's no reason to give it ill-repute.The film itself is a little dodgy in parts and could have used some better acting from some of its stars. Sean Patrick Flanery does an amazing job as Jeremy Reed, and I believe he was well-suited for the part.I didn't like Lance Henriksen's acting at all. I thought that the way he portrayed the character was a little too repetitive and boring. But then again, I don't care for him as an actor anyway. I think he's crotchety, annoying, and outdated; and the characters he chooses to play reminds me of the acclaim that Robert Redford always gets - undeserved.The film is about a young man who suffers a birth defect after his pregnant mother is struck by lightning and killed. OK, I can understand some of this. He is raised by grandparents who soon begin to fear him and show him no emotion - not unlike his father. When his last grandparent dies he is left alone for a short period of time before he is discovered by the police. Our main character is highly intelligent, scared, telekinetic, and has an electric personality, not to mention he's an albino, too.A social worker, Jessica, played by Mary Steenburgen is called to take over the boy's case and he is placed in a group living situation in a home. He is placed with delinquents and abandoned children who have no respect for him. I love Steenburgen and think she always does a good part in any film she is in. She's a fine actress, and though she may not be classed as dazzlingly beautiful, her charms show through no matter what character she plays. She's heart-warming, endearing, and always brings a good sense of love to a film.Those who say that Salva's sexual undertones are present in the film can be dismissed right away. I knew nothing of Salva's past when I watched this film for the first time, and I noticed nothing out of the ordinary. Goldblum's character, who is a science teacher and befriends the boy, does a good job of interacting with him. He's not molesting him or harming him by holding his hand and giving him a long-needed hug. If you're assuming this shows sexual predators at work, I think you need to see the therapist, not Salva.Also, the scene in which he is looking at another boy who is in the locker room is not about lust. He is longing to be able to do normal things that others do without being ridiculed. If you'll remember, it's the very next scene where they tell him he's a freak who is as bald as a baby. He just wants to fit in, and it is at this point that I believe he realizes he doesn't.Overall, this film does bring a sense of wonder to the viewer. If you sit back and take it all in, Salva is showing us what might happen if we all stop judging one another and start accepting human beings for their uniqueness. He's not trying to make you accept him for being a child predator. He's showing the world that people are ALL different, and if we spent a little less time being so blocked and full of hate, we might come to realize this and appreciate the aesthetic value of the human soul.I gave this film a 7 out of 10 because I didn't like Lance Henriksen's performance at all, I thought some of the characters could have come through in the end (Why didn't his love interest stand up for herself against her father? Why were there loose strings here?), and I would have liked to have seen more after the fact wrap-ups when Jeremy becomes raw energy in the film's climax. Also, why in God's name does Powder have eyelashes if he is unable to grow hair? Huh? What?

I wish more   Altman films were this slick visually many interesting visual things   happening, reflections upon reflections, beautiful compositions. Plus,   the film stock this was shot on looks more expensive than the one   Altman usually uses. Makes this look more like a movie, and his other   movies (aside from Gosford Park perhaps, which is also   self-referential) look more like we're spying on actual happenings,   from the graininess of the footage resembling home video almost. I must   say The Long Goodbye has an admirably smart look about it due to this   better film stock.    Elliot Gould's performance of Marlowe as a man sort of drifing through   this movie, like the naked hippies next door to him, fits well with   Altman's depiction and send-up of contemporary (1973) LA.    Funny motifs run throughout the security guard who does impressions of   Hollywood celebrities (Jimmy Stewart is probably his best) is lots of   fun, and also Marlowe's temporamental cat provides amusement. Like with   Dr T and the Women and MASH, however, the jokes in Altman comedies   are not really intended just for empty amusment - so you don't   necessarily laugh out loud. More often than not, though there is humour   for humour's sake, the jokes are vicious, slap in the face-style,   attacks at certain social constructs (or often just presentations of   certain social biases, like treatment of blacks and women in MASH).    Curios    Arnold Schwarzenegger before he was famous, playing the next step up   from an extra, owing to his muscle man frame exposed in the scene where   Augustine has his thugs and Marlowe strip so they'll be honest. He   looks ridiculous with those breasts of his.    Screenplay by THE Leigh Brackett, screenwriter of classic Bogart flick   The Big Sleep (1946), based on another of Raymond Chandler's Marlowe   novels.  Obviously a lot of   Chandler's overly complex plot had to be summarised, but i think   Brackett (in an Altman movie most of the dialogue has been reworked by   improvisation and rehearsal by the time it gets to the screen, but it   was certainly Brackett who gave the overall structure of how it would   be adapted and how much of the book could be told in the movie) did a   good job with the hard task she was given - the plot of Chandler's   novel is more convoluted than The Big Sleep, if that's any indication!    Bottom line what a great soundtrack! One of Altman's best movies, and   one of his best shot. If you're not a fan of his ensemble movies (how   could you not be, but still) here's one of his narrower, smaller cast   movies that works really well.

Bottom line what a great soundtrack! One of Altman's best movies, and   one of his best shot.

I wish more   Altman films were this slick visually many interesting visual things   happening, reflections upon reflections, beautiful compositions. Plus,   the film stock this was shot on looks more expensive than the one   Altman usually uses. Makes this look more like a movie, and his other   movies (aside from Gosford Park perhaps, which is also   self-referential) look more like we're spying on actual happenings,   from the graininess of the footage resembling home video almost. I must   say The Long Goodbye has an admirably smart look about it due to this   better film stock.

It was the best thing it had going for it when it was released in special theaters with sound equipment designed to vibrate your fanny as it sat snugly in those theater seats.   Unfortunately, without the vibrations, Earthquake just ain't as much fun.As disaster films go, Earthquake is certainly not the worst, but is far from the best.  Charlton Heston, fresh from having saved a 747 from certain disaster in Airport 1975, now does his best to save the city of Los Angeles. To be fair though, we knew he wasn't going to stop the earthquake, leaving that for Christopher Reeve in Superman some years later.  But we just knew that as Construction Engineer, Stewart Graff he'd do his best to save a lot of L.A. citizens stuck in precarious situations.  Why else would he be here? And just for fun, he even brought George Kennedy over from Airport 1975 with him although he's a cop named Lew Slade now instead of tinkering around with jetliners.  What a treat!It seems that Lew Slade was chasing a bad guy who had been drunk driving and run down a kid.  Unfortunately the bad guy crashes his vehicle right on the property of Zsa Zsa Gabor, which is out of Slade's jurisdiction.  When another officer who is in the proper jurisdiction berates Slade for messing up Miss Gabor's shrubbery, Slade let's the young officer know how much he cares about plant life by landing a right cross.  This lands him a suspension, and supposedly helps us get to know his character a little better while we pat our foot waiting for the big rumble to start. Did you really think they were going to open a disaster film with the actual disaster?  There's a code in the screenwriter's handbook that says that's not allowed.  At least that's what I'm told.Meanwhile somewhere else in L.A., Stuart Graff is married to Remy Royce-Graff(Ava Gardner) who was fathered by Sam Royce(Lorne Greene) when he was seven I think.  Sam is also Stuart's Boss.  Stuart is having an affair with Denise Marshall(Genevieve Bujold) who happens to be the widow of a former co-worker of Stuart.  We are not told whether Stuart had anything to do with the death of Denise's husband so he could put the moves on her but they could have added that to the plot too.  Generally in these types of films they throw everything in but the kitchen sink anyway so why not?Then on the other side of town we have motorcycle daredevil Miles Quade(Richard Roundtree) along with partner Sal Amici(Gabriel Dell) getting ready to put on the show of his life.  His sister is Rosa Amici(Victoria Principal, before Dallas)who has about the funkiest curly hairdo I think I've ever seen on film.  Think Shirley Temple with coal black hair.  Then there's supermarket manager, weekend warrior, Jody(Marjoe Gortner)who happens to be a fanatic about women with curly coal black naturally curly hair as you'll soon discover.  Now all this might sound interesting on paper, and might make a good soap-opera. In this film it's all useless information since this is a film about an earthquake and after it hits we could care less about what happens up to that point.  Think of it as the filler before the thriller.Even without the oscillating seats, the earthquake itself is still fun to watch.  We get skyscrapers crashing to the ground, buildings falling on people, shards of glass piercing the good citizen's skins, people scalded by stoves, houses explode, freeways cave in, Stuart, Remy, and Sam get trapped in a high rise, a bar comes crashing down around Lew, Miles big motorcycle stunt comes crashing down, Rosa loses her popcorn in a movie theater, Denise's son takes a dive on his bike, and good boy Jody gets to put his uniform on and show us just how psychotic and messed up he really is. This is cool stuff folks even for 1974 type special effects.  Unfortunately, the Earthquake momentarily subsides and we are left to deal with some of the silly plotting the film started out with.  Guess you can't have everything.If you can overlook the usual silliness and terrible dialog which seems to go with the territory in disaster films, you might be entertained by some close calls and daring rescues after the earthquake.  You'll certainly get a few laughs out of Marjoe Gortner's cracked-up soldier performance.  George Kennedy is pretty darn good as the cop.  Heston is better than he was in that Airport thingy, and though his romance with Bujold is an obvious mismatch, it doesn't come near to equaling the absurdity of his relationship with Karen Black on that 747.  Ava Gardner plays the bitchy Remy as if she were competing for the Shrew Olympics.  Lorne Greene looks as if he wishes he was back on the Ponderosa with Hoss, Adam and Little Joe.  Richard Roundtree is fun as the daredevil, but we see little of him after the earthquake.  Tiger Williams as Denise's son Corry spends most of the film unconscious and we are grateful for that.  Usually the kids in disaster films are scripted to be overly cute and annoying.  I think there's a rule in the screenwriter's disaster film handbook about that too.If I have one suggestion to make it would be avoid the version of this film with the added TV footage at all costs.  For those of you familiar with Welcome Back Kotter, if you see any footage of  Rosalie 'Hotzie' Totzie(Debralee Scott)riding an airplane, change the channel, remove the tape, just do what you have to do.

Well it is more that that.  It pokes fun at the cold war, and totally makes fun of nuclear war in general.  Everything gets turned around in this zany black comedy, and the whole world comes to an end.  Though it is all a joke, you should take some time to see it.The story begins in 1963 when the cold war is heating up between the Americans and the Soviets.  In this movie, the Soviets were working on trying to create the ultimate nuclear weapon, a Doomsday Device.  The Americans decide not to worry about this, except for General Jack D.Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who has ordered his men to bomb the Soviet Union using nuclear bombs.  President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is holding a meeting in the War Room (which is supposedly in the Pentagon) trying to figure out what to do about the planes that were called out to attack Russia.  Just then, the Russian Ambassador shows up in the movie to talk with the President about nuclear war.  The Ambassador gets the President on the phone to Russia to speak with their leader about what has gone wrong.

He really shows off to the viewers how much he wants to bomb the Russians, and how obsessed he is with bodily fluids.The reviewer rates this movie 5 out of 5 gold stars.

This came after Josie Wales and before the bloated Dances With Wolves and the horrible Unforgiven. There are only two really great westerns in the last two decades. The Grey Fox(Richard Farnsworth) & this Pale Rider. In this Clint is 'Preacher'. Preacher is basically a rehashing of 'Man With No Name' from the Sergio Leone trilogy of the sixties 'For A Few Dollars More', 'A Fistful of Dollars' & the best of the three 'The Good The Bad & The Ugly'. Preacher is also an older more slowed down but mature version of MwNN. Also with Clint here is Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgrass, the beautiful young Sydney Penny as Snodgrasse's daughter Megan, a young Chris Penn and a host of fine character actors who support Clint as good guys and bad guys. Pale Rider verges on the Supernatural for Preacher appears to be a man who was killed in a shootout some time before. Only indication to the audience is when Clint removes his shirt and five or six plugged up bullet holes cover his back. Preacher had been seemingly shot & killed by Stockburn, a villainous killer Sheriff for hire, who has now been hired by the town boss to run out the gold mining locals. Snodgrasses character should've known how 'ghostly' Preacher was as they sort of seduced each other towards the end of the movie. Preacher's ghostly existence is never cleared up so we are left wondering. This is smart and might've been how Clint wanted the audience to view Preacher. Did I smell a sequel. But overall a beautifully shot on location film. And Sydney Penny(Megan), she's just beautiful.

That's the point.  The film makes fun of the various stereotypes, both black and white, that exist now and then.  The film starts out with both Undercover Brother, a modern day blaxploitation hero, teams up with the B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., a secret agency seeking to promote black equality, to defeat the Man.  The Man being the figure for the supposed white establishment that governs U.S. society.  The Man is using a mind-controlled Black retired 4 Star General to introduce a mind controlling drug to the Black community via his chain of General's Fried Chicken (GFC) restaurants.

The final confrontation takes place at the Man's secret Island.  The end of the film is good and promotes racial harmony as members of both races realize the benefit of working together.I love Conspiracy Brother played Dave Chappelle.  Chappelle hasn't been so funny since his role as Reggie in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (96).  The music is great (I also bought the soundtrack) and anyone who grew up in the 70's will be taken back to their youth.  You know the time when music was original and hadn't been sampled and rapped over multiple times and then passed off as new and original.  The one remake is Snoop Dogg's Undercova Funk but it's hardly a remake as his Uncle, the original performer, Bootsy Collins remakes it with him.  I hope they make an Undercover Brother 2 but don't see how it could be funnier than the original. Until then I think I'll sit down with my Nappy meal and rewatch UNDERCOVER BROTHER again.

I'd have liked the movie to be less mean and maybe stay focused on the theme of commitment and weddings instead of ultimately disintegrating into just another battling couple movie.

Perhaps it's because Hitchcock, `The Master of Suspense' did such a good job with his movies that people weren't interested in seeing them directed by other people so the art died out with the end of Hitchcock's career, or maybe suspense films just aren't as interesting to today's viewers as fast-action films with amazing special effects.  Whatever the case may be, `Rear Window' is a very good classic suspense movie.  Filmed in color, it's also easier to watch than most classics, to those with spoiled movie tastes.  Hitchcock utilizes symbolism in this movie to give an intellectual twist for those who get excited by such things.        \tFor example, some of his characters seem to be placed in certain apartment levels and styles to display their personalities.  On the floor level Miss Lonelyheart, as she is nicknamed, is living her sad life.  She seems depressed and even at one point suicidal, generally if someone has reach this position in their life, they would be considered to have hit `rock bottom'; hence, she is on the bottom level.  The piano man to the right of the main wall of apartments has a place with a lot of windows on the wall facing the central courtyard his apartment seems very open, like it hides nothing.  In the same way, the piano man is not afraid to show his emotion; he is a very expressive man and doesn't hide what he's feeling.  When he gets frustrated or upset with his music writing he gets very dramatic and sweeps the papers off his piano and almost seems to throw a tantrum.  When he has his party, he is a very happy and ecstatic person, the life of the party even.  There are many more little connections to the people and their apartments but it's a part of the viewing experience to figure them out!       \tHitchcock also does an amazing job with his camera tricks; only once does the camera view change in reference to its position.  99.99% of the time the shots are done from inside the main character's apartment, it's a great concept because it helps the viewer to feel like they are just as involved in the investigation as the other characters in the story.  The viewer sees what they see exactly and can make their own silent inferences as to what's going on.  Yet it doesn't get old having the same view standpoint because there are interesting plot developments all the time.       \tOverall Rear Window is a very interesting movie and a must see for those who like suspense without all the gore that is found in today's Hollywood thrillers.

I don't consider the plot to be anything fantastic, and really it's so silly that it's ridiculous.  As a standalone film, I wouldn't be too impressed with it.  Were it the only Nightmare sequel, I probably wouldn't like it.  The fact that it comes after five crappy sequels . . . well, that's part of the film's charm.All things being relative after some of the sheer stupidity of some previous Elm Street concepts, Wes Craven's New Nightmare has a pretty awesome plot, and I admire how Wes Craven recognizes the poor quality of the previous films and dismisses their relevance.  The craft of the film, however, is undeniable, and that stands very well on its own and towers above the previous efforts to make an Elm Street sequel.  In terms of style, it's quite obvious Freddy's creator is back with a vengeance.What I love most about this movie?  The lack of an on-screen Freddy Krueger and the lack of exploration regarding Freddy's character.  Most of the time is given to the characters we're supposed to give a damn about and for the first time since Elm Street 1 we can actually give a damn about someone besides Freddy Krueger.Craven creatively finds other ways to imply Krueger's presence and influence - through pictures, paintings, merchandise, clawmarks, and seeing glimpses of him on the TV in exerts from the first Elm Street film (my personal favorite).  We know this is a Nightmare film, and Wes knows we don't need to be reminded every 30 seconds by seeing Krueger in full makeup killing. Less is more, and here it pays off as Craven builds up the anticipation of seeing the gloved demon finally unveil himself.And since Elm Streets 2 - 6 effectively ruined any and all intimidation Krueger might have had by toning him down and explaining to death every conceivable question one could ask, Wes scraps that backstory and starts anew.  Then he delivers it himself in a very brief bit of dialogue midway through the film.  From then on, we hear no more of the backstory.  Once again, less is more.  We really didn't need to know who was Freddy's daddy.The re-invention of who\/what Freddy Krueger gives Wes the chance to introduce us to Freddy all over again and recreate that original feel that the first nightmare film had.  Now we, along with the cast, are meeting the *real* Freddy Krueger.  With previous Elm Street films, we already knew who Freddy was and typically so did the characters--say goodbye to intrigue, and hello to formulas\/gimmicks.And the return of Heather Langenkamp is a welcomed one.  Finally a heroine capable of stealing the spotlight away from the villain.  This is attributed to the fact that Nancy was perhaps the most developed character of all the Elm Street films, and though Langenkamp plays herself (and not Nancy), Wes masterfully introduces parallels so we could build on our familiarity with seeing her in two previous films.  The jump from Nancy to Heather is so much easier to swallow than a complete cast changeover.  Not to mention there's something special about seeing Langenkamp go head to head with Krueger once again, something funny about seeing her hold a casual chat with Robert Englund sans makeup, something honest about her in California talking to Bob Shaye and Wes Craven at New Line Cinema . . . something human about how Wes Craven has handled the story telling and character development of this film.As much as I like New Nightmare, the film is far from perfect.  When Freddy is first unleashed at the hospital, he lives up to the expectation and I found it well worth the wait; he kills mercilessly, coldly toys and taunts with his the story's heroes and all the while appears to hold all the cards leaving the good guys essentially powerless.  However, the final confrontation left much to be desired.  It appeared like missed opportunity after missed opportunity for Krueger to make the kill, he didn't appear to be in a place to taunt, too many times I wanted to say, `Why didn't he just kill her there?  Why try to swallow the kid when he could have slashed him already?' as a result, it lacked intensity.  Heck, it even showcased a hint of the hideous Freddy's Dead misplaced humor.And it didn't set well with me when the nurses administered a shot to Dylan against Heather's wishes.  It would take either an extreme circumstance or a seriously demented RN to administer treatment after a patient refused.  I wasn't convinced that these circumstances were worth the risk of a malpractice suit and possible ruined career(s).And there's a few dozen other minute gripes such as Freddy's new makeup that just didn't sit well with me, but it's not really worth it going into too much detail there.  The pros outweighed the cons for me.  Through all its faults, I find Wes Craven's New Nightmare arguably the best Nightmare film simply for its genius way of handling what it was dealt.

It is a refreshing break from the family movies of today that mostly concentrate on stories in that upperclass Reiner-esque suburbanite setting of husband and wife and two and a half obnoxious kids. Instead, The Sandlot falls into a line of memorable adventures like 'House Arrest' and 'The Wizard.'Flashback to the 1960s. Scotty Smalls, newcomer to the neighborhood, narrates (in a Wonder Years way) the hilarious adventure of how he got he and his baseball playing buddies into the biggest pickle ever. Smalls is the shy brainy kid who makes friends with a bunch of baseball fanatics. While learning the sport of baseball, he learns of an exaggerated legend of something called 'The Beast,' otherwise known as Old Mr. Myrtle's junkyard dog, which is chained up in the fence just behind the ballpark. The kids like to play baseball. And the Beast likes to eat them. Not to give too much away, but, the pickle that Scotty gets his friends into, involves a pretty valuable baseball, one slobbering beast, and kids who try to do anything they can to save their buddy from being grounded for an eternity. The mess they get into and the junk they try to get themselves out is simply hilarious. That, and the subplots of a clever move on a lifeguard and the determination to show up some very obnoxious rival baseball players.It's a funny, fantastic film that most kids will likely enjoy--the boys for baseball and the girls for those noteable teen stars like Mike Vitar, Tom Guiry, Chauncey Leopardi, and Will Horneff. It's loaded with laughs and good time adolescents, despite Tom Guiry hamming it up only slightly. Plus, it's got a good theme about friendship and drive and determination to do what you want to do. I highly recommend it, if for nothing else, then the part where Squints tells the story about the history of the beast.I can see from the message boards as well as other viewer's comments that it still has a rather memorable following, despite it's age. Definitely a must see! ","genre":null},{"date":"17 March 2004","score":"44 out of 48 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Sandlot is one of the greatest kids movies ever.

It didnt get off to a good start with the cheap looking crayon introduction.It didn't seem like the future. It's supposed to be the year 10000 or something yet all the head honchos are all called Dukes, Barons or Emporers. Even in 1984 those terms had lost importance. It seemed more like some Bible epic at times especially given the strange music score.Many commented upon how they loved the design. I found it ugly and wierd (why is everything gold\/orange?). The effects were ugly and wierd too.Overall it just seems really, really dated.

Indeed a very unique setting that just awaits an exquisite horror film! One thing you have to hand to Barker.like none other author, he has the talent to portray nightmarish worlds and macabre surroundings. The three major chapters in his career as a filmmaker all are tales of pure darkness. And - unlike Nightbreed - Lord of illusions can depend on a solid script and original story aspects. Clive combines the mysteries of magic with the dangers of a satanic cult in order to create one of the most frightening horror villains ever. Nix - a diabolical personification of evil who has complete control over elements like fire, gravity and even the human will and soul! Daniel Von Bargen (one of the most underrated actors alive) plays Nix amazingly and the hairs in the back of your neck will stand up as he says, `I was born.to murder the world' in his most vicious tone of voice. Scott Bakula is the private detective, hired by the ravishing Famke Janssen, to keep an eye on her husband who once buried Nix but now fears his resurrection from the grave. All in one, Lord of Illusion is a successful mixture of horror and detective, with gruesome make-up effects and more than enough tension to keep you focused. Barker controls the supernatural elements real well and he also injects multiple personal interests of his in his film. Like his disturbing obsession with masochism, for example, and the constant undertones of homosexuality and sexual perversion. The wholesome is served with a constant atmosphere of morbidity and very little humor. Therefore, Lord of Illusions is a very mature horror film that'll certainly frighten (or even shock) inexperienced viewers. Possible negative aspects about Lord of Illusions are the overall predictable twists the grotesque finale.

It's the one movie that i've watched time and time again since it was first released on dvd, and have found it to be interesting each time I see it. Truthfully my all time favorite scene has to be Jim and Nadia in his bedroom, and her making him strip for the unbeknowest to her camera. This is the one film that can now be landmarked as an american treasure right along with the classic Animal House. Of course the two are totally different films, but good old natured fun in both aspects. Another thing I loved about AP was the ensemble casting. It's like looking at my own circle of friends that I went to high school with. That's another reason for my liking this film so much, just for the pure reflection of it all, and the overall genius in the humor.
