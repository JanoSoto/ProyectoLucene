After realizing that he did mission impossible, that made me like him more. so I sat back and watched Phantom of the Paradise and was shocked at what i saw.Every director has to start somewhere, and although this wasn't his first movie it was clearly just a flick to get recognized. it follows the traditional Phantom story line of a man who gets his music stolen. And so this man sets out to destroy the copies that are made. but the man is burned and he hides away for a year or two and resurfaces to take revenge.there's a twist to this Phantom story though. The disfigured Phantom finds a way to co-op. with the jerk theif and the two form a contract. This contract has their souls taken by the devil and things go downhill from here. the twist is unexpected and definately puts a new spin on the Phantom tradition. if you are a big fan of the 80's then you'd like this film, with all the songs, fashions and actors trying to act. not bad, not great.

AFO was stupid, but the writers still knew what made the DHS work and what turned it into junk.  Enter Under Siege, less of Die Hard and more with Commando. The DHS involves communication, villainy, subtexts, and fireballs.  While Under Siege has the correct DHS pacing unlike The Rock and Speed (DHS movies don't start with action scenes, they start with the story), the villainy is PC and the subtexts are gone.  Tommy Lee Jones never struck me as an impressive actor, even in The Fugitive he is as blank as ever.  Steven Seagal competes with him in this movie not only for control of a relatively fake-looking battleship, but also for who can make the most deadpan delivery with bad one-liners.  Bruce Willis had a rough and cut style while Seagal tries to be cool.Andrew Davis certainly gets credit from me for being semi-diverse.  This is his action movie and nothing more.  While here the story and characters are paper-thin, much like Collateral Damage, it's funny how he goes to a plot overdose with Holes.  Perhaps he should make more family movies.  Too bad his style here is loaded with Richard Donner-isms reminiscent of TV and not the film world.Now let's get to where Under Siege subverts the DHS.  Under Siege tries one-upping its predecessors by throwing in Miss July '89.  Other than appealing to the almighty dollar, there is no plot reason for this.  Suddenly we are in a Dirty Harry\/Lethal Weapon world where Seagal is stuck with a complaining attachment throughout.  Also, the hero is able to converse with his superiors, but contact with the villain is saved for the typical final encounter.  No points there.  For the record, The Rock's ending imitates the intentions of this one, the purpose all along of destroy the Area of Operations in some grand scheme to save lives.  Heroism has never been so lame.  Overall, if you want to learn...watch Die Hard.  If you want to be entertained...watch Die Hard.  If you're looking for phenomenal leaps of protocol unseen since WarGames, watch this.

Highlander is extremely criticized due to the fact that Highlander II The Quickening came before it. I look at it this way, Highlander II is like Halloween III it has nothing to do with the rest of the series the only exception is that it does involve Conner Macleod, unlike Halloween III which doesn't involve Michael Myers at all. I did not see the theatrical version of Highlander The Final Dimension, I just recently came across a copy of the R rated Directors Cut of this film. This cut of this film is excellent and it is a nice sequal to the original Highlander if you forget about Highlander II.I think I can understand why this film was criticized, the theatrical version was probably released half assed with the scenes all cut up. The Directors Cut is pure and complete.I'd like to comment on the love scene in this film between Conner and the female lead, it is almost on a pornographic level and it is no wonder that they wouldn't allow that to get into theatre's. It is greatly welcomed in this release though.Mako does an excellent Job as Macleod's new trainer at the beginning of the film, he knows he is going to die and on at least three occasions gives Conner the opportunity to take his head, he idiotically refuses and his trainers powers fall into the hands of evil an evil that would hunt MaCloud many centuries later. Those that say that this is a remake of the original are greatly mistaken and should rent the directors cut of this film and watch this one again.MaCloud did win the prize in the original film, it just so happens that when the sorcerer is resurrected the game begins again,Macloud is actually defending the prize he already won, he gets an even greater prize when he kills the Sorcerer, he recieves the powers and knowledge of his trainer and his power of illusion, besides the overall prize.Many have asked about Highlander Endgame, this film only works if you think of it as many years later, this film also is based on the television series too, we have both Conner and Duncan in this one. IF you see the pilot of that show Conner is there, we learned that he trained Duncan after finding him almost dead after a battle. This film pretty much wraps up that series and it tries to finish off the film series as well, it is confusing but you can make sense out of it if you try. The Villian in that film tops them all as he doesn't care about the rules, in fact he breaks every one including the Holy Ground rule.If anyone else can figure out the link between Highlander I, III, the series and Endgame, feel free to write another commentary with updated information and your own thoughts of what if.Highlander The Final Dimension is under-rated and the Directors Cut of this film should be viewed for best performance.There can be only one, yes in the end there can be only one, we do not know when the end will be, it could be the end of time for all we know, immortals are always being born throughout the centuries and years, we don't know who they are or where they are, at the time end of time one man shall stand alone, at that point there can be only one, but it will be almost an eternity before every immortal is killed in fact the game has the potential to last an eternity.Those were just some words to think about next time you watch any of the Highlander films(except II) and when you watch the show.

It is greatly welcomed in this release though.Mako does an excellent Job as Macleod's new trainer at the beginning of the film, he knows he is going to die and on at least three occasions gives Conner the opportunity to take his head, he idiotically refuses and his trainers powers fall into the hands of evil an evil that would hunt MaCloud many centuries later. Those that say that this is a remake of the original are greatly mistaken and should rent the directors cut of this film and watch this one again.MaCloud did win the prize in the original film, it just so happens that when the sorcerer is resurrected the game begins again,Macloud is actually defending the prize he already won, he gets an even greater prize when he kills the Sorcerer, he recieves the powers and knowledge of his trainer and his power of illusion, besides the overall prize.Many have asked about Highlander Endgame, this film only works if you think of it as many years later, this film also is based on the television series too, we have both Conner and Duncan in this one. IF you see the pilot of that show Conner is there, we learned that he trained Duncan after finding him almost dead after a battle. This film pretty much wraps up that series and it tries to finish off the film series as well, it is confusing but you can make sense out of it if you try. The Villian in that film tops them all as he doesn't care about the rules, in fact he breaks every one including the Holy Ground rule.If anyone else can figure out the link between Highlander I, III, the series and Endgame, feel free to write another commentary with updated information and your own thoughts of what if.Highlander The Final Dimension is under-rated and the Directors Cut of this film should be viewed for best performance.There can be only one, yes in the end there can be only one, we do not know when the end will be, it could be the end of time for all we know, immortals are always being born throughout the centuries and years, we don't know who they are or where they are, at the time end of time one man shall stand alone, at that point there can be only one, but it will be almost an eternity before every immortal is killed in fact the game has the potential to last an eternity.Those were just some words to think about next time you watch any of the Highlander films(except II) and when you watch the show.

I remember catching this on television at some ungodly hour a few years ago. From the beginning it screamed crappy 80s horror film, but the plot was so strange I couldn't turn it off.Here's the basic idea (it's been a while, remember...). Paul and his family have just moved to town and he has no friends. That's because he just moved in, but also because he's a child prodigy that spends his time performing brain surgery and building robots.Paul's only friend is a robot he created named B.B.. By today's standards B.B. is laughably primitive and at the same time impossibly advanced. See, Paul's so intelligent that he bases the brains of his robots on the human mind, so even though B.B. looks like a clunky, cheap, barely-mobile toy from the deepest, darkest part of the 80s, it's highly intelligent.Anyway, Paul gets picked on at school and is pitied only by a pretty girl named Samantha, who decides to be nice to him, just like in real life. Everything looks good until some bullies try to break B.B. and instead short-circuit him. Paul gets B.B. to run, but something is not quite right with our school bus-yellow, rotund mechanical friend. And then the movie gets REALLY ridiculous.Paul is forced to dismantle B.B. because of angry neighbors or something. Later, Samantha's abusive father kills her and Paul, devastated by the loss of his young crush, decides that he can reanimate her BY PUTTING B.B.'S MAIN CHIP IN HER HEAD. No power source is required, nothing like theat. Just a trip to the morgue, a little surgery, and Samantha is as good as new. Except for her complete lack of emotion and her odd, mechanical movements. Paul keeps her in his garage because, you know, Samantha's supposed to be dead and everything, but she starts committing acts of revenge against anyone who mistreated Paul, Sam, or the robot itself.Like the other reviews mention, there are only three good things about this movie* The scene in which robo-Samantha decapitates a mean old woman with a basketball (I'm not a big horror fan, but that was too cool and odd to ignore)*The fact that the role of the mean old woman is played by that mean old woman from Goonies*Keeping in mind the material she had to work with, Kristy Swanson does a good jobI realize I've summarized most of the plot, but I'm not going to give away the ending... it's too hilariously out there. You just have to see it.So yeah, Deadly Friend is a silly movie from a decade that gave us a lot of silly movies, but it's a decent way to kill some time, if only for a few scenes (and laughs).I said there was something horrifying about Deadly Friend, and I wasn't lying, just saving the best for last the screenplay was written by the same guy who penned the screenplay to JACOB'S LADDER, one of the finest films I have ever seen!

See, Paul's so intelligent that he bases the brains of his robots on the human mind, so even though B.B. looks like a clunky, cheap, barely-mobile toy from the deepest, darkest part of the 80s, it's highly intelligent.Anyway, Paul gets picked on at school and is pitied only by a pretty girl named Samantha, who decides to be nice to him, just like in real life. Everything looks good until some bullies try to break B.B. and instead short-circuit him. Paul gets B.B. to run, but something is not quite right with our school bus-yellow, rotund mechanical friend. And then the movie gets REALLY ridiculous.Paul is forced to dismantle B.B. because of angry neighbors or something. Later, Samantha's abusive father kills her and Paul, devastated by the loss of his young crush, decides that he can reanimate her BY PUTTING B.B.'S MAIN CHIP IN HER HEAD. No power source is required, nothing like theat. Just a trip to the morgue, a little surgery, and Samantha is as good as new. Except for her complete lack of emotion and her odd, mechanical movements. Paul keeps her in his garage because, you know, Samantha's supposed to be dead and everything, but she starts committing acts of revenge against anyone who mistreated Paul, Sam, or the robot itself.Like the other reviews mention, there are only three good things about this movie* The scene in which robo-Samantha decapitates a mean old woman with a basketball (I'm not a big horror fan, but that was too cool and odd to ignore)*The fact that the role of the mean old woman is played by that mean old woman from Goonies*Keeping in mind the material she had to work with, Kristy Swanson does a good jobI realize I've summarized most of the plot, but I'm not going to give away the ending... it's too hilariously out there. You just have to see it.So yeah, Deadly Friend is a silly movie from a decade that gave us a lot of silly movies, but it's a decent way to kill some time, if only for a few scenes (and laughs).I said there was something horrifying about Deadly Friend, and I wasn't lying, just saving the best for last the screenplay was written by the same guy who penned the screenplay to JACOB'S LADDER, one of the finest films I have ever seen!
