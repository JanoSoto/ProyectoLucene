The comic-book was turned into a film without their knowledge or consent, so Jay and Silent Bob decide to forego any potential cash from the project in favour of canning the thing entirely. Rather than make a phone call or send an email they decide to set off from one coast of the United States to the other.There are gay jokes \/ poo jokes \/ clit jokes \/ d*ck jokes \/ fart jokes \/ masturbation jokes and more, including much mugging towards camera and plenty of in-jokes for Smith fans.For Smith there are internet jokes \/ a Star Wars rip off sequence \/ a billion pop culture references \/ and a monkey...There are cameos galore George Carlin \/ Carrie Fisher \/ Mark Hamill \/ Ben Affleck & Matt Damon (& Gus Van Sant) \/ John Stewart \/ Jason Biggs & James Van Der Beek \/ Judd Nelson \/ Diedrich Bader \/ Tracey Morgan \/ Sean William Scott \/ Wes Craven & Shannon Doherty \/ Chris Rock \/ and Will Ferrell... The best laughs from the cameos? Bader (Oh what a lovely tea party) and Damon \/ Affleck \/ Van Sant in the Good Will Hunting sequel (Applesauce bitch!).And if you don't understand it all there are three hotties in tight outfits... and Kevin Smith's missus who tags along with them (sorry Kev).I think it is more a by-product of making a film with a massive cast but this film has the best performances by Sean William Scott, Ferrell, Morgan and Chris Rock in many years, only because none is asked to be on screen for more than 20 minutes at most, as they are all equally tiresome when you realize that their initial shtick is all that they have. Ferrell has already started to feel the backlash at his tired antics, Chris Rock hasn't been a draw for... ever aside from stand up and Morgan's drop is rapidly approaching.Ask Kevin himself, he cast Morgan in Cop Out and said Action which helped me prove just that.Final Rating - 7 \/ 10.

It is 45 seconds after that when the first joke is fired, not a great one it must be said (it's literally a toilet joke), but from that point on you don't go another 3 minutes 45 seconds without laughing, quite often not even 45 seconds.The beauty of Coming to America is that it relies on what is almost a threadbare plot and gives enough room for the actors to provide the funny, in the wrong (*cough* Sandler) hands lesser comedians (*cough* Schneider) could kill the film with their hamming (*snort* Ferrell) or lack of range (*ahem* Look at me, I'm down to Earth - Aniston).Luckily at this time Landis had Murphy in his prime, Arsenio as a great character actor and foil, and a bunch of bit part guys and dignified straight men (John Amos, James Earl Jones) willing to dumb down just a little.That threadbare plot involves the sole heir to the throne (Murphy) of a made up African nation going to America to find his bride, as he is not happy with the arranged marriage being prepared by his parents in his native land.The lushness of Akeem's situation is very clearly illustrated early on, he has dozens of people at his beck and call, barely does anything by and for himself, and has access to anything and anyone he chooses.His Father the King is James Earl Jones, and he clearly wants Akeem to follow tradition and accept his custom built new bride. When Akeem shows some trepidation the King agrees to let him take a break, thinking that a month away will let him clear his system, or perhaps something less crude, so he will come back in a better frame of mind. Along for the ride is his faithful friend Semmi (Hall) so he has someone to talk to and to keep him out of trouble.Once in America, specifically New York, Akeem and Semmi seek to blend in. Early efforts don't go so well, which would generally be the case when wearing the GDP of some nations, and having more staff on hand than many multinational companies.After they manage to simplify matters by moving into a dingy apartment they get to the business of getting Akeem some tail. They hit every disco in town with no success, other than highlighting Murphy and Hall's talent for multiple roles and proving that every chick in New York is apparently nuts.The local barber points the boys in the direction of the Black Awareness Rally happening that night, and it is at that event that Akeem notices Lisa MacDowell (Shari Headley), a confident, intelligent and beautiful young woman who is the daughter of the caterer to the event.Search over. Only Lisa MacDowell does not know that Akeem exists, and he does not want to win her over with money and tales of don't you know who I am. Besides that Lisa already has a boyfriend, the son of the Soul Glo empire named Darryl (Eric La Salle).Leo MacDowell (John Amos) runs a Macca's rip-off restaurant called MacDowells and Akeem and Semmi get jobs there as cleaners, never letting on their true backgrounds.Over time, Lisa acknowledges Akeem and they gradually seem to be getting nearer and nearer... then, just as things heat up Semmi and Leo meddle (Semmi 3X!) and stuff gets complicated.><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>< Now this is a comedy, and a damn good one, so aside from the factual stuff above it is hard to explain what happens without just recycling the jokes, and I ain't no Two & a Half Men writer.

However, it's an action movie, and how many of those are really believable anyway? So one has to judge this for its ability to excite and to entertain and every now and then to get your heart pumping. It manages to do all three of those things generally pretty well.Harrison Ford was an obvious choice to play the lead in this. As James Marshall, he's the President of the United States, who recently committed the US to ousting a brutal dictator in Kazakhstan and having him thrown into prison, whose followers commit themselves to getting him released by taking the President hostage.

The People vs. Larry Flynt is about the creator of Hustler magazine, an extremely racy pornographic magazine that was way ahead of its time, and the legal battles that ensued upon its creation and development. It focuses on aspects of Flynt's home life as well as his business. His offensive magazine was condemned by onslaughts of disgusted American's, and this lead to Larry Flynt being a figurehead in the battle for free speech. The film tells a very interesting story with a colorful cast of odd characters, including the obscene and bizarre protagonist himself.The story that this film tells is not one that you will hear discussed in everyday society. It just isn't something that can easily be brought up, because of its raunchy subject matter. And that's why I enjoyed this movie so much, because it told a surprisingly fascinating story. There was a lot more to this legal battle than meets the eye. There was a surprising amount of aspects to the story that I wasn't expecting. The movie told a very interesting story about a very interesting man. The film covers a lot more ground than is to be expected. It begins with Larry and his brother running a small time strip club. Not long after the movie begins is Hustler created and Flynt begins to thrive. The main focus of the films conflict then starts to arise as Flynt is attacked by naysayers who are disgusted by what he is doing. From here a lot of things happen, some good, others not so good. There is plenty of comedy, drama, and even tragedy in this unorthodox story about a very unorthodox and yet fascinating man.I think I've made it clear that Larry Flynt was a fascinating character to watch unfold in this movie, but that doesn't mean he was a likable one. To put it lightly, Larry Flynt was a jerk in this film. He was vulgar, rude, and obscene. He objectified women and had little to no respect for authority. There were times where he became unbearably obnoxious in the film, but it all played in to what the character was all about. He undoubtedly developed issues as he grew older. He suffered one physical tragedy that left him impaired physically, but also drove his mind into depravity as well. But despite all this, I can't say I disrespect him for being so determined to exercise his first amendment rights. Considering the situation, you really can't argue with the points he makes in the film, whether you agree with him or not. The tagline of the film says it best. You might not like what he does, but are you prepared to give up his right to do it? This sums up what the legal battle the film focuses on is all about. He has the right to do what he does whether you like it or not. The film delivered very interesting battle of wits and morals.The film boasts a fascinating story with a variety of different characters, and it thankfully has the cast to hold up this aspect of the film. Woody Harrelson plays Larry Flynt, and he does an incredible job. Flynt goes through a lot of changes, both physical and mental, throughout the course of the film, and Harrelson conveys those changes extraordinarily well. It is definitely one of his finest leading roles. Courtney Love plays Flynt's wife, Althea. Now, I have absolutely no expect for Courtney Love. She is a disgusting and tasteless woman with no redeeming qualities except for her performance in The People vs. Larry Flynt. As much as I dislike Love, she does a fantastic job as Althea, a troubled and emotional character that isn't easy to access or understand the motives of because she is really just a nutjob. The character is very multi-dimensional, and Courtney Love does a surprising job at conveying it. Edward Norton plays Flynt's lawyer, Alan Isaacman. The character is another very interesting one. He shows how difficult it is to be the lawyer for a deranged man like Larry Flynt, but his will and determination give him an insightful and compelling edge that I really enjoyed. Plus I love Norton in everything he does, so loving him and his character was a no-brainer.I really loved this movie. It isn't perfect but what it delivers is excellent. The narrative has some issues. In the beginning of the film conflicts seem to arise and then just disappear without another word. There are some abrupt cuts that give the film an uneven feel and pacing. But by the end of the film these issues are easily forgivable because of how much I liked the overall story this film delivers. I really liked everything about this film and could easily see past some of its imperfections. The story is unique and interesting, and so are the characters that are portrayed by a great cast. Don't be turned off by this film's subject matter. You don't want to miss it.

He is a 70s throwback complete with a 12 scale Dr J afro and speaks with a heavy distinct lisp and a slow drawl in a wannabe erudite manner.Leon gives ridiculously homophobic, sexist and outdated answers to the most straightforward of relationship based questions, and for some reason the callers are offended despite the fact that Leon ALWAYS gives similar, generally butt-related responses.Leon's producer is Julie Simmons who is likable but will always be the uppity daughter from Fresh Prince to me, she must field all the complaints and queries, and simultaneously ward off the angry station managers who constantly want to fire Leon.When one manages to do so and Leon is turfed, we get a brief explanation of how he came to be (long story short he grew up in the Playboy mansion) and then move to his dingy local bar where we get to meet the regular clientele that Leon calls friends.As Leon and Julie plot the next stage of their career we are informed that Leon not only talks the talk but humps the walk, he apparently has a string of special ladies all over the city, many of whom hate his guts. This has lead to a similar number of disgruntled husbands and partners who know Leon only from the smiley face tattoo on his derriere.

That thought is also put on its head when he finally finds the chick and it is Tiffany-Amber Thiessen in her prime. In lingerie. Damnnnn, HELLO MISS WRONG!!! The finale is cheesy and a little disappointing&#x85; (Ferrell & Evens feature), but mostly The Ladies Man is the story of a man out of touch with the real world, a man who lives in his own bubble of ignorance but is always totally honest and true to himself and what he believes in. Even if that is stupid.Take out the wronged guys subplot and this movie is even better, but also about 40 minutes long, maybe this is a case of better left as a skit? Final Rating &#x96; 7.5 \/ 10.

If you get 4 minutes into the film and decide you don't think that you like Leon Phelps you might as well stop. If you get that far and don't smirk once DEFINITELY stop, it ain't gonna change from here.Leon Phelps is a radio talkback guy that can only exist in movies as he would never really get a job in the real world. He is a 70s throwback complete with a 12 scale Dr J afro and speaks with a heavy distinct lisp and a slow drawl in a wannabe erudite manner.Leon gives ridiculously homophobic, sexist and outdated answers to the most straightforward of relationship based questions, and for some reason the callers are offended despite the fact that Leon ALWAYS gives similar, generally butt-related responses.Leon's producer is Julie Simmons who is likable but will always be the uppity daughter from Fresh Prince to me, she must field all the complaints and queries, and simultaneously ward off the angry station managers who constantly want to fire Leon.When one manages to do so and Leon is turfed, we get a brief explanation of how he came to be (long story short he grew up in the Playboy mansion) and then move to his dingy local bar where we get to meet the regular clientele that Leon calls friends.As Leon and Julie plot the next stage of their career we are informed that Leon not only talks the talk but humps the walk, he apparently has a string of special ladies all over the city, many of whom hate his guts. This has lead to a similar number of disgruntled husbands and partners who know Leon only from the smiley face tattoo on his derriere. I will not refer to this group again in favourable terms, suffice to say they include Will Ferrell and Lee Evans, two of the worst and over-hyped comedic actors in recent history.They wish Leon harm.Leon has no job, no prospects and no regular missus. On top of this Julie has had enough of his lack of common sense and has temporarily scarpered.

He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way.

In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police.Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) important people who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum.With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur.This is where the fun starts for all involved.Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing marriage problems, in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers.Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids&#x85; and Grandma Rose for dinner.******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor.All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well.So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose&#x85; Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her.Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while.At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen.Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right?

It wasn't a fantastic thriller, but it shouldn't get the beating it's getting on IMDb, Netflix, and every other review site. The acting isn't phenomenal, the plot isn't much, but the events in the film keep you at least interesting and hoping for the best. In the long run, The Trigger Effect is not the worst thing to come out of movies ever.Sometimes, I believe, when a movie is panned by critics and moviegoers, a film gets bad reviews by everyone whether they like it or not. I looked on the IMDb Bottom 100 before writing this review, and thought, there's got to be one person out there that likes some of these films. I scanned about twenty, and the twenty I picked had no review above two out of ten. My point; not everyone can hate a movie. It can't be so bad no one likes it. This is kind of how I feel with this film and the 1996 comedy Bio-Dome which I found to be an entertaining film. The only difference with The Trigger Effect is I could find someone who liked Bio-Dome. I have yet to find someone that (honestly) admits they like The Trigger Effect.The film has no real plot. It takes place in Southern California where our two protagonists reside. Matt (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elizabeth Shue) return home from the movies to find their infant screaming with an ear ache. Matt calls a doctor who promises to have a prescription filled by morning. In the middle of the night, the neighbors wake to find a the town has blacked out. Matt arrives at the pharmacy to find out the doctor didn't call in the prescription, so he resorts to stealing the medicine for the baby.Matt's brother Joe (Dermot Mulroney) arrives at the house to convince the couple to buy a gun for security since the blackout is causing very strange behavior amongst the town. When purchasing the gun, the four come to the consensus that they must take a trip to wife's parent's house. Soon enough, all hell breaks loose.The film is no masterpiece, but it shouldn't get the beating it is taking on the web now. It's a very least intriguing. You want to know what happens to these innocent people. You want to follow them through this journey through hell. As most of these events occur, they trigger another thing to happen (obviously why the film's title is what it is). Clearly the person behind this idea wanted no light at the end of the tunnel. Just like the film Where the Heart Is or The Quiet, they wanted no light at the end of the tunnel.Upon it's release, it grossed a mere $1,887,791, and ranked 12th at the Box Office. It came up very short compared to it's $8,000,000 budget. It went on to gross around $3,000,000 in it's entirety, and lead on to never being spoken about again. While I think in no means it should be praised, it should at least be recognized for doing the job it did. It didn't want to be bad, but then again no movie does. It just showed it's limitations on screen, and nothing more. It doesn't want to be anything more than it's budget allows. It's a good thing and a bad thing simultaneously.Starring Kyle MacLachlan, Elisabeth Shue, and Dermot Mulroney.

It wasn't a fantastic thriller, but it shouldn't get the beating it's getting on IMDb, Netflix, and every other review site. The acting isn't phenomenal, the plot isn't much, but the events in the film keep you at least interesting and hoping for the best. In the long run, The Trigger Effect is not the worst thing to come out of movies ever.Sometimes, I believe, when a movie is panned by critics and moviegoers, a film gets bad reviews by everyone whether they like it or not. I looked on the IMDb Bottom 100 before writing this review, and thought, there's got to be one person out there that likes some of these films. I scanned about twenty, and the twenty I picked had no review above two out of ten. My point; not everyone can hate a movie. It can't be so bad no one likes it. This is kind of how I feel with this film and the 1996 comedy Bio-Dome which I found to be an entertaining film. The only difference with The Trigger Effect is I could find someone who liked Bio-Dome. I have yet to find someone that (honestly) admits they like The Trigger Effect.The film has no real plot. It takes place in Southern California where our two protagonists reside. Matt (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elizabeth Shue) return home from the movies to find their infant screaming with an ear ache. Matt calls a doctor who promises to have a prescription filled by morning. In the middle of the night, the neighbors wake to find a the town has blacked out. Matt arrives at the pharmacy to find out the doctor didn't call in the prescription, so he resorts to stealing the medicine for the baby.Matt's brother Joe (Dermot Mulroney) arrives at the house to convince the couple to buy a gun for security since the blackout is causing very strange behavior amongst the town. When purchasing the gun, the four come to the consensus that they must take a trip to wife's parent's house. Soon enough, all hell breaks loose.The film is no masterpiece, but it shouldn't get the beating it is taking on the web now. It's a very least intriguing. You want to know what happens to these innocent people. You want to follow them through this journey through hell. As most of these events occur, they trigger another thing to happen (obviously why the film's title is what it is). Clearly the person behind this idea wanted no light at the end of the tunnel. Just like the film Where the Heart Is or The Quiet, they wanted no light at the end of the tunnel.Upon it's release, it grossed a mere $1,887,791, and ranked 12th at the Box Office. It came up very short compared to it's $8,000,000 budget. It went on to gross around $3,000,000 in it's entirety, and lead on to never being spoken about again. While I think in no means it should be praised, it should at least be recognized for doing the job it did. It didn't want to be bad, but then again no movie does.

A disco throwback with an insatiable thirst for justice and fairness to all things pro-black. He is also funny as sh*t.

This is apparently a tragedy as it will cost an entire culture its identity and basically its coolness. I wonder if they will still be allowed to do porn or play in the NBA?Enter the BROTHERHOOD, which stands for something I can't remember but is probably vaguely clever and totally unnecessary. A group of predominantly (see further down) black staff who seek to thwart The Man's efforts and preserve the black experience for generations to come. The BROTHERHOOD are staffed by total stereotypes, but at least they acknowledge as much in the naming of most characters&#x85;* The Chief* Smart Brother.* Conspiracy Brother* Sistah-Girl&#x85;And Lance, the token affirmative action white guy played by Neil Patrick Harris. (Who would have thought that 2 of the better comedies with a predominantly non-white cast would have featured Doogie himself?) For some reason this cracks me up even though it also panders to every sarcastic stereotype of white guys going around. (Can't dance, not cool, tone deaf etc.)Our plot revolves around The Man trying to spread a white-washing drug through the black community using fried chicken laced with a mind altering drug, and fronted by a formerly admired black General with aspirations to politics who has apparently sold out, but is really himself under the influence of the drug and powerless to resist.The BROTHERHOOD conscript Undercover Brother to help stop The Man's plan, but first he must go through white-thinking training. Needless to say the montage shown before him has some of the more embarrassing atrocities ever committed by the white race. He must also learn to cope with mayonnaise, which we apparently all love for some reason.Sent into the heart of The Man's operations, UB must blend in by removing any trace of cool or blackness. The Man counters by unleashing White She-Devil (Denise Richards) as UB's ultimate temptation and foe.Once under her spell UB becomes temporarily lost to the BROTHERHOOD, and it is up to Sistah-Girl to go and save him. A catfight between She-Devil and Sistah-Girl in front of Undercover Brother and a couple of white henchmen remains a hilarious highlight as it gets more and more ludicrous, culminating in the both half dressed and slurping it up in the shower.I laughed a lot in this film. I a lot of comedy recently and this was by far the funniest and offered the most frequent laughs.There are jokes about having a black President - which show that they couldn't see into the future - a great slo-mo car chase featuring golf buggies and enough good natured Oh well black people do this and white people do that jokes that made me wish you could get away with more political incorrectness when it comes to race these days.

(Mr Feather (Chris Kattan) is a 50\/50 proposition, half funny and half cringeworthy, mostly due to his attempts to speak black for comedy's sake.)Of course being a movie with a 70s throwback as the main attraction the music is funk-tastic and includes some of the better known hits from that decade, as well as nifty background tunes.The whole thing seemed to set up a sequel that never came, which is a shame, because aside from a few clumsy missteps Undercover Brother is without doubt the most chuckle-worthy of the comedies I have seen thus far.Final Rating &#x96; 8 \/ 10. The only drawback of Undercover Brother is the absence of one huge laugh. There are dozens of funny bits and chuckles galore but no eye-watering, cheek hurter.That aside this is still very good stuff and underrated. Maybe the White Man is keeping a Brother down after all!

The movie is based upon a novel Vampires by John Steakley, a pretty solid novel, I might add. Carpenter did a pretty good thing here, by showing his vision of vampires, a dark, Gothic monsters of the night, by my opinion the way it should be. There's a lot of blood, gore, action and somewhat cynicism... well expected from Carpenter, but the result is pretty average here. Comparatively... entertaining film, with characters very different than those from the book, they are pretty weak in the film... but the dialog remained the same, a lot of toughness, swearing and other angry-macho stuff, there's also a weak tension as the movie goes by.
