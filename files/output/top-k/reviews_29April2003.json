Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly have a chemistry that is truly one-of-a-kind. Crudup gives a heart-wrenching performance as a man who struggles with the fact that the love he thought he lost seems to have reappeared. Waking the Dead never made much of a dent in the mainstream box office, but it represents the best elements of what a drama should have.
