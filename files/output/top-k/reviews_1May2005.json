Without a doubt it's interesting. It has a good premise and varied interpretations can make the film intriguing as different kinds of satire. Unfortunately, it's not consistently entertaining or rewarding to watch, it has some technical, directing and editing problems, and it easily invites unfavorable comparisons to Monty Python. In the end, I had to give Jabberwocky a C, or a 7 this time around, although I found myself continually wishing that I could give it a higher score.Jabberwocky is really the story of Dennis Cooper (Michael Palin), a lovable dolt who is in love with Griselda Fishfinger (Annette Badland), the obese daughter of a local fisherman. It is set in the Middle Ages in England, probably around the 13th or 14th Century (partially based on a character identifying plaster as possibly being from the 12th Century). After Dennis' father dies, Dennis decides to head off to the grand city to find a job and make his fortune, so he can head back to his village in a state worthy to marry Griselda. However, things aren't going so swell in the city, either. Unknown to Dennis' village, there is a monster called the Jabberwock that has been terrorizing the countryside not far from the city. The city has been closed off and there's tight control over who gets in or out. People in and just outside of the city are starving; there is no work, and so on. Dennis finally sneaks into the city one morning and discovers the dire truth. The bulk of the film is a series of misadventures, focused on Dennis, as he tries to adjust to life within the city.Because Jabberwocky's release date was only two years removed from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), because it was directed by Python member Terry Gilliam, who also co-directed Holy Grail, and because it has a similar setting, some similar characters, some similar scenarios, and some almost identical costumes, it easily invites comparison to its better-known brother. That's Jabberwocky's first major hurdle for anyone who has seen Holy Grail, which is likely to be a large percentage of the audience who would seek out and\/or bother watching this film. The problem is that Jabberwocky isn't anywhere near as funny as Holy Grail, and I don't think that Gilliam intended it to be.For me, the most favorable reading of Jabberwocky has it as a fairly serious satire (so satire in the more academic sense) not of the Middle Ages, but of the popular 20th Century conceptions of what the Middle Ages (or the Dark Ages) must have been like. This is further enforced by Gilliam and Terry Jones' remarks on the Holy Grail DVD commentary (and maybe better enforced on the Jabberwocky commentary, which I haven't had a chance to listen to yet) during the scene when King Arthur encounters the peasants who get into a political structure debate. There, they explicitly state that they tried to exaggerate the popular misconceptions of how such peasants would have been, and acknowledge that more academic research has shown those ideas to be false. In Jabberwocky, Gilliam has his entire population as filthy, stupid gits with deplorable personal hygiene who can barely figure out how to survive. They resort to eating rats, scams that involve hacking off their own limbs so they can beg as a cripple, and so on.Monty Pythonesque humor of the less intellectual variety does enter occasionally, especially with the bits involving bodily functions or violating the sanctity of the body. That's not to say that Jabberwocky is not an intellectual film in any sense. But the intellect here comes with the interpretation above--in the skewering of our progress-oriented misconceptions about the past.As promising as some of that might sound, and as promising as it might sound to make concrete Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky poem from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), the film has a load of problems. Even though the focus is ostensibly on Dennis, he always feels like something of a bystander in the film, making any desired focus, and the viewer's attention, drift. Gilliam has problems making scenes flow smoothly. His pacing seems off. The sets and the cinematography are not very attractive. In fact, at least on the DVD release, much of the film looks extremely murky (oddly, I thought the color on the included trailer looked better). None of the auxiliary characters quite click, and it's often difficult to decipher what they're saying\/talking about. Some scenes are almost repeated in the film, and other scenes, such as those involving the princess in her tower, or Gilliam's cameo as he's talking to castle guards, seem like rejected drafts of similar scenes in Holy Grail. In fact, all of this is in sharp contrast to the excellence of Holy Grail.So despite all of the good points, including the opening, with its hilarious point-of-view of a Jabberwock attack, the fantastic extended final sequence, the more bloody scenes from the tournament, the sly jokes that work (such as accusing the innkeeper of cannibalism after Dennis disappears), and so on, I find my score gradually sinking throughout most of the film. Gilliam and Python fanatics will definitely want to check out Jabberwocky if they haven't seen it yet, but be prepared for a bit of a disappointment.

David Hayter's clever script provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, and Singer is able to convey a wealth of information at high speed without obscuring the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.).The performances, too, are uniformly excellent Stewart and McKellen are unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors add real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team (including Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden) look suitably spectacular, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen. Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Hugh Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of the film's rushed production schedule Newton Thomas Sigel's scope photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins.While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protesters gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? This interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it provides plenty of food for thought. Followed by X2 (2003).

A well made historical drama should be able to suck the viewer in, make them feel a part of the era the film depicts. Disney's The Three Musketeers was not one of my favorite historical pieces. The juvenile plot and idiotic one-liners made Dumas' epic adventure into the standard kid friendly crap that Hollywood seems to pump out in great volume nowadays. That said, I was more than a little intrigued when I heard of The Man in the Iron Mask, another adaptation of a Dumas book that would be given a more serious treatment than its predecessor. With a great story and stellar cast, they couldn't go wrong, could they? Unfortunatally, the actual adaptation is far less compelling than the concept. A feeling of unevenness lingers through the whole film. At times the drama is simply overbearing and bogs down what is supposed to be an epic adventure. Little tension or suspense is ever felt on screen, and the sparse action scenes do little to invigorate the viewer. Instead of being exhilarating and inspirational, the climax comes off like a bad cliché and takes away any emotional effect that the crew intended. The characters themselves provide other problems, in particular DiCaprio's portrayal of the royal brothers. To his credit, he plays both roles quite well Louis as the spoiled, selfish and obnoxious king, and Philippe as the insecure, innocent and passive prisoner. This is another major flaw of the film for an adventure picture, the protagonist\/antagonist are just boring. We have a villain who doesn't so much need to be defeated as he needs a spanking, and a hero who isn't so much heroic as he is meek. Like DiCaprio, the rest of the cast gives good performances, but none of them really amaze. So what we have is an adventure film that isn't really adventurous and a historical drama that seems over-dramatic and sentimental. At times entertaining and even potent, but overall poorly executed. As crazy as it may sound, I think I'd have to consider the swashbuckling camp of The Three Musketeers over this film.

Well, thanks to the fourth of the dire sequels, now we know. It would have sucked.There are two good things I can say about this movie. First, it serves as a lesson about how not to adapt a book to the screen. Second, it shows how much of a great film The Howling is, simply by comparison. As it's another version of the same novel, you already pretty much know the plot ... a disturbed woman goes to a retreat of some kind in order to set her mind straight, and decides to investigate a mysterious howling in the woods. The only positive thing I'll say about the adaptation is that it retains the strong religious element from the book, which was neglected in the Joe Dante version. This movie is apparently a lot closer to Gary Brandner's novel, but it lacks any of the flavour, metaphor or subtext.First off, you don't care about the characters. Secondly, it just isn't scary. Director John Hough may manage to stay faithful to the book like some kind of a literary parrot, but apparently he hasn't heard of those things we call mood or pace or style ... in no way does this feel like a horror movie (it features the most un-frightening ghosts I've ever seen in a film). It's not even a particularly well-made film, and I noticed several errors in continuity. The acting isn't great, as all of the cast seem to belong on a soap opera, but by no means is that the worst thing about the movie. Also, for some odd reason all the dialogue is dubbed. Badly. And there's no excuse for it ... it just distracts you from the rest of the scene (or perhaps that was the intention). The special effects are actually very good, but unfortunately you don't see any of them until the last ten minutes of the movie when they're all thrown together in a hectic mish-mash.Why do we need this movie?

We ignored the problem for as long as we could, but by 2025 we knew we were in trouble & began to search for a new home, Mars is as good as anywhere I suppose.

After 20 years it seemed to work, then all of a sudden the oxygen levels started to drop & we don't know why. But we are going to find out by sending a manned mission to Mars. Bowman's crew consists of Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer) who is a mechanical systems engineer, a co-pilot Lieutenant Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt) & Dr. Bud Chantilas (Terence Stamp) who is the chief science officer. Joining them are two civilians, Dr. Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore) who is one of the worlds leading bio-engineers & Chip Pettengill (Simon Baker) who happens to be a terraform expert. They are also taking along a military robot named AMEE which stands for Autonomous Mapping Exploration & Evasion. After travelling through space for 182 days the Mars-1 reaches it's destination, Mars. Unfortunately radiation caused by a solar flare badly damages the Mars-1, the crew have just 6 minutes before all primary systems shut down. The crew manage to put their spacesuits on & make it to a small escape pod, except Bowman who has to stay behind & manually launch the pod because there isn't enough power to launch it automatically. After the escape pod is safely launched Bowman manages to repair the Mars-1 all by herself by messing about with a few wires, clever girl. The escape pod lands on the surface of Mars & promptly falls over the edge of a cliff, once the pod completely stops it becomes clear that Chantilas is badly hurt & will not be able to travel any further. The remaining men only have seven and a half hours of oxygen left in their tanks, the algae that should be present isn't. Adding to their problems AMEE has been damaged during the crash landing & gone nuts, reverting back to her military mode. Things look bad for the mission as AMEE isn't programmed to take prisoners, the men have no food, water or means of contacting anyone & are running low on air... Directed by Antony Hoffman I thought Red Planet was an OK time waster but nothing that really sticks in the memory. The script by Chuck Pfarrer & Jonathan Lemkin moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't boring, but it does contain situations which just didn't sit well with me at all. What's all this solar flare causing damage to the Mars-1? We have spacecraft now which can withstand this sort of occurrence. And what about this breathable air nonsense? If they can detect that the oxygen levels are falling then why can't they detect that it's also breathable? We could do that now as well. Who built that run down complex they come across?

When Burchenal cause the massive fire that kills himself & the alien bugs & Bowman can clearly see from space why is Gallagher completely unaffected even though he was standing mere feet away from him? Surely he would have been caught in the explosion as well. Why take a military robot along with you? Why not a moon buggy that you could drive or something like that? How did Bowman manage to repair the Mars-1 so easily on her own? I also thought Red Planet was a bit patchy in places, AMEE is only in it sporadically which is bad because she's just about the best part of Red Planet & the characters aren't developed that much. Having said that if you ignore some of the silliness & stupidity Red Planet is quite entertaining to watch, but at almost 2 hours long it probably could have done with being a little shorter though. The special effects are generally excellent, I especially liked the ultra modern cool looking AMEE.

For the last 20 years we have been sending unmanned probes with algae bio-engineered to grow there & release oxygen. We are going to build ourselves an atmosphere we can breathe. After 20 years it seemed to work, then all of a sudden the oxygen levels started to drop & we don't know why. But we are going to find out by sending a manned mission to Mars. Bowman's crew consists of Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer) who is a mechanical systems engineer, a co-pilot Lieutenant Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt) & Dr. Bud Chantilas (Terence Stamp) who is the chief science officer. Joining them are two civilians, Dr. Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore) who is one of the worlds leading bio-engineers & Chip Pettengill (Simon Baker) who happens to be a terraform expert. They are also taking along a military robot named AMEE which stands for Autonomous Mapping Exploration & Evasion. After travelling through space for 182 days the Mars-1 reaches it's destination, Mars. Unfortunately radiation caused by a solar flare badly damages the Mars-1, the crew have just 6 minutes before all primary systems shut down. The crew manage to put their spacesuits on & make it to a small escape pod, except Bowman who has to stay behind & manually launch the pod because there isn't enough power to launch it automatically. After the escape pod is safely launched Bowman manages to repair the Mars-1 all by herself by messing about with a few wires, clever girl. The escape pod lands on the surface of Mars & promptly falls over the edge of a cliff, once the pod completely stops it becomes clear that Chantilas is badly hurt & will not be able to travel any further. The remaining men only have seven and a half hours of oxygen left in their tanks, the algae that should be present isn't. Adding to their problems AMEE has been damaged during the crash landing & gone nuts, reverting back to her military mode. Things look bad for the mission as AMEE isn't programmed to take prisoners, the men have no food, water or means of contacting anyone & are running low on air... Directed by Antony Hoffman I thought Red Planet was an OK time waster but nothing that really sticks in the memory. The script by Chuck Pfarrer & Jonathan Lemkin moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't boring, but it does contain situations which just didn't sit well with me at all. What's all this solar flare causing damage to the Mars-1? We have spacecraft now which can withstand this sort of occurrence. And what about this breathable air nonsense? If they can detect that the oxygen levels are falling then why can't they detect that it's also breathable? We could do that now as well. Who built that run down complex they come across? It states that they're the first manned mission to Mars & that they had previously only sent unmanned probes. Maybe I missed something along the way. When Burchenal cause the massive fire that kills himself & the alien bugs & Bowman can clearly see from space why is Gallagher completely unaffected even though he was standing mere feet away from him? Surely he would have been caught in the explosion as well. Why take a military robot along with you? Why not a moon buggy that you could drive or something like that? How did Bowman manage to repair the Mars-1 so easily on her own? I also thought Red Planet was a bit patchy in places, AMEE is only in it sporadically which is bad because she's just about the best part of Red Planet & the characters aren't developed that much. Having said that if you ignore some of the silliness & stupidity Red Planet is quite entertaining to watch, but at almost 2 hours long it probably could have done with being a little shorter though. The special effects are generally excellent, I especially liked the ultra modern cool looking AMEE. It's well made throughout with nice production design & sets, the acting is OK but nothing spectacular. Overall I was entertained & there isn't anything really wrong with it when you consider it's just a big budget Sci-Fi action film, there are much worse out there. Worth watching but just don't expect anything particularly deep or meaningful, decent enough.

It also managed to impress upon viewers like myself that sometimes, you cannot keep the evil lurking out there away from your family.

His new partner is a rather strange-looking character by the name of Martin Riggs. In the course of just one day, Riggs manages to risk his life, and that of his new partner, in so many memorable ways that the film is now entrenched as an example of the buddy cop film not only being done right, but being done brilliantly.

As the two detectives begin asking questions, a string of extremely memorable attempts on their lives begins. They say that an action hero is only as strong as his antagonist, and Gary Busey gives Mel Gibson a lot to work with here. Gibson, fresh off the rather tepid third installment in the Mad Max franchise, obviously knew this was his shot at the big time, and he rides it for everything that it is worth.

It is sadly ironic that this, rather than a role in a great historical drama like The Colour Purple, Glover is hardly remembered outside of this admittedly impressive cavalcade of stunts.I have been reading articles recently that state, among other things, that the real reason films have been getting more expensive and less profitable is not so much production costs, but because of a massive explosion in salaries. Lethal Weapon, estimated to have cost fifteen million to make, took in more than four times that sum at the box office. That's to say nothing of all the rentals and video sales that this, regarded by some as the best action\/buddy film, has generated.

Although I disagree with the idea that the best films were made in the so-called Golden Era, when studios reigned over cast and crew like the monarchs of old, I do agree with the notion that film does not function well at all when commerce is the driving factor.

Lethal Weapon, estimated to have cost fifteen million to make, took in more than four times that sum at the box office. That's to say nothing of all the rentals and video sales that this, regarded by some as the best action\/buddy film, has generated. It reminds me of a satirical graphic developed by one pack of jokers that states the fact that film executives once paid Keanu Reeves thirty million dollars, but piracy is making them bankrupt. Although I disagree with the idea that the best films were made in the so-called Golden Era, when studios reigned over cast and crew like the monarchs of old, I do agree with the notion that film does not function well at all when commerce is the driving factor. It has become better to lose money spending a hundred million rather than ten million, and the art suffers badly for it.Lethal Weapon is also (almost) the last film on the resumé of stuntman Dar Robinson, whose resume also includes the first two Police Academy films, along with other surprising classics like Rollerball. As Lethal Weapon was in post-production, Robinson was tragically killed in a motorbike accident. A brief dedication at the end of the film lets viewers in on the fact that behind all those men who dive off buildings or get blown up for their entertainment, there are names and faces. It is a quiet dedication that most never bother to watch, but it reminds that stuntmen are truly the unsung heroes of the action film industry.I gave Lethal Weapon a ten out of ten. It shows in no uncertain terms that action films work better when the director is allowed to focus on that little element called action. Not just the kind of action where some idiot shoots another with a cap gun, and you see some terrible playacting, but the kind of action where men are trapped in cars that, seconds later, explode with a mighty thud. They don't make them much better than this.

It's a movie about women, but since it's a baseball movie, men will enjoy it too. A humorous look at a woman's professional baseball league during World War II, A League of Their Own follows the lives of Dottie (Geena Davis) and her kid sister Kit (Lori Petty) as they try out for and make the Rockford Peaches, one of the four teams in the league just for women. While some of the names have been changed to protect the innocent, the movie tells the mostly-true story of the league's first year. Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell play fellow Peaches, adding a sassy duo that helps bring smiles to the scenes that they are in. But it's Tom Hanks who steals the show. He plays Jimmy Dugan, a former home run king who cannot get a Major League managerial job because of his obsession with drinking. There was not really a baseball player named Jimmy Dugan, but most believe the character is based on former Philadelphia Athletic power hitter, Jimmy Foxx. Hanks plays his character over the top, over asleep drunk in the dugout. He utters the most famous line of the movie, There is no crying in baseball to one of his players who just committed an error. He also holds the record for longest on-camera urination in the history of cinema. But Tom Hanks comedic performance could have been overshadowed if Jon Lovitz had been in just one more scene. Lovitz plays a scout looking for talent across America, while playing a variation of The Liar he perfected on SNL at the same time. Penny Marshall, who directed this film, makes sure to keep the pace even, with both baseball scenes and scenes with just the girls. My favorite non-baseball scene involves the girls at charm school trying to sip tea the right way. The movie does follow the usual sports-movies clichés, but you know what? I had a good time anyway. The movie isn't about the team on the field, but rather the way the girls bonded as a team. There is one heartbreaking scene where one of the girls finds out here husband died in the war. But that scene is equaled with Tom Hanks driving the team bus after waking up to a rude surprise.

Admittedly the films weird cult (as in Christianity) creates the biggest barrier to getting anything from the object of devotion.While the decision to write off the land of Oz as a dream is a creative writing teachers nightmare, it probably saved the culture from fifty years of garbage sequels that would have sullied this film. That the book was changed is a strange complaint, because the larger point of contention is that they only filmed 3\/4ths of it. The last portion of the book is completely missing. (the quadlings, the dainty china country, green glasses) The exclusion of these bits without their being missed, is indicative of how arbitrary Baums inclusions are. Most of the altered elements are technically motivated. How do you have a swarm of field mice carry a lion out a poppy field in 1939? The slippers were changed to the more vibrant red color because the original silver slippers offered nothing that couldn't have been shown in the black and white world Dorothy has left. etc.As it is, it offers an abundance for a child to digest and the inclusion of the missing elements would have compressed the rest and perhaps triggered exhaustion in the audience. My patience grows thin at the If I were King interlude and the movie mercifully omits the late developments. Any book would do well to have such a hack job done on it. Baums simplistic, chirpy books might be out of print by now if not for this movie. Furthermore Baum restlessly throws away populations and characters over the course of each book before they're even developed. There's a spoof of Baum's books just waiting to be written, called The United Nations of Oz, in which Oz diplomacy is explained to suggest how all these nations, regions & peoples get along... it might be useful in our world.You could complain about what it doesn't achieve but the movie is so packed with iconographic elements (the yellow brick road, munchkins, witches, malevolent trees) all entering the tableaux in breathless maximization (the way children prefer their stimulation) that the movie becomes powerfully vivid. The window has probably closed on the era in which you could intentionally produce a movie that plays as this does on the naivete and complexity of the American psyche.My only complaint about this is that it is perfectly scaled to the venue which popularized it (TV). On the big screen the tiresome use of vaudeville shtick & cop-outs cheapens and trivializes plot points and grates on a viewer. Next time you watch it, try cataloging which gender holds all the power in the movie. Margaret Hamilton terrifies kids, and her witch is iconographic. Can anyone show me a green witch before 1939? Some goofy lines are hysterically inappropriate seventy years later (only bad witches are ugly... toto too!) There's a moment as the Munchkins entreat her to Follow the Yellow Brick Road where Dorothy's rhythmic walk transforms into her happy dance-skip.
