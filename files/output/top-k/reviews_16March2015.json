I have often heard it talked about and I could not even begin to count how many times I have heard people say the lines, You talking to me, are you, talking to me, you must be talking to me cause I don't see anybody else here.. So saying that, I finally got around to seeing it and I think it is a really good movie, probably not as great as everybody thinks it is, but overall I liked it a lot. De Niro does an excellent job as Travis Bickle, you really get the feeling of isolation while being in the middle of everyone, and the score and city itself really helps with that. If I was judging this movie on acting alone I would give it 5 stars, but due to the amount of swearing, the fact that Bickles idea of a nice date is to go to a pornographic movie and the child prostitution kinda makes it lose some stars, but I do understand some of that is necessary for the story. The cast for Taxi Driver was really good too, and I don't think I have ever seen Harvey Keitel look that young before. So overall Taxi Driver was pretty darn amazing, although I doubt Bickle would have survived with that many wounds, and if he did, I am pretty sure he would have been thrown in to jail for what he did, but what do you want, its a movie. 4.5 Beards Out Of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Certain films are iconic in themselves or for certain lines, Taxi Driver falls into both categories.

Possibly it seemed totally daring to the critics of the time, a harbinger of youth revolution. Today, to me, it seems dated, narrow, and sad. Time hasn't served it well, and I don't refer only to the fact that we have now seen a lot of actual mass school shootings and are less likely to get excited about them. Nor to the fact that repression of the children of the elites and wannabes in UK public schools is not so much a contemporary issue.Possibly the world of 1968 was not so quick as we are now to notice that, hey, every named character in this film is an obnoxious misogynistic white male twit! I can testify personally that there was a period of a few years when misogynistic white male twits could get a lot of attention leading protests on US campuses. Actually one could take this film as a warning that people like Travis and his followers are to be shunned by persons serious about change, but if that was its message it gets lost.Particularly in the second half a lot of apparently surrealistic elements start to appear. When a clergyman who also leads military training was produced from a large drawer, this set me wondering about other events and images. Did an instructor's wife actually wander naked through the halls? Did Travis actually steal a motorcycle at all, or throw a crocodile on a bonfire? Or are these Travis's fantasies? And if so, is the whole concluding scene of violence maybe really just another fantasy, something that might happen If.... ? (This would explain how the nameless The Girl ends up on the scene. I'm not confident that she even exists.) No doubt all these questions are answered in commentary or interviews somewhere, and if I were a professional I would look them up, but I'm only an amateur reporting on my impressions.But it doesn't terribly matter whether these are Travis's fantasies or the filmmakers' fantasies. The question is how revelatory or instructive or inspiring or artistically attractive they are. And frankly after it all I'm not terribly impressed.I would be more impressed if the 13-year-old enslaved scum had picked up arms to defend themselves against their manifest oppression, torture, and degradation, but that isn't the story. Instead, you have Travis. We learn nothing of his family or backstory. He is contemptuous of the whips and faculty, who deserve contempt, but what has he to offer himself other than some tired snippets of laziness passing for anarchism, about how war and violence are the only creative acts and one man with a gun can change history, and a blood pact with his mates which is about what you would expect of Tom Sawyer playing Red Indians. Why does he stay in the damned school at all? If he left and tried to deal with the issues of his actual life that would also be more impressive. But he strikes me as someone with a sense of ruling- class entitlement just as monumental as that of any of the oppressors, who feels that he should be allowed to just wallow in inaction and play on someone else's dime, and, when he gets whacked on the bum a few times (not exactly the worst thing to happen to anyone in the year of the My Lai massacre), wants to just kill everyone in sight for it.So, to be fair, maybe the makers are entirely aware that Travis's Crusaders are as horrible examples as the powers and principalities of the school. Maybe they know that the dilettantish so-called resistance grounded in pique of these children of the ruling class is as much a target for satire as the institutions of privilege. Maybe. But they don't make it clear to me that they do. The Monty Python troupe satirized this whole ground a lot better, and apart from satire, what's left here?

Now, no one believes which one is which and the two of them start trying to take over each other's lives (while trying to murder each other, obviously).If that brief plot summary hasn't made you ask more than a few questions regarding the hows and whys of it all, then you really are an expert at suspending your disbelief. Most people would already be picking holes in the story. So, if you're looking for a watertight plot with no holes in it, you probably should really skip this one.Luckily, Face\/Off his just so much fun that you'll find it easy to gloss over the general absurdities of it all, sit back, break open the popcorn and just roll with it.

But once the mob finds out, he should have called the police and then the FBI to get in the witness protection program. Instead, he gives the book to his son, Phil, as if he is doing him a favor.All right, Jack is stupid, and we will let it go at that. But then we do not understand why Gloria does not just hand over the book to the mob right away. She is not even willing to go to the police for help, so what does she think she and Phil will do with the book? She says she cannot go to the police for protection because the mobsters are her friends, but then she shoots five of them in their car. I guess it is all right to kill your friends, but not to get the police to protect you from them.When the mob gets the book, they say they still need to kill the kid, to make an example. The problem with that is that it is a cliché that the Mafia leaves the women and children alone, primarily because killing family members invites retribution. So, this determination to kill a young child is not believable.Then Gloria decides to go to Pittsburg. Eventually, it occurs to her that the Mafia is probably in Pittsburg too. No kidding. The thing to do is go to some small town no one has ever heard of in another part of the country, like Kerrville, Texas, population just over 20,000.Finally, the dialogue between Gloria and Phil is unnatural.

Now forgive me but I come from a similar background to the central character Will and I believe myself to be intelligent, but I didn't use my intelligence until very recently. Instead I took to taking drugs and drinking and swearing! Only a few years ago I was working as a cleaner, but now I'm studying programming and media technology at the best technical University in the UK. Now if I can identify with this film's realism (and I live in England) why can't so many others? This film is a veritable jewel. The script is one of the best I've ever seen. The way it mixes thought provoking ideas and witticisms with the kind of colloquial dialogue which we have read in things like 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Now I agree with the sentiment that some people have put across, 'get in touch with your inner Robin Williams'. But thankfully the script or Gus Van Sant or whatever prevented it from going over board. Look at the final scene where they're hugging and saying their farewells. Now this could have overlapped into a typical slushy moment, but no the lines 'Doesn't this contravene the Doctor, patient relationship?' 'Only if you grab my ass' were uttered so as to diffuse it. Then bear in mind that you never actually see the reunion between Skylar and Will! I could go on forever arguing against people's criticisms. But what's the point if certain viewers can't appreciate the subtly evocative direction of Van Sant, the quick fire script and the superb performances by the cast. It's these same viewers who shall, until the end of their days sit and watch the vacuous outpourings of Hollywood mainstream. Let them watch this 'chewing gum for the mind' and we discerning few will lap up the droplets of quality cinema.
