The movie also stars Leslie Nielsen as Jamie Lee's father and Hamilton High School principal. Everyone else in it are just bit players, but we must consider that this film stars one of the wickedest you-know-whats in slasher movie history. Her name is Wendy, and she is played by Anne-Marie Martin. Who this actress is, or was, I have no idea, but I know I hated her character with a passion. One of the biggest bonuses for horror fans in this movie will be the big chase scene with her and the killer quite near the end which was deliberately filmed super dark. You can hardly see what's going on and for me it is the best scene in the whole movie. Big points for Wendy's chase scene. It works since she plays the role well, and we've waited so long for this scene and it comes pretty much near the end, but it delivers.Anyway, 'Prom Night' opens with a tragedy in which young Robin Hammond, who is Jamie Lee's character's little sister, accidentally falls to her death from a two-story window after being cornered by four brats(Wendy, Nick, Kelly, and Jude)who were trying to scare her. Freaked out that they may be in serious trouble, they all make a pact to take it to the grave, initiated by Wendy, the leader of the brats. Ultimately the blame gets pegged on some serial pedophile and no one ever suspects the four kids. But someone else knows and was there and saw the whole thing. We continue twelve years later. It's the day of the prom and all four of the kids receive raspy phone calls, asking them to come out to play. It concerns most of them, but eventually their minds stray back to the prom. Some of them have dates, some don't. Jamie Lee ends up going with Nick who just dumped Wendy, so Wendy hooks up with Lou, who sort of serves as John Travolta's Billy Nolan from 'Carrie', and the two of them plan to play a prank on Jamie Lee and Nick since they were voted Prom King and Queen. Pause real quick. Remember, Nick is one of the kids who was involved with the death of Jamie Lee's little sister. Could you really keep a secret that big from someone you are going steady with? Also, the two other girls involved, Kelly and Jude, appear to be good friends with Jamie Lee's character. I don't think there is much logic in that, but hey, it's a horror movie. I have to overlook it.In the end, prom dreams are sliced and diced as the vengeful killer begins knocking each of them off, eighties style. The movie is definitely pretty corny and cheaply made, but that's all part of it's charm. The suspense is there, the score is really creepy, and Jamie Lee does her thing. However, the best part is the mystery. Who is the killer? I'm sure we all know twenty-five years later, but it was fun finding out. Everyone is a suspect in 'Prom Night', as mentioned by Randy from the first 'Scream', and it will keep you guessing right up to the climax. Well, actually, when it gets to that point there are only a couple people left that it can be...but it was still a bit of a surprise. Honestly, I think 'Prom Night' could use a remake. My VCR copy has such awful quality that it's really quite hard to see what's going on on the screen, and I hear that the DVD isn't any better, so I think we could all benefit from a remastered version, or even a remake at this point.6\/10 is my vote.

Yeah anything involving a romance between two mismatched people isn't usually my kind of movie and I doubt if it was produced for a target audience of 30 something blokes , but that's not to criticise it in anyway . The central plot of two people coming closer and closer together as seen here is convincing and the characters are well defined helped no doubt by the understated performances of Ormond and Roth . Alas it's not flawless The problem is about two thirds of the way through there's a plot twist as if the producers said to themselves  Hold on let's try and liven things up a bit so it'll appeal to streetwise wannabe gangsta boys  . The screenplay did not need livening up since everything was going so well .

Ever since seeing Superman The Movie as a kid, I yearned for seeing Batman The Movie and it wasn't until the summer of 1989 that this movie was released. I was 17 years old and would be a high school senior that fall. I saw this movie opening night and when I first got a VCR, Batman The Movie was the first movie I bought on VHS. I also couldn't wait until the superb film score soundtrack by Danny Elfman was released. Danny Elfman scored the best Batman theme I've ever heard in this movie.I really don't approve of casting a well known celebrity as Batman. Although if I have to compare the three actors who played the Caped Crusader, Michael Keaton was the best of the three. He captured the darkness of Batman and the moodiness of Bruce Wayne. Although Michael Gough looked nothing like Alfred in the comics, he had that grandfather like feel to him. My favorite scene with him was his reminiscing about Bruce as a kid in the kitchen with Bruce and Vicki. Jack Nicholson I felt was the best thing about the whole movie altogether. He was born to play the Joker and had some of the greatest lines. My favorites are This town needs an enema! and What are you laughing at?! Jack Palance was superb as Carl Grissom and I agree with Tim Burton that he was the only man who could have been Jack's boss. I loved the Batmobile, the Batwing, and the Batcave. Wayne Manor was also very elegant looking. This is the only one of the four Batman movies where Gotham City looked like a real city in comparison to the sequels. I would have preferred it had they filmed on location in New York like they did for Superman. All I have just described is what I liked about the movie. But I have to say that as a DIE HARD Batman fan, I found something wrong with each of the four movies. This one is the only one with the fewest complaints. Here are my grievances. 1 Tim Burton's first Batman film lacked action sequences. After Batman's first appearance, we don't see our hero very much for a while. Not good. This movie needed more of Batman. 2 Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox Reporter for the Gotham Globe. His scenes and especially his scenes with Vicki Vale bored me to tears. 3 Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon. I seriously could not believe that this pudgy man was the Commissioner. I've always been at a total loss why they could never find a man with silver hair and a mustache with glasses for the role. 4 Harvey Dent. I didn't mind Billy Dee Williams in the role. He did great. But I wish they could have brought him back as Two Face later on. 5 Mayor Borg. I could not stand this guy. Borg gets my vote as worst mayor of Gotham City. 6 Bob The head goon of the Joker. Something about him I didn't like. 7 While I love the Joker, I felt he upstaged Batman in this movie, but then again, all the villains did in the four films.In closing, I felt this was the best of the four films. Now comes the shocker. Batman The Movie can't hold a candle to the likes of the newest release, Batman Begins. In comparison, Tim Burton was good, but not nearly as good as Christopher Nolan with adapting Batman from his true comic book roots. So I feel that Batman The Movie is the second best Batfilm behind Batman Begins. And Michael Keaton is second best compared to the likes of Christian Bale.

And so the journey at the Moulin Rouge begins. And in a wave of familiar lyrical songs and laugh-out-loud jokes, you watch as a young, sensitive, handsome, penniless writer falls for a clever, sexy, Cortesan called Satine. It seems as though the only thing the two have in common is there singing talents and there desire for something greater. But things start to get a little more complicated than Christian thought when Satine is sold to the Duke in exchange for investments on their new play, and when Satine becomes deathly ill. What was a sweet and lighthearted romance turns into a desperate race for Satine's love, and overwhelming jealousy and a sense of ownership create a power on screen that becomes heart wrenching. Baz delivers a few powerful renditions of modern songs and delivered lines that make the audience gasp. Such as the scene where the Duke asks why the Cortesan shouldn't fall in love with the Maharajah. In an angry and frustrated rage Christian screams out BECAUSE SHE DOESNT LOVE YOU! Sending further suspicion that Christian and Satine are in love. The daring casting of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman give it an extra leap of faith that proves to be Spectacular! And the unexpected romantic aspects have ever female viewer in tears. But an extreme in opinion shows a serious viewing issue. Many who are spontaneous, passionate, and artistic will love this. The combination of the passionate love story, the wonderful music and art direction and the character's want of something greater is gripping. But the viewer has to be very opened minded.

I just melt over little people, and Willow waddling around clutching a baby over half his size just made me wanna go aaaaaaww! As coming from the age of CG and multi-million dollar effects budgets, I suppose I have been too spoiled to complain about how absolutely TERRIBLE the effects and costumes and several of the sets were, but I stuck it in there anyway. As per the acting, I have never been a huge fan of Val Kilmer and, while he got the nutter part right on, I thought every other aspect of his character was shallow and hardly played. *SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING, ALTHOUGH NOT PLOT RELEVANT* with regards to the rather, uh, RELUCTANT romance that took place between him and Sorsha, I was practically ready to JUMP OUT THE WINDOW to make it stop- HORRIBLE. In Warwick Davis' case, although he offered more depth of character than Kilmer, I found his voice- inflection, sincerity, etc- quite unbelievable, and his face never seemed to change expressions throughout practically the whole film- but I suppose allowances must be made for his age and inexperience- he was only 18 when the film was made. Now, I don't even KNOW what actors played the little fairy sidekicks, but they cracked me up more than absolutely anything! I suppose it would be a rather diminuative experience for a male to play a fairy, but they seemed to genuinely have fun doing it, and it showed.But oh, don't even get me STARTED on the script! It may have been low-budget and from the 80's, but to me there is NEVER an excuse for having a script THAT BAD. Perhaps time has made it more acute in my memory, but somehow in my head I keep hearing Willow shouting and Madmartigan, after he just saved his tiny butt from being killed by some form of ruffian or other, What were you thinking?! You NEVER drive that fast with an infant! *shudder* I suppose I can't FULLY blame Kilmer- I think Denzel Washington would be hard pressed with a script like that.When it came to aspects such as cinematography and music, there was nothing special or out of the ordinary. I also quite enjoyed the fact that all the outdoor scenes were actually OUT DOORS, something that was not done far too often in the 80's and earlier.While, from a critical and technical point of view this movie is nothing too great, it gets all its points on sheer charm and the genuine enjoyment one gets from such an innocent, sweet movie. Certainly more enjoyable if you're watching it with a bunch of your like-minded female friends, and a GREAT summer movie. Now, I know loyal fans will absolutely KILL me for saying this, but I really do hope someone will a remake of this film, with minimal to no plot changes, updated effects and IMPROVED script. The only problem with remakes is that you can't use the same actors, and that to me is the greatest loss.All around Definitely worth seeing as it is pretty much a classic, and definitely more worth it with your friends.

We may think of cuckoos as a cute wooden thing that comes out of a gingerbread clock and makes funny noises to announce the time, but that's because we are not birds. Real cuckoos are brood parasites. They lay eggs in the nests of other species of birds. The other birds fecklessly hatch them. And, man, are the cuckoo hatchlings ugly -- gray, featherless, sinewy things that immediately go about the business of rolling the other eggs out of the nest to get rid of the competition. They are born evil.In this movie the cuckoos are children. Their mothers were impregnated by -- well, by some kind of extraterrestrial infrared hypermolecular cosmological incubus. Anyway, all the women of Midwich become pregnant during a blackout period that encompasses the entire village for a few hours. It's chilling from the outset to see others try to enter the village and flop down as soon as they cross an invisible boundary.These kids aren't ugly though. They all have blond hair and magnetic eyes. And what one of them learns, the others know immediately. But handsome or not, they can immediately solve one of those Chinese-box puzzles in which you have to slide panels around, up and down, until you expose the inner drawer. It always takes me ten times as long as it take them.This is an intelligent science fiction thriller. Here are these dozen or so kids, who have powers beyond the natural and need no one except each other. Like autists they don't show any affection for anyone or indeed any emotion at all, unless determination is an emotion. Their biological mothers mean nothing to them, the supposed fathers even less. What they need is a good dose of what Rousseau called amour propre, love of self based on the opinions of others. It won't make them happy but they'll be less destructive. What they seem to want as they grow into preadolescents is to be left alone except for what tutoring George Sanders as the requisite professor can give them in earthly knowledge. They're mortal enough. An independent community of them has been destroyed in the USSR. And they're dangerous too. In three instances -- one accidental, two deliberate -- a villager almost kills some of them, and he dies the way he intended them to die.Why are they here on earth? Nobody knows. If the kids know, they're not telling. National leaders sit around in conferences wondering what to do with them. It's not easy to put a bunch of 10-year-olds in prison, let alone destroy them. It's not just morally difficult, it's practically difficult too because, after all, these kids can read the front part of everybody's mind. (They're working on the back rooms too.) Sanders proposes that the government give him a year to teach them in the local school and to study them, and the wish is granted.But eventually Sanders comes to realize that when they are grown the children will have all the power and knowledge they need to take over the entire world, and maybe that IS their goal. They show nothing in the way of humane impulses. If they only kill when they are threatened, well that can change as soon as they pick up some of the values of the world they're now living in. Yes -- ruthless fascist dictators seem about the right slots for them. I can't readily visualize them as Gestalt psychotherapists.Sanders decides that they have to go, but it's a problem because, although he's about the only person in the village they feel any trust for, they can also read his intentions. And naturally if he succeeds in ridding the world of these kids, he must go with them because, really, how can you murder these beautiful intelligent children and go on living with yourself. In order to accomplish his goal, he must think of nothing but a brick wall, so they can't read his mind. But they are suspicious and their collective power begins to cause the brick wall to crumble -- too late.I said this was a low-budget flick and it is. There are hardly any special effects to speak of. The production couldn't even afford to pay a stunt man for a full body burn. The performances are fine, but the direction is no more than efficient, and the art direction and photography project a chilly and grimy atmosphere which seems to have occurred naturally.I also said it was intelligent and it is. It's not exactly a horror flick because it has no monsters or murderers and it's not exactly science fiction in the usual sense because it takes place in the present and there isn't a robot in sight. What it does is use improbable events to pose a series of important moral questions. Nobody would argue that these kids are likable. And maybe their Daddies were nothing more than a shower of golden coins or a stream of photons. But they look human and in many ways act it. They don't want to die -- they know about mortality.They certainly DO seem dangerous but they haven't done anything irredeemably evil yet. Sanders decides that there's nothing wrong with them that a darn good blowing up wouldn't cure and we applaud when he manages to carry out his plan. But he's making an awful lot of questionable assumptions. Do they deserve to be killed en masse? Would YOU kill them all?

The film is dark and grainy, the characters are too broadly drawn, and there are some disgusting acts of violence. There are a couple good shootouts however, and it's always nice to see Bronson dish out his own brand of justice.Our story picks up a few years after the events of part one. Bronson has relocated in Los Angeles and is working as an architect and currently redesigning a radio station building. His daughter is living close by in an institution. She is still greatly disturbed by her traumatic rape in the last film. She can venture out in public under the supervision of her father, but she still cannot speak. On one such trip, Bronson, his daughter, and his girlfriend (Ireland) get into an altercation with a gang of five muggers. The muggers steal Bronson's wallet and find out where he lives. They then show up at his place and... help the maid prepare dinner.Well, that isn't quite what happens. This is a Michael Winner film, and nobody does rape scenes like Michael Winner. In one of the most shocking scenes ever found in a mainstream film, the house keeper is repeatedly raped be these creeps. Depending on the version you see, the rape lasts from only a couple minutes to nearly fifteen minutes! This film has been cut to ribbons by editors over the years as each station has their own idea of just how much of it they want to show you. Anyway, Bronson and his daughter eventually show up at the house where he is beaten and left for dead while his daughter is kidnapped by the punks. In another tasteless scene, his mute and helpless daughter is also raped and then jumps to a gruesome death from a window. I think that scene is really a lot worse than the housekeeper scene.Of course you know where we're headed. Bronson goes on the war path and tracks these five creeps and their associates down and blows them away. Not only are there some neat shootouts, but also a few good one-liners along the way. If you can get through the brutality of the first half hour, you will enjoy seeing Bronson do what he does best.Bronson's performance is calm and dignified like always. There are two outstanding supporting performances by Vincent Gardenia and Jill Ireland. They share a wonderful scene together as Gardenia (hot on Bronson's trail like in part one) questions Ireland about Bronson's whereabouts at night. He also informs her of Bronson's history of killing muggers in the Big Apple which leads to a hilarious scene between Bronson and Ireland later on. And YES... that is THE Laurence Fishburne as one of the muggers. He's the one Bronson shoots in the head through a radio. You'll have to see it to understand what I'm referring to.One may be tempted to defend this film by saying that yeah, it's pretty nasty, but so is real life crime! I won't deny that, but I don't buy the argument here. This film with its broad caricatures of street hoods, and no less than three sexual assaults is really just a piece of exploitation. The film does have its good moments, and apparently enough of them for it to gross 16 million dollars and spawn several more sequels. But Death Wish II is really not going to impress anyone who isn't a rabid fan of Charles Bronson. I would strongly urge anyone and everyone to take a look at part 3, though! That film is an absolute blast! 5 of 10 for Death Wish II. So sayeth the Hound.

I won't deny that, but I don't buy the argument here. This film with its broad caricatures of street hoods, and no less than three sexual assaults is really just a piece of exploitation. The film does have its good moments, and apparently enough of them for it to gross 16 million dollars and spawn several more sequels. But Death Wish II is really not going to impress anyone who isn't a rabid fan of Charles Bronson. I would strongly urge anyone and everyone to take a look at part 3, though! That film is an absolute blast! 5 of 10 for Death Wish II. So sayeth the Hound.

So it works for the youngins. As an adult, and an animation fan, I was surprised to learn that this movie is sort of the Disney studio's secret shame. I had nothing but fond memories of it, after all. And I could name at least a dozen Disney films that I would have put ahead of it on my Most Crappy list. I very recently watched it on television after many years, and yes, it is definitely flawed. The quality of the animation is terrible, and the lack of an over arching story makes the whole thing seem frivolous, like it was made for TV and not for a big studio release. There are holes in the narrative, scenes that should exist that don't, and scenes that have no reason to exist that do. And I think the somewhat random decision to cast the film with animals lends to the Saturday morning vibe as well.But there's enough cool things peaking out from under all the half-assery that rescues the film just enough for it to be enjoyable. Peter Ustinov turns in an excellent, excellent performance as Prince John, at turns hysterical and genuinely nasty. Brian Bedford oozes easy going charm as Robin. He's probably turned in the second most likable performance of the character captured on film. He's just unfortunately delivering it through the poorly animated mouth of a cartoon fox. And though the actual quality of the animation is poor, some of the character animation is pretty clever and expressive. And I have to applaud the choice to add Roger Miller to the mix as a folkie, possibly pot-smoking minstrel rooster. His character adds a cool, Earthy vibe to the proceedings and as others have mentioned, his song, Not in Nottingham, actually sort of works as a blues song. Weird.So Robin Hood is definitely not the epic tale Disney was capable of churning out in its hey days, but I dug it as a kid, and I still dig it today.

I like this remake of The Haunting better than I like Robert Wise's 1963 version of the film. However, the discrepancy between the two in my eyes on this viewing is nowhere near my last viewing in 1999, when I felt the remake was a 10 and the original a 6. My opinion of the original has gone up slightly, to a 7, and my opinion of this film has gone down two points, to an 8.Still, I can't see how someone can like the original film a lot and dislike this remake. There are more things about them that are similar than most folks admit. A lot of the negative views on the remake seem centered on CGI and other special effects. I think that puts a disproportionate emphasis on one element of the film, and it's not as if the Wise film was really devoid of effects, although I agree it had far less.Most folks think the original is scary and this one isn't. Maybe that's part of the problem. I don't think any films are scary and I never have. Fear is just not an emotion I can get from films.Like the 1963 film, the focus here is on Eleanor (Lili Taylor). The premise is basically the same, if some of the details have been changed. An academic researcher, Dr. David Morrow (Liam Neeson), wants to study the fear response, especially as it relates to group interaction. Morrow poses a ruse to get research subjects. He says he's going to be doing an insomnia study. He draws a few participants, including Eleanor, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson), to a huge old mansion--more like a palace--called Hill House. He invents a story based on the true one (per the film's world) about the history of Hill House and plants the juiciest details with Luke, along with an instruction to keep quiet about it lest he scare Theo and Eleanor. Of course, Luke blabs, and soon afterward, spooky things begin happening. But is Dr. Morrow behind the strange occurrences or is there really something supernatural going on at Hill House? What will happen if the participants discover the truth behind Dr. Morrow's experiment? And why does Dr. Morrow, or whoever is behind the haunting, appear to be picking on Eleanor? Director Jan de Bont gives strong nods to the original film in the remake's script, and he even goes so far as to recreate performances, specific shots and sequences. The strongest recreation of a performance is a minor one--Marian Seldes' Mrs. Dudley, who delivers the infamous speech about the rules of the house and her and her husband's caretaking habits with almost identical dialogue and intonation as Rosalie Crutchley's Mrs. Dudley in Wise's film. But all of the principal cast members are directed to give performances close in tone and disposition to those in the original. Sequences such as Eleanor and Theo running to each other as they experience strange sounds and something trying to enter their rooms are almost identical to the original, with de Bont taking great care to block infamous shots so that they're the same as the beloved Wise film. Other sequences, such as the sudden presence of cold, are changed in structure a bit, but retain the spirit of Wise. This is all evidence that despite the reputation of the de Bont film, it is much closer in tone--even with its strong emphasis on things only heard or glimpsed out of the corner of one's eye--to the Wise film than almost anyone admits.Of course, this version of The Haunting does have differences. De Bont was not shooting for a Gus Van Sant-styled recreation, ala Psycho (1998), after all. De Bont dispenses with Eleanor's narration (which I've always found annoying in the original), shoots in color, and goes bonkers on production design, cinematography and yes, special effects and CGI. Personally, I prefer going bonkers on production design and cinematography. On both of those ends, The Haunting easily deserves a 10. The sets are breathtaking, beautiful, bizarre and stunningly shot--the exterior of the house, too. I also like the special effects and CGI, but it may be important to remember that I'm not someone looking primarily for realism in films. To me, it's absurd to watch a film about the supernatural expecting realism, anyway. But that's because in real life, I'm a skeptic on all of this stuff. To me, this is a fantasy, as is the Wise film, and I welcome fantastical, surreal (read non-realistic) imagery.However, unlike the first time watching the remake, I felt that The Haunting had flaws this time around. Maybe I didn't notice them in the theater because I was so floored by the beautiful visuals projected larger than life. The problem is that the story and the dialogue become gobbledy-gooky. There are a lot of non-sequiturs in the plot. Characters disappear for arbitrary lengths of time. Eleanor figures out mysteries that should require complicated sleuth-work without much information to the viewer about how she did it. Characters say things to each other that seem like necessary foundational exposition was edited out. On the other hand, the Wise film wasn't exactly free of these problems, either.And the focus here isn't primarily on a tightly woven story in the vein of a mystery flick, anyway. The focus is on atmosphere--a rich tapestry of visuals and sound, where the actors are just one element, all meant to evoke moods. The film tends to be more poetic in this regard.

This film makes Reservoir Dogs look like Bambi. Sure, there are more cringeworthy movies (Audition, Ai No Corrida), but these set out to merely shock, not entertain. And Man Bites Dog almost dares you not to laugh. In this way, it is very much like a Bill Hicks sketch take an uncomfortable premise like abortion (or, in the film, rape, robbery and murder) and see if you can get the audience to laugh at it, then turn up the violence a notch, and make you feel uncomfortable and guilty for having laughed in the first place. The story is of a low-ranking, no-good-for-anyone, semi-intelligent self-taught philosopher, whom we join somewhere along his killing spree. We, the viewers, do this by looking through the lens of a camera crew, who are following the killer's every move. The killer has a dubious moral conscience he sees himself as a modern-day Robin Hood, except that his justifications for his acts ring hollow and arbitrary, and he is not exactly kind to those to whom he redistributes his ill-gain wealth (which, hilariously, includes the film crew, who have run out of money to buy more film stock; the killer thus becomes the financier of the movie). As the film crew become more and more involved, they implicate themselves, and you start asking yourself how it is that this movie is ever going to be released (which it must have been, since we are watching it). It draws on the same kind of paranoia as, say, Dostoevky or Kafka. As the whole project comes off the rails, we witness a brutal rape scene, and even I found myself thinking - was this really necessary? Then I realize that I have been caught out by the film I am editorializing, and have become the fourth member of the film crew, thereby giving up any last semblance of distance from the events, and becoming more than a voyeur - a participant in the acts the film portrays. And herein lies the film's true genius it is exactly what it is, nothing more, nothing less. It looks shaky and grainy, because it was made by a bunch of film students with no money. The sound is crappy because of the same reason. You feel you are following a murderer, because you are (oh, no, of course not, he is an actor, I have to keep reminding myself). In a way, it is reminiscent of the Blair With Project, but whereas there was no point to that film, there is to this one. Namely, it questions our voyeuristic nature, in the process blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction, good and bad, complicity and responsibility, and does this by getting under your skin, reaming some gashes, and then dare you not to pick at the scabs.

The killer has a dubious moral conscience he sees himself as a modern-day Robin Hood, except that his justifications for his acts ring hollow and arbitrary, and he is not exactly kind to those to whom he redistributes his ill-gain wealth (which, hilariously, includes the film crew, who have run out of money to buy more film stock; the killer thus becomes the financier of the movie). As the film crew become more and more involved, they implicate themselves, and you start asking yourself how it is that this movie is ever going to be released (which it must have been, since we are watching it). It draws on the same kind of paranoia as, say, Dostoevky or Kafka. As the whole project comes off the rails, we witness a brutal rape scene, and even I found myself thinking - was this really necessary? Then I realize that I have been caught out by the film I am editorializing, and have become the fourth member of the film crew, thereby giving up any last semblance of distance from the events, and becoming more than a voyeur - a participant in the acts the film portrays. And herein lies the film's true genius it is exactly what it is, nothing more, nothing less. It looks shaky and grainy, because it was made by a bunch of film students with no money. The sound is crappy because of the same reason. You feel you are following a murderer, because you are (oh, no, of course not, he is an actor, I have to keep reminding myself). In a way, it is reminiscent of the Blair With Project, but whereas there was no point to that film, there is to this one. Namely, it questions our voyeuristic nature, in the process blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction, good and bad, complicity and responsibility, and does this by getting under your skin, reaming some gashes, and then dare you not to pick at the scabs.

I find it completely unwatchable; 2. It is darkly-funniest movie ever made. Another promise I can make without hesitation is that you won't be able to watch this movie without cringing. This film makes Reservoir Dogs look like Bambi. Sure, there are more cringeworthy movies (Audition, Ai No Corrida), but these set out to merely shock, not entertain. And Man Bites Dog almost dares you not to laugh. In this way, it is very much like a Bill Hicks sketch take an uncomfortable premise like abortion (or, in the film, rape, robbery and murder) and see if you can get the audience to laugh at it, then turn up the violence a notch, and make you feel uncomfortable and guilty for having laughed in the first place.
