We probably haven't seen the last of them, or given the real story.The plot at times reaches for credibility. For example, the character of Gestapo Inpector Gruber is played brilliantly by Alexander Granach. For once, WWII anti-nazi movies gave us a real Nazi who was smart and does solve the case, but not in time to save his life. In real life, I doubt whether a real Gestapo Inspector would ever go anywhere without the comfort of a few armed men. The writers would have us believe that so many ordinary people could stick to the same concocted story without making an error, or taking a bribe to test the credibility of their plot to cast the informer as the assassin.Gene Lockhart proves he can act as he plays the informer. He plays the role two ways- a devious and ambitious man willing to sell out his friends, and as a pathetic victim of his own doing.Brian Dunnleavy plays the assassin who struggles with himself knowing that his act has caused the shooting of hostages. He wants to give himself up, but is convinced that it would be a futile gesture. Anna Lee plays the daughter of one of the Hostages, and she originally goes to the Gestapo to trade her knowledge of the assassin for her Father's life. On the way, the ordinary citizens try to stop her, and her conversion to helping the Czech cause begins to overide her attempt to save her father's life.This film was one of many that were made during the War. Without major stars, it could never have won the acclaim that Casablanca won. Whereas Casablanca is filled with stereotypes, this film doesn't show every Nazi as a idiot. Inspector Gruber is a worthy opponent of the underground. As a cop, he was pretty good, at the same time he was playing the typical Nazi rotten human being.Considering that that the Nazi's were in power from 1932 to 1945, and the Soviet Occupation of Czechoslavakia was three times longer, one has to wonder why there haven't been three times as many films portraying them as the unwanted dictators of their country.

At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.After two droids crash-land on the desert planet of Tatooine, they are immediately captured and sold to a young farm boy called Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who desperately wants to leave the rock he lives on with his aunt and uncle. While fixing one of the droids, he finds a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Luke finds Kenobi, a hermit living in the mountains, who tells Luke of his family history. His father was a Jedi knight, killed by the evil Darth Vader and now Kenobi decides it is time to teach him the way of the Force. After Luke finds his family's home destroyed by stormtroopers looking for the two droids, they decide to find their way to another planet. They enlist the help of space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who decides to give them a lift. On the way, they find the Death Star, a giant space station run by Darth Vader, with the ability to destroy any planet of the solar system. Now, they must enter the Death Star, find and rescue the Princess and destroy the station before it produces anymore harm.George Lucas has been criticised for his so-called lack of direction and screen writing abilities, but I don't think most people can deny that Star Wars packs a mean punch in terms of solid entertainment. While Star Wars is playing, all eyes are on the screen savouring every delicious moment, whether it be a fantastic lightsaber duel or a quiet scene between Luke and Obi-Wan. The visual effects (including those in the special editions) are seriously some of the best in motion picture history as they manage to make the viewer believe they're in space, surrounded by various creatures and flying ships. Lucas has gotten a lot of negative criticism for the fact that he believes that the updated version of Star Wars is the ultimate way to see the film, but I don't mind. The special effects are better and they certainly do add to the experience. Greedo shooting first? It's such a quick, minor scene that goes by at such a fast rate, that I don't really mind. I understand where the die-hard fans are coming from, but for the casual viewer, it's practically nothing. Adding to the impressive technical delight of Star Wars as well is John Williams's magnificent score, the best in any Hollywood film. I seriously don't think the film would be as highly regarded as it is, if it wasn't for the fantastic music. I seriously would probably enjoy the film even less without it.Yet, I think the lasting appeal of Star Wars has to be the characters. Every child growing up wants to be like Luke Skywalker, the young Jedi who just wants to save the universe from possible destruction.

Whether it's The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra or Beethoven, music plays an important part in inspiring people. When writing, I like to listen to music, specifically classical pieces. One of the best classical composers was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose life is brought to the screen in Milos Forman's Amadeus. Well, not all of his life as most of what is portrayed in the film never actually happened in real life. That is not a flaw of the film, however, as Peter Shaffer manages to still create a fascinating story that keeps us gripped throughout the three hour running time. Forman recently released the Director's Cut on DVD, adding about twenty minutes of new footage and it surprisingly enough, improves the theatrical version that graced cinema screens and won eight Academy Awards in 1984. This is the version of Amadeus more worthy of being in your DVD collection.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a court composer in Vienna, is excited about the arrival of his musical idol since childhood, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). However, much to Salieri's shock, Mozart turns out to be a vulgar, immature creature who just happens to be blessed with the power to produce beautiful music. Salieri soon watches his world change as he realises that his own music isn't so great when compared to the impressive operas that Mozart churns out. After watching Mozart mock him at a party, Salieri decides that he must do away with him somehow and take his revenge on God, who he has since declared his enemy for giving the beautiful gift of music to a vulgar, little man with an annoying laugh.Milos Forman and Petter Shaffer created a masterpiece with Amadeus, a startling portrayal of two different men thrust together. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for their performances and they both give their characters the right tone. Mozart is a fun individual who surprises people with his impressive music despite his personality (and obnoxious laugh), but is soon going to deeper into debt and alcoholism. Hulce portrays Mozart's nuances so perfectly and Abraham is just as terrific. One of the main reasons that Amadeus is such a terrific film is the fact that when things do not go Salieri's way, we are just as upset as he is, because we feel for his pain. Mozart provides Amadeus with comic relief, while Salieri provides it with torturing pain. That's just how good the performances, script and direction allow these characters work, especially in their final scenes together.The supporting players are also integral to the plot as well, though. Jeffrey Jones is almost comical as an emperor with an attention span of two hours and requests Mozart to cut a few notes from his operas. Catherine Berridge is the actor in the film given the most opportunity to shine thanks to the Director's Cut. Forman looks deeper into the character of Mozart's wife, Constanze and she is given a much more important role than in the theatrical version and there is even bigger reason as to why she is shocked to see Salieri in Mozart's room at the time of his death. And of course, I would be crazy of me not to mention the glorious sets, costumes and makeup effects that are so important in bringing 1700's Vienna to life. This is one of the best films to come out of American cinema and a treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music. In fact, those who are fans will be very happy with Warner's remastered soundtrack of the film which booms through the speakers and you feel as if you yourself is in one of the opera palaces with Salieri and Mozart.

Forman recently released the Director's Cut on DVD, adding about twenty minutes of new footage and it surprisingly enough, improves the theatrical version that graced cinema screens and won eight Academy Awards in 1984. This is the version of Amadeus more worthy of being in your DVD collection.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a court composer in Vienna, is excited about the arrival of his musical idol since childhood, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). However, much to Salieri's shock, Mozart turns out to be a vulgar, immature creature who just happens to be blessed with the power to produce beautiful music. Salieri soon watches his world change as he realises that his own music isn't so great when compared to the impressive operas that Mozart churns out. After watching Mozart mock him at a party, Salieri decides that he must do away with him somehow and take his revenge on God, who he has since declared his enemy for giving the beautiful gift of music to a vulgar, little man with an annoying laugh.Milos Forman and Petter Shaffer created a masterpiece with Amadeus, a startling portrayal of two different men thrust together. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for their performances and they both give their characters the right tone. Mozart is a fun individual who surprises people with his impressive music despite his personality (and obnoxious laugh), but is soon going to deeper into debt and alcoholism. Hulce portrays Mozart's nuances so perfectly and Abraham is just as terrific. One of the main reasons that Amadeus is such a terrific film is the fact that when things do not go Salieri's way, we are just as upset as he is, because we feel for his pain. Mozart provides Amadeus with comic relief, while Salieri provides it with torturing pain. That's just how good the performances, script and direction allow these characters work, especially in their final scenes together.The supporting players are also integral to the plot as well, though. Jeffrey Jones is almost comical as an emperor with an attention span of two hours and requests Mozart to cut a few notes from his operas. Catherine Berridge is the actor in the film given the most opportunity to shine thanks to the Director's Cut. Forman looks deeper into the character of Mozart's wife, Constanze and she is given a much more important role than in the theatrical version and there is even bigger reason as to why she is shocked to see Salieri in Mozart's room at the time of his death. And of course, I would be crazy of me not to mention the glorious sets, costumes and makeup effects that are so important in bringing 1700's Vienna to life. This is one of the best films to come out of American cinema and a treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music. In fact, those who are fans will be very happy with Warner's remastered soundtrack of the film which booms through the speakers and you feel as if you yourself is in one of the opera palaces with Salieri and Mozart.

Whether it's The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra or Beethoven, music plays an important part in inspiring people. When writing, I like to listen to music, specifically classical pieces.

I'm not going to comment on why this part of the world has been so long plagued by such violence and repression; that's up to sociologists. Although things as they stand in 2007 are no where near as bad as they have been, there are still completely wild areas in the America's (parts of Columbia are in anarchy with rebel groups still fighting a very long war). Central America saw some of the most brutal and repressive civil wars and regimes. Guatamala and El Salvador saw exceptionally horrible levels of death and destruction. El Salvador, which this film depicts, was in the throes of yet another wave of civil disorder, pitting the large and very poor underclass against the small numbers of privileged upper class with predictable results. The army was used as a brutal and murderous machine, acting out the dark ideas of the right wing. The US aided the right wing because US foreign policy blindly labeled all rebellious groups in the America's as Communist insurgents and worked overtime to eliminate them. That's the backdrop to this film.The murder of Archbishop Romero was but the beginning of a ten year civil war that saw over 50,000 deaths in El Salvador. The film is hard on the nerves to watch as all depictions of depravity and death are. The actors have put their best into this important film.

In short, by the tragic end, we are emotionally drained and very upset, as we should be.

First he kills a couple of men working for gang leader Doyle (David Patrick Kelly) & is promptly hired by Doyle's rival gang leader Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg), he calls himself 'John Smith' & begins to play the two gangs off each other as he passes information along which will make him lots of money. However Smith becomes too involved & as the situation spirals out of control just about everyone wants him dead...Written, produced & directed by Walter Hill I thought Last Man Standing was an average & fairly forgettable action\/western remake of Yojimbo (1961) & A Fistful of Dollars (1964). The script which takes itself very seriously is alright but it could have used more action, as it is it feels long & drawn out without much happening. You know I'm not really that sure who Last Man Standing is meant to appeal to, it has elements of drama, action, romance, western & thriller without actually settling down & concentrating on one particular genre. It's a bit messy & while it tries to be several things it ends up being nothing in particular. The film features a constant narration by Willis' character which saves the need for a lot of dull exposition heavy dialogue I suppose but it's flatly written as is the whole film really. To be fair to it it's watchable but nothing special, in fact I only saw it a few hours ago & I can barely remember it. I wasn't convinced by some of the plot either, I mean why would these gangs give Willis' character so much information when basically they didn't know him? Why did they trust him so much & fall for every lie hook, line & sinker? The ease with which Willis play the two gangs off each other just seemed far too easy to me.Director Hill does alright but the few action scenes are very brief & not exciting in the slightest, then there's the pacing problem because it does drag in places & there's not much variety in the plot either. I also didn't like the decision to film everything in a brown\/orange sepia tone, everything just looks dusty, dirty & very dull with little detail. To be fair the period recreation is well done & it looks the business but, well, I still didn't like it that much. The violence is tame with little blood, there's some nudity including Willis' bare bum if that's your thing.With a supposed budget of about $67,000,000 Last Man Standing tanked at the box-office & you can understand why, I'm not really sure who it was meant to appeal to. It's well made for sure with high production values although the annoying brown tone makes things a little muddy & hard to make out. The acting is OK, I really like Bruce Willis & he's made some great films although why he chose to do this is beyond me, luckily he got back on track with his next film The Fifth Element (1997). The great Christopher Walken is wasted in nothing more than a cameo role while Ned Eisenberg has recovered from a homicidal maniac shoving a pair of garden shears into his throat in the classic slasher The Burning (1981).Last man Standing is an OK time waster, it's nothing special & I can see why it bombed at the box-office.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"5 July 2007","score":"11 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" The silent film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the October Revolution of 1917. Ironically the film's director, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on socialist realism. Influenced by the Russian film theoretician, Lev Kuleshov, and through him by D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein constructed his films from a collision of rapidly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length, motion, content, lighting, and camera angle. Without question the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the Odessa Steps sequence in Potemkin.In structure Potemkin is a five reeler divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama. In Men and Maggots, Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship's working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny. Even before the sailors and their upper class officers\/masters are visually introduced, Eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea. Onboard ship we witness crowded, unsanitary conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the sailors' dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, harsh labor, and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal. The ship's nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the sailors' rage. In accordance with Marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from The Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (in perhaps the first deliberate jump cut in cinema history).Identified by inter-titles as Drama on the Quarterdeck and An Appeal from the Dead, Potemkin's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution, Vakulinchuk. United by Vakulinchuk's appeals to brotherhood, the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers. A chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by Eisenstein's editing techniques. The officers' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot-ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelet without breaking eggs) and he is laid out with dignity on an Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge Death to the oppressors. Shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness.The complex and unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act. It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, eyeglasses, baby carriage). Suddenly (as exclaims a title card in huge letters) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting Cossacks below. The mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for Russia's oppressive institutions tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church.Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter's first victims. The boy is shot, but the mother continues running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd. With a much slowed editing pace, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They summarily shoot her dead. After this lull, the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach (the womb of Mother Russia?) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage. In a scene famously imitated in The Untouchables, the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase. Horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom.

Ironically the film's director, Sergei Eisenstein, was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art. Subsequently, Eisenstein's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on socialist realism. Influenced by the Russian film theoretician, Lev Kuleshov, and through him by D. W. Griffith's Intolerance (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein constructed his films from a collision of rapidly edited images, a montage of shots varied in length, motion, content, lighting, and camera angle. Without question the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the Odessa Steps sequence in Potemkin.In structure Potemkin is a five reeler divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama. In Men and Maggots, Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship's working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny. Even before the sailors and their upper class officers\/masters are visually introduced, Eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea. Onboard ship we witness crowded, unsanitary conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the sailors' dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings, harsh labor, and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening's meal. The ship's nearsighted physician is brought forward by the other officers to declare the meat perfectly suitable to be served with the dark soup, boiling like the sailors' rage. In accordance with Marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see one of them smashing a plate inscribed with words from The Lord's Prayer from two different camera angles (in perhaps the first deliberate jump cut in cinema history).Identified by inter-titles as Drama on the Quarterdeck and An Appeal from the Dead, Potemkin's second and third parts depict the actual mutiny and the onshore funeral of its leader and first hero of the revolution, Vakulinchuk. United by Vakulinchuk's appeals to brotherhood, the initial mutineers are joined by the entire crew in an attack on the officers. A chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by Eisenstein's editing techniques. The officers' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot-ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the revolt (no omelet without breaking eggs) and he is laid out with dignity on an Odessa pier. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge Death to the oppressors. Shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness.The complex and unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence constitutes the film's fourth act. It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects (parasol, eyeglasses, baby carriage). Suddenly (as exclaims a title card in huge letters) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps. Here Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting Cossacks below. The mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for Russia's oppressive institutions tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church.Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children. In the first, a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter's first victims. The boy is shot, but the mother continues running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son's fallen body being trampled by the crowd. With a much slowed editing pace, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown only in a diagonal shadow line). They summarily shoot her dead. After this lull, the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach (the womb of Mother Russia?) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage. In a scene famously imitated in The Untouchables, the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase. Horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom.

Even Chief Dan George, as Old Lodge Skins, the best developed character here, often comes across as merely a lovable schlemiel.

It either makes them feel that they are missing out on the essence of the film because they do not understand the language being spoken, or they simply don't want to be forced to read in order understand what's going on. For those who share that opinion, it's quite a shame because this is one fantastic film that you will be missing. Being the son of an Argentine-born parent, I more or less understand a lot of the Spanish spoken by the characters in this film, though I am in no way fluent. As you watch this film though, you almost forget that the subtitles are there. You can miss a few lines of dialog and still have a good grasp of exactly what's going on. This is due mainly to the two starring actors in the film who were absolutely incredible. First, Ricardo Darin, is nothing short of brilliant. He's a well-known actor in Argentina and has such an incredibly natural on-screen presence that you can't help but be captivated by his performance. He plays the role of a professional con-man to perfection, combining his dramatic and comedic skills to form an equally villainous as well as sympathetic character. Secondly, his counterpart Gaston Pauls is equally brilliant as Darin's baby-faced accomplice in what is to be a one in a million opportunity to swindle a wealthy businessman out of a small fortune. I've seen the American version Criminal - 2004, which is also good, but does not really do justice to the original. Nine Queens is a brilliant piece of international film-making that will not disappoint any fan of the genre. As mentioned by a reviewer, there is absolutely zero down time in this film. The dialog is crisp, the characters are very well cast and there is no time wasted with any unnecessary filler or elongated scenes. Every word and every scene builds a bridge to the next and culminates with a surprising and satisfying ending that you definitely will not be expecting. Please, don't let the language barrier prevent you from seeing this film. It's very easy to follow and well worth the small effort required. 10\/10.

Connery and Baldwin deliver magnificent performances as the Russian naval captain and a CIA analyst, respectively. Jack Ryan (Baldwin) finds himself in the middle of a potential prelude to global nuclear war as the seemingly insane Captain Marco Ramius (Connery) steers the Red October toward the United States, supposedly as a hostile move.Running slightly over two hours in length, Red October perfectly captures the state of tension between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. as the suspense never lifts from the film. The directing style is very effective in depicting the fears of impending warfare against foreign and new weapons, and the fears of the individuals who try to prevent it. The moody lighting alone portrays these fears beautifully. The score by Basil Poledouris is superb, using both Russian lyrics and various submarine sounds to envelop the viewer in the lives of those who must ask men to risk their lives in close spaces underwater. Supporting cast members including Scott Glenn, James Earl Jones, and Sam Neill reflect very well on the roles of both Baldwin and Connery by acting as foils to round out the other two characters and to emphasize the fact that the characters are complex individuals, not a mass of good vs. evil or the United States vs. the Soviet Union.While the technical and naval jargon and outdated technology may put off some viewers, it is easily one of the best movies of the past fifty years. Utilizing the talents of several big-name stars, Red October will continue to be an excellent example of how political thrillers should be done not with fancy explosions and half-baked explanations for characters' actions, but with heart and tone indicating that the stars of the film are the characters and the plot, not the special effects which Hollywood has become addicted to in order to draw in audiences.
