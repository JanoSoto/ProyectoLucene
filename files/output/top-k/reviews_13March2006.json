This movie was action packed to an extreme. Usually Bond movies slow down a bit to build up the tension but we get none of that here. Bond is in Las Vegas and the location is used to its every advantage. The redhead that is Tiffany Case plays a good tough girl with that high maintenance touch. Connery delivers twice as many one-liners as before giving this movie a comedic touch. Blofed is a very powerful villain and he is one of the best Bond villains to date. This movie also gives us the somewhat legendary henchmen of Mr. Wynt and Mr. Kidd. They provide some classic moments when they face Bond and when they finish each others puns and old sayings. They truly made this film the comedic masterpiece that it is. This movie took a different turn with more comedy and more action while still keeping the plot together. That is what I find fun about this movie. Bambi and Thumper are 2 vixens who know how to put up a great action sequence. Connery sadly looks older in this movie than I expected. He looks like he is 45 and I was shocked to find out he was only 40. I also think Connery might have soiled his reputation by returning for an huge sum of money. Plenty O'Toole was a pointless character that didn't even deserve ANY screen time. Overall if you've always wanted to see Bond with a little more action then I think this is the Bond movie for you. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2006","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In this thriller of a James Bond movie we get the return of Sean Connery after skipping a movie.

I just love films and I would like to sincerely thank everyone who reads me as a reviewer and all the input and emails I have received over the years. I do appreciate getting feedback and I love talking films. That being said I thought long and hard about what I was going to do the big 300th review on and I thought it only fair that I do the sequel to one of my favorite big screen adaptations and characters and the sequel to the film I reviewed for my 200th review.Superman II was the follow up to the original classic film that opened in 1978. It was only two years later but the origins of the story had come and gone with the original and the writers and director were likely faced with an even bigger challenge and that was creating an entirely new adventure for the man of steel. Smart move and fortunately for them that the original cast all returned, every single one of them. Although I think casting was not entirely perfect for this series it's still not good to replace character in the middle of a franchise when audiences have become comfortable with them. In many ways and opinions Superman II nearly or does exceed the greatness of the original. A True war raging between Kryptonians on Earth with super powers, the blossoming of one of the great romances in history, and a new and original story about an age old classic hero.Christopher Reeve returns to his role as Superman and Clark Kent. His emotions and very human side are much more explored in this sequel as he struggles with the decision to give up his super powers in exchange for the love of his life...Lois Lane. Reeve is still the absolutely perfect choice for this role. He still remains the man of steel. His powerful presence both as Superman and his bumbling, well maintained alter ego is perfect. Margot Kidder also returns as Lois Lane. She's never been my favorite choice for Lois Lane but as I re-watch these films my opinion of her performance grows and Superman II certainly helps that. She shows more of an emotional side, and we get to see her deep feeling for the Man Of Steel. She's still brash and forward and strong willed but definitely softens the image for the romance to take place. The real stars and stand out performances of the film are the villains who truly encompass the meaning of an adversary, arch nemesis or villain. General Zod played by Terence Stamp (who just for interesting facts now is the voice of Jor-El, Superman's Father on Smallville) plays the absolutely perfect Super Villain. He is downright insane with power and desperate to rule the world. He also perfectly portrays a Kryptonian completely unfamiliar with Earth and it's cultures. He's brutal and unforgiving and his battle with Superman is edge of your seat. His followers are the horribly cruel Ursa played by Sarah Douglas. As the only female villain in the film she holds her own against all the testosterone and perhaps has the cruelest look to her out of all of them. She also seems to be the one who holds her own the most against the Man of Steel. Finally Jack O'Halloran plays the silent and very deadly Non. His brute strength and lack of brains make him the perfect (and not campy) sidekick to Zod. Together the three of them are some of the best Film villains in history and their knock down battle across Metropolis is without a doubt a highlight in the Superman series. Also returning (although not with much fanfare, and apparently didn't actually return at all) is the wonderful Gene Hackman but never really so wonderful in the role of Lex Luthor. The writers always made Luthor more of a comedy break which doesn't make sense to me but the plus side to Superman II is that they eliminated the sidekick of Otis who was a complete joke to the entire original film. Apparently Hackman's role was created using look a-likes, stand ins and voice overs. If that is true they actually did a very good job and explains a lot of Luthor's toned down part. They did bring Ned Beatty as Otis back briefly for a cameo but left him behind in order to make a far more serious film which was a welcome change. Hackman's Luthor was much more tolerable and effective without all the bumbling and errors.Superman II went through many, many changes and problems and law suits and everything else. Brando who got top billing for his very brief cameo in the first film caused so many issues with the second that his already filmed parts were pulled altogether from the sequel. No loss in quality there because as great as Brando is his role as Jor-El is very small. Original director who was more than ready to film the sequel Richard Donner was replaced after filming a lot of scenes already. He was replaced with Richard Lester who I think still got a lot of help and ideas from Donner's original ideas for the film. However it was done it was done very well and turned out to be even better than the original. Still, for nowadays it might seem a little campy, and the acting isn't entirely on par but for what it was then and still today is the only big screen adaptation of The Man of Steel it's a great movie and a classic in it's own right.

He's a big name in theater! Well, I'd be lying if I claimed that I didn't, throughout watching this film, often thought to myself Mr. Brook, I do believe you should have stayed in your own field. I do now, though, acknowledge his talent. The film opens with a bold and unusual(as far as I know; I haven't seen too many films of this period, so it may, in actuality be common practice of the era) choice of narrating events, which I found refreshing and surprisingly effective(though if the less-than-pleased grunts I heard from around are any indication, I was in the minority). The film has an interesting plot, though that may be more indicative of William Golding's insight than that of Brook... I'd have to read the novel itself to determine. Before I proceed; I've heard that there is a colorized and re-cut version of this film... the version I saw is the original, black and white (and apparently, less expertly cut, judging from the opinions of those who have seen both; I wouldn't exactly claim that those are terribly educated opinions, though). The pacing is all over the place. In some instances, the film is intense(at times, without really 'moving'... an impressive effect that is not easily achieved), and at others, it doesn't move, well, at all, really. The acting is, as could be expected by a cast of teenage boys, not all stellar. I would suggest that at least some of the roles were cast with more focus on the actor looking like the character described in the book than actual acting talent. The cinematography is at times magnificent, with some breathtaking visuals... and at times dreary and dull, with lazily composed shots to cover the action. I found myself marveling at how many angles seemed to be missing... scenes where one would expect the camera to cut to a reaction shot or a closeup, and it instead stays... and stays. Not moving from it's current motif. The editing seems as if there was too little time or enthusiasm to do it properly.

The Skekses took hold of the now dark crystal & used its powers to find immortality&#133; a 1000 years later a problem was that they found out another race, the Gelfing were the source of their bane they would put an end to the Skekses power, so the skekses got rid of all the Gelfing only 2 made it out alive.

I think I'd better stop there before I tell the whole plot; I know the story sounds stereo-type, but don't overlook it its really cool.I love the world it's based in, its wonderfully different world with totally different landscape, it's sort of a prehistoric, neo-earthy sort of place; definitely not modern. The plants have an ancient under-water look about them; they are so bizarre but cool like a cross between plants & animal. The wild creatures are just as unique, like a bush-baby part mushroom, some very scary gigantic glowing-eyed beetles ,an over-sized red-eyed toad or a rabbit combined with a catfish on stilts, really cool. The Characters are very memorable themselves, Jen is very pleasant, sensitive, and modest, I don't really know how to describe his character but he's very nice. Gelfings almost look human & yet they don't, they look shorter with long ears & long noses. Kira is also very pleasant but she's almost bolder, people who will like this movie will like Kira. The Uhru are these beings who almost look like an elderly herbivore-dinosaur part horse, none of them look young they are very ancient, their personality it celestial, meditative & almost monk-like.

Something sparks our emotions when we see men battered and bruised in the bloodiest of ways. We feel deeply saddened for the main character when he loses brothers and\/or friends in the war, and root for him throughout. So, how does The Patriot continue this trend while staying fresh, entertaining, and even educational? The answer to the aforementioned question is that it brings something new to the table. That new thing as I'm going to call it is honesty. Now, what could I possibly mean by honesty? What does being honest have anything to do with The Patriot? You see, The Patriot isn't the most historically correct movie that you might think it is. I'm no a history buff, but I do my research when going to review a movie. And, my research told me that The Patriot wasn't historically accurate. But, the director Roland Emmerich knows this, and doesn't hold it back. Yes, he keeps some aspects of the original war in the story, but he also brings the emotions with it and a well-written main character to boot! That my friends, is honesty.Also, like I mentioned before, emotion is a major theme in this film that is characteristically heartfelt. The emotion these actors and actresses bring to the table is undeniably heartwarming and heartbreaking. This is a huge theme to pull off, and a lot of these actors aren't well known, so it had to have been hard to deal with. But, they managed to pull off an outstanding job in this category. As did Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger, because just because you're well known, doesn't mean you don't have anxiety when you're about to perform you role. That's basically having the weight of the world on your shoulders when you know everybody is depending on you.Another theme of the film is, believe it or not, brutality. Now, when I say brutality, I don't mean ruthless, unforgiving brutality. I mean real-life brutality that wars can have on people. The worriment of knowing that you just might die when you're defending your country. It's all dealt with here, and in an abrupt way. There's no asinine feeling to it, just raw brutality. The realism of brutality shines here.Another major theme is family matters. I'm talking about the family matters that we all face today. Family issues, arguments, pain, it's all here. As we go through Benjamin's life, we also meet up with his family and see how they react to his time in war. It's very visible that this family is in pain over their loss of their father. Sure, he's still alive, but his family doesn't know for sure. He's out there defending his country, he doesn't really have the time to write them a letter. Also, you can see how the kids react to this too. Especially his daughter Stephanie, who bawls her eyes out just at the thought of her daddy being away for home, maybe not to return at all. It's truly emotional. I take off my hat to this.Now, as I mentioned before, the film is not historically accurate. There are a lot of little things that get tweaked around here in The Patriot. Such as that the French did not wear red coats in the French and Indian War. Does it matter that much? No, not really. But, for the history buffs, it could ruin a whole chunk of the film. I mean, you don?t want to see something you truly love and study be tweaked to a minority, but still have a major effect on you.This is where the honesty I mentioned earlier in the review comes into play. The director Roland Emmerich and the cast of the film know it's not going to be the most historically accurate film of all time. So, they put that out there. They give a fair warning to all of the history buffs out there that they might not see what they expected of the film. And I admire this. This actually reminds me of the advertisements and promos for the release of the movie Doom. The Rock and the director assured everybody that the movie Doom would stay relevant to the video game. But, this proved to be false, as a huge amount of monsters were nowhere to be found, and it played more like an episode of The X-Files. This disappointed the fans of the game, and it didn?t go over too well (though, it still made millions at the box-office). Now, only if Doom would've taken notes from The Patriot's book, it might've went over well with the fans.Overall, The Patriot is worth a watch. It's good for it's entertainment in the action section, and delivers the goods. and, if you're a history buff, you can go in knowing this film isn't going to be historically accurate, but it isn't asinine in any way shape or form. It's good quality entertainment. The acting is a measurement of perfection in this film, as is the emotional charge of what a war can do to someone and his\/her family. Clocking in at three hours, it holds its head up high and gallops forward to the end with nice pacing of action and storyline. It's well worth your time, no matter who you are.

Now, when I say brutality, I don't mean ruthless, unforgiving brutality. I mean real-life brutality that wars can have on people. The worriment of knowing that you just might die when you're defending your country. It's all dealt with here, and in an abrupt way. There's no asinine feeling to it, just raw brutality. The realism of brutality shines here.Another major theme is family matters. I'm talking about the family matters that we all face today. Family issues, arguments, pain, it's all here. As we go through Benjamin's life, we also meet up with his family and see how they react to his time in war. It's very visible that this family is in pain over their loss of their father. Sure, he's still alive, but his family doesn't know for sure. He's out there defending his country, he doesn't really have the time to write them a letter. Also, you can see how the kids react to this too. Especially his daughter Stephanie, who bawls her eyes out just at the thought of her daddy being away for home, maybe not to return at all. It's truly emotional. I take off my hat to this.Now, as I mentioned before, the film is not historically accurate. There are a lot of little things that get tweaked around here in The Patriot. Such as that the French did not wear red coats in the French and Indian War. Does it matter that much? No, not really. But, for the history buffs, it could ruin a whole chunk of the film. I mean, you don?t want to see something you truly love and study be tweaked to a minority, but still have a major effect on you.This is where the honesty I mentioned earlier in the review comes into play. The director Roland Emmerich and the cast of the film know it's not going to be the most historically accurate film of all time. So, they put that out there. They give a fair warning to all of the history buffs out there that they might not see what they expected of the film. And I admire this. This actually reminds me of the advertisements and promos for the release of the movie Doom. The Rock and the director assured everybody that the movie Doom would stay relevant to the video game. But, this proved to be false, as a huge amount of monsters were nowhere to be found, and it played more like an episode of The X-Files. This disappointed the fans of the game, and it didn?t go over too well (though, it still made millions at the box-office). Now, only if Doom would've taken notes from The Patriot's book, it might've went over well with the fans.Overall, The Patriot is worth a watch. It's good for it's entertainment in the action section, and delivers the goods. and, if you're a history buff, you can go in knowing this film isn't going to be historically accurate, but it isn't asinine in any way shape or form. It's good quality entertainment. The acting is a measurement of perfection in this film, as is the emotional charge of what a war can do to someone and his\/her family. Clocking in at three hours, it holds its head up high and gallops forward to the end with nice pacing of action and storyline. It's well worth your time, no matter who you are. No matter what you fancy!

But it seemed like I was the only one who did; the reviews in the paper trashed it, my friends hated it, and it was out of the theater before most folks ever got a chance to see it. Now it seems to be having something of a renaissance on video. Its reputation is growing, but there is still an awful lot of silly hatred for this film out there, and I think folks are really being unreasonable about it. Okay, so this is a silly movie. So what? It was supposed to be. It's just an action flick. Check out the page for Die Hard, for example. That film rates an 8.0, while this poor movie is stuck at 4.6. Why? Sure, Die Hard had better effects; it had a slightly larger budget, too. But Tank Girl is funnier, smarter (no, really, I mean it) and has far more interesting characters. Lori Petty is sexy and mad-funny. Neither film is high art but this one is simply more enjoyable (and I like both), so why the huge difference in ratings? It seems like the expectations for this film were higher than they should have been, maybe because the feminist theme (good women kicking evil men's butts) misled people into expecting a work of serious political or social intent. But if anyone thought that, they obviously knew nothing about the film or the story coming into it. In the first place, the movie was based on a COMIC BOOK, for goodness' sake. For that matter, the comic in question was basically a feminized and humorized version of The Road Warrior, not all that serious a motion picture in itself. Also, the casting of Malcolm McDowell as the villain should have provided a clue; he's the most reliable bad guy in Hollywood, because you always know exactly the character you're going to get out of him. The trailer, with all the crazy outfits, ridiculous kangaroo costumes, and zany one-liners shouldn't have misled anyone. Plus, why on Earth would expect Citizen Kane from a film called Tank Girl in the first place? This movie is exactly what you want for kicking back and enjoying an evening a fast-paced, engaging bit of semi-sci-fi which, surprisingly, really does achieve a few genuinely beautiful moments, especially the dust-shower scene (to Portishead's Roads). Ignore all the cynics. This film is a blast. It's pure entertainment with a good cast and zany, silly story&#133;it's the closest you'll ever get to a live-action Bugs Bunny cartoon.

Big mistake!! Like Hoosiers this one was an exception and what an exception. Remember the Titans is in my top five movies of the past ten years. Denzel Washington, as the coach, gave another of his consistently outstanding performances.Like Hoosiers this is a true story and it is not just a story about sports but a strong story about race. I probably appreciated it more than most because of my background I connected to the movie. During the 1940s I attended schools which were well integrated and students of different races and cultures existed harmoniously. To a large degree, it was because the high school had a very successful football program in which unlike almost all of the other schools, minority athletes were welcome. In my junior year we went undefeated and won the State Championship and the team is still considered the best high school team of all time. The only time the team came close to defeat was in the State final when we played another well integrated team.Consequently the community while generally middle and upper class except for its minorities was well integrated. As a result although I knew racism existed, I never encountered it in my community. But then I began to see its ugly head. First, the All-American end on our team, a superb athlete, was denied scholarships both to USC and Stanford because neither school accepted minorities. I had always wanted to go to USC but because of what USC did to my friend I turned down its offer of a scholarship the next year as I did to Stanford which I considered a snob school then as I do today.But my college was cut short when the Korean War began and I was in the service. I was sent to bases in the South and I spent much of the next thirteen years in the South witnessing how bad it was for the blacks and I was involved in the civil rights movement in the South which got me into a lot of trouble with my military superiors.During my tours in the South I became head coach of a football team at a Southern base. Filled with ex-collegiate stars and some pros, we regularly played Division I colleges and universities. However, because I had black players on my team I couldn't schedule games with any white southern colleges. Instead we scheduled one black college and several state universities in the mid-west.Some critics have compared the summer camp at which Washington as Coach Boone brought the blacks and whites together as a team as like a Marine Boot Camp but everyone missed the subtlety of this. I went through Boot Camp at a time when the military was just integrating and we had southern blacks and whites as well as a mix of races from other parts of the country in my platoon as well as all classes. It didn't take very long for us to become as one unit. The first part of boot camp is sure hell and the reason for it is that it reduces everyone to the lowest common denominator of misery and you quickly learn that the only way to escape that misery is to work together. This is just the way Coach Boone made it work.What I liked about this movie is that it showed how all this played out. Most moviegoers today are not really aware of how bad racism was in 1971 but this movie illustrates it well. Even though the movie has a few corny moments and the actors playing the roles as football players look old for high school, these faults are minimal and do not detract from the power of the film.

The subject matter of the movie is the child sex trade and there is a considerable amount of intense violence in the film. I think all but a mature audience would be pretty traumatized by the film--I know I was a bit put off by the disgusting plot initially.Second, this film was a lot of fun for me to watch because I have seen Daniel Auteuil in many films and this was the first time I saw him acting in English and he did an excellent job. In addition, the character he played was a lot different than I was used to seeing. In Hollywood, this role might have been played by a more traditionally macho star--but I really think it helped to have a shorter, middle-aged and not particularly hunky guy play the role. It helped to make the plot seem more real.As mentioned above, the plot involves child sexual abuse and the sick soul-less people who profit from buying and selling children. Auteuil plays a private detective who stumbles into this industry when searching for a missing man. But how he resolves this will either totally put you off or offer a great reward depending on your sensibilities. If you can't accept him becoming a vigilante and killing or maiming these evil people, then I suggest you don't watch the film. I admit was totally repulsed by the sexual deviants and found it very satisfying to watch them get killed--particularly the last guy. The film really manages to tap into your visceral disgust for sexual predators--and some may feel disturbed that they can ENJOY watching these men die.About the only negative is the role played by Nastasia Kinski. Her character, at times, seems a little too shrill and annoying--almost more of a caricature than a 3-dimensional woman. Later the movie explains, in part, her over-reactions but I just felt she was a poorly developed character.

I wish there would be a place in IMDb where one could post general thinking about directors, actors, writes and the like. Since I don't know of such a place I post it here under one of his films. It could be anyone, since I saw most of them recently here in Vienna, Austria, where the local film museum shows this month all of his films!Fighting is quite the right title, since most of Sam Fullers films show individuals or groups fighting for survival in one or the other form.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"13 March 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Giant, set roughly in the period between the late 1910s and the early 1950s, is a family saga which tells the story of a Texan ranching family over two generations. Jordan Benedict II, the head of the family, marries Leslie Lynnton, the daughter of a Maryland doctor, and takes her back to his ranch. When Jordan's older sister Luz (pronounced, in anglicised fashion, to rhyme with buzz) is killed in a riding accident, she leaves a small parcel of land to Jett Rink, a poor, downtrodden ranch-hand whom she has befriended. Jett turns down an offer from Jordan to buy the land for twice its value, a decision that initially seems eccentric but which later turns out to have been prudent when oil is discovered there. Jett's good fortune eventually leads to his becoming the millionaire proprietor of a massive oil company. Jordan, however, is too stubborn to allow any drilling for oil on his own land, arguing that he is a cattle man, not an oil man.The action then leaps forward twenty years, focusing on the three children of Jordan and Leslie. Jordan hopes that his only son Jordan III will inherit the ranching business, but rather to his disappointment the young man prefers to follow his grandfather into the medical profession. His daughter Judy, however, who has married the son of a neighbouring rancher, shows much more interest in ranching. His other daughter Luz II seems to be falling for the now middle-aged Jett.The family saga was a popular literary form in the first half of the twentieth century, but it was not one that always transferred well to the cinema screen. Such adaptations always raised the problem of how to deal with the ageing of the main characters, a problem that this film does not altogether solve successfully. The beautiful twenty-four year old Elizabeth Taylor would not, after all, have been most people's first choice to play a grey-haired grandmother, nor did James Dean, the archetypal youthful rebel, seem a natural to play a drunken middle-aged tycoon. Rock Hudson, several years older than either Taylor or Dean, copes well with the challenge of playing both the older and the younger Jordan. This is one of his better performances, and in many ways he acts as the bridge which links the first half of the film to the second. Taylor is unconvincing as the older Leslie; the make-up department's solution to the problem of ageing her seems to have been to give her much more grey hair than the average woman in her forties or fifties while leaving her face completely unlined and youthful. We are always aware that we are watching a twenty-something actress trying to act old.She is, however, very good in the first half of the film. Leslie has an important role as the voice of liberal, progressive ideas imported into Texas from her East-Coast home. She is a feminist, impatient when she is left out of discussions of politics or business by her husband and his male friends. She is shocked by the callous racism shown by many Anglophone Texans towards Mexican immigrants, and arranges at her own expense for a doctor to serve the poor local Mexican community. The more conservative Jordan is initially cynical about what he sees as interfering do-gooding, but later comes to appreciate what his wife is trying to achieve. He raises no objection when his son wants to marry a Hispanic girl, and a key scene comes near the end when, attempting to stand up for a group of Mexicans, he is beaten up by the racist owner of a diner.The contrast between Eastern liberalism and Western conservatism is reflected in the contrasting landscapes; the pastoral green hills of Maryland and the empty, featureless Texan plains. The Benedict family home is an imposing, Gothic-style mansion, and changes in the way it is decorated reflect the changing times and changing social attitudes. In the early scenes it is heavy, grand and baronial, with much dark woodwork. Later it is lighter and more homely, like a domestic sitting-room writ large.Giant is in many ways an interesting film, but overall it has a number of weaknesses, mostly rooted in the difficulties of adapting the family saga genre to the screen. The break between the two halves of the film, when it suddenly shifts from the story of Jordan and Leslie to that of their children, is too abrupt. The film is far too long; a word frequently used to describe it is sprawling, and the adjective seems apt. I have never read Edna Ferber's novel on which it is based, but it would seem that it contained too much source material to be contained in a normal-length film. Indeed, perhaps not all the material could be contained in a film like this one that that runs to well over three hours, as there are a number of loose ends that are never tied up. (Judy Benedict and her husband, who at one time looked set to inherit the ranch, largely disappear for most of the latter part of the film).The biggest disappointment for me, however, was Dean. He seems particularly miscast as the older Jett, fabulously wealthy but broken-down and disillusioned, but even as the younger man he is not very impressive; too often he tends to mumble his words, making it difficult to understand what he is saying. It could no doubt be argued that a young, working-class man of limited education would not have enunciated his words very clearly, but realism of this sort is of little value if it hinders understanding. This may have been his last performance before his tragic death, but it cannot equal his excellent one in East of Eden and his truly great one in Rebel without a Cause. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2006","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Giant, set roughly in the period between the late 1910s and the early 1950s, is a family saga which tells the story of a Texan ranching family over two generations.

They get on the plane, and everything seems to be going smooth, but out of nowhere the plane explodes and everyone is killed. Casey, our main character, wakes up on the plane, and realizes that it was all a dream. But then, things begin to happen exactly like they did just before the plane exploded in his dream. Casey begins freaking out, and is taken off of the plane. His friends get off the plane as well. Then, as Casey is telling them all about his dream, the plain explodes in mid air, and everyone in it is killed, just like in the dream. But it doesn't end there. Soon, the people that got off of the plane begin to die one by one in mysterious ways, and the teenagers soon begin to realize that death is coming back for all of them, and they have to find a way to stop it before it's too late.I am a big fan of this film. In the 2000s, it seems like most film makers are having a hard time coming up with original ideas. The majority of movies coming out are rip offs, sequels, or remakes. But every now and then a movie like this comes along, and proves that some filmmakers out there can still come up with an original idea and make a great movie out of it.The Final Destination series, much like the Friday The 13th series, is based all around death scenes. The main reason to go see these films is so you can see young teens die in freakish and awesome ways. This movie is not over the top gory by any means, but it still has some great death scenes, and will give you a few jumps along the way. The atmosphere is very creepy, more so than in the two sequels. The acting is acceptable, and the writing and direction prove that James Wong and Glen Morgan are both extremely talented filmmakers.I highly recommend this movie, and if you like it, check out the sequels as well.

Soon, the people that got off of the plane begin to die one by one in mysterious ways, and the teenagers soon begin to realize that death is coming back for all of them, and they have to find a way to stop it before it's too late.I am a big fan of this film. In the 2000s, it seems like most film makers are having a hard time coming up with original ideas. The majority of movies coming out are rip offs, sequels, or remakes. But every now and then a movie like this comes along, and proves that some filmmakers out there can still come up with an original idea and make a great movie out of it.The Final Destination series, much like the Friday The 13th series, is based all around death scenes. The main reason to go see these films is so you can see young teens die in freakish and awesome ways. This movie is not over the top gory by any means, but it still has some great death scenes, and will give you a few jumps along the way. The atmosphere is very creepy, more so than in the two sequels. The acting is acceptable, and the writing and direction prove that James Wong and Glen Morgan are both extremely talented filmmakers.I highly recommend this movie, and if you like it, check out the sequels as well.
