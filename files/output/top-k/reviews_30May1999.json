But in his last three--LEAVING LAS VEGAS, ONE NIGHT STAND, and his newest and best movie, THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE--the Figgis style is starting to look like a deeply felt, hard-won achievement. This impressionist prism-movie about man's uncertain relationship to his body, and nature in general, is probably too lofty, too self-serious and too splintered in its storytelling to connect with a mass audience. But though the audience seemed split between titters and yawns, I find the movie improbably moving--and as obsessively, rambunctiously personal as a James Toback or an Abel Ferrara movie.A series of autobiographical fragments and symbolist fantasias, the movie takes as its metaphor eviction from Eden--and makes it radiate out in all directions, encompassing both the shame that adheres to human sexuality and the demolition of the earth's environment. There's obviously something moss-headed in the notion that sex was once, Blue Lagoon-like, free and pure, and is now polluted by human neuroses and power plays. Where does Figgis think human neuroses and power plays came from--an alien hovercraft? But the kaleidoscope Figgis generates around this material is intoxicating and sometimes shockingly poignant--as with a moment when two supermodelly twins, separated at birth, chance upon one another in the Rome airport. It's like a lost moment from a late Fellini movie (but sweeter, and with humility). Everything silly about this diary-movie is swept away in the last sequence--a Paul Bowlesian shocker that might literally steal your breath.

This movie had ten Oscar nominations, and won best picture in 1938. Paul Muni (The Last Angry Man) was nominated for an Oscar for his performance as Émile Zola, one of the foremost writers in France. Zola and his best friend and confident painter Paul Cezanne, played by Russian born actor Vladimir Sokoloff (Taras Bulba, For Whom The Bell Tolls), who attend the Moscow Academy of Dramatic Art. The story takes place in  Paris in 1862.  Paul Cezanne and Émile Zola were friends when both were starting their careers. Through ups and downs Zola became financially successful long before Cezanne. He was married and had a successful career as an author. Paul Cezanne then decided to live in the country far away from the city, and told Zola not to be part of the establishment but to fight for truth and justice again.  Émile Zola is living comfortable and even getting fat, and is about to became a member of the French Academy for the utmost writers, and to get honored by the Nobel society. He is approached by  Lucie Dreyfus, played by Gale Sondergaard (Anna and the King of Siam), whose husband was unjustly court martialed and sent to Devil's Island (Papillion's prison home) because he was accused of betraying his country by disclosing military secrets. Mr. Dreyfuss' case is one of those passionate cases where anti-Semitism is also an issue. It is unbelievable that this specially inhumane trial took place in France,  nation for Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality. That what Zola was fighting for.The music by Max Steiner is beautiful. He was also nominated for an Oscar for best music score. Anatole France is also part of the story. My favorite scenes the folding umbrellas, Zola getting his first pay check as a best seller author, the conversations between Zola and Paul Cezanne. The determination of Ms. Dreyfuss and she goes to talk to Zola, her last hope. My favorite quotes There are times when the most courageous thing is to be cowardly. This is a great biography.  It is a Schindler's list type of story!  It has great passion, deep commitments, love, great music, and we get to know a bit more about French literature. Thanks to my dad, who was passionate for literature and majored in languages, I was brought up with a library of books where one could find the internationally acclaimed classics. Émile Zola's works were among dad's favorite. That was what made me purchase the tape. I highly recommend it. You can learn a lot from this movie!

In the opening scenes, they reaffirm the universal truth that when three thousand guys decide to gang up on one or two, they'll politely wait their turn as the outnumbered persons dispatch them one at a time.After committing grand theft starship, our mercenaries are joined by a happy meal alien, who aids them in generating tremendous marketing potential for movie-related consumer goods.  The trio come to the aid of a dictator who refuses to submit to the democratic process, and when faced with being restrained, escalates the conflict into an upward spiral of assaultively belligerent coiffure.In their retreat, they are joined by a young tough who is otherwise so egregiously tow-headed that he is alleged to exist by virgin birth.

The movie features both a bad guy (who really did seem a lot nastier when he was the bad guy on Inspector Morse), and a bad guy side-kick (who by staggering coincidence was wearing exactly the same outfit as three fourths of the teenagers in the audience).The utter lack of plot is compensated for by the underlying subtexts that clearly demonstrate our modern beliefs and fears our fear that we will ultimately be subjugated by people with Japanese accents aided by their robotic minions, our belief that politicians can never be trusted (especially when they've never been caught taking illegal campaign contributions), and that anyone who does not speak perfect American English (with a Midwestern accent) is either stupid or dangerous.

A very important question...how many people have to die for a just cause? That what war is all about? Since the history of human kind, there have always been wars...except that not always they have been so expressfull as this one. So...open, so ...real. Hollywood has a record to make good war movies, but not all of them show you the REAL face of the war. This time, we all have something to watch and learn...from Steven Spielberg. He did his homework and he did it very well. Saving private Ryan, proves just that. Tom Hanks plays great. In the movie, he used to be a teacher, but now he is a captain, and he certainly deserves his rank. If, by any chance, you didn`t see this movie yet, you have no idea what you are missing.

Repeated references to the lack of sleep or nutrition, combined with the general air of confusion that he shows makes one wonder what attitudes are genuine and which are not.

The favored contestants had the answers before hand, but Herbie is asked to lose to a successor Ralph Fiennes (The English Patient, Schindler's List) Charles Van Doren. Van Doren is a lovable, well bred, educated, nice looking young man who teaches literature at Columbia University, and that infuriates Herbie, who hates him.Rob Morrow (Northern Exposure, Last Dance) plays Dick Goodwin who is an attorney with the Federal Government working for a Congressional subcommittee investigating the scheme in the late 1950s. Morrow and Van Doren are of Jewish background, and Goodwin likes Charles Van Doren and wants to protect him.  His wife Sandra Goodwin, Mira Sorvino (Jake's Women, Mighty Aphrodite), even tells him about over protecting Van Doren.

I am not the biggest Star Wars fan ever but even I was anxious to see it. The drawback? Anakin, his acting was terrible...at best I might add. What a waste of a character! He was not suitable for this role, how could Lucas not see that? Can I go, Mom? - Anakin asks his mother for permission to become a Jedi and forever leave his home. How PATHETIC can it get? The only time I had the same puky feeling was when I was watching Godzilla and Armageddon...honestly I expected more from Lucas.The queen did a poor job at the beginning, she improved later on, unfortunately not enough. She's cute, don't ya think? The effects are quite entertaining, there is no doubt. I wish they could use them sparingly though, not stick them in every place imaginable. I too think the Trade Federation guys had oriental accents, what was the point of that?Another drawback? Too dramatic, too many ups and downs. I don't quite understand why you ALWAYS have to leave TWO contenders in the race, the rest either die or fail miserably. Of course, the good guy wins BUT only because the other one was so evil that he had tampered with the good guy's equipment.Anakin mother's behavior was quite perplexing - maybe family relations in the Star Wars worlds are different but what mother would let her 5-year old son participate in a 200+ MPH race? And who would let his or her child be taken away by some stranger for dangerous and unknown training while you are left to slave your butt off for the rest of your life.The movie progressed smoothly, that's one thing I liked about it. The plot was intriguing apart from a few inconsistencies like droids' dumb behavior and constant failure to hit people with their laser guns.As I walked away from the movie theater discussing it with my friends I came to this conclusion - the movie was made for kids, whether I like it or not. Either I am too old for this or too down-to earth to enjoy science-fiction. But yet again, there are OTHER ways to make Sci-fi movies, right? Aliens is a good example.

I know then, it was going to be great! Then, on Saturday night, the sneek preview rolled on in to the theater closets to me.  There was no chance of me missing this movie, I  was not disappointed.  Anthony Hopkins plays Dr.Ethan Powell, who is accused of killing 2 and wounding 3 unwanted park rangers with a club.  He is brought from a jail in Africa to the U.S. to be study.  His doctor is Doctor Theo Calder, played excellently by Cube Gooding Jr.  As the movie goes on it centers around the two of them and the interviews at the jail.  One scene Ethan attacks Theo and is ready to break his neck when he begans to ask him questions.  The one line I personally loved was when he has a piece of tape over Theo's mouth, and tells him in a voice I will never forget  Who never had control, you only thought you did!

I disliked LW4, but felt that Jet Li seemed interesting, and I promised myself that I would go and see his next movie released in America. Sure enough, I went with my friend a week or so ago, and words can not describe how repulsive I found this to be.  I've always known Oriental films too often have a completely different feel and often manage to be campy, but I felt this film would have the fun and entertaining, yet overall cheesy feel that Jackie Chan had always managed.  My guess as to how this film would be could not be more wrong.  It was dubbed, which doesn't make a film bad, but it was hard to follow what they were saying as the mouths didn't follow in unison, which I always disfavor, although the quality of the film usually isn't taken away.  But the content of this movie was horrible. The wanton violence and overly elaborated amount of blood and killings was just there to bother me.  I've been known to love violent movies like Aliens and Halloween, but the violence here was just totally unnecessary.  Also, all this film was about was the combat sequences.  I have no clue what the story was even about, if there was one.  And this film was about ninety minutes long, which usually means that the film is short and sweet.  Even in the ninety minutes it played, it managed to feel like an agonizing five hour fight scene that wouldn't end.  All this film was about was the fighting, and that wasn't even achieved well.If you're Oriental and\/or cultured in Jet Li films, you might like this one. But from the standpoint of being an American and just looking for a good action film, seek more.  This is in my opinion THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I'm sorry to say it, but it's the truth.  It's just overall boring and the fight scenes (which is all there is) lead you nowhere except the exit sign.

This film more than any I can remember portrays personal and group turmoil and confusion.  I can understand how many would not enjoy this film. There is so little of a positive nature in it.  That said, I do believe it to be a good film in many respects.  The film was well written (Dave Rabe, playwright) and directed (Anthony Drazan).  Between the two they produced a work with interesting characters and dialogue.  If you don't like listening to A LOT of dialogue, you will not like this film.  The casting was excellent.  I am not a Sean Penn booster, but he was perfect and brilliant in the part of Eddie, the drug sotted lead. Kevin Spacey as the sarcastic, flip Mickey as his roommate was good as well.  Chazz Palminteri as the violent, mentally slow Phil and Gary Shandling as the shallow, fast talking Artie round out the male leads.  The female roles are all played brilliantly as well.  Robin Wright Penn as Darlene, the unpredictable girlfriend of Eddie and Meg Ryan as Susie(?), the easy stripper were very good, but the best was Anna Paquin as Donna, the homeless young woman used as a sex object was so much more.  Ms. Paquin was great and I look forward to seeing her in the future.  It is difficult in the beginning to have any feelings for these characters, but by the end of the movie some empathy if not sympathy developed.  The filmmakers do not expect us to like these intelligent talented (with exception of Phil) characters whose lives are mess of their own making, but some understanding not acceptance develops.

It is a tantalizing flood of new age science fiction wrapped in unbelievable computer graphics.  Directed by the little known Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix brings back the love of sci-fi to the silver screen.  You might be scared off by the idea that this film may be a cop off of recent Reeves bust Johnny Neumonic.  But the movie is far from what should be expected.Set in the present, in a big city, a computer hacker named Neo(Keanu Reeves) is approached by rebels who offer to answer Neo's most prized question What is the matrix?  The leader of the rebel cause is Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne)  who is an outstanding criminal of society.  Neo finds himself in danger when Morpheus sends fellow rebel Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss) to collect Neo and bring him to Morpheus.  They think Neo is the savior of their rebel cause, which is to destroy the matrix.  In this world of reality Neo is thrust into the world of the rebels, one of mind-boggling truth and discount of all natural laws known to man.  If you thought computer programs were just for computers, this film believes otherwise. The Matrix strives to be more than a plain movie with great special effects. It coherently meshes the story with the computer graphics so everything undoubtedly seems fluid-like and flawless.  It has such deep meaning that the film makes you think about how far our society can go into the future at its present course.  The idea of a savior for the 21st Century from what man has created is heavy.  For example, in the film Agents Smith(Hugo Weaving), Brown(Paul Goddard I), and Jones(Robert Taylor II)  shoot to kill Neo who uses his powers to stop the bullets in mid-air.  This idea would look silly if for not the concrete plot to back up the superb graphics.  Keanu Reeves actually puts in a great performace for this film.  As Neo, Keanu is not any recognizable character portrayed in past movies, i.e. Speed.The Matrix is right on as a new age sci-fi film.  I can not emphasize enough to go see this movie for special effects as well as the plot.  The whole idea of having the viewers' perception of reality changed and put in loco to achieve a place where those superb graphics feel real makes the film work.  Other than one weak plot scene where Neo is brought back by a kiss, The Matrix was the best.
