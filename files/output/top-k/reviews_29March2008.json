And with his performance in Jonny Mnemonic I can see why but I think people often forget that, when given the right role, he can be great. Speed, A Scanner Darkly and of course The Matrix are prime examples of how Keanu can really be a great actor. And with out a doubt, Harball proves this once again.The story of Hardball sounds like a generic sports movie and listening to the plot on paper makes it sound like Mighty Ducks with baseball. However, while the story may not be the most original thing, the approach is what makes Hardball stand out. Instead of taking the easy way out by making it a family comedy where the team comes together to win with their used to be a douche-bag coach, Hardball is a surprisingly powerful drama. Keanu is very good as a gambler who excepts a job coaching inner-city kids on a baseball team to help pay a debt he owes. Along the way he realizes he is kind of an A-hole and not really going anywhere but down and really starts to enjoy the kids. The movie takes itself pretty seriously which works really well. Diane Lane is the obligatory love interest and does a great job as always. All of the kids on the Baseball team turn in great performances as well but it is really Keanu that steals the show. He really shines in a speech he gives near the end at a funeral and wow....I never cry during a movie....and still have not....but I was pretty close during that scene. How he didn't get at least nominated for an Oscar for that is further proof that the people who choose the nominations are idiots.So overall....a well done Drama with a great performance by Reeves and all involved. Check it out.My grade A- ","genre":null},{"date":"29 March 2008","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Keanu Reeves has taken a lot....and I do mean A lot of doo-doo (imdb has dumb censorship rules so I can't say a certain word that rhymes with bit) for his acting.

There were a number of gritty films based around school kids made in the eighties, but of all the ones I've seen; this is certainly the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is disturbing in its own right and adds the theme of teenage slackers and their uncaring attitude about things, which takes the story onto another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it's played out by complex characters. The film begins with a murder. We then follow the murderer, nicknamed John, as he goes back to school and tells all his friends about what he has done. Rather than give the expected reaction, most of them hardly react at all and the strongest reaction that the murderer gets comes from Layne; who makes it his number one priority to help John clear up the mess he's in and get him out of it. The other friends mull over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police...River's Edge features a host of great performances from its young cast. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for wooden acting, and for good reason; but he fits in very well to this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as the slightly insane Layne. Glover always stands out in every film he's in, and while he does go over the top a little bit; he convinces well as the lead in this movie. Reeves and Glover receive good support from a talented young cast that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua john Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film features a very gritty picture which bodes well with its nihilistic tone. The central characters are all of the 'slacker\/stoner' generation and the way that they genuinely don't seem to care about the murder of their friend is more shocking than the murder itself; and the point that the film tries to make about modern society is both strong and well defined. The film is also rather funny, owing to some of the characters' lines; but the humour is pitch black and clearly this film was never meant to be a comedy. Overall, this is an excellent and memorable film that is definitely worth seeing!

But I won't deny that this one is still really funny. My favorite scene is actually when Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) jump into the men's heads to try to get the word out. Just imagine some individuals addressing police officers, and they suddenly start talking like surfer dudes! Ah, but the movie's most interesting aspect - at least in my opinion - is the presence of the Grim Reaper (William Sadler), and the fact that Bill and Ted play games with him. Never would I have guessed that a movie starring the guy from Speed would feature a scene paying homage to an Ingmar Bergman movie!But anyway, this is mostly an excuse for nice, brainless fun. Most of the dialog consists of words like dude, cool and yes, bogus. A wonderful romp. Also starring George Carlin, Joss Ackland and Sarah Trigger.
