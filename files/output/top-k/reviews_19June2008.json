The main character Patch acted by Robin Williams tries to understand the minds of his patients with his unusual ideas. What makes him to be a doctor is hidden in his past life. In any case, he believes that  Laughter is the best medicine. Moreover, his ideas are original and very funny. He is a genius with provoking laughter of others. Even though he is surrounded by many difficulties such as his cynical professor or the traditional systems of the hospital, he tries to get over them. Do you think he can save his patients? I would like to recommend this movie to everyone. This is a human drama, but it also has aspects of comedy as well. You can not see this movie without laughter and will know the fascination of laughter from this story. However, I think they dramatize the main character too much. I guess the real person went through harder way than this. Though, the cast are great still. I was touched a lot.
