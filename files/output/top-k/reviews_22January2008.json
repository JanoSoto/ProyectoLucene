It's a view into lives that, at least at the time, didn't get much time on cinema screens. We understand that this young mother, Cesira (VERY well deserved Academy Award winner Sophia Loren), has a kind of hard protective shell of the fiery, strong woman that today might seem to verge on being something to expect in an Italian or Spanish drama, but here is meant to be just that- a shell to guard off from the wretched horrors of a war which repeatedly she asks will it end soon? She also has to be strong for her thirteen year old daughter Rosetta (Eleonora Brown, excellent even if not considering it's a first performance), who still has a little innocence and admiration for those who are more good-hearted, if not as resourceful.This type as mentioned is in Michel (Jean Paul Belmondo, a curiously low-key performance considering his big hype as a suave star in France), who is a resistance fighter that Cesira and Rosetta come across while traveling away from Rome during bombing raids. We see them (Michel and Cesira) getting close, maybe too close, though she recognizes in him one of the only vestiges of common sense and decency, even if in a slightly shrewd (or just practical) manner that she can't totally grasp. She's been through the war, right along with her daughter, and there's layers that Loren grasps that pierce through the character; De Sica knows that she's capable of reaching these very real dimensions even before she has to go full tilt into the tragedy of the rape scene in the church. Loren's absolutely stunning in her gorgeous beauty, but in a way that works to make a comment on how her character has to keep guarded as well. Sometimes a look is just enough to suggest something. Other times, men might get a little more forceful. There's suggestion beneath some of the bigger scenes, and Loren is fantastic at grabbing them for all their worth.From the start, De Sica and Zavattini set the tone people walking on a street, suddenly the alarms sound, running, bombs drop. Should be business as usual, but it's still staggering for the mind to grasp. In a way, Cesira and Rosetta are in the midst of a kind of apocalyptic atmosphere, and we as the audience, even as we know where history will lead the characters, get wrapped up in the maelstrom of violence (one moment that's important is when the mother and daughter walk along a quiet road, a man on a bicycle passes, and a plane swoops down, shooting, the women duck, but the man is killed - the women look startled for just a moment, but hide it and go on their way) and with some political discourse thrown in from time to time as well (these might be the only weak spots of the film, but still very good scenes with a quick pace and sharp attention to mixing real actors and non actors, a slightly elevated neo-realism). And there are memorable scenes before that last half hour- just seeing the Germans appear up in front of the Italians, menacing in an almost surreal two-dimensional fashion, verbally abusive, taking bread. Scenes precede this, like a couple of brutes who threaten Cesira with a gun. But this one strikes it hard a state of mind in war cripples the mind.Finally, they come to the abandoned church, and the infamous scene occurs (filmed with a very effective zoom lens on Rosetta's eyes at a crucial moment, a kind of approximate exclamation point). It's a very careful study in the disintegration of the human spirit at this point, and more than once, De Sica and his writer, as in times before, pull sincerely and harshly at the heart strings. This time, however, is like seeing a Lifetime TV movie as done by the most sincere dramatist, ready to gage the emotions just by presenting the devastation straight on, and enhancing a theme the futility of escape in this environment. Rosetta can't stand that her mother didn't protect her more, she's almost shell-shocked, and after a tense scene riding back with an opera singing trucker (a small, great scene), she awakes at night to see she's run off with the trucker from before. She comes back, Cesira is furious, but not simply for that. A much greater tragedy has occurred, and it all comes crashing down. Even the most hardened and cynical moviegoer will be hard-pressed to hold back from crying as Loren brushes back her daughter's hair in the church, or tries to look away in the truck. And that final shot, however in sentiment as the final shots of Umberto D and Bicycle Thief, drive it on home like a dagger.One of the best films of 1960; a touching masterpiece in Italian cinema from one of the masters (if that's over-praising it much forgive me).

Weighing in at over three hours, it isn't for the timid of spirit, and certainly isn't for the impatient. It is essentially a character study, and an incredibly ambitious one at that. We follow a cast of upwards of ten characters as they simply live their lives over the course of a day. But the characters here are certainly varied and, for the most part, highly watchable. Two of our very best character actors, Philip Seymour Hoffman and William H. Macy, deliver excellent performances, the latter most especially as a boy prodigy gone wrong. This is paralleled by a current boy prodigy on the same game show that Macy won on, who is afraid of becoming something similar to Macy's character, said show's host is dying of cancer in a manner similar to the show's producer....and so on. The gimmick that magnolia wields is the sometimes incredulous convergence of chance. It's incredibly intriguing introduction sets the tone perfectly, as it describes three extremely improbable events (which seem real, and I had assumed they were until checking on them), and the film wraps up in the same theme with the oft mentioned scene (so called to avoid spoilers). Ebert described it as such All of these threads converge, in one way or another, upon an event there is no way for the audience to anticipate. This event is not cheating, as some critics have argued, because the prologue fully prepares the way for it, as do some subtle references to Exodus. It works like the hand of God, reminding us of the absurdity of daring to plan. And yet plan we must, because we are human, and because sometimes our plans work out. The event for me, was certainly unexpected (and undoubtedly memorable), but didn't serve to elevate the events of the film into the same area as the events described in the introduction. What was more striking was the emotion constantly experienced between the characters, and by the characters. William H. Macy is brilliant and pathetic as someone who had such a bright future, but ended up lost and lonely, to the extent that he believes wearing braces could turn his love life around. Tom Cruise is unexpectedly stellar, and his interaction with his father was powerful stuff. Jason Robards' speech about his life's regret stuck with me the moment he finished it. John C. Reilly is perhaps the standout star, playing a simple, utterly boring man, who accidentally, more than anything, affects one of the characters in a way that would seem almost impossible at the start of the film. It is all this, the constant experiences we go through with these characters over the course of the film, that are the real meat of it. The event, as the character Stanley put it, is just something that happens. That being said, the film is not perfect. Watching it, one gets the sense that it is somehow flawed, but in a way that one can't quite put their finger on. Julianne Moore's character could potentially have been completely jettisoned. A bit more of it could possibly have hit the cutting room floor, but even at three hours plus, it never truly feels like it is dragging on. Credit Anderson's vision for this. He has created something broad and sweeping, and while it doesn't really have anything important to say, the experience it delivers is at the worst hard to look away from, and at its best enthralling. Perhaps the worst that can be said about it, is that it plays to a very small audience. Whether or not this is actually a debit could very well be debated, but regardless it seems true. I would recommend the film with some slight hesitations. It is definitely challenging fare, but for those willing to brave the journey, it is rather rewarding.

He has a motion picture camera and loudspeaker on his truck. As he drives through the villages he broadcasts to the people that he is from the film industry of Roma and he is giving screen tests in order to discover natural talent.He sets up his truck and tent typically in the town square. His technique is to tell everyone that they have a wonderful face, hidden talent, that they are naturals and diamonds in the rough.

Indiana Jones and The Mummy are good examples of adventure films from recent times that have withstood the short test of contemporary time. Action films cannot help but impose upon additions to the genre; but when you see a bad adventure film, you know it's bad when the narrative is dull and routine; when the action scenes are short and unspectacular and when certain events that occur happen because the genre demands they happen, rather than because the film is trying something new and original.In The Mummy, from the same year; there were these ancient Egyptian beetles that were reminiscent of piranhas only they weren't constricted to water; in the Indiana Jones films, we were given good, constructive bad guys who we enjoyed seeing get pummelled and beaten by the hero; we like the special effects in both films, the characters and the beauty of the locales. In The 13th Warrior, surely the now obvious 'beginning of the end' for director John McTiernan, we are given grubby looking cinematography set amongst a backdrop of boring and uninspiring settings; we are presented with action scenes so dull and unimpressive we actually feel cheated; we are presented with some of the most boring, one-dimensional characters ever committed to an action film and we are insulted with a narrative so plain and so uninteresting that to even repeat it would waste time and insult intelligence.That is to say the actual narrative for The 13th Warrior is just bland and routine. Antonio Banderas plays an Arab with a Spanish accent among a group of Vikings who are portrayed in an equally insulting light. Banderas' character's name is even so long and such a mouthful that it too could be seen as insulting toward the typical Arabic name, in fact it's so long one could assume the writers were playing for laughs more than anything else. Action heroes need a short and sharp name, something cool and sharp to reflect their persona Han Solo, James Bond, Indiana Jones; hell, even Rick O'Donnell would do but we are given Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad? It's no wonder the Vikings laugh at him as we are doing the same. After a very young boy travels the length and breath of the land (the length it takes to learn a new language), seemingly on his own, to deliver a mere message that they are under attack from 'monsters', twelve Vikings take it upon themselves to travel and help out but with one catch the 13th warrior must be foreign. If you can get past the fact this little ancient 'rule' still seems like a necessity to be included in a time of crisis, then you might miss how very handy it is that Ahmed was even there; otherwise who else was going to go? Omar Sharif's character? I'd like to have seen that.Ahmed goes on a journey with these Vikings whom are portrayed as big, disgusting troll like people who wash themselves in each others spit and happily kill one another over the last piece of drumstick at meal times. Likewise, the Arabs seem to have a certain class; a certain sort of swagger that can only be put down to Hispanic Banderas' good looks and Spanish elegance. In the film, Banderas has another opportunity to swish and sway enemies with his sword, just as he did in The Mask of Zorro a mere twelve months earlier. But this time, there is no class nor is there the feeling of adventure or excitement; unlike that film, The 13th Warrior heads nowhere bar an abyss of horrible action set pieces and boring logic. The 'monsters' of the piece turn out to be nothing more than bears with swords and shields, how dull and that's when we're supposed to truly believe that they're monsters. What Banderas discovers that no one else for the hundreds of years that they've been attacking the Viking villages is that these monsters are actually men, black men; in costume. Yes, racism starts to run a little thick and a little fast here. Boring, faceless, seemingly voodoo obsessed black people who are able to not only control the weather but live in an underground system of caves and such, during which they can survive and develop utopias of rope bridges and democratic systems that govern who are the fighters and who are the leaders they are like human ants who every now and again, like to pop up to the surface and start a bit of bother. Their 'kind' have been doing this for centuries, might I add.And then the genre movie kicks in. The Vikings and Ahmed lie in a circle as the monsters approach but nobody decided to give Ahmed any training with the Viking sword that he clearly cannot use but that's only established AFTER the first fight scene. He says so himself he is no warrior but he drops a few of these monsters no problem. The fights are frequent, dark and unintelligible when they're at their most mediocre. The film descends into a Warcraft style narrative when the characters have to visit some crazy old woman who speaks more sense than she looks like she's able to Kill the leader! she exclaims. Yup, that might work. After seeing off hoards of the monsters who were armed with torches and swords and whom could so easily have taken the allied camp in one swoop if they really tried to, the Vikings and Ahmed make a counteroffensive into the lair; something nobody thought of in centuries gone by. A final word on the closing battle scene absolute crap. A three minute montage of swishing swords and funny faces in slow motion and it's over, as is very briefly after the immediate ending, the audience's will to live.

What Banderas discovers that no one else for the hundreds of years that they've been attacking the Viking villages is that these monsters are actually men, black men; in costume. Yes, racism starts to run a little thick and a little fast here. Boring, faceless, seemingly voodoo obsessed black people who are able to not only control the weather but live in an underground system of caves and such, during which they can survive and develop utopias of rope bridges and democratic systems that govern who are the fighters and who are the leaders they are like human ants who every now and again, like to pop up to the surface and start a bit of bother. Their 'kind' have been doing this for centuries, might I add.And then the genre movie kicks in. The Vikings and Ahmed lie in a circle as the monsters approach but nobody decided to give Ahmed any training with the Viking sword that he clearly cannot use but that's only established AFTER the first fight scene. He says so himself he is no warrior but he drops a few of these monsters no problem. The fights are frequent, dark and unintelligible when they're at their most mediocre. The film descends into a Warcraft style narrative when the characters have to visit some crazy old woman who speaks more sense than she looks like she's able to Kill the leader! she exclaims. Yup, that might work. After seeing off hoards of the monsters who were armed with torches and swords and whom could so easily have taken the allied camp in one swoop if they really tried to, the Vikings and Ahmed make a counteroffensive into the lair; something nobody thought of in centuries gone by. A final word on the closing battle scene absolute crap. A three minute montage of swishing swords and funny faces in slow motion and it's over, as is very briefly after the immediate ending, the audience's will to live. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, History"},{"date":"22 January 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" When adventure films are good, that usually means they are fun. Indiana Jones and The Mummy are good examples of adventure films from recent times that have withstood the short test of contemporary time. Action films cannot help but impose upon additions to the genre; but when you see a bad adventure film, you know it's bad when the narrative is dull and routine; when the action scenes are short and unspectacular and when certain events that occur happen because the genre demands they happen, rather than because the film is trying something new and original.In The Mummy, from the same year; there were these ancient Egyptian beetles that were reminiscent of piranhas only they weren't constricted to water; in the Indiana Jones films, we were given good, constructive bad guys who we enjoyed seeing get pummelled and beaten by the hero; we like the special effects in both films, the characters and the beauty of the locales. In The 13th Warrior, surely the now obvious 'beginning of the end' for director John McTiernan, we are given grubby looking cinematography set amongst a backdrop of boring and uninspiring settings; we are presented with action scenes so dull and unimpressive we actually feel cheated; we are presented with some of the most boring, one-dimensional characters ever committed to an action film and we are insulted with a narrative so plain and so uninteresting that to even repeat it would waste time and insult intelligence.That is to say the actual narrative for The 13th Warrior is just bland and routine. Antonio Banderas plays an Arab with a Spanish accent among a group of Vikings who are portrayed in an equally insulting light. Banderas' character's name is even so long and such a mouthful that it too could be seen as insulting toward the typical Arabic name, in fact it's so long one could assume the writers were playing for laughs more than anything else. Action heroes need a short and sharp name, something cool and sharp to reflect their persona Han Solo, James Bond, Indiana Jones; hell, even Rick O'Donnell would do but we are given Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad? It's no wonder the Vikings laugh at him as we are doing the same. After a very young boy travels the length and breath of the land (the length it takes to learn a new language), seemingly on his own, to deliver a mere message that they are under attack from 'monsters', twelve Vikings take it upon themselves to travel and help out but with one catch the 13th warrior must be foreign. If you can get past the fact this little ancient 'rule' still seems like a necessity to be included in a time of crisis, then you might miss how very handy it is that Ahmed was even there; otherwise who else was going to go? Omar Sharif's character? I'd like to have seen that.Ahmed goes on a journey with these Vikings whom are portrayed as big, disgusting troll like people who wash themselves in each others spit and happily kill one another over the last piece of drumstick at meal times. Likewise, the Arabs seem to have a certain class; a certain sort of swagger that can only be put down to Hispanic Banderas' good looks and Spanish elegance.

He's eccentric about his films (he doesn't like scene selection on his DVDs, as he believes they need to be watched in their entirety every time). I'd seen Twin Peaks before, but my main introduction to Lynch was through this film, it was often brought up in movie discussion, and sparked additional public interest when David Lynch found success globally with Twin Peaks. It still manages to be discussed and anaylized today, so i thought i'd review it.I guess the reason that Blue Velvet along with twin peaks and the elephant man is one of Lynch's favourite films is because its so straight-forward. Its not absurd and hard to access like Mulholland Dr. and Lost Highway (although, some people enjoy those kind of those puzzling movies). The plot centers around Jeffrey (Kyle MacLachlan), a young lad who, whilst in the midst of dealing with his father's recent stroke, discovers a severed ear in a field (yup, a human ear!). Jeffrey befriends Sandy, the daugther of a local detective (Laura Dern), leading him to conduct his own investigation based on her leads. Jeffrey soon finds himself involved in the life of Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a seductive but very mysterious woman tied to Frank (Dennis Hopper), a perverse, evil man at the center of Jeffrey's investigation into the missing ear.In 1986, this film was huge, it was everywhere. It steamed a huge bowel of controversy soup. Probably because it featured perverse, strange and graphic sex, very explicit violence and strong inappropriate language, and Frank Booth -- a very, very dangerous and terrfying man. He is literally the eptimone of evil. He is psycho. As a result of the controversy surronding Booth and the movie, Blue Velvet has received essays, thesis', entire books written on it...so obviously I cant explain the film in the limited amount of space i've got here. As you may have gathered, this is an immensely intense film. Jeffrey, the main protagonist, is just a college kid- his life in suburbia is heavily contrasted to the 'underground' world of drugs, violence and bizarre sex acts he uncovers (there's a lot of clever visual metaphors throughout the film representing this). He has a sweet, clumsy sort of romance blooming with Sandy, but at the same time has a twisted sort of sexual relationship with Dorothy. Sandy is a figure of purity throughout the movie (although not all that pure- she dumps her boyfriend for Jeffrey, and is well-versed in her father's cases), but ultimately the movie hints at the fact that her idea of a happy, loving apple-pie, coffee-drinking society is probably never going to get past the realms of fantasy.The more I write, the more I realise that trying to tell you, in words, why Blue Velvet is such a great movie is somewhat fruitless. It's a movie all about the experience of being slapped around, and a movie built more for post-watching discussion than the initial convincing stage. If you think you can take it (not everyone can, in my experience), slap this into your DVD player, dim the lights and prepare to be shocked by David Lynch's world. It is an unforgettable movie.

Maybe it was because of films like this, which totally turned me off. I guess I figured (I might be wrong) that VanDamme's career had gone down the dumper, if this was any indication. However, you can discredit all of the people involved in the film for its failings, not just Jean- Claude. It was a team effort. For instance, this film had some of the dumbest dialog and worst acting I've ever seen.It also had a convoluted plot. Can anyone make sense of this story? Would anybody want to? It looks like a cheapie Hong Kong flick imitation but one that is trying to be intellectual at the same time. It's all way too much. Actually, it is a Hong Kong flick, with director Hark Tsui in charge, but filmed in Hollywood. One look at the plot line listed here on the IMDb home page should tell you something fashion designer....joins forces with CIA....to stop terrorism. Yeah, right!!! What's next?

Comedy (the kind that is actually funny) and horror (the kind that genuinely scares) are two completely opposite styles and incredibly hard to amalgamate, but Abbott & Costello &#150; and of course the rest of the cast and crew &#150; seemingly pull it off without the slightest form of effort. The gags & clichéd comical situations never once negatively affect the overall horrific themes and settings and, vice versa as well, the horror atmosphere is never an obstacle for the humor.

The script features all the main horror icons and &#150; stunningly enough &#150; they're not caricatures of themselves, the story is engaging and the tone is light-headed. This film is actually a whole lot better than Universal's other attempts to assemble the monsters in one film, like House of Dracula, House of Frankenstein and Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man. Clumsy & easily scared Wilber (Costello) and cynical Chick (Abbott) work as baggage couriers and become unwillingly involved in a mad monster party when they lose track of two relics meant for Mr. McDougal's Museum of the Macabre. Actually, they didn't just lose the relics of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster &#133; they got up and walked away!

Meanwhile, Dracula teams up with the ravishing female scientist Dr. Mornay in a search for a brand & docile set of brains to put into the Frankenstein's monster's skull. And which brains are more suitable for this operation than those of poor old Wilbur? The on screen chemistry between Abbott and Costello is excellent, although that is merely just stating the obvious, but especially their interactions with acclaimed horror icons like Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. are hugely admirable. Bela, Lon and also Glenn Strange as the monster obviously enjoyed being part of this comical film, still they never once mock their own characters and keep their faces straight even during the most absurd situations. Lugosi is at his most evil self again as Dracula (a role he hadn't played since the original 1931 classic) and Chaney once again masterfully depicts his alter ego of the tormented Larry Talbot.

I had thought that Quintet was the nadir of his 1970s film career, but I had forgotten just how atrocious A Wedding is. But then I re-watched Popeye and think that there's a new serious contender.

The film is a shambling mess, with not much discernible plot, and it's almost the exact opposite of the cartoons on which it's based. Those were little jewels of narrative economy -- even a movie made for kids needs to be well written. Robin Williams is a riot as Popeye, and his constant muttering is easily the best thing about the movie. It's also worth watching to see Shelley Duvall in the role she was born to play, and she does it almost too well, making Olive Oyl just as annoying in human form as she was as a cartoon. The Harry Nilsson songs are terrible, and they're not really even songs. Characters occasionally walk around sing\/talking, but the songs, like the film, have no structure and just sort of end. Ray Walston, as Popeye's pappy, infuses the film with some verve, but he enters the picture too late to save it.

That leads me to the second point I would like to make if you didn't know, this film is actually three separate Japanese films edited into one American version.That's what makes this film odd. All the faults lie with the editing, dubbing, scripting... basically all the American added elements (surprise surprise, right?). The animation in the film(s) is great I'm not sure who did the art direction, but it's drastically different from the series' animation, which I always found stiff and repetitive (which, again, might be the result of American editing). The animation in the movies is smooth, dynamic, stylish, and very action packed. It can be compared to the animation in FLCL or the animation in select episodes of Naruto (such as the showdown between Naruto and Sasuke). Everything sort of flows. The character models are a bit more distorted, and it uses darker\/cooler color shadings. The overall effect is very good and entertaining.Unfortunately, the superb action and animation direction is moot when put beside the HORRIBLE dubbing. Saban, like 4Kids is wont to do, chose to drastically alter the original script and writing. Often, side-comments will be added to the dialog for no real reason except, possibly, to cram more dialog into a scene. The jokes are often flat, and distract from the main plot instead of adding to it. If you want a good example of this, watch any of the One Piece episodes translated by 4Kids (i.e. the ones with the crappy rap song opening). It's awful. Thank God Funimation took that show over, but I digress.Speaking of plot, it's bad. Let me clarify the plot for the first two sequences (Greymon vs. Parrotmon and the first digidestined vs. Diaboromon\/Infermon) is actually good, mainly because it's simple. As stand alone movies, the plot would be fine. However, when combined together with the third sequence\/film (featuring the digidestined from season 2 vs. a new digimon named Endigomon), it's bad.

However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this. This movie had all the ingredients to keep to make a recipe for disaster and Scorecse just brighten's it up for us which keeps us hooked. The most funny I found about this movie was that Robert De Niro reminds me of my own ex-boss, his constant nagging and micro-management of everything might seem good to others , but then to the rest of us he just seemed like a control freak and all round ass hole. But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10 You Don't Stay At The Top Forever...

But I guess thats what keeps you in tune with the character because no matter how much we hate it ranting and raving we all know the stuff he is saying is true and oddly enough I thought to my-self thats what really matters in the movie. Joe Pesci was just nothing short of brilliant, I felt that this time he was let of the leash big time and he did provide a lot of the entertainment especially with his 21 F-U rant in just 2 mins! Sharon Stone was brilliant , normally in gangster movies I have noted that the women are either there for eye candy or their presence in the movie is not of a an big or major significance but I was glad to think that it did not happen over here as her performance is note worthy! Scorcese's makes Casino a pseudo-documentary with his clever use of commentary telling us what we all ready know about Vegas but with its use of colours, lights , music and glitz and glamour one is taken in by its hedonism and it because easy to understand how someone got taken into this world of lust,power and deception and greed. Nearly everything I have covered is probably covered in all the other the comments that people have posted on here...but the reason behind is that it is all true . To conclude Casino should be on every film geeks '100 movies to watch before I die list'. The only problem I had was that a few moments in it were a little bit long which made it drag and it is a long movie so do have a clear mind when you watch it.CASINO - 8.8 OUT OF 10 You Don't Stay At The Top Forever... ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 January 2008","score":"","review":" I had bought my-self a copy of Casino a while back ago but never did get round to watching it, however on Sunday I did as I thought I would keep up with my gangster movie phase I am going through, however unfortunately whilst watching it , my disc messed up and I got annoyed as anything (never purchase second hand DVD's). However the very next morning I got up and went to my local rental shop and watched it. All I can say is - WOW!, I mean I thought Goodfella's once probably Scorces's best work but I can probably say he has topped that with this beaut! No one is truly a fan of the gangster genre without paying homage to this.

","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"22 January 2008","score":"9 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Note I talk about scenes in the film so there are MILD spoilers.Yes, Lawrence of Arabia is remembered for desert vistas and sweeping battle scenes. The cinematography is unforgettable, the scale vast. In many ways, it defines epic, but at the center of Lawrence of Arabia there is a real historical person who was also a hero worthy of classical Greek tragedies a man whose virtues are his downfall. A lot of people seem to miss this, and often I think fans of the movie even miss quite why there is nothing else out there like it. Every aspect of the film, from the narrative structure to the staging of shots, revolves around exploring not just what T.E. Lawrence did but why he did it, and what it cost him.The desert is a recurring image, but it's not simply a stunning landscape. Shots linger on vast emptiness, and suggest a blank canvas on which Lawrence can paint whatever he wishes. Profoundly alienated from his family and home culture, Lawrence pulls on the robes and persona of the man he might have been, if he'd been born an Arab. The deeper his insecurities reach, the farther his ambitions must go. He conquers the desert, and the desert conquers him, demanding payment for every personal triumph.The desert and the visuals of Lawrence of Arabia work in relation to the narrative, characters and themes in a way that would be impossible without 70mm film, without the long, lingering shots that make the desert itself a character. The desert shifts and changes, shimmers and conceals, as mysterious and indefinable as Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's performance is mirage-like, with emotions flickering and disappearing. Just as some shots linger on a vast and empty desert, others linger on his face, frozen in a moment of internal conflict.Director David Lean cuts together close-ups and wide-angle shots to reflect the dual nature of his film as vast epic and intimate portrait, as when Lawrence journeys through the furnace heat of the desert to rescue a lost man. Consider the sequence. A speck in the distance; Lawrence's eyes, lit up in relief and vindication; the man, who has expected to die, almost literally rising from the dead; they move toward each other, two specks becoming one; and finally the impersonal specks become human beings again.Robert Bolt's screenplay is elegantly structured to show that the desert exacts a personal price for every public triumph, and that Lawrence's inner and outer identity are constantly in conflict. Lawrence captures a Turkish seaport by crossing the Nefud desert, but this success has required him to execute the very man whose life he just saved from the desert. Returning to Cairo to announce his military triumph, he helplessly watches a young friend drown in quicksand. Grieving and stunned, Lawrence approaches the Suez Canal and is seen by a British motorcyclist. To this man, Lawrence is a speck on the horizon, and when he calls, Who are you? we know this is the very question Lawrence is asking himself. The more Lawrence accomplishes, the more of a stranger he becomes to himself -- an unknown speck in the desert within.Eventually Lawrence must come in from the desert, and rejoin his own race-and-class divided culture. This time, Bolt hides the theme of identity in a way that can only be noticed when the film is seen more than once. At the end of the war, and the movie, a British officer shouts racist insults and slaps Lawrence down to the ground because he is dressed in Arab garb. A few days later, when Lawrence is wearing a British uniform, this same officer is proud to shake Lawrence's hand.Still later -- but seen at the opening of the film, at Lawrence's funeral -- this very British officer professes his great respect for Lawrence and berates a reporter, who really did spend time with Lawrence, for daring to be cynical about him. And the theme of identity comes full circle. Much as Lawrence fought for ideals his own people did not understand and against personal conflicts few would see, Lawrence of Arabia remains a film of many secrets, offering something new to discover on each viewing. It is the dual nature of Lawrence of Arabia, as an epic and as a personal exploration of the mind, that lifts it to a level of poetry made from images and dreams.Ironic that the film is like its hero often celebrated but rarely understood.
