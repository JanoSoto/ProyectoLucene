[{"date":"27 May 2006","score":"","review":" Spoiler regarding Rounders This is a solidly good and entertaining movie. It reminds me of my own poker games with friends, minus the threats of bodily harm.The casting is great and it's very well written; the film showcases how far men will go for their best friend.Overall, I would also recommend two other poker movies. The first is Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, a hilarious movie that shows the brotherhood between men. The other is The Cincinnati Kid. This one is better because you get a better sense that there's some humanity behind the bad guys, and plus, the surprise ending.All good movies.
