We see this in Mallrats, but this film...clerks, his first one is a bit out of the league.First of all the actors can't act, it's a fact. None of them really convinces me. And the script sometimes focuses to much on...nothing that it almost becomes intolerable to watch. Not even the directing is that good in this movie, but I think I speak for all Smith fans when I say that we are willing to forget and forgive most of this when it comes to clerks.Making a movie about two guys talking crap behind the counter of a quickstop is a very original and funny idea, but Smith does not pull this of all the way. He focuses to much on duologue, duologue that you know is very rehearsed, every line is presented with the utter most perfection which makes it less believable. But not all of it is bad, as I said before the idea is very original and some of the jokes really made me laugh.And let's not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive. It's also that fact that makes this movie so good, every aspiring director (including myself) sees this movie and if it weren't there before, now there is hope, hope that someday i will make it big time to. That is what makes this movie so great and thats what makes me love it.May the force be with you...always. Oh, and the Empire strikes back is way better than return of the Jedi.

Now, years later, I got a hold of a copy almost by accident, and watched it again. Being a kid, you don't really have the ability to procure things for yourself that you want, that is usually a prerogative of your parents - but when I watched it again now I felt sorry that I did not do more to get a copy of this movie back then, and consequently almost forgot about it until today.This really is a beautiful movie. It tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a hard-edged, misfit kid - who takes his cues from his horrible, abusive mother - and his neighbor, a slightly younger boy who has AIDS.Right, you say. Another one of those. A tear jerker. A bucket movie. A morality tail. Yeah, I know, I hate those too. Only this one isn't. It is one of the very few movies among those many I have seen that pulls off a very rare trick it conveys a truly sad story (and yes, a morality tale) but without a single moment where it feels cheesy, forced or in any other way hollywoody. It shows a REAL relationship between two REAL boys, who interact as REAL kids do. And through that interaction the good-natured, loving character of the older boy, Eric, starts to shine through his tough-guy persona, as he takes on a kind of big-brotherly care for Dexter, his HIV-positive younger neighbor. Together, they embark on an adventure to find a cure - which to Erik seems to be just around the corner - so that all this silly AIDS thing will go away and they can be friends forever.The production is top notch. But, of course, what really carries this movie, is the performances of the two leads - Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello. Especially Mazzello, who is simply stunning - he does convey a sense of frailty needed for an ailing boy, but at the same time he manages to make Dexter a truly energetic and determined character. He shines at the scene where the boys confront Pony his impulse to protect his older friend lunges him forth, drives him to say what he says - and only afterwards, the horror is depicted on his face, as he realizes that what he himself said is true his blood is poison... Renfro also has his moments, in particular the scenes with his mother he depicts perfectly how this macho, street-wise kid is left completely frozen and numb when faced with his abusive, storming mother, and can't get a word in to contradict her as she forbids his relationship with the ailing boy out of her fear and ignorance. Annabella Sciorra also gives a memorable performance as Dexter's mother, who ultimately becomes, in a sense, a mother figure to Erik as well.I've first seen this film when I was at school back in America, and loved it - not at all a given concerning movies of this sort. But the behavior of the kids in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Ironically enough, the teacher who had shown us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still in touch with her) got in trouble for it, as some uptight parent complained about it having the scene when the two boys are looking at a Playboy... Pathetic. Seriously, will Americans ever get over this ridiculous phobia, I do not know. There was a hardly-distinguishable shot of a playboy cover in the movie and thus it is not shown in schools... how sad. Kids need to see this movie. It is more inspiring and educational than all the official after-school specials put together.Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm rambling, but nevertheless... The score. It's great. I am a musician, and as such I know Dave Grusin from his records he is a well known Jazz pianist and record producer. Up until this movie I really did not know that he did movie scores as well, even though when I later checked I found out that I had unknowingly watched several movies he worked on. Really, a wonderful job there.All in all, a solid Ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can use watching a film like this among all the standard special-effect hysteria they usually see.

News of the strange phenomenon quickly spreads & government agent Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) is there giving out orders before anyone knows whats hit them, everyone seems baffled as the area in which the strange occurrence has happened is clearly defined, very odd. Suddenly at six O'clock, four hours after the initial black-out, everything & everyone regains consciousness. However the oddness doesn't stop there as the local quack Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) quickly realises that a large number of the female population of Midwich are pregnant including the local virgin (there's always one...), pregnancy's that stem from the day of the black-out. The months pass & the babies are born but as they grow into children there definitely seems to be something wrong with them & why re so may of the townspeople having 'accidents' & committing suicide...Directed by John Carpenter I thought Village of the Damned was an OK time waster but it didn't exactly knock my socks off. The script by David Himmelstein was based on the original Village of the Damned (1960) which I have seen & the first obvious difference is that it is now set in an American town & not an English village which was the setting that served the original so well. While the film moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't that boring as a whole Ididn't think it worked, the character played by Kirstie Alley for instance seems only to be included so Capenter can use her whenever the need for some scientific exposition is called for even though the origins of the children are never really made clear although the script hints at aliens. Many of the other character's also feel surplus to requirements except to be killed off by the children for the most minor of reasons which never convince, I mean why make your mum put her hand in a pot of boiling water? Think about it, why? There's no reason whatsoever. It's watchable for sure, in fact when I think about it one reason why I may not have much love for this is because I've seen the original which this follows quite closely so the story wasn't particularly surprising & I sort of knew where everything was going.Director Carpenter has a fine CV of horror & sci-fi to his name although I doubt Village of the Damned will be anywhere near the top of it. It's fairly ironic when you consider that Carpenter directed possibly the greatest remake ever when he helmed The Thing (1982) which was a brilliant retelling of The Thing from Another World (1951). Unfortunately the children themselves inspire bouts of laughter rather than fear, they look absolutely terrible with white hair & glowing eyes. The film lacks scares & atmosphere & is a bit flat.With a supposed budget of about $22,000,000 I was amazed when I found out, where did all the money go? It looks more like an average made-for-TV film than a 20 plus million Hollywood blockbuster. The acting is so-so, Village of the Damned is probably the only film where you will see Luke Skywalker & Superman together...Village of the Damned is an OK film, I didn't think much of it & I doubt I'd watch it again.

One hopes this isn't representative of the entire country.The movie also has as one of the characters an older trumpet player who is portrayed as a religious man who wears crosses and says the Lord told him to do this and do that. Hen then proceeds to have sex with every female in the group. Talk about anti-religious cheap shot. Well, that's typical of filmmakers.In a nutshell great music, fairly interesting story, but profane, blasphemous and full of scummy people.

You hear about drug-related problems on the TV, the newspaper, the radio and the general media as a whole. It has become a media sensation, governments are supposedly trying their best to stop it and police forces are supposedly tackling the problem down to the core. A lot of people see the drug epidemic as something that is communicated through small triangles coming via low-life street gangs corrupted by poverty. Now when tackling a problem like drug trafficking to the core a word such as corruption is a central key to the problem. Traffic proves just how big the drugs ring is and that it is a triangle that is constantly moving.Traffic is a study of social dilemmas that are faced in the recent war on drug trafficking. The film puts forth so many details of how everyone is affected by the problem. Traffic, unlike other drug films like Trainspotting or Requiem For A Dream that focus on the soul affects of humans Traffic's heart is set on showing the involvement on everything. It's a wonderful anti-drug film that shows the tackling and breeding of the problem. The film's gritty nature is needed to create the fast-paced style, the fade in\/fade out editing is usually perfectly and does not detract the viewer from the story. Everything is crafted with elegance; the story manages to work around the script with an astonishing amount of pressure.Traffic personifies film-making and with what is easily some of the finest direction from the 21st century it will remain a highly reminiscent work of film. Stephen Soderbergh is a director who I've personally never been a fan of, but Traffic stands out as a tour de force example of highly challenging cinema. The direction grips you; it captures the persevering and dirty nature needed for the film. The excellent editing and screen-transitions show tremendous skill at the art of film-making. The use of colours to distinguish the different stories works as a brilliant metaphor. The wonderful soundtrack accompanies scenes with a polished style, each song or piece of music is chosen to fit each scene flawlessly.The cast is one of the best casts to ever come out of cinema in recent years. With the likes of Benicio Del Toro, Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Don Cheadle and Dennis Quaid you may expect the film to feel very mainstream Hollywood. Yet it doesn't and each actor manages to pull off their performances with the needed emotional power. Benicio Del Toro gives the best performance of his career (along with the latter 21 Grams) managing to create a believable character who reacts to a situation with the needed realistic response. He becomes his character throughout the film's two and a half hours running time, which never fails to lose its grip nor fall into pacing\/structure problems. The other shining performance is that of Catherine Zeta Jones who gives a highly poignant performance reminiscing one of Oscar material. Overall it's Benicio Del Toro who steals the show, deserving his Oscar with what is a genuinely effortless example of brilliance.Traffic gives the viewer morals through conflict; it's a film that should be taught in schools as it shows the ultimate effects of what drugs do to our society. It puts fourth many questions of ethics, values and responsibilities in a controlled and sophisticated manner. The substantial amount of dialogue that the film relies on manages to remain an absorbing cinematic device helping to understand the character's current situations and pasts. It's sharp and digs down to the point, seeing as that's what is needed the film succeeds in another area of greatness.One of the greatest films of the decade so far, a film not to be missed and one that forges a mile-stone in direction.

Of course if potential perpetrators did that, then Agatha Christie would run fresh out of story ideas.As he often does Poirot just happens to be on the seen when a very filthy rich American heiress, the Paris Hilton of the Thirties is shot and killed while on a honeymoon on a Nile cruise.There's sure no lack of suspects.

But witnesses pop up and that's where things go awry. David Niven is on the scene as well. Poirot's normal Watson, Hastings is not accompanying him so Niven pinch hits.

Actually, everything that I wrote doesn't even have to be said because at such small distance between fighters, it is Impossible to use missiles. Only guns would be able to be used. Missiles are absolutely useless at such small distances. This is Top Gun kind of crap.Not to mention that over the years, many real-life simulations in air have showed that MIG29 has unmatchable maneuverability over F15 in a close air to air combat.

By turns the story is really only plausible in mostly 'movie-logic', but in the veneer of this being something that could actually happen. I'm not sure if ransom cases happen this way, where the father of the child changes his mind and takes away the ransom to make into a bounty on the kidnapper's head. But it makes for a pretty neat contrivance that is unfortunately surrounded by a couple of others that are pretty glaringly insipid. If there is one reason aside from the hit and miss storyline, it's the acting, with Gibson being his conflicted hero role of the father, who just wants his son back as his only need. Sinise, playing the villain, is a little less believable but does what he can in a villain role. He's really quite nuts, in fact, as he hides it with his veneer of professionalism- it's his show, he tells his underlings-in-crime (including Lili Taylor and Liev Schreiber)- and will stop at nothing to get HIS money from a guy, as he says, pays up.Sometimes there are great scenes even when Sinise isn't really as good at playing this kind of role as he is playing a conflicted good guy himself (or shattered OK guy) like in Forrest Gump. One I really liked a lot was when Gibson had to drive to drop off the money the first time, and as Sinise follows him he goes on and on talking through his walkie-talkie, with a dead-pan infliction on the voice about the film the Time Machine and how it relates to him and Gibson's character. It's not the usual thing I would see in a movie like this. The scene that follows this though, when Gibson suddenly realizes what's 'really' up with these guys- that they won't pay up- due to Wahlberg's character's folly (should've remembered an address), is a little more typical with helicopters over a setting like a coal-workers area, with the music pumping hard and fast. It's interesting to see a director like Ron Howard working from one very good scene to just a standard one, but then again Howard's better with actors and characterization than he is at doing highly-charged action set-pieces (see the DaVinci Code for more details).What drives Ransom to be a better fare than it could've been, and why I kept on watching, was it had a solid cast (aside from Gibson in his determined and headstrong role where he goes through a big change, there's Russo as the upside-down mother of the kid and Delroy Lindo who might be the best of the group as the main hostage negotiator-type person behind the scenes). What we end up with is a film that isn't totally satisfying, but has many emotionally charged scenes and moments that do connect, like the aftermath with Sinise and his partners after the first bothced attempt to get the money. Or, more crucially, the final phone call between Gibson and Sinsise- the GIVE ME BACK MY SON scene- that does really stretch the bounds to get manipulative with the audience. So, the problem then? Logistics really (and this is why I have a spoiler warning up) why would Sinise go back to Gibson's HOUSE, as opposed to somewhere else like his office? Wouldn't he think his son- whom he got back to him via killing off his underlings and calling it in- would be there and might recognize his voice at least? It's a really iffy bit that sets up the ultra-violent climax that I irked me.That being said, it's worth checking out Ransom to see, at least two-thirds of the time, how to do a professional type of thriller where psychology is meant to take as much precedence as the suspense. We get a good shot of that, if maybe a little too slick for it's own good.

These are indeed rather odd films, because the film-makers have not failed to include every cliché of the genre they could, and yet boldly include wild innovations that are completely anachronistic, having absolutely nothing to do with the Chambara tradition, nor with the older tradition of samurai-folklore. In that respect, they paved the way for many of the fantasy ninja and samurai films that followed, and which constitute most of the B-movie entries in the Japanese cinema of the past ten years. While the anachronisms most noticeable are the gimmicky weapons (packed inside the baby-cart, no less), what may truly offend a traditionalist here (and I guess I'm one of these) are the personalities of the characters involved, who talk and act like 1960s street yakusa pretending to be samurai.But what makes these anachronisms striking is that they are presented in films that take themselves just SO seriously, there is hardly ever a moment's humor, and rarely does any character even smile. And to be sure, the Japan depicted in these films is so dark, so filled with vile corruptions - physical, legal, spiritual - that it's difficult to understand why all these characters just don't commit seppuku and get it over with.This particular film has recently been re-released on DVD.

The violence in these films is graphic almost beyond belief; Lone Wolf cultists are clearly impressed with it, others may feel it is so overdone it borders on self-parody.

One very memorable scene towards the beginning of the movie involved an ambush of a battalion of German tanks and soldiers. I was very impressed with the way it was executed.

I truly appreciate the Germans actually speak German with sub titles and the sometimes arrogant sometimes humble George C. Scott who played the role of the general.

I am also a drama major, have been in numerous Shakespeare productions, and have cut Shakespeare plays myself for directing. I am writing a term paper on this movie. Kenneth did an unbelievable job at this movie. Yes, he did cut many, many lines as the woman before me stated, but he did so brilliantly. Watch the scene between Beatrice and Benedict at the beginning and you will realize that this movie kept everything juicy, nothing stale. Kenneth took certain lines (none to be spoiled here!) and gave them a completely new, fresh meaning that did not detract from the original intent! Branagh's casting list reads as a Who's talented in Hollywood and beyond, with his now ex-wife Emma Thompson playing deliciously opposite him as Beatrice; Robert Sean Leonard (who has since learned much about acting and is fantastic in the series House, MD.) and Kate Beckinsale as the sweet, if not too interesting Claudio and Hero; Denzel is princely as can be, I personally find objections against him to be petty, he knows how to do Shakespeare naturally, without pretensions behind the language. As Leonato and his brother are staples Richard Briers and Brian Blessed, both of whom Branagh uses in almost all if not every film he makes. The supporting cast was fantastic, Michael Keaton as Dogberry is one of the most perfect performances ever seen, and the only odd choice is, as stated before, Keanu. Dear god Keanu sucks. The lack of emotion in his voice, whether he is melancholy or not is appalling. You really wonder how this man was casted. Oh well, he really might be the only short-coming of the film, his scenes are almost unbearable. Overall, delight yourself in the gorgeous cinematic experience, with a perfect score, wonderfully new ways of looking at Shakespeare, and some truly perfect acting.
