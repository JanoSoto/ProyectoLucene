[{"date":"1 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Election is just what a comical movie should be.  It's hilarious, smart, witty, and, incredibly, really gets you thinking.Whoever did casting for this movie did one heck of a job.  I feel like the main characters gave their best performances ever in this movie.  Reese Witherspoon is FANTASTIC as Tracey Flick, the over-overachieving girl running for the election.  One minute, you feel like slapping accross the face, the next you feel incredibly sorry for her.  She flips back and forth from being a villian to the victim effortlessly.  Matthew Broderick gives a memorable performance as the 'sabatoging' teacher.  By the end of the movie, you're not quite sure if you love him or hate him!What I love about Election most is the fact that it's a smart comedy.  It's not at all like any other teen movie...in fact, it's a teen movie that's not made for teens.  Now, after watching this movie dozens of times, I've picked up on things that aren't in any other movie.  The director obviously paid close attention to every detail, right down to the Pepsi theme.  The whole movie questions the ethics and the morals of the characters.Be warned...this isn't a movie that you'll find yourself in stitches over. But I guarantee that you'll have a smile watching it...and for a while after! ","genre":null},{"date":"1 August 2002","score":"","review":"  Election is just what a comical movie should be.
