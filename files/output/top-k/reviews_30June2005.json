I certainly didn't. I thought I knew what to expect one of the most boring experiences of my life. Well I was as wrong as I haven't been wrong too often yet, because this is one of the best, most realistic and honest Hollywood films I've ever seen...Giving a short resume of The Straight Story isn't very difficult. It's about an old and stubborn man who steps on his lawn mower and drives off to another state to pay his brother a visit when he hears that the man has had a severe stroke. That's already special on itself, but what makes it even more special is the fact that he hasn't seen his brother in ten years because of some stupid argument. In the meantime he has his share of bad luck and problems, but he also meets a lot of people whose lives he influences in one way or another with his philosophical approach to life. Despite all the difficulties he drives on for weeks, not knowing if he will reach his goal seeing his brother again before it's too late...I can easily understand why there are people who don't like this movie and that's also the reason why I will not say that these people don't have a heart or things like that... This movie hasn't got any flashy action scenes, it is as slow as the lawn mower the man is driving on and no, you don't have to watch it for the nice soundtrack either, because there isn't any. But why should you watch it then? Well, the simple answer is the story. I haven't seen such a touching movie with such a powerful story very often and the fact that this actually comes from Hollywood and - to make things even better - from the Disney Studio's (that's right, the same studios that overwhelm us with sugar sweet nonsense) makes it even more special. I'm not ashamed to admit that I had the tears in my eyes a couple of times while watching it, probably because the whole situation of not seeing someone for many years because of some stupid argument is all too realistic for me.Some people will argue that the story is very shallow, but I really don't agree with that. Perhaps it is because they only see that old man driving on his lawn mower and don't want to think any further. If you look close enough than you'll understand that this man is doing all this because he knows he has once been wrong, that only his pride stood in the way of seeing his brother again and that he wants everybody else to see that too, so they won't make the same mistake. If that isn't deep enough, how much deeper does a story have to go for you then? I would also like to add that this movie really had it all. Some beautiful landscapes (finally an American movie that shows something else than the skyline of New York, Chicago or some other big city), some very fine acting by Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek,... and a very understandable way of telling despite the fact that this is a David Lynch movie. I know now that I was completely wrong by assuming that this movie wouldn't be to my taste. It's one of the very best movies I've seen in a long time. This movie aimed for my heart and hit the bull's eye. I give it the full 10\/10.

His best moments come -When he explains to two men in advertising his idea for a Tiger Woods commercial -After he talks to his wife on the pay phone for the first time but before he checks his messages at work-When he talks on a pay phone for the second time-And near the end.Ben Affleck doesn't have any standout moments like these, in my opinion, but he does a good job overall. The other major actors also deliver, especially those playing Doyle's wife, Doyle's friend from AA, and the hacker (who was deliciously evil).But the movie is well written. And very complicated. Both male leads face moral dilemmas that each could have been the plot line for separate movies, even if the two characters had never encountered each other. The accident and the revenge plots just add to the excitement level. And the writers didn't just give us a simple 'You got me, so I'm going to get you worse' sequence of events. Both characters had numerous opportunities to forgive and forget if they could just be mature. This was also true with the plot lines that would have had nothing to do with the accident.And of course a movie like this serves two purposes.

At the same time, we are shown that these actions do have consequences, and we learn that we shouldn't act impulsively. (Or should.) The excitement level did not stay consistently high, because this was not really an action movie. But the tension stayed constant most of the time, and we were given the occasional energetic scene.

Watching Rob, played charmingly and realistically by John Cusack, mature as he traces his life through music and various romantic entanglements is a joy.The central message of the movie seems to me to be that relationships take work. Well, duh, you may be saying. But this film illuminates that point, showing each of Rob's formative (or, as he puts it, All-Time, Desert-Island Top Five) relationships, why they went wrong, and, to a certain degree, how they could have gone right.Rob's most important relationship is with music--it's his true love, and the film treats it as a character. Given the choice between his girlfriend and his record collection, the viewer is left with no doubt which Rob would choose--music, hands down. This disregard for human feelings that Rob shows throughout much of the movie proves something else as much as we may like him, Rob's kind of a jerk. It is a testament to the heart of this film, the strength of the story, and the talent of its large, varied cast that High Fidelity emerged a thoughtful, funny movie, rather than an annoying pity-party about its main character.I recommend this movie to everyone.

Most of the time the directors try too hard, spoiling everything and making me loose all interest after about 30 minutes. This time however, it was a completely different case. Gregory Hoblit, the man who also made the interesting movie Primal Fear, but who hasn't made many movies since, has done a good job with an interesting story and some very good actors...Fallen starts with the execution of the serial killer Edgar Reese. Now that Detective John Hobbes knows that the man is dead, he's convinced that all his troubles are over. But when people get killed by someone who uses the same method Reese once used and several people he knows and people on the street, start to sing the same tune that Reese sang in the gas chamber,... he knows something is wrong. As Hobbes follows up the last clues Reese left, an evil presence called Azazel, moves from one person to another, coming closer to Hobbes and threatening everyone he holds dear in the world...I know all this may sound rather unbelievable. A fallen angel, praying on an honest cop, does indeed seem a bit too far-fetched and typically Hollywood, but what is more important this time is that it all works. I was interested from the beginning until the end, not only thanks to the story, but also thanks to the very good acting by Denzel Washington, Donald Sutherland, James Gandolfini and (the in my opinion underrated) John Goodman. They were the real stars in this movie and they made it all work, but it was Elias Koteas who stole the show with his short appearance as Edgar Reese.Of course many people will be disappointed by the lack of any big and spectacular action scenes. If you are looking for that in a movie, than you better leave this one alone. This movie doesn't really use any special effects or big explosions, it almost entirely depends on the acting and the storyline, although the direction and the way this movie was shot give it something extra too. Overall this movie certainly deserves to be seen by a larger public, especially when they are interested in thrillers with the presence of evil and demons as a subject. I liked it and that's why I give it a 7.5\/10.

There have been made several excellent Vietnam movies (think for instance of Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Platoon,...) and that sometimes makes me doubt if there is still room for one more. But there are of course many aspects that haven't been shown too often yet and one of those is the training. The only movie that has focused on the training before is Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's version of the Vietnam war and I guess that's the best movie to compare this one with.Tigerland shows how a platoon of recruits arrives in Ft. Polk for infantry training before leaving for war. The war has almost been lost and many try to avoid being send over there, but before it even gets that far they will have to get through their final week which takes place in Tigerland, a swamp similar to Vietnam. One of the recruits is Roland Bozz. He keeps getting into trouble and being thrown in jail because of his rebellious behavior, but he also gets a lot of respect from his comrades as he helps misfits to get discharges. And even though he has some leadership capacities, not everybody likes him. One sociopath in his platoon will try to get rid of him, making Tigerland almost as dangerous as the war itself...What I missed most about this movie were the actual battle scenes. You only get to see the training, but you don't know how they manage in Vietnam. Will they be able to survive, who gets killed or wounded,... nothing of that can be found in the movie and that's also the main reason why I have some difficulties with calling this a war movie.However, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't any good. This movie has plenty of good things to offer so you'll stay interested until the last moment. Despite the lack of many known names, the acting certainly is worth noticing. Colin Farrell is probably the best-known, but the other actors certainly don't have to be ashamed of what they did in this movie either. Overall this movie certainly isn't as good as Full Metal Jacket, but as a character study it isn't bad. Thanks to the good acting, this movie overcomes the lack of a larger story and makes it more than OK to fill an hour and a half with. I give this movie a score between 7\/10 and 7.5\/10.

This movie has plenty of good things to offer so you'll stay interested until the last moment. Despite the lack of many known names, the acting certainly is worth noticing. Colin Farrell is probably the best-known, but the other actors certainly don't have to be ashamed of what they did in this movie either. Overall this movie certainly isn't as good as Full Metal Jacket, but as a character study it isn't bad. Thanks to the good acting, this movie overcomes the lack of a larger story and makes it more than OK to fill an hour and a half with. I give this movie a score between 7\/10 and 7.5\/10.

There have been made several excellent Vietnam movies (think for instance of Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter, Platoon,...) and that sometimes makes me doubt if there is still room for one more. But there are of course many aspects that haven't been shown too often yet and one of those is the training. The only movie that has focused on the training before is Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's version of the Vietnam war and I guess that's the best movie to compare this one with.Tigerland shows how a platoon of recruits arrives in Ft. Polk for infantry training before leaving for war. The war has almost been lost and many try to avoid being send over there, but before it even gets that far they will have to get through their final week which takes place in Tigerland, a swamp similar to Vietnam. One of the recruits is Roland Bozz. He keeps getting into trouble and being thrown in jail because of his rebellious behavior, but he also gets a lot of respect from his comrades as he helps misfits to get discharges. And even though he has some leadership capacities, not everybody likes him. One sociopath in his platoon will try to get rid of him, making Tigerland almost as dangerous as the war itself...What I missed most about this movie were the actual battle scenes.

With Albino Alligator, Kevin Spacey made his debut and he certainly had some good actors to work with. But good actors aren't enough, what you need is a strong story.Albino Alligator has nothing to do with a white reptile with red eyes. It tells the story of three petty thieves who are chased by the police after the alarm went of at the place where they wanted to break in.

But what they don't know is that the police isn't looking for them, but for one of the hostages who is actually a Canadian criminal. They see no other option to get out of their but by using a trick called the Albino Alligator, they will have to sacrifice a couple of their hostages to get out of there alive and stay out of the hands of the police...As a debut this isn't a bad movie, but it never reaches to a high level. The main reason for that is because the story isn't all that good. It uses too many clichés and doesn't offer any exceptional material for the director and his actors to work with.

West Side Story, however, does not just borrow Shakespeare's basic theme but also follows the outlines of his plot, while turning it into a musical and updating it to the New York of the fifties. The Montagues and the Capulets become two rival street gangs, the Jets (white) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican). The two young lovers are Tony, one of the Jets, and Maria, the sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Apart from the lovers' parents, most of Shakespeare's main characters have their equivalents in the film. Bernardo is Tybalt, Riff (Tony's close friend and the leader of the Jets) Mercutio and Tony's elderly employer Doc Friar Lawrence. Maria's older confidante Anita has some of the characteristics of Juliet's Nurse, but she has another role as Bernardo's girlfriend. Many of the important scenes from the play also have their equivalents; thus the dance in the gym parallels the Capulets' ball, the scene on the fire escape the balcony scene, and so on. West Side Story is not simply a musical; it also deals with two important social issues, racism and juvenile delinquency. The two issues are, in this context, seen to be connected. The influx of Hispanic immigrants into New York at this period led to friction between them and the established population, even though many of that population were themselves of recent immigrant stock. Many of the Puerto Rican characters complain of having met with prejudice and discrimination, which reinforces their own prejudices against white Americans. Bernardo resents being referred to as a Spick, but he has no compunction about referring to the Polish-American Tony by the equally derogatory term Polack. The witty number Gee Officer Krupke humorously satirises fashionable psychological and sociological theories about the causes of delinquency, but the film also puts forward a theory of its own. Membership of the racially exclusive youth gangs is portrayed as being a means of strengthening one's sense of racial identity as well as one's sense of one's own importance. The Jets' slogan Little boy, you're a man; little man, you're a king has been described as encapsulating in one line the seductive appeal of fascist ideology. When the two gangs clash, they are not motivated merely by youthful aggression but also see themselves as defending the honour of their respective communities. The film is therefore both a tragic love-story and a piece of social commentary. This dual nature is reflected both in the look of the film and in its music. The songs fall into two categories. Those dealing with the love of Tony and Maria are generally traditional melodic ballads such as Tonight and A Place for Us. There are also, however, a number of songs which comment on social issues, and these, such as Gee Officer Krupke, America or The Jets Song are harder-edged, characterised by more modernistic harmonies and rhythms and witty or sardonic lyrics. Besides two distinct styles of music, the film also makes use of two distinct palettes. The more tender scenes between Tony and Maria are mostly shot against a dark background relieved by pale whites and yellows. In those scenes dealing with tragedy, violence or strong emotions, (such as the dance at the gym or the rumble) hotter colours, particularly reds, predominate. When, after Bernardo's death, Tony and Maria sing There's a place for us, the red light in the background casts an ominous shadow over their love, at odds with the optimistic words they are singing. In the tragic final scene Maria, previously seen in white or yellow, wears a red dress for the first time. This final scene is the only occasion on which the plot of the film diverges markedly from Shakespeare's. This was presumably done in order to increase the dramatic tension. Like Romeo, Tony wrongly believes that the woman he loves is dead. At this point those viewers familiar with Shakespeare will probably assume, as I did, that the film will end with Tony committing suicide in despair and Maria following him. Then Tony sees Maria, realises his error, and for a brief instant we hope that a happy ending is after all possible, only for these hopes to be dashed almost immediately. This brief revival of hope does, however, add to the emotional power of the ending. I felt that the two leading roles could have been better. Richard Beymer makes Tony too bland, the sort of young man who would be more at home in the Boy Scouts than in a gang of street fighters. There was nothing particularly wrong with Natalie Wood's Maria except that she seemed rather one-dimensional, charming and sweetly innocent but lacking depth. I found myself regretting that Audrey Hepburn (the producers' first choice for the role) had not been available. Despite that reservation, however, this is one of the great film musicals. Leonard Bernstein's score is brilliant and the song lyrics are both witty and pertinent, often driving home the film's points as well as, or better than, the spoken dialogue. The ensemble dance numbers are the most powerful and energetic of those in any musical that I have seen, with the possible exception of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Although there had been a growing trend in the fifties to use the musical as a vehicle for more than just lighthearted amusement, West Side Story was the film that, more than any other, showed that it was possible to use the genre to combine entertainment with social comment. The contrast between this film and Bernstein's previous film musical, the fluffy On the Town, shows how much the genre had developed in only twelve years. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There have been numerous films, from Broken Arrow to Snow Falling on Cedars, which have made use of the Romeo and Juliet theme of two lovers from opposite sides of a divided community.

Membership of the racially exclusive youth gangs is portrayed as being a means of strengthening one's sense of racial identity as well as one's sense of one's own importance. The Jets' slogan Little boy, you're a man; little man, you're a king has been described as encapsulating in one line the seductive appeal of fascist ideology. When the two gangs clash, they are not motivated merely by youthful aggression but also see themselves as defending the honour of their respective communities. The film is therefore both a tragic love-story and a piece of social commentary. This dual nature is reflected both in the look of the film and in its music. The songs fall into two categories. Those dealing with the love of Tony and Maria are generally traditional melodic ballads such as Tonight and A Place for Us. There are also, however, a number of songs which comment on social issues, and these, such as Gee Officer Krupke, America or The Jets Song are harder-edged, characterised by more modernistic harmonies and rhythms and witty or sardonic lyrics. Besides two distinct styles of music, the film also makes use of two distinct palettes. The more tender scenes between Tony and Maria are mostly shot against a dark background relieved by pale whites and yellows. In those scenes dealing with tragedy, violence or strong emotions, (such as the dance at the gym or the rumble) hotter colours, particularly reds, predominate. When, after Bernardo's death, Tony and Maria sing There's a place for us, the red light in the background casts an ominous shadow over their love, at odds with the optimistic words they are singing. In the tragic final scene Maria, previously seen in white or yellow, wears a red dress for the first time. This final scene is the only occasion on which the plot of the film diverges markedly from Shakespeare's. This was presumably done in order to increase the dramatic tension. Like Romeo, Tony wrongly believes that the woman he loves is dead. At this point those viewers familiar with Shakespeare will probably assume, as I did, that the film will end with Tony committing suicide in despair and Maria following him. Then Tony sees Maria, realises his error, and for a brief instant we hope that a happy ending is after all possible, only for these hopes to be dashed almost immediately. This brief revival of hope does, however, add to the emotional power of the ending. I felt that the two leading roles could have been better. Richard Beymer makes Tony too bland, the sort of young man who would be more at home in the Boy Scouts than in a gang of street fighters. There was nothing particularly wrong with Natalie Wood's Maria except that she seemed rather one-dimensional, charming and sweetly innocent but lacking depth. I found myself regretting that Audrey Hepburn (the producers' first choice for the role) had not been available. Despite that reservation, however, this is one of the great film musicals. Leonard Bernstein's score is brilliant and the song lyrics are both witty and pertinent, often driving home the film's points as well as, or better than, the spoken dialogue. The ensemble dance numbers are the most powerful and energetic of those in any musical that I have seen, with the possible exception of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Although there had been a growing trend in the fifties to use the musical as a vehicle for more than just lighthearted amusement, West Side Story was the film that, more than any other, showed that it was possible to use the genre to combine entertainment with social comment. The contrast between this film and Bernstein's previous film musical, the fluffy On the Town, shows how much the genre had developed in only twelve years. 9\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"30 June 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There have been numerous films, from Broken Arrow to Snow Falling on Cedars, which have made use of the Romeo and Juliet theme of two lovers from opposite sides of a divided community. West Side Story, however, does not just borrow Shakespeare's basic theme but also follows the outlines of his plot, while turning it into a musical and updating it to the New York of the fifties. The Montagues and the Capulets become two rival street gangs, the Jets (white) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican). The two young lovers are Tony, one of the Jets, and Maria, the sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Apart from the lovers' parents, most of Shakespeare's main characters have their equivalents in the film. Bernardo is Tybalt, Riff (Tony's close friend and the leader of the Jets) Mercutio and Tony's elderly employer Doc Friar Lawrence. Maria's older confidante Anita has some of the characteristics of Juliet's Nurse, but she has another role as Bernardo's girlfriend. Many of the important scenes from the play also have their equivalents; thus the dance in the gym parallels the Capulets' ball, the scene on the fire escape the balcony scene, and so on. West Side Story is not simply a musical; it also deals with two important social issues, racism and juvenile delinquency. The two issues are, in this context, seen to be connected. The influx of Hispanic immigrants into New York at this period led to friction between them and the established population, even though many of that population were themselves of recent immigrant stock. Many of the Puerto Rican characters complain of having met with prejudice and discrimination, which reinforces their own prejudices against white Americans. Bernardo resents being referred to as a Spick, but he has no compunction about referring to the Polish-American Tony by the equally derogatory term Polack.

I've already seen several in a couple of weeks time and I'm sure that many more will follow. That doesn't always make it easy to give a movie a good chance of course. After a while they all start to look a bit the same and then it can be good for this movies to be somewhat more original in their approach to the subject of love.Return to Me certainly succeeds in that department because it doesn't start with being all happy and great. When Bob Rueland's wife, with who he has a very good time, gets killed in a tragic car accident, her heart is used to save the life of Grace Briggs, a waitress at a local Italian restaurant. Both try to make the best of their lives after this tragic event, until they meet each other in the restaurant. Bob doesn't know that his wife's heart saved Grace's life, but immediately feels some kind of attraction to her. They fall in love with each other, but when Grace finds out the truth, she doesn't know whether she should tell him that she got the heart from his wife or not, whether she should stay or leave...As a story this certainly works, although you need some imagination to believe that all the things happening in this movie could actually be true. (Normally they don't tell where the heart comes from and that it stays in the same city is far from certain as it goes to the first person with the correct blood type on the waiting list). But I want to see past that for once and than I must say that it certainly isn't bad. What also worked for me was the acting. Especially Minnie Driver did a nice job. Personally I found David Duchovny a bit miscasted, although I don't really have another name to play the role.Overall this isn't a bad example of a romantic comedy \/ drama, although it isn't always perfect. In my opinion the best thing in this movie were the old men in the restaurant (the friends of Grace's father), they were very funny and made me forget about most flaws in the story.
