Okay, okay. I'll stop with the superlative negatives. Surely there have been worse, and, yes, off the top of my head, I can think of many that are worse. However, for a book that over 125 million people have read, and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history, and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises, and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation, I am more than severely disappointed. I know that, had it not been so overhyped, it would have been just as bad. Now, however, my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come.I go into an in depth criticism, but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words. There is hardly a piece of it that I liked. As a film, it was poorly edited, poorly acted (by most), poorly filmed. The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom, although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever. The Quidditch game, which has been hyped to all heaven, is completely boring and poorly created. It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop. When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film, Christopher Columbus, who, I must say, lives up to his reputation completely, begins to edit furiously. I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13. My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game, no matter how exciting it might have been. I'm still not sure which story to buy.But the person I really want to tear into is J.K. Rowling. What a hack. Never has the word hack been more fitting. A former waitress, her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names. Only in the mind of a psychopath (or idiot) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever. Writing children's literature is not difficult, but this is simply awful. She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow, especially in the exposition. The game of Quidditch, which seems to be a drawing point of some sort, is absolutely nonsensical. As a preteen, I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces. Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time, unless someone catches a special type of ball, which ends the game immediately. So theoretically, the game could end in thirty seconds. And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all. And let's talk about the surprise climax. Really, anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end. It is tremendously unclever. And the penultimate sequence, where the crown is awarded to the best dorm, is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin, We only hate one of them, so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them, and then is cruelly snatched away. And what about Hogwart, anyways? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart, why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways?Friends, you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons. If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures, make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. This is the most soulless garbage imaginable.

Very much. It had the same feeling of the book(s) but of course it couldn't cover as much as the book could (it would be near impossible to do it). For instance, a lot of the characters didn't have as much screen time as they are mentioned in the book. (It seems that Snape, Quirrell, George, Fred and Percy Weasly had bigger roles; and Hedwig, I can't even remember the name being mentioned) But really, that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie is good or not, and it is.There aren't a lot of family movies that capture the kind of humor and adventure\/drama that this one does. Just for record, I've read all the books, so that might make me a bit biased, but really its a good adaption.The acting is superb. I honestly think there should be Academy Award nominations for this movie, both in acting and the movie itself.-Richard Harris, Maggie Smith,Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are PERFECT!!, they are so good at capturing the essence of their characters, that shouldn't go without a nomination.-Also, Daniel Radcliffe does a very, very good job as Harry. I liked him in this part because you can tell he wasn't overly acting like some child stars do; instead his shy\/quiet nature was exactly like Harry Potter -Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also PERFECT as their roles of Hermione and Ron, respectively.

I enjoyed the flick from beginning to end. Renee Zellweger is a really good actress, she's proved that in almost every movie she's been in, and she does it again here. We finally get to see a character in a romantic comedy that we can relate to. Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) has her flaws, she smokes too much, she drinks too much, and she thinks she weighs too much. She's not perfect, just like most of us. So we can relate to her, guys and girls alike. She wasn't an annoyingly gorgeous woman who just happened to be single because the screenwriters thought it would be a perfect way to lead Ashley Judd or Jennifer Lopez through the rest of the film, while the audience wondered whether or not she'd end up with the gorgeous guy in the end (Yawn). Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, though both gorgeous, appear to be perfect for their respective roles, and they do a great job. And even if one of them turns out to be to a jerk, you still feel like each of them are likable in their own ways.But, this movie is basically all about the lead character and thankfully, I just adored her. Bridget Jones's Diary is a romantic comedy treat. Although the movie, just like Bridget, has it's flaws. It's still a highly enjoyable and fairly original movie. At times the movie is predictable, but until later in the movie, I honestly did not know which of the two men she would choose from. The movie is also very funny, as I laughed out loud more than one time during this movie. Overall, I'd recommend Bridget Jones's Diary to anyone looking for a romantic comedy that's not set in a perfect fantasy world a la every other Ephron-ized romantic comedy that's been coming out of Hollywood over the past few years, but actually has it's own twists and turns along the way. And one that has some of the best performances from Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant.

Thus the scene is set for an audacious, dazzling, deconstructed & reconstructed, exhilarating romp of a film a romantic tragedy, a musical that is at the same time old & new, as much an homage to times past as it is a herald of the 21st century.It turns out that the 2 intruders (Koman as the narcoleptic Argentinian & Leguizamo as the painter Toulouse-Lautrec) were rehearsing a play called `Spectacular Spectacular' (itself a good description of the film, 1 of several play-within-a-play self-references), which Christian is promptly drafted in to rewrite.

Broadbent, Roxburgh, Leguizamo & Koman give excellent support with really strong performances, & there's a great little cameo from Kylie Minogue as an &#145;Absinthe Fairy'. There are moments too of great theatrical power, chief of which to my mind (along with the climax) is the moment when Christian accidentally gives the game away to the Duke about his Hamletesque play-within-a-play; a really powerful scene. The film exudes an intoxicating energy from the opening scene to the stunning denouement, & is in turns exciting, uplifting, inspiring, energising, clever, funny, surreal, & profoundly moving. The music itself is superb, & ranges from turn of the century vaudeville to Fat Boy Slim, Christina Aguilera & the queens of hip-hop, stopping along the way for opera, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Bollywood, The Beatles, T Rex, Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana, U2 & Beck &#150; among many many others; the original music also is excellent. This is a music lover's paradise! Surpassing even the variety & quantity of the music is how it is used often completely disparate types of music are meshed together seamlessly in a way that is clever, witty, highly original & simply exhilarating. For instance a can-can type number sung by the Moulin Rouge cast alternates with the audience singing back lines from Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit' `here we are now, entertain us' etc.; Christian eventually wins over Satine in a conversation come musical duel comprised almost entirely of lines from pop songs &#150; brilliantly imaginative & witty.

RATING 10  ","genre":"Drama, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"22 November 2001","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  `The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love & be loved in return' so begins `Moulin Rouge' as penniless Parisien writer & hopeless romantic Christian (McGregor) types & reads out the story as it at the same time unfolds before us. `My writing was interrupted' (he types & reads, & I paraphrase) `when an unconcious Argentinian fell through the roof' (cue said precipitation) `and a dwarf dressed as a nun ran into the room' (which he did). Thus the scene is set for an audacious, dazzling, deconstructed & reconstructed, exhilarating romp of a film a romantic tragedy, a musical that is at the same time old & new, as much an homage to times past as it is a herald of the 21st century.It turns out that the 2 intruders (Koman as the narcoleptic Argentinian & Leguizamo as the painter Toulouse-Lautrec) were rehearsing a play called `Spectacular Spectacular' (itself a good description of the film, 1 of several play-within-a-play self-references), which Christian is promptly drafted in to rewrite. The play is to be shown at a can-can cabaret theatre, the `Moulin Rouge', where Christian meets & falls in love with the star turn, lady of dubious virtue & struggling wannabe Satine (Kidman). She's a &#145;Material Girl' who apparently will do anything for money & for the furtherance of her career, & who is attempting to seduce a rich Duke (Roxburgh) to that end. Christian attempts to turn her with nothing to offer but his undying love & a beautiful singing voice. Can he save the girl & win her heart from the cold evil Duke & his money? Will love save the day? The outcome isn't hard to guess &#150; not least because it's announced in the opening scene &#150; but then it isn't meant to be; this is not your average run-of-the-mill movie.  Visually this is absolutely stunning &#150; the sets & costumes are impossibly colourful, lavish & detailed, the choreography inspired. The cinematography textbook has been thrown out here; the camera seems to have a life of it's own, panning & zooming manically, making a mockery of normal concepts of time & space, & giving us many post-modern sight gags along the way.The cast is superb McGregor to my mind is one of the finest actors to emerge out of Britain in recent years, & Kidman fully justifies her star billing. Broadbent, Roxburgh, Leguizamo & Koman give excellent support with really strong performances, & there's a great little cameo from Kylie Minogue as an &#145;Absinthe Fairy'. There are moments too of great theatrical power, chief of which to my mind (along with the climax) is the moment when Christian accidentally gives the game away to the Duke about his Hamletesque play-within-a-play; a really powerful scene. The film exudes an intoxicating energy from the opening scene to the stunning denouement, & is in turns exciting, uplifting, inspiring, energising, clever, funny, surreal, & profoundly moving. The music itself is superb, & ranges from turn of the century vaudeville to Fat Boy Slim, Christina Aguilera & the queens of hip-hop, stopping along the way for opera, Rodgers & Hammerstein, Bollywood, The Beatles, T Rex, Bowie, Madonna, Nirvana, U2 & Beck &#150; among many many others; the original music also is excellent. This is a music lover's paradise! Surpassing even the variety & quantity of the music is how it is used often completely disparate types of music are meshed together seamlessly in a way that is clever, witty, highly original & simply exhilarating. For instance a can-can type number sung by the Moulin Rouge cast alternates with the audience singing back lines from Nirvana's `Smells Like Teen Spirit' `here we are now, entertain us' etc.; Christian eventually wins over Satine in a conversation come musical duel comprised almost entirely of lines from pop songs &#150; brilliantly imaginative & witty. The viewer is constantly surprised with the ever-changing musical landscape & at a time when so many films are extremely predictable for this alone `Moulin Rouge' deserves high praise.The quality of the music is also outstanding, not in the least due to the vocal performances of the stars themselves. Kidman holds a tune extremely well & combines beautifully with McGregor - who is simply magnificent. His is a voice of such control, range, power, tone & expression that it is the equal of his considerable acting talent. His rendition of Elton John's `Your Song' is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long time. Jim Broadbent, playing the theatre owner, adds his stentorian baritone, while Koman growls his way magnificently through a version of The Police's `Roxanne' &#150; in duet with McGregor & a tango  - that simply has to be heard to be believed. `Moulin Rouge' is a truly modern musical; Luhrman has taken hold of an old & cliched genre, injected it knowingly with 21st Century irony, imbued it with great energy, imagination & talent; & has produced a post-modern masterpiece, one of the most audacious & original films seen in a very long time - & one for which he deserves every success. After all, to quote Christian & Satine (& Paul McCartney), `Some people want to fill the world with silly love songs &#150; and what's wrong with that, I'd like to know?', & surely &#145;making love not war' has never been more appropriate than it is now.

Madmartigan takes Alora Dannen from Willow and jumps in a cart, Willow follows and they go on a crazy cart ride, while battling off warriors.           Soon Madmartigan and Willow agree to help one another. Willow must deliver a magic wand to Fin Raziel who's exiled on a small island. He goes there, finds Raziel as a muskrat.

This movie has a happy ending. I personally like this movie.And that sledding scene was real funny, and when Madmartigan rolled down the hill as a snowball, and crashed and the snow flew all over Willow, I laughed very hard.
