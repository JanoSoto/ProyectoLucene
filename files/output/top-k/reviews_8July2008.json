[{"date":"8 July 2008","score":"","review":" Strange, how effective O is, despite being somewhat of a mess. Taking one of Shakespeare's plays and updating it to a contemporary high school has been done before (10 Things I Hate About You, for example, which also features Julia Stiles). But those were comedies, or if they were tragedies (like Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Romeo and Juliet), they were made with some sort of gimmick, if you will, to distance them from reality (I guess). Here Tim Blake Nelson puts Shakespeare's tragedy Othello in a contemporary high school setting, but he leaves out any of the flair or flourishes that accompany the other attempts of doing the same. The result is a gritty, and at times highly disturbing, film.Odin James (aka O, played by Mekhi Phifer) is the star basketball player of an exclusive prep school. Resentful of O's fame, and the thankless spot that it leaves him, Hugo (Josh Hartnett) plots to ruin O's career by sowing the seeds of doubt in O regarding his relationship with Desi (Julia Stiles), the dean's daughter.The acting is solid all around. While the actors get off to a rocky start, they eventually come through. Mekhi Phifer is adequate as the jealous O, but he's outshined by Hartnett and Stiles.If you're looking for a chance to ogle Josh Hartnett, rent another one of his movies. He's too creepy here. He's rather quiet and standoffish, which is an effective way of portraying Hugo, because it makes him more frightening than if he was foaming at the mouth, or, God forbid, cackling with maniacal glee. Ditto for Stiles; while she's not creepy, this isn't an opportunity for her to play a sexy character (although she does have a steamy sex scene). Martin Sheen is too over-the-top as the coach (who is Hugo's father), but as the movie goes on, he begins to fit in with the rest of the cast.If there's any problem, it's with director Tim Blake Nelson. He broadens everything so much that it all threatens to blend together into one big soup. There's no crispness in his directing, where one would normally isolate each scene and bring it out individually (to a point). That said, the film's climax is so disturbing that it will leave a sick feeling in many people's stomachs. This is not a teen soap opera; O is as real and affecting as it gets.Nelson's directing isn't a hackjob, though. He may have over-broadened everything, but he knows what he's doing. His choice of camera angles is great, though it threatens to go overboard at some points. He uses shots of the characters at key moments where they don't speak. Because they are so expertly done, they are the most telling moments of the film.Despite its shortcomings, O is a worthwhile film, and one that needs to be seen (though it was perhaps wise that they pushed the release date back after the Columbine tragedy).
