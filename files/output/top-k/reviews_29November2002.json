It stands out as a quick reminder of why I became so fascinated with these films to begin with, and what intelligent, important work that can actually be achieved within the genre. Mark my words, In another five years it will considered one of the finest video cult-classics of the 90s.The film is described as a retelling of that old molestation tale Little Red Riding Hood - and, great as the movie, that's pretty much all it does. What I liked about the movie though is that the filmmakers not only retold the story in a more adult way, but they also modernised it and changed the characters and plot to something that actually tells us something of our times and its problems. Something Hollywood would't touch. Little Red Riding Hood (wonderfully portrayed by Reese Witherspoon) is a bad girl trying to make it in a rotten world, and the wolf (Keither Sotherland in his only part i've liked - probably because he gets it so hard in the end) is a psycho serial killer with a taste for young girls. One thing that the film makes clear from the very first frame is that there is a sex-war going on between men and women. A war in which the freethinking, sexual and non-submissive young woman of the lower class are on the bottom of societys food chain. It could be argued that Freeway was intended as a morale-booster to these, often looked at as bad, girls. If that was the case I would support it all the way - just thinking of how insane young girls are treated in our society (that whole virginity-thing for example, or the fact that rapist can get away with it if the victim wore short skirt!) makes it clear that more films like Freeway are needed. You don't have to take the film so serious though, it's a fun, campy and tough film any way you watch it.Also check out Freeway II, which is like Freeway I on acid.

There were some moments that could have been good, but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities, and don't get me started on the bad.The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious, but I will recap them here in case anyone cares. Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with Freddy's long-lost child. Now, the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer (and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent) is HEREDITARY, so why not a mystery-type slasher in which Lisa Zane's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.Then there's the trip to Springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. The essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.Of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. That, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with Freddy's Dead it just doesn't try at all, leave alone hard enough.On a related note, I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. He has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries V, for example), and to be forever remembered as the man who played Freddy is selling him rather short. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast, well, I think their performances here speak for themselves. They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than B-grade horror props. Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B-films.All in all, Freddy's Dead gets a 1 out of me.

Anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. The first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with Freddy's long-lost child. Now, the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer (and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent) is HEREDITARY, so why not a mystery-type slasher in which Lisa Zane's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? Sound like a good plot idea to you? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.Then there's the trip to Springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. Funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. The essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.Of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. That, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with Freddy's Dead it just doesn't try at all, leave alone hard enough.On a related note, I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character. He has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries V, for example), and to be forever remembered as the man who played Freddy is selling him rather short. It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. As for the rest of the cast, well, I think their performances here speak for themselves. They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than B-grade horror props. Even Yaphet Kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B-films.All in all, Freddy's Dead gets a 1 out of me. I'd vote lower, but the IMDb doesn't allow for that. FD is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.

If there ever was a role on this earth that he could not play, I haven't seen it yet...or putting it simply, such a role has never been written.  Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary as all three characters that he plays in this film.  Characters who are completely different from one another, with different ideals and different beliefs.  His dialogue delivery, his expressions, everything is marvellous.  His eyes say it all.  This role should've given him an Oscar nomination. When he smiles, you smile, when he cries, you cry.    He is just a brilliant, brilliant actor.   The movie was very interesting, though very depressing at times.

The victimization starts with Lawrence Musgrove (Sean P. Diddy Combs) who is to be executed for a crime that is never mentioned.  A large amount of time is used to show how the prison guards are preparing for the execution and Lawrence spends time with his wife and son.  It would have been helpful to know if he was being sent to the electric chair because he shot 16 innocent people with a machine gun, or was he caught stealing at the local Walmart?  As it is, he is just a victim without a story.Then there is Leticia Musgrove who is the greatest victim in Hollywood history.  Her husband is executed, her son is run over and killed, she is being evicted, she loses her job, and her car breaks down.  She has no friends or support people.  No mother, father, sisters or brothers to lean on.  She is just alone in the big world all by herself.Meanwhile, Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton) is busy being a racist and child hater.  He quits his job for a reason that is never explained, wanders around aimlessly, and must contend with a father who would make a member of the KKK blush.  His son commits suicide in front of him and yet he has no remorse!!SUDDENLY there is a change of heart by Hank who decides that black people really aren't that bad after all.  He is nice to his black neighbors, who earlier in the movie were told to stay off his property or else.  He gets a black girlfriend, sleeps with her, and decides he'll have her move in as well.

It's really sad to think that the writers and director couldn't envision a love affair in which these two people come together because they like each other as equals.  Instead, we get the 1902 version of race relations.  The empowered and the victim.The final victim in this story is Halle Berry herself.  I will never understand how she was talked into an X-rated scene.  There was absolutely no reason to go that far.  She should have talked to Sidney Poitier who turned down roles that were negative stereotypes of black people when roles for minorities were almost impossible to find.  She should have received an Oscar for bad judgment.  This movie gets a 1 on the scale of 1-10. Truly awful.  It probably would have received a 10 in 1902.

The actual fact, that the movie's theme is as real as it can get is a strong point. These are things which probably are still happening everywhere. It doesn't matter if it's black, yellow or red. It happens everywhere.     Unfortunately, the brilliance of this movie seems to not have been understood or accepted by some people, and I'm thinking especially about the people who award the well known Academy Awards. But, let's be serious does a movie have to be recognized by a hand of people to be good?    From the beginning to the end of the movie you shall feel the intensity of the things that are happening. You shall tremble, and you shall fear. You shall think and you shall see, that maybe you know these things. Or, maybe not. It's a thrilling walk, through our present world. It's something you might not understand. It's something you might not accept. It's that fact that some people do think the way it's presented in the movie.     Maybe one of those is reading this.

And whatever you will do, you will have to say it before God. Of course, for these people the only problem is God does not exist.     As proven, it's not a lost cause, and you can always turn around. There's one point of view out of which I fear this movie probably failed. If it's only purpose was to entertain, then it's merits are sky high. But, if it had the objective to change the way some people are thinking, I doubt it succeeded. That's what I believe. Sadly, the movie only repeats the things most of the people know. It can be less impressive for some, out of a simple reason It shows you reality, a reality in which you live in, but a reality which you already know. Or think you know.     The fact that at the end Danny dies, killed by a black kid will leave a big question open what will Derek do? What will he do now, after his second relative is killed by a black person&#133;he might turn back to his old ways&#133;it remains an open question, and the answer will depend on each persons character. I myself, believe that he shall not stray on the wrong path again.

I would go though on Benigni, because I have a good feeling when American awards are handed over to non English speaking people. I mean people who don't have English as their native language of course.      Norton though is one of the actors which will have( if you don't want to say he already has) a shining career as an actor.         Edward Furlong showed some impressive skills, and surely deserves to be called a great hope of modern cinematography.
