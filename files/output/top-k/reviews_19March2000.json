This certainly isn't the case.The film is based on a true story.  The general plot is that an older man is having a difficult life, but manages to find his true calling (in a typical Robin Williams humorous fashion).  The man decides that he wants to help people, so he joins medical school to become a doctor.  His name is 'Patch Adams'.The fact that he is 40+ and just joined medical school raises a few eyebrows from fellow students, but he doesn't care.The story follows him as he helps people realise their problems, and through laughter makes himself feel better.  There are many hilarious scenes in which 'Patch' keeps the children entertained.Throughout the film it is apparent that Patch is disliked by his mentors, but continues to break there rules as his beliefs are so strong.With help of some friends Patch starts a home where people who are ill can come to get better.  This is totally illegal, but Patch doesn't care.I'm going to stop with the plot here, because it may ruin the rest of the film, but, let me just say that the ending is one where you think you know what will happen, and don't.Robin Williams portrays his character incredibly well, bringing together his funny side and serious side, both of which he can play well.The supporting cast play good and well acted parts, even though the film is based mainly around Patch.If you think this film is solely laughs then you are wrong, it has a serious side to it, and is very emotional throughout, but it is very funny.I was very impressed by this film, especially Williams, who I feel is the second best actor in Hollywood (behind Tom Hanks).

Otherwise, if that is not what you are looking for, then just don't see it.However, Final Destination gives a new twist to the genre (introduced by the tag line You can't cheat death) by attacking and terrorizing the characters with a killer that absolutely cannot be killed (or stopped, as you will see in the end). And since the killer is not really human, the deaths don't necessarily have to be realistic (anything short of completely unbelievable is an understatement), which is actually somewhat refreshing; it forces you to kind of use your imagination; and if you can't, it provides the pretty (read gory and bloody) pictures for you.The main principles by which the characters follow regarding Death's Design was reminiscent of John Calvin's belief of predestination which ignited during the Protestant Reformation.

The movie reconstructs this idea very well, and even leaves you wondering whether they were right about Death's Design or whether they were just following the plan all along.Other than all that, the film proves exciting through the end (you will NOT be bored), because as we all know, Death is relentless.

A friend of mine pressured me to go with him so I did. When we were in the theater I was complaining about how bad this movie was going to be, mainly because these types of movies are not my taste. By the time the movie was over I was left speechless. The first thing that came to my mind was that from now on I was going to see every movie directed by David Fincher.Fight Club is filled with so much energy its not even funny. It makes the audience want to be in the movie. The direction is absolute perfection. Fincher certainly has an eye for cinematography. Everything is composed so beautifully, with the help of computer generated graphics it makes the film seem even darker and more impressive. Ed Norton has never been better as an actor. His performance as an insomniac is pure perfection. I'm positive enough to say that he will never be as good as he was in this film. Helena Bonham Carter is as usual, beautiful. In Fight Club it comes to show how the power of makeup can change a person's appearance. To many people her look may seem repulsive, but I think she looks attractive despite her role, I dug it. All I can say is that without her Fight Club isn't the same. Brad Pitt is a macho guy who is pretty much Ed Norton's character alter ego. I can't really comment on him, don't like the guy that's all.All I can really say is that Fight Club is quite possibly one of the most energetic and memorable movies of the 1990s. Everything an entertaining movie needs is right here. Looking for a good time, look no further. Unfortunately this wasn't nominated for any Academy Awards which it truly deserved. If you ask me, Fight Club can kick American Beauty's ass any day! Like every other person out there, I thought the Academy Award nominees for the 99-year movies were terrible.

It was long, slow, and boring, and the two and a half hours it lasted felt like about four and a half. The story was an interesting one, though probably not as well known in the rest of the world (other than in the U.S.), but for me the interest in the story started to dissolve after about the first hour. The jumping camera I'm guessing was designed to give a documentary feel (??) to the story, but it just made the film irritating to watch. I went to see the film on the basis of all the good reviews it had received, and also the buzz surrounding Russell Crowe's performance, but I was left disappointed. I realise it was a stretch for him to play a middle-age family man, but he didn't convince me, so for me that's where the movie fell down. I kept thinking there's Crowe wandering about with talc powder in his hair, and this is supposed to be a great performance. I couldn't believe he was Wigand, and that was essential for me to get into the movie. I hope he doesn't win the Academy Award because his performance didn't impress me in the slightest. Kevin Spacey in American Beauty convinced me immediately that he was Lester, and although I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have hoped (something to do with it being so hyped up before I saw it), the performance was far superior to Crowe's effort. The Insider tells an important story, but the film's own sense of importance is what made it hard viewing for me. I felt no sympathy for Wigand's wife even though she understandably (in terms of her wanting to protect her family) didn't want Wigand to continue with his testimony because he was putting her family at risk, even though it was the right thing to do. Instead I found her an irritating character, and a bit one-dimensional. In my book, the films high points were the actor who played Wigand's lawyer in the scene where he is trying to get Wigand's testimony despite objections from the opposing lawyer, and Al Pacino's various one-liners scattered throughout the movie. The psychedelic scene in the hotel room when then wall begins to change and visions of his daughters appear was a bit out of place with the rest of the film. I know this was an attempt to give the viewer a sense of how far down Wigand had sunk mentally, but it just seemed so out of place and bizarre .Of the two main characters, I thought Pacino was much better, but he hasn't attracted as much praise. Unlike Crowe, Pacino immediately made me believe he was Lowell Bergman. All in all I felt the film was too long, and lacked the pace to maintain my interest.

Acting, music, editing, all help to create an interesting story. Many scenes in the film are very strong in the way that they stay in the viewers mind long after seeing this film. I remember the, apparently authentic, scenes in the beginning of the film that show the streets and although very brief they create a sort of feeling of authenticity that sets the tone for the film. I remember reading that Scorsese had to use authentic footage because they ran out of money making the picture. When it comes to the accuracy of the portrayal of mental illness in the film, I would like to believe that there are certainly worse efforts. The film tries to tackle the mental grey area that really isn't about sanity or psychosis but about the area between these two. I think the film puts more emphasis on the sane part of the human mind and on what that part allows. The film is far from perfect, but rather than as a documentary the film should be seen as a fictive story that is actually very close to reality.The last 3 minutes of the film that show the happy ending to the story has bothered me.

Now, they've been playing it almost every other night this month.  With each viewing, I start to see how this movie is more and more appealing beyond the surface impressions the first time around.Some of the other comments I've read are interesting in that they viewed it as either hilarious or vile depending on their taste.  Not surprising that the ones who hated it most came from Down Under.  I found it appealing in that the dark humor was offset by the change in Teddy.  Through the odd twists and turns he encounters after meeting Angie and the rest of the Woop Woopers, his selfish motives that lead him to Australia in the first place change into one of actually caring for some of the people he finds exciled there Duffy, Ginger, and particularly, Krystal.  He could have easily left once he got the key to the truck, but he stayed because of Krystal.  She told him there was nothing in it for him, which is the theme throughout the movie regarding his selfish ways What's in it for me?  Teddy shows that his con artist ways hide a real person and a true romantic at heart.That underlying romance between Teddy and Krystal was at the very core of the movie, and I admit that I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff.  There was obvious chemistry between them beyond the pure sexual magnetism between Teddy and Angie.  And the little extra scene after the movie's credits underlines how deep that love between Teddy and Krystal really was.  It was a nice touch.I hated Daddy-O, but only until I realized that his rather bullish ways hides an obviously very tender and vulnerable heart that he showed at Ginger's funeral. Keeping people in Woop Woop against their will is very wrong but he tries to do right for the people that stay loyal to him.  Rod Taylor's performance was excellent in conveying the two-sided nature of the character.The music was what got me.  I loved the references to Sound of Music and South Pacific.  The music played in the background made the scenes even more powerful and every bit as emotionally poignant as any good drama would.As odd a life as the Woop Woopers lead, it doesn't seem to be detrimental to their overall happiness.
