I rented this movie just so I could see the scene that is shown on every movie montage ever made.

I rented it, and even though the scene did not come until exactly an hour into the film, I found myself immersed in all other characters and situations.  The film snags you from its opening sequence where Beal announces that he's going to kill himself on the air in exactly one week, and then make his courtesy known to the public relations people so that they can have enough time to promote the event.  I found how the film's two main characters, Max Schoomaker and Howard Beal, each parallel the other's rise and demise in opposite directions.  Then, for that great serendipitous moment amid all the chaos, they both seem to have it worked out as Beal finds a way to express his anger and Shoomaker can finally be honest with himself.

I am upset that I didn't see it when it was in the cinema and in its popular run with the world. Baby's opening lines are a good place to start my review - It was the summer of 1963, when everybody called me Baby, and it didn't occur to me to mind. That was before President Kennedy was shot, before the Beatles came, when I couldn't wait to join the Peace Corps, and I thought I'd never find a guy as great as my dad. That was the summer we went to Kellerman's.At a summer camp Baby meets Johnny Castle, who teaches interested vacationers how to dance, and in his off hours dirty dances with other dancers. When Johnny loses his regular dancing partner, Baby volunteers to learn his routine to help him out of a tight spot. As the summer winds down, the dancing pair must come to grips with responsibility, love and each others growing expectations. Undoubtedly, the greatest part of this film are the scenes where we get to see some great dancing. The very first scenes with it in my view where in some way erotic, yet had an infectious feel on me. The dancing is very intense and heavy. It is no wonder they call it 'dirty dancing'. It must have been hard to find the right dancers to perform in this movie, but I feel they did get it right. The main part of the cast must have been able to dance a little too, cause if they couldn't have it would have made the film very erratic, and nowhere near as good as it was. Plus the ending of the film is great, with the two main characters getting up and showing the audience what they do best.The cast of Dirty Dancing was pretty good. Patrick Swayze, who played Johnny proved to me how talented he really was. His on-air relations with Jennifer Grey, and his dancing parts of this film were great. His lead in this is also deserves much praise. Swayze has had an eventful career, starring in Ghost, one of the big films of the 90's, and Black Dog alongside music legend Meatloaf. However, Jennifer Grey is an actress who I had never heard of until this movie, yet I loved her role in this immensely. Her characters struggles in this film were well acted by her, yet by the end she really shows that she can dance too. I have recently seen one of her other films which i think the whole world liked, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and I must admit that wasn't a bad film. However, Grey did not cash in on her success as Baby in Dirty Dancing, because I believe the movie loving public did not get to see enough of her afterwards, which was very disappointing.The one thing I do remember vividly at the time this film was doing well was the main song on the soundtrack, 'I've had the time of my life'. When I heard this in the film itself last year, I really got into it. The musical version of it is great. Yet the soundtrack is full of other great hits like Hungry eyes,  She's Like the Wind (performed by Patrick Swayze) and Overload just to name a few. Everyone I talk to about this movie says Hey have you got the soundtrack to that? It is amazing what effect a movie's soundtrack can have on people and Dirty Dancing's is great soundtrack to have.Finally, the movie's story is what I would call a bit 'mushy', but don't let that distract you from what a great film this is. The brilliant dancing and soundtrack is what I will remember most from this movie. I also like this movie for the fact that it shows some great dancing, which makes me a little jealous, considering that dancing is not one of my strong points. Lastly, let me leave you with this thought. I heard last year that an new version of Dirty Dancing was to be made, with people such as Ricky Martin and Sarah Michelle Gellar in the lead roles. I believe that a newer version of this sort of film won't be the same, cause Dirty Dancing, the original, has a certain historical look, that no new film could ever capture the same.

Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread, and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe, drivel, awful, wretched, the worst ever, etc. (NOTE as far as I'm concerned, the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best- or even more especially, the worst- movie ever are to be immediately disregarded.) Highly innovative in its way, it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort-of sequel. In the summer of Star Wars Episode 1, this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house, I felt for the first and last time in my adult life *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger.Many have complained about the shaky-cam, the cussing, how nothing 'really happens', and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not *that* shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why- they're tromping through the woods and they're scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing- the lines were ad-libbed, the actors are college-age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student I've ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples' language, but what else is new? That's not a flaw of the movie- it's realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary, but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that's it.TBWP is about what you *can't see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others.

My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary, but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that's it.TBWP is about what you *can't see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland, just beyond the flashlight's reach, something is making strange and terrible noises- but we don't know what it is.

Deviously so. Wickedly so. And it certainly has its audience.

I wouldn't actually buy it, mind you, but I do rent it on occasion.But there's one thing I want to point out about this movie. It is far darker, far creepier and a lot more disturbing than you might expect it to be from the ads. Of course, we all know that it's a funny idea to have the Brady Bunch in a Twilight-Zonish time wrap (which I sort of wish was explained) and face-to-face with the 90s. But that's not why I call it dark and creepy.It's creepy because..... well, how do I explain this... because it's not exactly the most comforting thing in the world to watch a movie that is physically demonstrating just how much more the world has gone to hell in a handbasket during the past several years. This film deliberately draws lines to show how much more cynical and jaded people have become, and it isn't a pretty sight.If you want to see a lighthearted trip down memory lane, this isn't the film for you. It might only depress you. I myself did like watching it, but the first time after seeing it it made me feel unhappy for a long time afterward. However, if you are personally cynical and jaded yourself and think things were TOO innocent in the past you might very well disagree.

Iannis disapproves of the match, feeling that his only child could do better but the couple are happy enough until the war against Italy, in Albania, sees Mandras leave to join the Greek Army.  Pelagia writes to her fiancé, every day but hears nothing from him in return.  She assumes that he's dead - particularly when news arrives of the Greeks' defeat at the hands of the Italians' German allies.The lives of all the islanders are turned upside down, as Italian soldiers arrive to occupy Cephallonia.  When officers are billeted in local homes, Iannis and Pelagia are joined by the charismatic Captain Corelli.  Whilst the doctor treats this pragmatically, as an opportunity to get medical supplies from the Italians' quartermaster, his daughter finds her loyalties sorely tested.  Should she stay faithful to her newly returned war hero fiancé, or succumb to the charms of the mandolin-playing captain?  Before these matters of the heart can be resolved, Italy surrenders and the Germans launch a full-scale invasion.At first, Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a heart-warming tale of Italians and Greeks learning to live together in, if not harmony, then at least a kind of relatively peaceful co-existence.  The performances from the entire cast are superb, with John Hurt, in particular making the most of his part as the wise and witty Iannis and Penelope Cruz making a perfect Pelagia.  Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage's brash, but also gentle and cultured, Captain Corelli is a bold piece of casting by director John (Shakespeare In Love) Madden.An A-list Hollywood actor sticks out like a sore thumb in a character driven film such as this but that's exactly as it should be.  Given the effect the character has on the people around him, he ought to look and feel slightly out of place.  After a few years of him seeming only to have appeared in thrillers and action movies, it's good to see Cage getting to grips with something that stretches him a bit more as an actor.Also excellent is Christian Bale.  His performance as the simple-hearted Mandras is light years from the slick yuppie of last year's American Psycho but he's totally convincing, even when he looks a little too much like Demis Roussos for comfort.Having set up characters you really care about and shown you enough of Cephallonia to have you mentally packing your suitcases for next year's holiday, the Nazi invasion sees the film perform an about face.  The action in the third act puts war films such as Saving Private Ryan to shame by being so much more emotionally affecting, because you're seeing people and places you feel that you know personally being blown up and shot to pieces.As one of the (apparently) few people who haven't read the book, I can't comment on whether Captain Correli's Mandolin is true to the novel but it is a terrific film and I wholeheartedly recommend that you see it.

Watching Leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show, like The Ladies Man Presents... which is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock Presents... is absolutely hilarious.  There's a great episode where Cameron Diaz role-plays Monica Lewinski, and Leon plays Bill and they call it The Oral Office.  See, that's funny!!!  In the movie, we don't see Leon on the show too often.  In fact, he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country.  And the plot revolves around his quest for true love, involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat, signed by Sweet Thing.  Karyn Parsons, who is famous for playing Hillary on Fresh Prince of Bel Air, works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon.  The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another.  And the gags are boring as well.  The first time we see Leon mention the word wang it's pretty funny.  When he uses it over and over again, supposedly trying to get a laugh, the joke has run dry.  Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before, and done better, on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty-five minutes.  They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies' Man haters, who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him, to bring some life into this witless comedy.

Billy Dee is charismatic as always, but even he can't breathe enough life into this film.  I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R & B hits, which impairs the film even more, giving it a horribly downbeat tone--as if the script isn't boring enough.

But over the last five decades, the `grandmother of French New Wave' has completed 29 other works, most showing her affection, bemusement, outrage, and wide-ranging curiosity for humanity.Varda's most recent effort-the first filmed with a digital videocamera-focuses on gleaners, those who gather the spoils left after a harvest, as well as those who mine the trash. Some completely exist on the leavings; others turn them into art, exercise their ethics, or simply have fun. The director likens gleaning to her own profession-that of collecting images, stories, fragments of sound, light, and color.In this hybrid of documentary and reflection, Varda raises a number of philosophical questions. Has the bottom line replaced our concern with others' well-being, even on the most essential level of food? What happens to those who opt out of our consumerist society? And even, What constitutes--or reconstitutes--art?Along this road trip, she interviews plenty of French characters. We meet a man who has survived almost completely on trash for 15 years. Though he has a job and other trappings, for him it is `a matter of ethics.' Another, who holds a master's degree in biology, sells newspapers and lives in a homeless shelter, scavenges food from market, and spends his nights teaching African immigrants to read and write. Varda is an old hippie, and her sympathies clearly lie with such characters who choose to live off the grid. She takes our frenetically consuming society to task and suggests that learning how to live more simply is vital to our survival. At times we can almost visualize her clucking and wagging her finger-a tad heavy-handedly advancing her agenda. However, the sheer waste of 25 tons of food at a clip is legitimately something to cluck about. And it is her very willingness to make direct statements and NOT sit on the fence that Varda fans most enjoy, knowing that her indignation is deeply rooted in her love of humanity.The director interjects her playful humor as well-though it's subtle, French humor that differs widely from that of, say, Tom Green. Take the judge in full robes who stands in a cabbage field citing the legality of gleaning chapter and verse. Quirky and exuberant, Varda, 72, is at an age where she's more concerned with having fun with her craft than impressing anyone. With her handheld digital toy, she pans around her house and pauses to appreciate a patch of ceiling mold. When she later forgets to turn off her camera, she films `the dance of the lens cap.' One of the picture's undercurrents is the cycle of life-growth, harvest, decay. She often films her wrinkled hands and speaks  directly about her aging process, suggesting that her own mortality is much on her mind. The gleaners pluck the fruits before their decay, as Varda lives life to the fullest, defying the inevitability of death. Toward the movie's end, she salvages a Lucite clock with no hands. As she films her face passing behind it, she notes, `A clock with no hands is my kind of thing.'If you'd be the first to grab a heart-shaped potato from the harvest, or make a pile of discarded dolls into a totem pole, THE GLEANERS is probably your kind of thing.

Whatever a movie is supposed to be, Amadeus is definitely it.  Although the dialogue stumbles over some colloquialisms, the movie is otherwise extremely beautiful and well-thought out.  It made me almost regret my mediocrity and sympathize with Salieri.  Almost.I first saw Amadeus in my junior year of high school, after a friend recommended it to me.  It made such an impression that I decided I was going to go to the Mozart Music Festival in Salzburg the following summer. Probably what struck me most about the film was its dramatic portrayal of Salieri, a man who blended into the 18th century music scene so well, his history can only be linked with Mozart, and although not mentioned, Beethoven, one of his later pupils.  Watching Salieri struggle with his mediocrity created a pang in my side - how often are we all forced to witness genius and know that we can never achieve it?  What is even more interesting is the dichotomy between the side of him that longs to destroy Mozart and the side of him that worships every note Mozart composes.

The next plank in the scenario is more obvious - what if Nosferatu's director, F W Murnau, was a megalomaniac. The rest is easy - just raise the money, assemble a cast and crew, choose locations, and shoot it!  Except perhaps for casting the part of the vampire\/Schreck - but that's easy too, because lurking in the recesses of movieland is a  mysterious being - going under the name of Willem Dafoe - who has such diabolical power to transform himself into a vampire that he, too, might be the genuine bloodsucking article. Casting the megalomaniac director really is a cinch - here's a part, at last, in which John Malkovich  can run the gamut from quiet, detached control to raging, bug-eyed hysteria, without being accused of hamming it up; and  he can use an accent the audience might find acceptable  (and perhaps it might erase the memory of  the ridiculous Russian in Rounders, or perhaps not).  But despite the efforts of Dafoe and Malkovich, as well as fine support like Eddie Izzard and Catherine McCormack, for me the real stars of Shadow are the set builders, lighting\/camerapeople, and assorted technicians - under the leadership of director E Elias Merhige - who have managed to recreate the look and feel of a 1920s set and of the original B & W, silent movie. Because of that wonderful recreation, and the strong performances, it's easy to forgive a few faults in the overall execution. Others have criticised the ending; I was more doubtful about the first 20 or 30 minutes, when I thought the vampire should have made an earlier substantive entrance. One feels that some major scenes may also have been cut - otherwise, why does Malkovich\/Murnau leave the set for a while in the middle of the movie.  Films about film-making often bring out the best in their makers, and this is certainly the case here.  Shadow of the Vampire is worthy to join Sunset Boulevard, Singin' in the Rain, Eight-and-a-half, Day for Night, and Living in Oblivion as a first-class, enjoyable movie in its own right, while providing lots of food for thought about the way creating a movie provides such a wonderful metaphor for life in general.

Subjectively speaking, I hated it from the very beginning and couldn't wait for it to end. Throughout, it seems infused with the vitriolic spirit of Jackson Pollock, Stereotypical Alcoholic Artist, creating a work that is rock-hard to warm to.Not only is it tough to watch the sullen, surly, self-aggrandizing character played by actor-director Ed Harris, but his pushy, utterly codependent wife, Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden), is another stomach-turner. `Get your own damn career and stop freeloading off his!' I found myself yelling at the screen. Put these two together and you've got the film's main focalpoint a blatantly parasitic relationship that monotonously circles the same track, with her lowering her vast black New Yorker eyebrows in scorn and him skulking around with the loquaciousness of a two-toed sloth. Don't these characters ever get to do anything but hype his `genius,' carp and stew-for reasons we're never privy to?Set between 1941 and Pollock's 1956 death, the film both tells too little and tells too much. It presumes knowledge of the artist's career and biography that the uninitiated don't necessarily have. For instance, several times Pollock cops a faraway look that apparently means something to cognoscenti, like, `I can see him composing I'M A DRIP #7 in his head right now.' But the gauzy gazes are never explained, and the audience strains to psych out a character who is so malicious, self-absorbed and boring that it's not worth the effort. On the other hand, screenwriters Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller struggle to provide historical details about Pollock's shows, business dealings, interviews, etc., making the film stilted in places. They also have an unfortunate need to plug in famous quotes `I am nature,' `I'm the only painter worth looking at in America,' etc. Using such gack-worthy lines in service of character development is a cheap form of shorthand. I guarantee we could've extrapolated that Lee thought Jack's new splatter style impressive without having her deadpan, `You've done it, Pollock. You've cracked it wide open.'WHAT got cracked open is never revealed. There's nary a whisper of his being the first abstract expressionist, nor a mention of the designation Action Painters (though we do get to watch them guzzle beer together). The film never shares that The Dripper was fascinated with Navajo sandpaintings or the subconscious or anything else, facts that might have imbued him with some intelligence and dimension besides his supposed Neanderthal charm.Characters fall out of the sky without any explanation of who they are or what their import. Clement Greenberg is just `Clem,'--as their farmhand might be `ol' Zeke'-forget that he was one of the era's foremost art critics. When Krasner and her bangs first appear, we have no idea if she's a critic or a painter or just some gal cruising the Village for a drunk to pop.The film also jettisons the talents of several supporting actors. As Pollock's mom, Sada Thompson has sorely little to say, left to express herself with the kind of glares she used to give Buddy on FAMILY, but for reasons that are, again, never explained. Bud Cort, of HAROLD AND MAUDE fame, is a terrific surprise-but in the meagerest role on earth.

The racing sequences (especially the point-of-view shots from inside the cars) are some of the best I've ever seen committed to film and it's all accented by a thundering rock soundtrack.If you're looking for something deep and profound, stay home.  But if you're ready for a pure adrenaline rush, strap yourself in and enjoy a pedal-to-the-metal thrill ride!

And I can well understand that a true race fan in-the-know- can be put off by what they see as gross inaccuracies about thesport  Having said all this, I will also say that I found this movie to be spectacularly entertaining.  There's surely nothing intellectually challenging here, but since when did we expect that from Stallone?

And I would like to say, they're both right and wrong....Allow me to elaborate... There is nothing purer and more exciting to a Bond fan than the first 10 minutes of a new, fresh out of the packet Bond movie. It is exhilarating and also a little nerve wracking. The usual question arises What if this one ends up like Licence To Kill? Trying to please all and failing in the process? TWINE does not fail during the first 10 minutes, Michael Apted manages to put in 2 opening sequences. The great dive from the bankers office in Bilbao and then the mother of all speedboat chases along the Thames. TWINE shows that when you allow new writers to create Bond scripts, they end up both wrecking and rejuventing the series. TWINE's storyline is a little muddled, but it allows the crew to create newer, more modern action set pieces. Brosnan's interpretation of Bond grows better with every film. He manages to combine the lethality of Connery with suave, louche, lounge lizard of Moore. But, sometimes the minuses suddenly mount up. Robert Carlyle is wasted, he serves merely as a sucker punch, distracting you away from Sophie Marceau's Elektra King. Robbie Coltrane's rather poor Russian accent is stretched to breaking point and yes, Denise Richards does stink ever so slightly as Christmas Jones. But, look at the film! Never has Bond looked so slick and so damned Hollywood! Bond was getting a little staid, from one huge set to another, but this film breaks that mold. All in all, better than most. Bring on 2002!
