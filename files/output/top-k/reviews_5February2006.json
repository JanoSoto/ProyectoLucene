That being said, they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings, and let me explain why. Firstly, the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson's LOTR. The whole cast is too run of the mill. Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people? one could ask. Well, they are not really silly(save for Hobbits, later about them) and they certainly pack more personality than Jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue time. And that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the Bakshi's LOTR. Take Aragorn for example. In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority(Aragorn the lord)and with a seasoned rasp(Aragorn the ranger). This is due to John Hurt's brilliant voice acting. Compare that to Viggo Mortensen's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven Hurt beats Mortensen hands down. And then there is Gandalf. Probably the most dominating(and the most popular) character in the whole saga. In this Bakshi version Gandalf(William Squire) is a real wizard. And by that I don't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips(he does not), but his presence is just captivating. He is a mystical, powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease. Add to that his looks Tall, old as the ancient oak, beard long as his body, sharp eyes, wizardy hook nose and of course, the classical wizard hat. A Perfect Gandalf, just like in the books. Ian McKellen's Gandalf in the other hand, is simply just too boring. He looks too human, sounds too human, acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword. Yes a sword. In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword(as he did in the books). And those are stylish slow motion kills. Gandalf is not a power to be messed with. And it must be noted, that while I'm sad to say this, the great Christopher Lee didn't bring Saruman alive. Fraser Kerr in this movie did, even with a very limited screen time and lines.Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie, it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jackson's pretendeous bad guys. Bakshi's orcs taunt their enemies(or each other) constantly with growls, screams and nasty language. They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. And finally, the Black Riders - or the Nazgul. Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black. And they speak with haunting voice, which mesmerizes their victim. My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river. While Peter Jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party, Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky.But as much I like this film more than Jackson's, the latter are, if only technically, still better. And that is because of some key visuals. As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated characters(all hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered with paint. I don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way, but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures. This is especially true with humans(Riders of Rohan, tavern people etc.) Orcs are different matter, since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters. Orcs, while played by humans with animation mix, look far superior to Jacksons version. They have brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. Biggest screw up in this films visuals, howerver, are the Hobbits. While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies. And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them, so be warned. Again, the voice acting is OK with them too, but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels. Well, I never really liked those halflings anyway. General failures in the Bakshi script are well known. Limited playing time(with limited budget) and a lot of missing scenes. So while this film covers nearly half of the story, it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to Jackson's version. In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior-overall atmosphere (it feels more like Middle-Earth) -overall voice acting -music (I really dig the fantasy score by Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of the John Hurt's finest roles) -King Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Elrond (He's not some fairy hippie in this one!)While Jackson version is better-because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -Gollum\/Smeagol -Balrog -HobbitsLord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi, even with it's well known shortcomings, is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfectly.

The cast is generally good, it's realistically filmed on location (or close enough) in Yugoslavia, etc. However, there is something really lackluster in the whole production.The big disappointment is Israeli actor Topol as Tevye. He's younger and handsomer than Mostel, but doesn't sing or emote nearly as well, and he has one of those rather odd Israeli accents that are partly British -- certainly NOT Russian -- and that comes off as awkward. Tevye is the prime role, he has the major songs, like Tradition and If I Were A Rich Man, so having a so-so leading man here is fatal to the film. He's also too old to play Tevye on screen -- on the stage, it's OK to have an older actor, but Tevye's oldest daughter is 18 and he was supposedly married at 18 himself, so realistically he is supposed to be about 37. Instead, Topol appears 50 or more with gray hair. (This is also true for the actress who plays his wife.)The larger flaw of the film is that like a lot of other musicals (the recent Rent comes to mind), the film director felt that it had to made on location and as realistically as possible. This just doesn't work well for most musicals, which are intended for the more stylized presentation of a stage and a theater. Forced to look at Tevye's actual barn and animals is very distracting. Plus, with the action staged out of doors, the singing (which is obviously done in a studio) sounds absurd -- where's the echo chamber? LOL!Despite everything looking real in the physical sense, the art direction has gone way overboard in the sense that all the peasants are depicted as living far too grandly for Jews of that time and place. Tevye's house is a multi-story Ralph Lauren summer home, and sits on many acres of land -- in those days, he would have REALLY been a rich man if he had all that. When Tevye sings about being rich and owning chicken, I believe its meant to imply that he's too poor to actually own any -- not an excuse to cut to photography of his flock!That being said, if you like the music and general story, it's all here, and reasonably faithful to the theatrical production in terms of plot, resolution, etc. Since there is no bringing back Zero Mostel, this is what we have! and probably a bit better than the typical community theater productions that still are around.In conclusion, I see a lot of reviewers talk about the sadness of the ending, as the Jews are forced to leave Anatevka. Personally, I have never considered this as sad. The film distorts things a bit by depicting Tevye as a landowner with lots of farm animals, furniture, a house, etc. In reality, peasants this poor had virtually nothing. The reality -- as experienced by my own paternal grandmother, who left Russia in 1920 -- is that these Russian Jews came to America to lead vastly better lives in a free country. Not to mention that their children and grandchildren became successful doctors, lawyers, business owners. This is not a sad ending, folks -- it's the happiest ending of all time!

The cast is generally good, it's realistically filmed on location (or close enough) in Yugoslavia, etc. However, there is something really lackluster in the whole production.The big disappointment is Israeli actor Topol as Tevye. He's younger and handsomer than Mostel, but doesn't sing or emote nearly as well, and he has one of those rather odd Israeli accents that are partly British -- certainly NOT Russian -- and that comes off as awkward. Tevye is the prime role, he has the major songs, like Tradition and If I Were A Rich Man, so having a so-so leading man here is fatal to the film. He's also too old to play Tevye on screen -- on the stage, it's OK to have an older actor, but Tevye's oldest daughter is 18 and he was supposedly married at 18 himself, so realistically he is supposed to be about 37. Instead, Topol appears 50 or more with gray hair. (This is also true for the actress who plays his wife.)The larger flaw of the film is that like a lot of other musicals (the recent Rent comes to mind), the film director felt that it had to made on location and as realistically as possible. This just doesn't work well for most musicals, which are intended for the more stylized presentation of a stage and a theater. Forced to look at Tevye's actual barn and animals is very distracting. Plus, with the action staged out of doors, the singing (which is obviously done in a studio) sounds absurd -- where's the echo chamber?

Her bubbly, sweetness is also more than misplaced. You can bet your gold nugget that the studio needed a love interest who would show her birthday suit, I would well hope that Hill was not responsible for her character or role.

It was not many years from 1986 to 1989, only three years, and two Trek Flicks, but in this film we must assume that enough time has lapsed between The Voyage Home and this flick, so that the Enterprice Crew is to retire and the Enterprise-A to be sent to Scrapheap City. Sulu is now a Captain of The Excelsior, Rand is his Communications Tech. Christian Slater is one of Sulu's Ensigns- Ahaha. So, this film has lots of GREAT actors John Shuck, David Warner, Rosanna Desoto, Christopher Plummer, and the Trek regulars. Not to mention Iman and Kim Catrall in clever parts.Now regarding the story, this is one of the best, being partly written by Leonard Nimoy. There is one scene which is a direct copy of a scene from Bridge over the River Kwai and I have to suspect that Nimoy was responsible for that. It is the scene where Kirk and McCoy are being inducted to the prison on the Penal Asteroid of Rura Pente- The warden is describing the rules, and that there are basically No fences, etc and that if they worked well they would be treated well, Work badly and you will die- almost verbatim to the speech the Japanese warden gives Alec Guiness and co at the start of Bridge over the River Kwai.This film does in fact have a lot of Trek Clichés, but they are masterfully handled. The speeches at the end of the film, while the action is resolving, are in fact lines from previous Trek episodes. You will hear things like Time is of the Essence et cetera.Now, as with all Trek films, this one was also badly edited, but wonderfully directed by Nicholas Meyer, and so the continuity errors that result are forgiven. Mostly, as earlier Trek were massive attacks on our visual senses with Giant Aliens and Klingons and Space Battles and Explosions and other things of the sort, this film is driven by it's dialogue which is written rather well, as well as the mystery and spy story aspects, rather than it's special effects Which were pretty basic compared to the first four Trek flicks. Possibly because this is one of the first films which used a lot of CGI, and not in the monitor displays.Michael Dorn plays his own grandfather and the character actually sets Worf on the planet of his birth (Kitomer), and Rene Aberjonois plays a sleazy Colonel who is part of the conspiracy.This film stands up to repeated viewings rather well... And the idea that we all must read Shakespeare in it's Original Kingon to understand it, is so preposterous that it is great.

It's relentless in what it depicts and I think it's one of those cases when the overall result somehow surpasses the original intent of the filmmakers, however great that intent was. It's an unflattering depiction of our society, a picture of the world which happens to be the point of view of a serial killer. His world is dark, but made so by the so-called human beings infesting it - all the banality, the apathy, the self-interest of our species is on full display here. The city in this film is in a state of perpetual decay; all we seem to see are rotting walls and buildings on the verge of crumbling. But this is just a surface corrosion, a reflection of what really ails all of us, which is the corruption of our souls. The serial killer is just a natural extension of society here. It comes as no surprise that he exists. We've made our hell on Earth and the killer is just one of the elements existing to fall neatly into place in the center of it all.Under the guise of a police procedural, director Fincher and the screenwriter unveil this grim world for us. This was not a reworked draft which fell into the common pitfalls of a standard chase at the end or a last minute rescue. No, none of that same old Hollywood stuff here. The nasty foreboding probably surfaces around the time we get to know a little about young detective Mills (Pitt) and his pretty wife (Paltrow), through the eyes of hardened veteran detective Somerset (Freeman). It's hinted that the young couple have recently moved into the big city from a more rural area, into the typical squalid apartment lifestyle prevalent in this grimy city. Maybe some alarm bells go off in the back of the audience's mind by this point we don't think this couple should be in this city. What in the blazes are they really doing in this hellhole? Why didn't they stay where they belonged, close by that high school where they met? Pitt is pretty good as the less experienced cop, not too intelligent but struggling anxiously to be in the big leagues. He does OK, but the film belongs to Freeman, who cannot strike a wrong note as the older weary policeman. This becomes the essential Freeman role, that of a man who perhaps has seen too much in his lifetime, but his keen intelligence cannot allow him to simply give up and throw in the towel, no matter how close he gets to that point. Freeman manages to convey a poetic disposition towards decency and civilization, as with most of his roles, but it's never more effective than here, when the entire world assails him with barbarism and anarchy.It's little surprise that much of the style of this film was copied over the next few years, including even the unusual credits sequence. The bulk of the film details the serial killer's masterpiece of murder, a pattern following the seven deadly sins. While interesting in itself and grisly in the depiction of murder as an artistic creation, we realize by the climax that it was all simply a preparation for the truly horrific crowning achievement of killer John Doe's final act. It's a shock at the end which still sends shivers down my spine no matter how many times I watch it. Perhaps meant for repeat viewings after the initial shock, the film serves to remind us we live (or just exist) in that chaotic charnel house we usually try not to think about. When all the surface gloss is peeled away and we gaze with unfiltered eyes at the unpleasant truth laid bare before us, we see John Doe smirking at us, holding a box.

Stanley Donen is best recalled for his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s on several of the best MGM musicals (usually working with Gene Kelly). But it is an interesting surprise that in the 1960s he did two thrillers (CHARADE and ARABESQUE) which were very well done indeed. CHARADE is about Reggie Lambert, a woman about to get divorced from her American husband. But before the divorce can get underway she learns her husband has been brutally murdered (we see his body thrown off a train). Soon she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) who starts befriending, even romancing her - but their relationship is twisted when it turns out his name is not Peter Joshua but Alexander Dial, the brother of a man who was killed in a suspicious incident during World War II, where a fortune in gold was lost. Although the Germans apparently were responsible, the suspicion was that the men guarding the gold hid it, to divide it up later on. These men are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, a dead soldier named Carson Dial, and the deceased husband of Hepburn. The three living ex-G.I.s are in Paris - they had apparently tracked down Hepburn's husband, and one of them may have killed him. But each denies this, and suspicion is also on Grant (supposedly for the share of his dead sibling), and Hepburn. To add to the tensions, Hepburn is contacted by a Mr. Hamilton Bartholemew of the U.S. Embassy in Paris (Walter Matthau) who explains that the U.S. Government is interested in recovering the stolen gold.There are several mysteries in CHARADE what happened to the fortune in gold; what is the game that Grant is playing (is he friend or foe to Hepburn); and who is bumping off the various ex-G.I.s. For as the film passes first one then the other is killed off. As these problems are wrapped up we reach the conclusion, a scary showdown in the empty Paris Opera House.Photographed in Paris, the film is also an able visual valentine to the great city. Only another Hepburn film, FUNNY FACE, shows as many romantic sites (a third one, HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, comes close too). It sort of fits the mood, with Grant romancing Hepburn in the great city.If you want to be totally surprised, I advise not reading beyond this point of this review. But if you want a personal observation read onSPOILER COMING UPAll his career Cary Grant wanted to play a villainous part. He was always the hero (his roles in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART and MR. LUCKY and SUSPICION were the closest to villains he played). This film was his last chance, and it would have been curious if he had played it as such. Oddly enough, the actual chief villain in the plot, Walter Matthau (as Carson Dial, pretending to be Mr. Bartholemew) was also at a crossroads. Most of Matthau's early film parts were villainous, such as the whip-happy tavern owner in THE KENTUCKIAN. However he had shown signs of being a good guy. In A FACE IN THE CROWD, as a television executive, he tells off a scheming, collapsing, Andy Griffith that he'll be lucky in a year or two to be recalled as a has-been. And in ONIONHEAD, he was a good natured cook on a naval craft who befriends Griffith. Still his most recent performances were mostly villainous - as when he was the government adviser in FAILSAFE who recommends the accidental launching of an attack of Russia be followed up by a full scale sneak attack. I might add, to Matthau's later success, he demonstrated where he could his great sense of timing and humor.It has often struck me that if Donan and Grant had gotten together, rather than a routine romantic adventurer for Grant he should have been the killer and villain, and been the threat to Hepburn at the conclusion - that Matthau would have been great fumbling his way to rescuing her. There need not have been a romance between Matthau and Hepburn, but he could have saved her.

Stanley Donen is best recalled for his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s on several of the best MGM musicals (usually working with Gene Kelly). But it is an interesting surprise that in the 1960s he did two thrillers (CHARADE and ARABESQUE) which were very well done indeed. CHARADE is about Reggie Lambert, a woman about to get divorced from her American husband. But before the divorce can get underway she learns her husband has been brutally murdered (we see his body thrown off a train). Soon she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) who starts befriending, even romancing her - but their relationship is twisted when it turns out his name is not Peter Joshua but Alexander Dial, the brother of a man who was killed in a suspicious incident during World War II, where a fortune in gold was lost. Although the Germans apparently were responsible, the suspicion was that the men guarding the gold hid it, to divide it up later on. These men are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, a dead soldier named Carson Dial, and the deceased husband of Hepburn. The three living ex-G.I.s are in Paris - they had apparently tracked down Hepburn's husband, and one of them may have killed him. But each denies this, and suspicion is also on Grant (supposedly for the share of his dead sibling), and Hepburn. To add to the tensions, Hepburn is contacted by a Mr. Hamilton Bartholemew of the U.S. Embassy in Paris (Walter Matthau) who explains that the U.S. Government is interested in recovering the stolen gold.There are several mysteries in CHARADE what happened to the fortune in gold; what is the game that Grant is playing (is he friend or foe to Hepburn); and who is bumping off the various ex-G.I.s. For as the film passes first one then the other is killed off. As these problems are wrapped up we reach the conclusion, a scary showdown in the empty Paris Opera House.Photographed in Paris, the film is also an able visual valentine to the great city. Only another Hepburn film, FUNNY FACE, shows as many romantic sites (a third one, HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, comes close too). It sort of fits the mood, with Grant romancing Hepburn in the great city.If you want to be totally surprised, I advise not reading beyond this point of this review. But if you want a personal observation read onSPOILER COMING UPAll his career Cary Grant wanted to play a villainous part. He was always the hero (his roles in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART and MR. LUCKY and SUSPICION were the closest to villains he played). This film was his last chance, and it would have been curious if he had played it as such. Oddly enough, the actual chief villain in the plot, Walter Matthau (as Carson Dial, pretending to be Mr. Bartholemew) was also at a crossroads. Most of Matthau's early film parts were villainous, such as the whip-happy tavern owner in THE KENTUCKIAN. However he had shown signs of being a good guy. In A FACE IN THE CROWD, as a television executive, he tells off a scheming, collapsing, Andy Griffith that he'll be lucky in a year or two to be recalled as a has-been. And in ONIONHEAD, he was a good natured cook on a naval craft who befriends Griffith. Still his most recent performances were mostly villainous - as when he was the government adviser in FAILSAFE who recommends the accidental launching of an attack of Russia be followed up by a full scale sneak attack. I might add, to Matthau's later success, he demonstrated where he could his great sense of timing and humor.It has often struck me that if Donan and Grant had gotten together, rather than a routine romantic adventurer for Grant he should have been the killer and villain, and been the threat to Hepburn at the conclusion - that Matthau would have been great fumbling his way to rescuing her. There need not have been a romance between Matthau and Hepburn, but he could have saved her.

This movie turns things a bit topsy-turvy as the two central characters, angels, are the bad guys.The whole movie from beginning to end is a tongue-n-cheek run up of religion--George Carlin a tough New Jersey-sounding cardinal Glick (The Catholic Church is Never Wrong); Chris Rock the 13th apostle Rufus; Salma Hayek as Muse and Silent Bob and Jay playing their usual characters. Silent Bob actually speaks a line and can be called a hero when he almost single-handedly takes on Bartleby & Loki on the train. Brilliant, I laugh just thinking of these characters. Then there's good old Ben and Matt--eye candy bad guys. Alan Rickman deserves a note for playing Metatron, a somewhat mysterious, Anglo-accented and stern Angel who seems to do God's talking for her and Jason Lee who plays the gangster-like Azrael. There's a little literature and religion hidden in here too as the movie seems to use Milton's Paradise Lost (the revolt of the Angel Lucifer and followers against god and their being cast down to hell) to set up the story.God is not only a woman, but a goofy one--God does not speak in this movie at all. Alanis Morrisette played this role perfectly...when she started doing handstands in front of the church...I nearly lost it.There is some blood and carnage, starting with the Stygian Triplets attacking god on the boardwalk, the scene in the bar where Azrael offs the bartender and of course the climactic scene in front of the church. Not too rough to watch and at least in furtherance of the plot.This is a light comedy worth watching...too bad Catholics were offended, they have more to worry about than this little movie.

The story ends up looking repeated, exhausted and pointless.Falling Down supposedly deals with the so-called problems of society, but it seems to merely be Bill injuring people. Of course, he's following the phrase an eye for an eye, so it's not done heartlessly.
