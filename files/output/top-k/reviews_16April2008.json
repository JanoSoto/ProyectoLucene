[{"date":"16 April 2008","score":"","review":" Ah, here we are. The sequel. Yet again Julie James is haunted by the incident(which, surely, by now must be two Summers back? Oh no, not only is there a dangerous killer stalking teenagers(I mean, come on, how much of that was there in horror cinema in the 80's?), but time is being slowed down to a halt, as well!), and in the year that passed both within the series and in real life, she made some new acquaintances, most of which clearly got high marks in the department of being generally annoying(perhaps they watched that John Cleese special?), while the writer(s?) thought up an admittedly novel way of ensuring both inherent creepiness and more or less(read less) dressed young people. The singing was uncalled for(really, what did we do to you?), but I guess they figured there'd be fans of the singer in the audience. Acting is fine. Jack Black is, if possible, even less tolerable than usual(but at least its recognized herein). This tries to jump right into the scares, and outdo the first in general, by having more of what it had. The story isn't bad, and does continue with characters that survived(the cast list and the cover of this could reveal who did and didn't, be forewarned). Not all the scares work. The twists are decent enough. The music still isn't as good as Scream. Some of the effects are nicely done. This didn't engage or excite me like the one before it did. All in all, more of the same, as has been said, not sure why this is less effective, if its the fault of the writer or the director(who did do a quite commendable job on Judge Dredd), or what\/who. I recommend this to fans of the movie it follows. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2008","score":"","review":" Ah, here we are. The sequel.
