[{"date":"17 February 2014","score":"","review":" Is the world that we know today really what it seems? Does it seem like we live an orchestrated life defined by what society deems as important? And does it seem that our lives are overly governed by the many rules of both man and nature? These questions are the main currents of Andy and Lana Wachowski's movie The Matrix which challenges what we see as reality today. Thomas A. Anderson, an orchestrated computer programmer during the day, lives a dual life where he is known as Neo online through his late night computer hacking. Beyond his day job Neo, played by Keanu Reaves, has always sensed and imagined that there was something hidden elsewhere beyond what he considered reality at the time. After receiving messages and a phone call from an unknown source later identified as Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishbourne, Neo joins a rebellion and becomes aware of the struggle to battle a war against machines in a post human driven world known as the matrix. The matrix is a software system imposed on humans by machines that limits their understanding and capabilities of reality. Neo becomes the one as referred to by Morpheus. He is pressed with the problem of breaking the bounds of the matrix and freeing mankind from the control of the machines before the last known unrestricted humans are eliminated. Neo along with his arch rival Agent Smith, who is a machine within human form, counter each other's personalities in a way that makes the distinction between man and machine that much greater. Agent smith, played by Hugo Weaving, illustrates the emotionless task oriented function of machines. His name in particular suggests the generalization and uniformity of machines. Neo's name contrasts this generalization expressing the individuality of humans as a representative symbol. Hugo Weaving's deep monotonic tone compared to Neo's softer relaxed tone contrasts each other's characters further against one other leading to an even greater distinction between man and machines.Adding to the distinction of the men controlled by the machines and the men aware of the society ran by the matrix, is the acting of Laurence Fishbourne. Fishbourne as Morpheus is part of the rebellion against the matrix and separates himself from the matrix by his aurora as an all knowing character. His elevated presence and his subtle cues of knowing what is to come next lead to the greater disparity between himself and the people around him. These details portrayed by the main actors lead to the best illustration of a thematic idea unprecedented in a movie up until today.That unprecedented idea is a movie based on what seems to be reality versus what reality actually is. Likewise artificial intelligence used by mankind in turn fights itself against man in a way that ironically makes humans look less human in the machine made artificial reality. A complex and highly in depth idea for any person to think of let alone direct and visualize clearly. Irony plays it's part also in the scene that describes how machines took over the world during the turn of the 20th century. Instead of humans using machines to help in their energy consumption, Andy and Lana Wachowski have turned the tables in this film. Machines instead farm humans in order to get their energy to run and operate the matrix. The dominator and dominated have essentially flipped roles. The originality of the futuristic film The Matrix questions the viewers perception of what is and isn't real while the actors used within the film support the direction that the film takes which ultimately leaves the viewers questioning and wanting to see more!

Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back in time in a time machine that his friend, the mad scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), invented. Once in the past, Marty meets his parents when they were teenagers. He accidentally messes with the time line and his mother falls for Marty instead of his father. Marty must fix this while Doc from the past finds a way to send Marty back to his own time. If Marty cannot get his parents together in time, he will disappear from existence.Director Robert Zemeckis creates an original and inventive film that that entrances the audience. However, he does not pull this off on his own. He has a wonderful cast that truly brings the script to life. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make an amazing team. They both embody their characters and when you put them together, movie magic happens. Their facial expressions, vocal expression, and physicality make their performance interesting, believable, and likable. Their interactions verbally and non-verbally when they are sending the DeLorean back in time for the first time is priceless, because of the way their eyes speak to each other and to the audience, and their physical actions magnify the intensity of their emotions. Through this, they create a scene of suspense but one that the audience can still laugh along to. Without these two actors the movie is just that, a movie; but, they create an adventure, a comedy, and overall a story that has become a classic. The music selection for this film is spectacular and plays an important role. This movie incorporates the big hits of each time period, and this does not only appeal to the audience, but also sets the mood of the movie. The Power of Love, by Huey Lewis and the News was written for this film and ended up giving the band its first number-one hit. This upbeat and overall fun song to sing along to gets the audience ready for a light hearted rocking good time. Another big hit, Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry is performed in this movie and is now considered to be one of the most recognizable songs in music history. Music truly can bring you back in time and this is what makes Back to the Future a hit even now. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and something new can be learned every time. Everything that is said and shown in this movie has a purpose. Whether that is a newspaper clipping, a license plate, or a phrase that is said, the director put them each there on purpose, to make the audience think. The attention to detail is amazing. One example is how the mall sign changes from Two Pines Mall to Lone Pine Mall later in the movie because when Marty was back in time he ran over one of the pines.

Virtuoso director Leone gives it an impressive sense of grandeur while also always remembering to concentrate on human emotions, as it takes its characters and audience on this dramatic (but never melodramatic) journey. It's subtly performed by all, with absolutely gorgeous widescreen photography. Leone dares to take his time telling this tale (scripted by himself and Sergio Donati, based on a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci, and Leone), which might drive less than patient people up the wall, but the film offers plenty of rewards for those that stick with it. You really come to either care for or loathe these characters, waiting to find out how things will be resolved and what will become of everyone. Enhancing all of it is one of Ennio Morricone's loveliest ever scores; it's likely to bring a lump to your throat several times.Four reliable performers play individuals whose lives come together Claudia Cardinale is Jill McBain, a former whore who's married well and is on her way to join her husband and his family. Charles Bronson is the unnamed man with the harmonica, who's a man on a mission. Not until near the end does his motivation finally become clear. Jason Robards is Cheyenne, a notorious half-breed outlaw who gets falsely accused of the slaughter of Jill's family-to-be, which was actually perpetrated by the vile, ambitious Frank. In a genius bit of casting, Henry Fonda, who had played so many upright and morally strong men before, plays this role, and does it with commendable restraint, refraining from ever becoming a moustache-twirling Oilcan Harry. Forming part of the plot is the attempt to build a town that will take advantage of a railroad being built.Leone gets wonderful performances out of his entire cast. Some of them are just making special appearances, which might make one wish that they had more to do, but they're welcome no matter what Woody Strode, Jack Elam, Keenan Wynn, Frank Wolff, Lionel Stander. Gabriele Ferzetti has the delicious role of physically disabled but devious railroad baron Mr. Morton, but it's Mr. Fonda who proves to be the most fun to watch.Leone prepares you for what's to come with his effectively protracted, stylized opening credits sequence. It plays out slowly, but the tension is unbelievable. From then on he covers a lot of ground. The film has a long running time at two hours and 46 minutes, but never feels as long as that.

Each born to their own time, each having found out through one way or another that they cannot die, unless decapitated by another immortal. And in due time, when their numbers start to wane, there would come a time, the Gathering, when those remaining would have to decide, who is deserving to become the last one.There can be only one.Upon its release in 1986 this film was panned by the critics, though for the life of me, I can't figure out why. This is a bold, flashy and ambitious movie. It sets out to create its own world, its own mythos, and by the end of the final fight it has succeeded. The idea of ageless beings, who don't feel the ravages of time, but can still be slain by mortal means, has always fascinated me and this film is one of the best example of the idea I've yet seen.We don't meet all that many immortals through the course of the film - five in total, I believe - but each and every one of them feels unique and interesting. Christopher Lambert plays the eponymous Highlander and delivers a great straight man and an audience surrogate. His bewilderment in the olden days upon finding out he just cannot die feels very believable, but when the film returns back to the modern age he has visibly matured. Sean Connery plays the role of Ramirez, an early guide for Highlander and no, I have no idea why they have a Frenchman playing a Scot and a Scot playing an Egyptian playing a Spaniard. One of the film's quirks, I suppose. Nevertheless it's unintentionally hilarious, but not in a bad way.Huge props should also go to Clancy Brown, playing the role of The Kurgan, bloodthirsty savage of an immortal, who has killed the most by the time of the Gathering. The man completely submerges himself into the role and what we end up getting is one of the nuttiest and most unhinged bad guys the cinema has seen. Yet the man is more than his rage and need to kill. He also believes in the code and wants to do the battles a certain way, which gives him an extra layer of depth.Probably the most off-putting thing about this film is its 80s visual style. You know the one, where everything is dark and shadowed, smudged and covered in dirt. I don't know why the 80s felt the need to make us feel unclean by merely looking at the screen, but it's still there. Though, to be fair, it's not a huge problem in this film as the style fits the bleak mood of the story rather well. Aside from that the film is fine on the technical side of things. The fights are suitably impressive, the cinematography works and the story is told well, though I've heard that some people have had difficulties following it. I personally didn't have any problem, though I did see the director's cut, so perhaps that's it.Highlander is a great film if you like swordfights, charismatic characters, bleak survival stories and the whole 80s urban fantasy style. It has a clear understanding of what it is doing and it delivers exactly what you want from it. Recommended.

The idea of ageless beings, who don't feel the ravages of time, but can still be slain by mortal means, has always fascinated me and this film is one of the best example of the idea I've yet seen.We don't meet all that many immortals through the course of the film - five in total, I believe - but each and every one of them feels unique and interesting. Christopher Lambert plays the eponymous Highlander and delivers a great straight man and an audience surrogate. His bewilderment in the olden days upon finding out he just cannot die feels very believable, but when the film returns back to the modern age he has visibly matured. Sean Connery plays the role of Ramirez, an early guide for Highlander and no, I have no idea why they have a Frenchman playing a Scot and a Scot playing an Egyptian playing a Spaniard. One of the film's quirks, I suppose. Nevertheless it's unintentionally hilarious, but not in a bad way.Huge props should also go to Clancy Brown, playing the role of The Kurgan, bloodthirsty savage of an immortal, who has killed the most by the time of the Gathering. The man completely submerges himself into the role and what we end up getting is one of the nuttiest and most unhinged bad guys the cinema has seen. Yet the man is more than his rage and need to kill. He also believes in the code and wants to do the battles a certain way, which gives him an extra layer of depth.Probably the most off-putting thing about this film is its 80s visual style. You know the one, where everything is dark and shadowed, smudged and covered in dirt. I don't know why the 80s felt the need to make us feel unclean by merely looking at the screen, but it's still there. Though, to be fair, it's not a huge problem in this film as the style fits the bleak mood of the story rather well. Aside from that the film is fine on the technical side of things. The fights are suitably impressive, the cinematography works and the story is told well, though I've heard that some people have had difficulties following it. I personally didn't have any problem, though I did see the director's cut, so perhaps that's it.Highlander is a great film if you like swordfights, charismatic characters, bleak survival stories and the whole 80s urban fantasy style. It has a clear understanding of what it is doing and it delivers exactly what you want from it. Recommended.

However, I really enjoyed this film. I used to view Jim Carrey as one of those actors that everyone (who didn't live in a collection of moss under a rock) knew and loved that I just couldn't find anything special about - that was before I saw some of his great films like Eternal Sunshine, The Truman Show, and Man on the Moon.Carrey plays the eccentric, inventive comedian Andy Kaufman with wonderful style and devotion to the techniques and candour that Kaufman was so loved for. He does Kaufman justice, and so does the film. Furthermore, Man on the Moon was directed by Milos Forman, director of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus - two incredibly well-made masterpieces of modern cinema. Though this film is not nearly as good as either of the aforementioned films, it is pretty good in it's own right. It is in tune with Kaufman's personalities and his obstinate nature.I most enjoyed the beginning of the film, the little prank that Carrey's Andy Kaufman played on the audience. I'd have supposed that's the way Kaufman himself would've started his biopic had he been alive during the making of the film. It is a delightful sort of bond that the audience can share with Kaufman or at least the image of Kaufman - and I appreciate the writers, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, for incorporating this - whether it was their idea, or not.I am a fond admirer of Kaufman and even watched the TV show Taxi to see him as Foreign Man, so perhaps I like this film a little more than I should because of the subject of the film... is this wrong though? When I was in middle school - yes, middle school - I started a fan club within my group of friends regarding that Kaufman's death was only a prank. Though only 3 people joined in - of which 2 were unfamiliar with who Kaufman was beforehand, and the other 1 was myself - it remains one of the nicest memories of my adolescence.Man on the Moon is a hilarious film, perhaps that's not at the expense of the film itself, but rather due to the context of it, but, nonetheless, it is a pleasure to view whether one knows Kaufman or not. I recommend seeing this film to people who do love Kaufman, or Carrey, or even the people who don't. It's an amusing biopic and can be regarded as well-made - if not anything else.

The matriarch is willing to spend millions in order to rewrite her son's history, and those millions are earmarked to go toward lobotomizing her niece, who knows the truth.The dysfunctional relationship between Violet Venable (Katharine Hepburn) and her late son Sebastian is apparent during her initial consultation with a neurosurgeon, played by Montgomery Clift. She speaks of Sebastian in the present tense, and it becomes obvious that Sebastian, rather than her late husband, was her primary love interest.Elizabeth Taylor portrays Catherine, Ms. Venable's niece, who was with Sebastian when he was killed. Catherine is well aware of Sebastian's sexual preferences and her statements to that effect provide the impetus for Violet to insist on ensuring her silence. She first has her admitted to a private sanitarium that has a no visitors policy; then she contacts Dr. Cukrowicz and insists that Catherine needs a lobotomy in order to be at peace. In the end, Cukrowicz puts the pieces of Catherine's alleged hallucinations together, injects her with truth serum and allows her to tell the story of Sebastian's death, hinting that the reason he was killed was because of his sexual involvement with one or more of the young men he used Catherine to attract.Freudian imagery abounds throughout this movie, which is something that may be lost on modern audiences and may well offend those who are gay. The Freudian concept that homosexuals are made, not born, by being in the presence of an overbearing, controlling female is reinforced in several scenes Violet maintains a Venus flytrap that she pampers in a glass house while feeding it live flies; Violet describes a journey to the Galapagos Islands during which flesh eating birds attack newly hatched sea turtles and devour them. Violet embodies the devouring female archetype, and the fact that she followed Sebastian to Asia when he decided to become a Buddhist monk instead of remaining with her dying husband makes this even more clear.Overall, the movie is well made, although Clift's character tends to be more subdued than would be expected and it's difficult to make Taylor's character less than glamorous. It makes no judgments toward homosexuality; rather, it depicts how the denial of reality can destroy those who insist on whitewashing the truth.

It is marred, though, by a script (possibly accurately reproducing the tone of the source novel, which I've not read) which has an overly simplistic approach to its characters, in particular to its protagonist McMurphy and his nemesis Nurse Ratched. McMurphy is our typical anti-hero, held up for our approval in spite of being an unrepentant apologist for grim offences; whilst Nurse Ratched is shown no mercy (and therefore given no depth) by the authors. This could have made for a two-dimensional movie. Fortunately the actors reached way beyond the binary world they were presented with and infused their characters with, in Nicholson's case, roguish charm and, in Louise Fletcher's case, inner complexity. They are both magnificent and richly deserved every award they won for their performances.They are superbly supported by a remarkable crew of scene-stealers - Danny Devito, Sydney Lassick, Scatman Carruthers, Christopher Lloyd, William Redfield, Will Sampson - and by a quietly effective, apparently one-off performance by Lan Fendors as Ratched's assistant nurse.The polarities of the film - conformism\/individualism, control\/freedom - are eternally important themes in our lives. In Milos Forman the film had a director who completely understood the significance of the material, crafting a film of real power with his DOP Haskell Wexler. But to me its message is weakened by the way its women - with the exception of Ms Fendors' taciturn nurse - are polarised as either dragons or whores. I've read that before Ms Fletcher was offered the role of Nurse Ratched, a number of actresses had turned it down because of the script was so misogynistic.

Unfortunately, Mayor Larry Vaughn fears the opposite; closing the beaches will ruin Amity Island's summer tourist season, the town's primary income source for the year.It's not long into the film before we and the terrified people of Amity Island discover that this creature of the sea is not one to be messed with.

Clever use of the camera and iconic musical score hints that danger is nearby but for the poor guy on screen, they have no idea what's lurking underneath them. It captures the feeling of helplessness I have every time I swim in the ocean, or even when I was younger just in the local swimming pool.

The man-eating killer shark doing what it can to get by or the 'putting everyone's life in stake for profit' Mayor. One shocking scene halfway through the film shows a crowded beach with nobody in the water. The Mayor walks over to a friend, a father with his family, and forces them to get in.

They do so unwillingly, their faces read pure fear but eventually it leads to a sea filled buffet for the shark (I don't refer to the shark as Jaws because that's just the name of the film, not the shark itself). It may be shocking but it was a shockingly great way to make the Mayor even more of a douche.Martin Brody soon teams up with shark enthusiast Matt Hooper and shark hunter Quint. There's some tension between them which is escalated with the fact they are alone on a small boat out in the ocean. It creates exciting chemistry when they are risking their lives trying to catch this beast. Despite having more camera time in this part of the movie, the shark looks and moves incredibly well for a film from the 70\u2032s. It definitely still holds up today.It's been almost 40 years since it's release and still Jaws remains as one of the best suspense\/thriller film ever released. If you haven't seen this film for whatever reason you need to check it out. If you've already seen it before, maybe it's time to watch it again.

It was a real bad year for the Oscars, I think. Of the five, I like Born on the Fourth of July a lot. Or at least I used to like it. I haven't seen it in years and I'm not sure it would hold up that well. The other four are quite mediocre, with one of the most mediocre winners of all time, Driving Miss Daisy. If you can extrapolate the general IMDb voter's opinion, Dead Poets Society should have won. It's the highest rated of the five, and has about 140,000 more votes than the next most voted on title. That's pretty amazing, really. I don't get it, frankly. Dead Poets Society to me was probably the worst of the five, just complete sludge. The film is about a group of rich white boys at a boarding school who become enamored of their free-spirited teacher, Robin Williams, who teaches them to carpe diem, or sieze the day. The boys (who include Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) form the Dead Poets Society, where they meet at night in a cave to read poetry. This is, for no reason in particular, highly looked down upon. And woe unto you if you ever want to act in a Shakespeare play, as Leonard eventually does. His father, Kurtwood Smith, does not approve of such frivolities. The final act of this film is pretty ridiculous, with Robin Williams incurring blame for something that clearly had nothing to do with him. The ending, which is supposed to be uplifting, just feels extremely unsatisfying. The performances are actually quite fine. Williams certainly didn't deserve a Best Actor nomination, though. This is clearly category fraud. There is no clear lead, but both Leonard and Hawke probably have more screen time than Williams, who seems like he's barely in the film for it being such a well loved performance.

Many comedies are only good for a few half-hearted laughs. Others are good for a hearty chuckle, but lack a decent plot to make the movie memorable. A select few can connect to the audience with an engaging plot paired with hilarious jokes and lines that everyone will be saying for years to come. Tommy Boy is definitely in the latter of these categories.If an interesting plot is what you're looking for, Tommy Boy delivers. Tommy Callahan (Chris Farley), a fresh college grad, but also a dimwitted goof off, inherits his father's auto part business after his sudden death. His father was a smooth talking, legendary car parts salesman, and the business is in trouble after his death. Tommy must take over the business and is faced with something he's never had in his entire life, responsibility. He embarks on a trip to sell a new line of brake pads in order to save his business, and the jobs of all his workers. He experiences many obstacles and challenges along the way. This plot, paired with a mystery, a love story, and downright hilarious scenes, makes this movie one to remember.Backing up the plot, there is a cast of great actors, including the dynamic duo of Chris Farley and David Spade. These two actors make the movie what it is. The always loud and obnoxious Chris Farley is perfect for the part of Tommy, a loud-mouthed dimwitted fool. David spade is as sarcastic as ever in his portrayal of Richard, the sarcastic know-it-all who accompanies Tommy on the brake pad selling journey. These two very different characters' bickering and disagreements, paired with the ridiculous situations they find themselves, are the main source of humor in this movie.With Tommy and Richard's crazy situations, along with other hilarious moments involving the rest of the supporting cast, Tommy Boy has everything a movie needs to be considered a great comedy. Between the slapstick humor, the crazy situations, the foolish actions and statements of Tommy, the sarcastic retorts of Richard, and the memorable lines that will be repeated by everyone for years, there is hardly any room to stop laughing.Behind every great movie is a great director, and Tommy Boy has Peter Segal to back it up. Peter Segal has made many great comedies including The Longest Yard, 50 First Dates, and Anger Management. He by no means mars his reputation with this movie, but rather bolsters it. The movie is very well done and organized, and keeps the interest of the audience.

It certainly didn't live up to the hype for me. Technically it was quite good, especially considering it was made in the very early days of the talkies when the actors and directors didn't have much experience with the medium and were experimenting with a lot of new techniques. The sets were outstanding, including the battles and scenes of war-ravaged France, and the cinematography was excellent for the time (if you watch it after seeing Saving Private Ryan or something recent, you will be disappointed), but for 1930 it was very well done.My problem with the movie is that it (and the novel it was based on) is really is just a pacifist propaganda piece. The film does a good job of portraying the plight of the German infantryman in WWI, and it was truly terrible by any measure The soldiers lived in terrible conditions, were treated like disposable cannon-fodder by their leaders, and not even the most basic logistical services (like food) were provided for them. What the movie does not allow for is the possibility of a war needing to be fought as an absolute last resort. Had the novel\/film been content to limit its scope to the horrors of the German infantryman in WWI, that would be one thing. But it is not content with that. It has to make the point that all war, by definition, for all time, is not worth it and there could be no conceivable justifiable reason for a nation to go to war. As a universal message, it just doesn't stand up.Maybe from the German perspective in the aftermath of the pointlessness of WWI when the novel was written, the author just could not conceive of a valid reason for fighting a war or that countries sending their young men off to war might make efforts to provide some everyday comforts to their soldiers, and not expose them to any more danger than is absolutely necessary.But we know better now, and I suspect a lot of people in 1930s Hollywood knew better too. They certainly did during and after WWII, and countless books and movies have thoroughly explored the concept of the just war while still showing the horrors of war. The message espoused by the film just doesn't stand up today, unless you're prepared to make the case that fighting against Nazism and Hitler just wasn't worth it. That's why, for me at least, this film doesn't stand the test of time. I really don't see why we are still calling this movie a classic more than 80 years later, except as an excellent example of film from the era.

But Gavras hasn't the choice either because at the time, it was still the dictatorship there and at least, Theodorakis' score helps to feel this culture.In all cases, this movie is just amazing. In our dark time in which democracy is stomped, this committed production is just a needy breath of air. For one time, political power isn't told as courageous, bold, historic but rather as corrupted, authoritarian. In short, the movie doesn't depict them as how they would like to appear but rather as how they really are. It's also a excellent lesson in constitutional law as it illustrates the meaning of the separation of powers  a real democracy is where each power is independent. Thus here, you can conclude it isn't one as the administration is vehement to tell the judiciary what it must does. At last, it's a extraordinary story about courage and conviction.

I've no idea how close it is to the source material, having never read '2000 AD', but I do recognise a derivative and fairly generic sci-fi shooter when I see one. The setting looks like Blade Runner but on a sunny day while our hero has to put up with the usual trappings of those stuck in an average action movie - comic sidekicks, love interest, revelations about their past, etc. It's frustrating because somewhere in there, a good movie with good ideas is fighting to get out but it sacrifices its origins to simply settle for being a blockbuster. And frankly, not a good one.In the future, when most of the Earth's surface has turned into a wasteland and the populations are forced to live in vast cities, law and order have basically broken down. Attempting to restore civic order are the heavily armed Judges who act as police, judge and executioner if need be. The most respected and feared in Mega City One is Judge Dredd (Stallone) who has dedicated himself to uphold the law absolutely but after he is framed for murder, out-going Chief Judge Fargo (Max Von Sydow) is forced to jail Dredd for life. While Dredd's partner Hershey (Diane Lane) seeks the truth, Dredd finds himself teaming up with petty criminal Herman Ferguson (Rob Schneider) in order to clear his name. But Dredd's past is coming back to haunt him in the shape of ex-Judge Rico (Armand Assante) who has plans far bigger than taking Dredd down...Judge Dredd makes an odd choice from the get-go by ignoring the vast history and traditions established since 1977 in '2000 AD' and instead turns the character into the very thing he was intended to be a parody of - a gun-toting, no-nonsense meat-head who mistakes the law for justice. In one respect, Stallone is ideal in the role right up until he takes the iconic helmet off and the character dissolves pretty much right away. Schneider adds very little to the film as he's basically being Rob Schneider while Lane & Assante have little to do besides look pretty and sneer maniacally, respectively. The film's look is probably the best thing going for it - Mega City One stretches for endless miles as flying vehicles and Judge bikes swerve between buildings and giant billboards. The sets, sadly, can't match the background as they still feel like parts of the Blade Runner set, complete with extras dressed in outlandish Goth-like clothing and cars built like roughly-chiselled boulders. Even the action seems substandard - guns make weird 'laser' noises when they're fired and the robot bodyguard that Rico picks up looks clunky and amateurish.While fans of the character may have nothing but hatred for Judge Dredd, I find my personal judgement a little more reserved. It's not the most original sci-fi shooter out there but most action fans aren't as demanding as I am. It ticks the necessary boxes without providing anything unexpected or surprising. I've always felt that Stallone is a second-class Schwarzenegger and this felt almost exactly like Stallone's Total Recall - full of action in a sci-fi setting but it doesn't make the most of its ideas or environment and resorts to blowing stuff up and fisticuffs between our square-jawed hero and sneering baddie. They even include such staples as Stallone running away from an explosion in slow-motion (which I swear he does in every film he's ever been in) and even a decaying, semi-ruined Statue Of Liberty. It's little more than a spiritual sequel to Stallone's earlier sci-fi actioner Demolition Man, only it takes an existing licence and then ruins it. I understand that the more recent Dredd is a closer fit to the source material and is also the better film, although I'll be the judge of that when I get around to watching it. As for Judge Dredd, it couldn't be any more middle-of-the-road of it was wearing crash barriers and I find that a real shame.

The plot is thoroughly absorbing, offbeat and full of surprises and the quantity of blood on view is absolutely extraordinary.Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is an unkempt, small-time, private detective who's hired by the immaculate but rather mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to trace the whereabouts of a crooner called Johnny Favorite who'd achieved some success in the period just before World War 11. Favorite had suffered serious injuries during his time in North Africa where he'd been entertaining the troops and had spent time in a mental hospital near Poughkeepsie where it's believed that, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, he'd been treated for shell shock. Cyphre had helped Favorite to launch his career and wanted to know if he was still alive because there were some clauses in his contract that remained unfulfilled.Angel soon discovers that something irregular had happened 12 years earlier (in December 1943) when he traces a clearly falsified document relating to Favorite's apparent transfer to another hospital and then discovers the body of the doctor responsible who'd just been brutally murdered. Spooked by this experience, Angel decides that it's unsafe to continue with the case but after Cyphre increases his fee, he agrees to carry on.His further investigations bring him into contact with a sophisticated fortune teller called Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling), the daughter of one of Favorite's secret lovers, Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and a blues guitarist called Toots Sweet (Brownie McGhee) who'd previously worked in a band with Favorite. All three are distinctly unhelpful and the gruesome events that take place following his contact with them have a powerful effect on Angel who's sharply aware that he's steadily unravelling but can't do anything to improve his predicament. Alarmingly, things get even worse for him when the reasons for his involvement in this dangerous and seemingly intractable case are finally revealed.Some of the content in Angel Heart is shocking and controversial but its greatest quality is the unsettling atmosphere that's present from start to finish. The dark street scene that opens the film sets a sinister tone and everything that follows from the eccentricities of Cyphre to the sounds of the descending steel elevators continues to suggest a lurking threat. This creepiness is further emphasised by the use of drained colours, high camera angles and views of a spiral staircase that work together brilliantly to create a sense of continuing unease.In a tremendous performance, Mickey Rourke inhabits his role so fully that he's utterly convincing as he portrays the difficult changes that Angel goes through and Robert De Niro also makes the most of the scope that Cyphre's character provides. Angel Heart has a haunting quality that makes repeat viewings irresistible and enough twists to ensure that such experiences are both rewarding and enjoyable.
