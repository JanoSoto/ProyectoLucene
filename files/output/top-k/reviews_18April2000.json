It follows the lives of a group of students at the American Ballet Academy over a year, from their audition to get into the school to the final workshop that will determine their future. Much like A Chorus Line, Center Stage goes behind the scenes to give us an insight into a dancer's life, with all its demands, victories and disappointments. In the main roles, Nicholas Hytner cast dancers, portraying the characters' fears, hopes and dreams better than any actor could. Ethan Stiefel is sensational both as a dancer and as an actor. Amanda Schull, Sascha Radetsky, Zoe Saldana and Susan May Pratt give good performances as well. Finally Peter Gallagher and Donna Murphy are perfectly cast respectively as the director of ABA and the ballet teacher.As the characters soon find out, the life of a dancer is not all rosy as Jonathan Reeves tells his students at the beginning of the year, they may have been the best of their classes up to then, but at ABA they will have to work harder every day to be one of the 6 chosen ones to become part of the company. Both Jody and Maureen are forced to re-examine what they want to do with their lives at some point and everyone ends up with a different goal than the one they set out to achieve.The dance sequences are some of the best ever seen on the big screen. Cooper Nielsen's last ballet - choreographed by Susan Stroman - is absolutely fantastic. Any dancer or dance lover will greatly appreciate performances of Romeo & Juliet, Stars and Stripes and Swan Lake. As a dancer myself, I believe that this is one of the best movies about dance that I've ever seen.This is an excellent film, at once funny and moving.

Nelson, William L. Peterson, Christopher McDonald, Hill Harper, and Leslie Bibb. Directed by Rob Cohen. Written by John Pogue. Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for violence, some language, and brief sexuality).By Blake French\tA secret society so powerful, it can give you anything&#133;at a price. That is the subtitle to The Skulls, a new thriller by Rob Cohen. The film is entirely fictional, although it claims to use concepts behind a real secret campus society called Skull and Bones. This film rips off the outline of the society's reputation and controversy, but the filmmakers should have ripped off even more-as much as they could have. At first glance this movie, with its ironic principles and mysterious overtones, sounds as if it may be something of interest, and extremely externally it is. However, if you are a filmgoer who likes films with the slightest hint of intelligence or consistence, you will discover The Skulls is a horrendous production.\tJoshua Jackson, (also starring in the upcoming Gossip) is cast as a college student named Luke McNamara. His roommates are the rich and beautiful Chloe (Leslie Bibb), whom Luke has a forbidden crush on, and an African American student journalist named Will Beckford (Hill Harper). Luke is a very busy young man. He is a varsity rower, works in a fast food restaurant, is a full time student, and rides his bicycle everywhere. Luke also has an unsettling history his father passed away when he was a baby and has no mother. Even so, due to his strong will, an elite force chooses him as a candidate for membership to the top-secret society The Skulls.\tAnother key character in this film is Luke's other friend, Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), who is popular among young girls and is muscularly attractive in appearance. His father, Litten (ex-Coach star Craig T. Nelson) is running for Supreme Court. Litten is also a judge for the Skulls, heads the society along with Sen. Ames Levitt (William Petersen). Caleb is under high amounts of pressure by his demanding father who expects his son to live up to the family name. This is one cliché I have had enough of lately.\tInside the Skull's headquarters, there are surreal and enticingly designed sets. They include a pool filled with black coffins, many dark hallways, private trap doors, concealed dungeons, several cement arches, and a creepy collage of ornamentation. During a business introduction, the society provides prostitutes for the members. Other benefits include money being casually added into bank accounts, free sexy sports cars, college acceptance, and protection against outsiders. All of this heavenly treatment soon becomes distant and inferior to Luke after Will dies mysteriously.\tThe Society is first developed through casual conversations. Entrance is like playing a giant video game. The characters are forced to undergo tests to prove their strength? Their bravery? Their endurance? Their strategy? We never learn about the Skulls enough to understand what happens.To make things worse for The Skulls, its stakes are simply not high enough-or perhaps there is too little conflict. What little tension present is not introduced until the story is well on its way into the second half. The movie is not challenging, involving, or thought provoking. Partially to blame is the lack of empathy for the main character. There is no narrative connection between Luke and the audience. Half way through the story he becomes absolute, then miraculously back in action. The rest of the characters are mechanical, one-dimensional plot puppets. No one has a mind of their own. All actions, or should I say reactions, are cause and effect notions, developing little tension or depth. As if the father-son strives were not enough, the movie also features a romantic cliché between Chloe and Luke. The audience never cares about this romantic subplot because it is never developed or examined. Leslie Bibb and Joshua Jackson do not create passionate character chemistry. Paul Walker, whose horrible Meet The Deedles still wreaks in the back of my mind, once again struts his flaunting character around like an arrogant robot. He recites his aimless dialogue as if mechanically programmed.\tAs bad as The Skulls is, I still would have never reasoned a conclusion like this. I have no idea what the filmmakers were thinking when they decided to portray an ending consisting of a duel between Caleb and Luke to withdrawal truth behind a death. What does a dead student, a secret society, a beautiful girl, and an old fashion sharp shooting challenge have in common? In one scene, a chairman of the Skulls asks Luke if he has any questions. Millions, he responds inquisitively. After watching The Skulls, we know exactly how Luke feels. The Skulls is brought to you by Universal Pictures.

Nelson, William L. Peterson, Christopher McDonald, Hill Harper, and Leslie Bibb. Directed by Rob Cohen. Written by John Pogue. Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for violence, some language, and brief sexuality).By Blake French\tA secret society so powerful, it can give you anything&#133;at a price. That is the subtitle to The Skulls, a new thriller by Rob Cohen. The film is entirely fictional, although it claims to use concepts behind a real secret campus society called Skull and Bones. This film rips off the outline of the society's reputation and controversy, but the filmmakers should have ripped off even more-as much as they could have. At first glance this movie, with its ironic principles and mysterious overtones, sounds as if it may be something of interest, and extremely externally it is. However, if you are a filmgoer who likes films with the slightest hint of intelligence or consistence, you will discover The Skulls is a horrendous production.\tJoshua Jackson, (also starring in the upcoming Gossip) is cast as a college student named Luke McNamara. His roommates are the rich and beautiful Chloe (Leslie Bibb), whom Luke has a forbidden crush on, and an African American student journalist named Will Beckford (Hill Harper). Luke is a very busy young man. He is a varsity rower, works in a fast food restaurant, is a full time student, and rides his bicycle everywhere. Luke also has an unsettling history his father passed away when he was a baby and has no mother. Even so, due to his strong will, an elite force chooses him as a candidate for membership to the top-secret society The Skulls.\tAnother key character in this film is Luke's other friend, Caleb Mandrake (Paul Walker), who is popular among young girls and is muscularly attractive in appearance. His father, Litten (ex-Coach star Craig T. Nelson) is running for Supreme Court. Litten is also a judge for the Skulls, heads the society along with Sen. Ames Levitt (William Petersen). Caleb is under high amounts of pressure by his demanding father who expects his son to live up to the family name. This is one cliché I have had enough of lately.\tInside the Skull's headquarters, there are surreal and enticingly designed sets. They include a pool filled with black coffins, many dark hallways, private trap doors, concealed dungeons, several cement arches, and a creepy collage of ornamentation. During a business introduction, the society provides prostitutes for the members. Other benefits include money being casually added into bank accounts, free sexy sports cars, college acceptance, and protection against outsiders. All of this heavenly treatment soon becomes distant and inferior to Luke after Will dies mysteriously.\tThe Society is first developed through casual conversations. Entrance is like playing a giant video game. The characters are forced to undergo tests to prove their strength? Their bravery? Their endurance? Their strategy? We never learn about the Skulls enough to understand what happens.To make things worse for The Skulls, its stakes are simply not high enough-or perhaps there is too little conflict. What little tension present is not introduced until the story is well on its way into the second half. The movie is not challenging, involving, or thought provoking. Partially to blame is the lack of empathy for the main character. There is no narrative connection between Luke and the audience. Half way through the story he becomes absolute, then miraculously back in action. The rest of the characters are mechanical, one-dimensional plot puppets. No one has a mind of their own. All actions, or should I say reactions, are cause and effect notions, developing little tension or depth. As if the father-son strives were not enough, the movie also features a romantic cliché between Chloe and Luke. The audience never cares about this romantic subplot because it is never developed or examined. Leslie Bibb and Joshua Jackson do not create passionate character chemistry. Paul Walker, whose horrible Meet The Deedles still wreaks in the back of my mind, once again struts his flaunting character around like an arrogant robot.

It is sheer poetry in motion. Sergio Leone, the man who revolutionized the western genre with the Clint Eastwood trilogy, now gives us an absolute masterpiece. This movie features an Italian all-star trio (Leone-deNiro-Morricone) who have really excelled themselves in this one. The story tells us of young Noodles and his three friends, Maxie, Patsie, and Cockeye, who soon realize they have got to stick together, for protection as well as profit. This bond they formed as boys was to them as sacred as blood, and would affect each of them profoundly, as long as any of them lived. One of the things that struck me first about this movie was its music. Ennio Morricone has created a masterpiece inside another one. All of the tunes, but especially Cockeye's song, the one with the pan flute, are absolutely fabulous. It enthralls us from the first minute, and we are still whistling it long after the movie has ended. The actors and actresses are brilliant. The fact that the movie failed to reap a handful (or two) of Academy Awards really makes us shun such dubious criteria. I feel it was as big an injustice as Kafka never winning the literary Nobel prize. I have praised this movie as much as I could muster the words, and yet I know I have fallen short of its greatness. If you have not watched this movie yet, please do so. For your own benefit. If you have watched it already, then I reckon you will agree with me that this movie is just as good as they get. Bravo!

Audrey Hepburn is a UN translator whose husband is killed by a seemingly motiveless murderer. In her Paris home she is menaced by ex-soldiers James Coburn, Ned Glass and George Kennedy, fed confusing information by spy Walter Matthau and aided by the charming but elusive Cary Grant. The plot (five men who were behind enemy lines in wartime Germany stole a hoard of gold. Now four of them have come back to find the loot and the man who double-crossed them) is secondary to the suspense generated in the treasure hunt across Paris. The villains &#150; particularly Kennedy as a one-armed hood who literally makes sparks fly &#150; are genuinely menacing to poor Hepburn's sexy young widow, and trying to work out just on who's side Grant is provides much entertainment (especially as he changes identity every quarter of an hour). Charade's director Stanley Donen (former dancer and maker of musicals) easily out-Hitches Hitchcock.  In its way, this was a hugely influential film. The villain with a metal hook motif was taken up again in the Moore Bond Live and Let Die, while the music and editing influenced the later Bond cycle (the film even has a pre-title teaser scene, a trait the later Bonds would make their own). The subplot, about stealing gold during wartime, provided the basis for the Clint Eastwood actioneer Kelly's Heroes and the recent George Clooney effort Three Kings. The photography, lighting and music (courtesy of Henri Mancini) are as good as &#150; if not better than &#150; anything the Bonds of the time could come up with (this is 1963, the same year as From Russia With Love). Particularly riveting is a rooftop fight between Grant and the one-armed Kennedy. This is one of the best fights in cinema history, nasty, suspenseful and with a viciousness that only the Dalton and Brosnan Bond movies have matched in the action films of recent years. When watching the film, you become aware that Grant was the model for the screen Bond. It's a pity he turned down Dr. No and never played the part, but at least here we have a taste of what his Bond might have been like. If you like comedy thrillers you won't want to miss a moment of this one. Director Donen, composer Mancini and scriptwriter Peter Stone reunited three years later for Arabesque, a suspenser with Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck in the Hepburn and Grant roles.

Also, the Oscar-nominated song It might be you perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to Michael's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities - the touch of the baby to his cheek, the poignant sight of Julie's skirt swishing in the kitchen, and the offering to Dorothy of her chocolate-covered finger to suck.  The images that go with the song are vivid and laced with tender irony. None of the actors strike a wrong tone - all the leading players are superb, but so are the bit players, including the frosty woman producer and black floor manager.  Tune in to some of the the throwaway asides from characters at the edge of the screen (e.g. moving round the two contrasting party scenes) and you get a real sense of scriptwriters, performers and editors working to capacity. Classic moments include Teri Garr's locked-bathroom scene and Bill Murray's arrival home to prevent Dorothy's seduction by the tragic Dr Van Horn.
