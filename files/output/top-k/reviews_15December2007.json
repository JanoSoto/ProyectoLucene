Woods writes several articles, where he speaks critically about views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington). Soon Woods meets Biko and he changes his views about him and he also begins to understand what authorities are doing to black people in South Africa (right from the top, even from the chief of police). When Biko dies in police custody, Woods decides that he have to write book about him and that no matter what he has to publish it. But Woods must escape from his country to get that book published and he must also put his family on second place, so world can find out the truth.Attenborough managed to make a good movie about people, with main message that black and white are the same, cause we are all people.

I wonder when the last time they saw it and paid attention was. This movie sits atop a lofty reputation, which is all that it has in its favor. What is the case for this being a good film?No character is likable. In any scene when the main character is with one of his friends from school, that scene ends with one of them being abandoned by their friends to a horrible fate of some kind alone, bullies, frozen tongues, etc.The younger brother lives under the sink and is only able to eat his food when his mom tells him to act like a pig, which he does for a really, really long time (editing, anyone?)in disgusting, glorious detail. Probably that kid grows up to be a serial killer. Mom pulls little Ralphie off a kid whose nose he has just broken, and without waiting to find out what happened, leaves the other kid there lying in the snow, bleeding. Covered in blood.

And now I will anticipate a response in the defense but that's how things were. I hope life at the time was better. This movie celebrates mediocrity.

But the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion. No less an authority than Leonard Maltin says 'Forbidden Planet' ...is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre. Ambitious? Without a doubt. Intelligent? Depends on what part of the film you're talking about. It certainly was the most prestigious and highly-budgeted science-fiction flick to that point. At a cost of nearly $2 million (this was 1956, remember), MGM pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling, eye-popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before, even employing artists from the Disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects. 'Charming' is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci-fi movies, yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here. Even the dreaded 'Monster from the Id' is only a well-rendered cartoon figure by the Disney people, unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of 8. When I see the various sets and take note of the art design, models, costumes, etc., I am reminded of nothing so much as 'The Wizard of Oz,' with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects. So much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless. 'Forbidden Planet' is wonderful to look at. The scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated, matte paintings of planets and space in the background, and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth. It's a bit like watching the most elaborately-produced stage play you'd ever see. The most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive Krell complex, where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well-done and credible. But then we get to the actors, darn it. The performances are almost uniformly awful, though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker-room humor, except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble. Even the great actor Walter Pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance, it's lugubrious at times. A very young Leslie Nielsen stars as the spaceship commander J.J. Adams, and doesn't convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film. He seems to instinctively know, thirty years ahead of time, that his true forte' lay in comedy, as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines. Every forced reaction, whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation, looks right out of a high school play. Anne Francis, also very young, fares a little better as the supposedly innocent Alta, whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up. (Alta Morbius, now there's a name for you.) Unfortunately, even at this early age, Anne Francis seems about as virginal and naive as Elizabeth Taylor in 'Butterfield 8.' There is a good story here, buried somewhere beneath the crew-mates' leering comments about Alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning Earl Holliman's 'Cookie,' ship's cook. (Holliman turns in a horrendous performance too. I'm guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school.) Based on Shakespeare's 'The Tempest,' the story of a dead race, the Krell, and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about 'Forbidden Planet,' and for good reason. For a few minutes here and there, you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the Disney artists' conception of the Krell underground complex. Is it enough to make up for the rest of the film's shortcomings? You'll have to decide that on your own. Oh, and of course there's Robby the Robot, every 1950's ten-year-old's idea of what a robot should look and talk like. He's funny. In places. So, 'Forbidden Planet' to me is a very, VERY mixed bag. It deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci-fi films and TV shows that followed, not least of which was 'Star Trek.'

Probably it was just as well, as I never really got into any sporting activity until I discovered swimming. But my nephew was in the Little League in Connecticut, and his career was distinguished by being in the outfield, and enjoying looking at the sky and clouds, or the green grass, or the back wall - and rarely looking at the thing mattered most the ball.It has become a commonplace piece of knowledge that for many kids being on a baseball team in the Little Leagues around the country is a nightmare. The kids look forward to the fun of playing baseball games with kids their own age. The problem is that all too often the enjoyment of the game (and the teaching of good sportsmanship) are sacrificed for the sake of the grown-ups who are in the background (parents, patrons of the teams) and the managers. These grown-ups are only concerned about winning. They have taken the view that winning is the end-all and be-all of living, and that second or third or fourth place in the standings is worthless. Unfortunately too many grown-ups feel this way. After all, how many people are active fans of the real major league teams that constantly are in the cellar? Occasionally such a team (the old Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1920s - 1930s or the original New York Mets comes to mind) do have such a following, but that is a rarity.THE BAD NEWS BEARS was the first film that tackled this problem of bad sportsmanship and enshrining winning within what should be the purest form of baseball. After all, Little League is for kids...isn't it?There are similarities in the film between the character of Morris Buttermaker (Walter Matthau) and Tom Hanks' character in A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, about the women's baseball league of the Second World War era. Hanks and Matthau have serious drinking problems. Hanks is in the majors with a Chicago team but is washing himself up with management - and takes this job managing the woman's team as a last chance to square things with his boss. Butterworth was a promising rookie in the minor leagues, who once (in a practice game) struck out Ted Williams. But contract disputes (he claims) prevented him from getting into the majors, and he takes the job managing the Yuma Bears for a salary. It is obvious that the parents behind this (led by a Councilman played by Ben Piazza) have little faith in his long dormant abilities - the Councilman even tries to palm off an unsigned check to Butterworth for his services at the beginning (a real sign of contempt). Subsequently the Councilman even drops supporting the team when it loses it's first game by a score of 26 to 0.Certainly the team is full of misfits, an overweight kid with a loud mouth (Gary Lee Cavagnaro), a would be African-American militant (Erin Blunt), and two Spanish speaking kids (Jaime Escobedo and George Gonzales) being only a portion of them. And initially the opportunist in Butterworth makes his work as manager become second-rate (he rarely trains them when sober, and he even has them assist him in his job as a swimming pool cleaner). But their unhappiness at their first defeat is too much. Also there is the unasked for and patronizing advise of fellow Coach Roy Turner (Vic Morrow, in a good performance), who is stressing how embarrassing the Bears are, and how they have no place in the league, and should quit. Matthau takes such a dislike to him that he is determined to turn the team around.He does this first by actually training the team, so they start cohering together (and start actually playing the game correctly). Then he goes after his one great discovery. When he was romancing her mother, Butterworth was training Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neill) on pitching and fielding, so that she is a powerhouse (though not as good as a hitter). He manages to get her to join the team, agreeing to pay for her ballet classes and for a pair of European jeans she wants. Later he also manages to get another good all-around player, Tanner Boyle (Chris Barnes). The result is that the team soon is zooming up in the League to the point that it and Turner's Yankees are to play the deciding game of the summer.Butterworth does not realize that Amanda's willingness to go along with him is based on the hope that he (a man she actually idolizes) will marry her mother. As for Tanner, he's a pint-sized hood who happens to decide to join the Bears only because he dislikes the self-important Turner (who keeps harassing him on the baseball field).The final twenty minutes of the movie deals with the price the poor kids in both teams pay for the glory of the adults. Butterworth shows a mean opportunism that the kids resent on his team, while Turner manages to permanently louse up his relationship with his son and wife by humiliating the boy for not following his orders. By the way, Turner's son gets one of the best revenges on an adult I've ever seen in any movie dealing with inter-generational and family relationships. Let us just say Turner is not facing a happy future when the film ends.A comedy about an area rarely touched until then in films (a scene in the James Garner - Kim Novak comedy BOYS NIGHT OUT was one of the few that dealt with Little League before this full study of it), THE BAD NEWS BEARS is a nice reaffirmation on what sports is supposed to be about fun.

A quick review of the plot may make the film look rather morbid, but nothing could be further from the truth. Its a completely compelling mystery and one of the screen's greatest romances. The screenplay (apparently by four different writers) is superb, full of fascinating characters and lots of witty dialog. Otto Preminger's direction is great as well, full of atmosphere and expertly paced. The fact that the cast on board is one of the finest ever assembled is simply the icing on the cake.What makes this film work so well, as mentioned above, is the combination of great writing and great acting. All the performers give the perfect nuances to their characters. Dana Andrews plays the tough detective who is revealed to have a heart as the film continues. Vincent Price is also very good in one of his pre-horror stardom roles as Laura's slimy finance, as is Clifton Webb as the witty (and possibly gay) mentor \/ columnist. Still, the real star here is Gene Tierney. Shes absolutely gorgeous and a great actress to boot. She radiates star power and its a shame her tragic personal life has somewhat prevented her from obtaining the legendary status she more than deserves. Laura is one of the finest films from the 40s.

Not the story, but the intended message, because surely there is one.The story is straightforward enough. Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern)is a drug-abusing, loud-mouthed, selfish girl who has had a couple of illegitimate kids and is now pregnant again. She's been in and out of jail and rehab programs so often she can't remember how many times. Now she's picked up for sniffing glue again and the court puts her back in the slams and advises her, strongly, to abort this new child.But she is bailed out by a devout working-class family (Kurtwood Smith, Mary Kay Place) who want to save her and her baby. They're sincere enough. They have a tough time scraping together the $400 bail. The home they take her to is a stifling nest of conventional religiosity and hypocrisy. They don't smoke, don't drink, don't swear, say grace before each meal, and their teen-age daughter sneaks out at night to get drunk and party. And hubby can't stop himself from eying Dern's nubile figure when she's careless with her garb. (You know, I used to be quite a sinner, he tells her while they lie side by side in his old bed.) The family introduce her to a counseling agency who do their best to talk her into saving her baby. The medical staff congratulate her on her pregnancy and show her a doll about the size of the fetus she's now carrying. (It's even got a little thing on it, she says. Sure, because it's a boy doll!) They show her a movie of dead, aborted children, which compares abortion to Buchenwald and Auschwitz, and she winds up changing her mind. Gee, I slept on dumpsters. Maybe I slept on some babies. But she's spirited away by a pro-abortion spy (Swoozie Kurtz) who has been undercover in The Baby Savers movement, and she's taken home to be brainwashed by Kurtz and her girlfriend, who apparently worship Selene, the moon, because they keen a kind of folk song at the night sky. They massage the acupuncture points in her bare feet while they propagandize her and Dern loves it. Do my spleen again. So she decides to abort.But then The Baby Savers come up with a $15,000 check if she decides to save the baby. So she decides to have the baby. And then a Vietnam vet among the pro-choicers matches the reward, so she decides to abort. By this time the issue has become nation-wide and has drawn in the leader of the Baby Savers, Burt Reynolds, who ups the ante to $27,000 if Dern will save the baby. So she decides to save the baby. (During all this, she's been swilling and sniffing everything in sight.) I won't give away the ending except to say that Ruth steals some money and makes off with it before anyone notices. Final shot Dern marching off alone into the distance, accompanied by a triumphant theme, strong-willed, street savvy, a bag full of cash slung over her determined shoulder, still lacking in the frontal lobes that might allow her to plan for a future.It's a satirical look at the abortion debate, and more black than comedic, although it has its laugh lines. Nobody comes off at all well, except maybe the Vietnam amputee who sees through Ruth and offers his $15,000 anyway. That is, she's been planning on how she might spend the windfall. She'll make a down payment on a new house, then buy a new car, then maybe travel to Europe. The vet listens to this then tells her it's baloney, that both of them know the $15,000 will last her about three days.The cast is littered with familiar names, none of whom do an outstanding job but all of whom are competent enough. As a stimulus-hungry, self-destructive, mentally challenged teen-ager, Laura Dern is an attractive and sexy young woman but not a teen-ager. Burt Reynolds brings his usual role distance to the job. He proudly introduces the first boy he ever saved by adopting, the boy who's now about fifteen, the boy who fetches the ice for Reynolds' drinks, the boy who now massages Reynolds' tanned and muscular shoulders on command.But where is the movie headed? I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended. Most black comedies at least give you someone to root for, even if he's not victorious. Dr. Strangelove was a black comedy, too, but President Merkin Muffley at least was sane and rational. Here, the Vietnam vet's role is far too minor for us to identify with him in any way. This reminds me more of Tom Wolf's Bonfire of the Vanities. Everybody in it is stupid and\/or rotten. And the intentions of the producers is ambiguous, along the lines of one of Randy Newman's songs -- I Love L.A. or Short People. Is Newman really defiantly saying he loves Los Angeles, or is he kidding? Maybe the message is that of the Buddha, who was a very practical man. All things in moderation. Avoid zealotry. An excess of passion always leads to disappointment and pain in one form or another.

I was all in favor of the pro-abortionist lesbians but I don't think that's what was intended. Most black comedies at least give you someone to root for, even if he's not victorious. Dr. Strangelove was a black comedy, too, but President Merkin Muffley at least was sane and rational. Here, the Vietnam vet's role is far too minor for us to identify with him in any way. This reminds me more of Tom Wolf's Bonfire of the Vanities. Everybody in it is stupid and\/or rotten. And the intentions of the producers is ambiguous, along the lines of one of Randy Newman's songs -- I Love L.A. or Short People. Is Newman really defiantly saying he loves Los Angeles, or is he kidding? Maybe the message is that of the Buddha, who was a very practical man. All things in moderation. Avoid zealotry. An excess of passion always leads to disappointment and pain in one form or another.

Arnold is know for kicking ass in big budget movies and this is just what he does here. Nothing more. The plot is a lame and uninspired version of Total Recall and it tries to top it with almost hilarious futility. There is even a scene where Arnold wakes up in a cab with no recollection of how he got there. Sound familiar? It should, since you have probably seen that in a better movie.Now, one can't blame this all on Arnold since the producers are likely to be just as much at fault. Take one of the opening sequences that involves two admitted cool helicopter\/jet hybrids racing in a canyon with one on remote control and the other actually being flown by a pilot. It's a fun scene, but it offers nothing more than fancy special effects. I don't mind expansive special effects, but there is a clear difference when these effects are thoughtful and designed with purpose than when they are not. The expansive (and expensive) sets and effects of Total Recall all worked within the film to show you the futuristic world that the story takes place in. Here many things are shown off just because they look cool and the overall sci-fi world isn't really a sci-fi world at all. It is just our contemporary world with random sci-fi things thrown in like holograms, high-tech vehicles and gadgets. Though, in a very odd move, one of the film's main action scenes, a car chase, has just regular cars and a regular suburban setting. The only indicator of science fiction is that these vehicles are virtually indestructible as they plow through houses and take vehicle suspensions to new levels of abuse. However, in the end it just the same old thing reheated, re-glossed, and re-served on the same old movie screen.In other words, wholly uninteresting science fiction\/action movie that barely scratches the surface of its interesting premise. It'll only entertain if taken as a no-brainer action flick, but there are so many of those around anyway. --- 4\/10Rated PG-13 for violence. This is a real MPAA treat as we are treated to lasers severing body parts and neck breaking. A real high for violence in the PG-13 category.

I didn't think this was my kind of 40's western (Oxbow Incident, Red River, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache, etc) and I was right. A definite offspring of GWTW in terms of look and feel with a dash of color-noir thrown in, all I had ever seen was the ridiculous shootout at the end when it was lifted for various documentaries on the western. I couldn't imagine a plot that would get me to such an unlikely conclusion.Still can't.But I found myself enjoying this obvious attempt to entertain on an epic scale without the aid of a grand backdrop like the Civil War. The personal duels in the sun are interesting to watch father and mother; two rival sons; ranchers and the railroad; and finally the mutually destructive finale. It seems that underlying most of these duels are the hormonal drives of young people and their parents. If honesty and self restraint (which are hinted at as life goals by just about everyone except the evil Gregory Peck)had been introduced early on in the story the movie would have no reason to exist. Perhaps the heat of passion and pleasure and ambition is the sun bringing all these duels to the boiling point.This film is overdone in every possible way but that seems somehow appropriate, after all the film itself can be seen as a duel with GWTW. It is gorgeous to look at and fascinating to listen to, but much more a soap opera than a western. The cast overacts at almost every opportunity and that is part of the fun. Today's film acting can't be half as much fun as this was for these guys.How did Gregory Peck ever bounce back to his heroic screen persona after this left turn? So, roll out the hormones and watch people destroy each other with lust and prejudice and ambition before anyone even draws a sixgun or shoulders a rifle.KlassicKlector Steve ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2007","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" It has been on my shelf for quite some time but on this rainy Saturday night I finally watched Duel in the Sun.
