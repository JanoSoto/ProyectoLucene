They all receive a proper attention. It is very well demonstrated in this movie, how hard it is for real people to adequately cope with these huge life events, how to react in a normal way. Some things are funny, some are beyond sadness. Sometimes, we are more in silent shock than talking a lot, simply because we never learned how to address the issues properly - and that comes across in this move astonishingly well. That's where the movie lands a huge, huge, huge blunt impact on the audience in its first half.Then, the relationship between black and white.

Shoot, if I had someone at home like that, I'd get rid of that person too. Commitment is commitment, priorities are priorities, many people think that way, and it's surprising and refreshing to see that Hank simply works that way too, particularly after such a screwed up coincidence that had happened beforehand. I think it's fair enough that people jump over prejudices; it's probably the only way to do it in certain life situations. And I think it is fair enough to assume people can develop, change their opinions, learn, give stuff a second thought. It happens day by day, in an increasingly complex and quickly moving world.

He's up there to begin with. But he needs more roles to show different sides of his character. The acting was perfect, and there is certainly no one who could have done it better, or in a better style, or with a better mood. The actress Halle Berry does not deserve one either, even though she also played her role like she was, well, Mrs Musgrove herself. I disagree with people who say that she is too good looking. For real life comparison first there is an awful lot of good looking women on this planet, and second, beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway. I am not a particular fan of Halle Berry's looks, but I really liked what she did with that role. Both actors, however, did what I would expect from someone growing up in the American south they acted normal. The true achievement to me lies in putting this together, in combining these people, and in coming up with the script and their lines.That is the thing the closeness of the characters and the script to normal American life. It shows how poor people, black people, old people, smokers with lung disease, mums without cars, overweight kids, and people in small communities don't live lives with double floors. Not in the slightest way. I think this movie is for people who live without double floors, who know it's just for once, and it's for real - and how that knowledge allows them to quickly reconsider. They decide differently from the double buffered lives lived in other worlds. It's a great contemporary movie, that is certainly much closer to being a documentary than one would think.

They are just not advertised as such so everyone can read modern person, and the industrial hallmarks of modernness are not abundant, but I am sure the true modernness, the reason why this movie had to wait until the year 2001 to be made in this atmospheric depth, lies in its modernness.The actor Billy Bob Thornton may not even need an award. He's up there to begin with. But he needs more roles to show different sides of his character. The acting was perfect, and there is certainly no one who could have done it better, or in a better style, or with a better mood. The actress Halle Berry does not deserve one either, even though she also played her role like she was, well, Mrs Musgrove herself. I disagree with people who say that she is too good looking. For real life comparison first there is an awful lot of good looking women on this planet, and second, beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway. I am not a particular fan of Halle Berry's looks, but I really liked what she did with that role. Both actors, however, did what I would expect from someone growing up in the American south they acted normal. The true achievement to me lies in putting this together, in combining these people, and in coming up with the script and their lines.That is the thing the closeness of the characters and the script to normal American life. It shows how poor people, black people, old people, smokers with lung disease, mums without cars, overweight kids, and people in small communities don't live lives with double floors. Not in the slightest way. I think this movie is for people who live without double floors, who know it's just for once, and it's for real - and how that knowledge allows them to quickly reconsider. They decide differently from the double buffered lives lived in other worlds. It's a great contemporary movie, that is certainly much closer to being a documentary than one would think. These days, everyone's double floors are shrinking, constantly. So even though the characters and the story are fictional, they could be real. Increasingly real. They just could. And that is also quite surprising once you think about it.

Apart from the future image of human devolution this is hardly thesame film. The beginning attempts(and mostly succeeds) to capture theatmosphere of the original but ultimately loses it's way. The Time Machine itself  is quite an amazingly constructed brass and glass creation but it'sincomprehensible design is nowhere near as memorable as the Pal version.Considering the theme this movie has all the trademarks of something that ran  out of time. The effects are visually interesting and the results of Stan Winston's  Creature Shop are as usual excellent. The characters have little time to develop  though before we are rushed back and forth into the future. Along the wayscenery changes, the Moon falls apart (probably the most interesting visualeffect of the future) and just when the story starts to build momentum it just  well, ends. Of course the benefit of the short running time is that it doesn't outstay it's  welcome. However, like movie popcorn when it's over it does leave you feeling  empty, unsatisfied and in search of something a bit more fulfilling.Acting is competent but apart from Guy Pearce nobody else has enough screentime to make any significant contribution. Samantha Mumba breaks the curse of  teen pop star to actor transitions by actually being watchable and her kidbrother is okay too. Orlando Jones (Evolution) is an entertaining if totallyunrealistic diversion who thankfully isn't as annoying as Chris tucker in the Fifth  Element. Watching Jeremy Irons you could be thinking it's David Bowie from Labyrinthand you'll be wondering why he bothered to appear in such a ridiculous role as  well. Maybe the script writers had been watching Beneath the Planet of theApes that night and (for lack of any other dramatic conclusion) thought hewould be a good thing to stick in near the end. ***SPOILERS AHEAD******SPOILERS AHEAD***When the movie finishes before you expect you'll be left with a myriad ofnon-paradox related questions.Why did the producers at the test screenings fail to notice the entire audience  unintentionally laughing at the supposedly sad scene near the beginning? If Future Guy Pearce is at the hospital near the beginning why doesn't Present  Guy Pearce notice a huge gleaming brass Time Machine that he hasn't bult yetin his greenhouse? If the Moon has broken up wouldn't the larger fragments be orbiting the Earth  and not what remains of the Moon? It does look good though! Exactly why do they pull the boats up? How does the hologram device still operate 800,000+ years into the futuredespite the earth completely and utterly changing? What are the Morlocks doing with the flames, tools and huge machineryunderground?

G. Wells' 19th Century novel of the same name).  The previous 1960 George Pal version could not overcome them and neither can this current update, written by John Logan and directed by Gore Verbinski and Simon Wells. Credit the filmmakers for resisting the modern temptation to transpose Wells' original tale to a contemporary setting.  The story still begins in the 1800's, with scientist Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce replacing Rod Taylor in the role) creating a machine with the capability of transporting him back and forth in time.  Unlike in the original film version, however, Hartdegen is not motivated by sheer scientific inquisitiveness alone.  The writer has provided him with an added personal inspiration for his endeavors in the form of a beautiful young fiancé who is tragically murdered at the moment of their engagement.  Hartdegen's overwhelming desire to find a way to return to the past as a way of rewriting the future provides the necessary motivation to get the story rolling.  The structural problem alluded to in the opening paragraph boils down to the simple fact that `The Time Machine' is, by its very nature, a tale in which the first and second acts will always far outshine the third (although, regrettably, the third act always ends up taking the bulk of any adaptation's running time).  The story is at its most intriguing and compelling in the setting up stage and in the scenes depicting the actual time traveling experience (this was the case in the first version and it is the case here as well).  We watch in awe as Hartdegen races across the millennia, seeing life from a strangely sped-up perspective (the special effects here are very impressive).  We also enjoy the little side forays he takes into the early 21st Century, where he visits a modernized New York City of 2030 and, a few years down the road, a world threatened by a disintegrating moon.  Less compelling is Hartdegen's eventual destination, the world 800,000 years in the future.  Those familiar with the earlier version will know all about the earth he ends up encountering, one in which the peace-loving, land dwelling Elois have become fodder for the cannibalistic, subterranean Morlocks, a grim product of evolutionary (or should we say, devolutionary) development.  Just parenthetically, one is struck here by just how heavily Pierre Boulle `borrowed' from Wells when constructing his plot for `Planet of the Apes.'  Given the obvious limitations of this rather hopeless final act, the makers of this version haven't done a bad job bringing it to the screen, since there really isn't much one can do with it but to turn the whole thing into an extended chase scene anyway.  The odd passivity of the Elois in acquiescing to their decreed nutritional fate was, however, captured to greater effectiveness in the 1960 version.  One felt caught off balance by the sight of all those people resigning themselves to the inevitable while affording no sympathy for the `loved ones' who were the Morlock's victims.  As partial compensation for missing this intriguing aspect, the new film does make the Morlocks appear rather more threatening than they did in the Pal version.  However, Jeremy Irons, as the representative of the `intelligentsia' branch of the Morlock race comes in way too late in the story to register effectively, and the climax of the film is both confusing and inexplicable to put it politely.  (There is, however, a nice coda at the very end, merging both time periods into a shared spatial dimension).  The least believable aspect of this current edition is the fact that the few Elois who still speak English 800,000 years in the future &#150; an absurd notion in its own right &#150; could give Professor Henry Higgins a run for his money in the elocution department.  We should all possess their pitch-perfect pronunciation, command of diction and level of vocabulary.Guy Pearce isn't given much opportunity to act in this role and I must say that, in his beardless state at least, his gaunt countenance is almost frightening to gaze upon at times.  I don't know what might have happened to him in the year or so since he appeared in `Memento,' but someone needs to buy that poor boy a substantial meal from time to time.  In some of the early scenes in the film, in particular, he looks positively freakish.  I kept looking for signs of deliberate tampering by the makeup artists and wondered how some future alteration in his appearance might play a significant role in the narrative's development.  It never happened, which leads me to wonder if Pearce might not himself be morphing into a Morlock.Special mention must me made of the superb art direction that adorns the film.  The sets depicting 19th Century New York City are particularly impressive.Overall, `The Time Machine' does a better job revisiting its source material than Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' did last year.

Akasha promises Lestat to rule the world, and they always land in California. Long live Hollywood! The Vatican of California. Anyway, same thing here, the world goes through a heck of a lot, and even when two separate species develop from the humans, the little that remain alive manage to crowd themselves where New York used to be. It all takes place in NY. Long live ethnocentric America! You are the world! But the badness doesn't end there. Look at the moon in the park where the professor meets his future fiancee. White stuff is raining around it! If you miss it the first time, you'll get a chance to see it again when the professor returns to the park. Some poor fellas in post-production didn't notice that they did a half-ass job with the CG, twicde! Or, you could say that it's a visual hint to what is going to happen to the moon in the future. Anyway, the badness still goes on. But here start the SPOILERS The underground cerebral mutant explains to the professor that the new species can't live above the ground. Yet, the hunt scene happens in broad daylight. What the heck!? And the little kid says the professor's watch was stolen while they were sleeping in their safe little huts on the side of a cliff. Why wait for daylight the next day to hunt those humans if it's just as easy to sneak in their little house they think are safe? Why live on a cliff side if your predator can sneak in at night anyway? And what is up with this mind controlling freak who ends up fighting the professor in a hand-combat where he proves to be stronger although he casted himself into a developed brain, and not a bunch of biceps? Why didn't he create an illusion for the professor to jump out of the time machine and rot? And this whole assumption on the professor's part that based on two failures he could try a thousand times to see his love die in a thousand different ways! This attitude simply reflects the writer's. Whoever wrote this decided that no matter how many times their character went into the past, they would end up with the same thing, so they stuck to the dumbest storyline possible--which exceeded their expectations.

I feel that its reputation comes from the darkness of the film and also from the fact that McDonald's marketed it to youngsters by throwing Batman Returns toys into their Happy Meals.  This is not a child's movie, nor is it the first film.Batman was a triumph in its own right, but I find this second film to be superior.  The characters are interesting, the scenery is spectacular (Michelle Pfeiffer included), and the script is actually very well done. Every time I watch this film I pick up more subtleties.  One of my favorites is when Penguin visits his parents grave and says, I was their number one son, but they treated me like number two.  This line has a great double-meaning.  Penguin being treated like a number two son, not quite as well loved or cherished, but also Penguin being treated like number two, as in bodily function, in the less vulgar vernacular, crap.  There are many lines just like this one laced throughout the film.  It is true, the screenplay does have a few holes in it, especially towards the end of the film, but it turns out to be very enjoyable.  There is great character development to be found with Bruce Wayne maturing and Selina Kyle having to deal with her newfound duality.  The relationship between Selina and Bruce is the most interesting of any of the films.  While the Penguin and bad guy Max Shreck are static characters, they really do contribute to the feel and plot of the film.  Heck, Penguin drives the main plot, or is it Shreck that drives it?  You decide.The Batman series would go downhill from this point.  Batman Forever is actually pretty good, although Schumacher's vision is a little to bright for my tastes.  Batman & Robin is one of the worst films I've EVER seen. It's no wonder that we haven't seen a Batman film since its release. Batman Returns and the first film really make Batman and Gotham City seem real. Tim Burton should be commended for his vision on these films, especially Batman Returns, the crown jewel of the series.

I had no clue who Jim Garrison was. I watched it, and just about everything Jim Garrison, and the other people said was documented. It was only then that I found out that 'JFK' was based in part on Jim Garrison's investigation. Oliver Stone did his homework on this one! He did stick pretty much to what Garrison found out. He also worked with some of the researchers in the Kennedy assassination, like Robert Groden, and Dr. Ceryl Wect. Stone said that the film serves a public service in the way that it brings all of the substantial criticism in one place. If you just take this as a movie, the acting, casting, and the directing is top notch! It is a star studded affair. there is even a cameo by Garrison himself, as Earl Warren! How's that for casting! On the other hand, if you watch this for the message, and still say this is all fiction, do yourself a favor.
