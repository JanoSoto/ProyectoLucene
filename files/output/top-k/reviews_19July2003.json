Some might argue for Thirteen Days, which was a good attempt but it just lacked something that his movies from the 80s and early 90s achieved. Dances with Wolves is an excellent film which is all the more impressive since it was Costner's directorial debut. Costner's acting isn't outstanding but it didn't have to be. Graham Greene, Mary McDonnell and Rodney A. Grant are the real stars here and Costner just coasts along and thankfully doesn't ruin the film with his monotone acting style. Great use of scenery and some of the most beautiful cinematography ever. I commend Costner for not cutting the movie and making it shorter because the 3+ hour length is necessary to adequately show the changes of the characters. I just watched the director's cut, which is actually 4 hours long, and I still didn't mind the length because this is such a great story of how we should not always judge a book by its cover.

Turns out that's because I'd somehow merged together that film and TO LIVE together in my poor muddled brain. Both have some similarities, beyond the common appearance of Gong Li in front and Zhang Yimou behind the camera, but TO LIVE definitely confronts the political (I should really say social) aspects of the decades they cover much more directly and forcefully.TO LIVE (aka LIFETIMES - I dunno what the Chinese name is) basically covers 3 or 4 decades of one family's life in China, in a period that saw not one but two revolutions, and looks at the effect the social upheaval had on ordinary people's lives. The film rarely criticises the political movements instigated by Mao Tse Tung, but does an effective job of showing the hellishness of a society that has been turned on its head, where the people are forced to change not just the way they live but the way they think, and people are forced into social relationships that are new, and quite possibly against human nature.I hope I won't jeapordise my visa if I admit that I had strong leanings towards Communism when I was younger, having read Marx in philosophy classes. His picture of a society without private possessions or social hierarchy did seem very appealing, but Marx acknowledged that the only way for such a society to work was if every member saw the value of it and willingly took part in it, and admitted that the only way that was likely to happen was via massive revolution - i.e. killing everyone that didn't agree with the plan. As a teenager, that didn't seem like such a big price or problemCertainly I'm not the only person to have considered this price worth paying, and a couple of people have actually put the plan into practice - lamentably with less than stellar results. Mao Tse Tung is, I guess, the undisputed king of Communist revolution, having led TWO of them in China, and probably disrupting more peoples' lives than anybody else in history in the process. TO LIVE gives those of us that haven't had to live through such conditions some idea of what it might have been like. People used to the cushy capitalist western lifestyle might wonder just how on earth people can live through conditions like that, but that's the what the film wants to say... life might deal you some crappy hands, but people are remarkably adaptable and resilient, and you've just got to try to live the best you can. It sounds remarkably trite put like that, but the film does a good job of expressing it.The film is based on a novel, with the author co-writing the screenplay as well. Zhang Yimou directs brilliantly as usual, which in this case is to recognise the strength of the story and characters and to back off a little, giving them space to live their lives. Although the film looks great throughout, the cinematography is quite unobtrusive. He once more elicits a great performance from Gong Li and the rest of the cast, with leading man Ge You giving the best one of all. The film has occasionally been criticised for throwing piling too much tragedy on, but this is never done in an exploitative\/manipulative way, and Zhang Yimou avoids turning to melodrama to evoke an audience reaction... which makes him all the more likely to get one (and without the audience feeling used afterwards).In a career full of magnificent films, TO LIVE stands as one of Zhang Yimou's finest moments. The film is epic yet remarkably simple, and the execution is as near to flawless as I've seen. I doubt that even Akira Kurosawa could have handled the material better, which is to say that Zhang Yimou surely ranks in the world's top echelon of film-makers.

The film rarely criticises the political movements instigated by Mao Tse Tung, but does an effective job of showing the hellishness of a society that has been turned on its head, where the people are forced to change not just the way they live but the way they think, and people are forced into social relationships that are new, and quite possibly against human nature.I hope I won't jeapordise my visa if I admit that I had strong leanings towards Communism when I was younger, having read Marx in philosophy classes. His picture of a society without private possessions or social hierarchy did seem very appealing, but Marx acknowledged that the only way for such a society to work was if every member saw the value of it and willingly took part in it, and admitted that the only way that was likely to happen was via massive revolution - i.e. killing everyone that didn't agree with the plan. As a teenager, that didn't seem like such a big price or problemCertainly I'm not the only person to have considered this price worth paying, and a couple of people have actually put the plan into practice - lamentably with less than stellar results. Mao Tse Tung is, I guess, the undisputed king of Communist revolution, having led TWO of them in China, and probably disrupting more peoples' lives than anybody else in history in the process. TO LIVE gives those of us that haven't had to live through such conditions some idea of what it might have been like. People used to the cushy capitalist western lifestyle might wonder just how on earth people can live through conditions like that, but that's the what the film wants to say... life might deal you some crappy hands, but people are remarkably adaptable and resilient, and you've just got to try to live the best you can. It sounds remarkably trite put like that, but the film does a good job of expressing it.The film is based on a novel, with the author co-writing the screenplay as well. Zhang Yimou directs brilliantly as usual, which in this case is to recognise the strength of the story and characters and to back off a little, giving them space to live their lives. Although the film looks great throughout, the cinematography is quite unobtrusive. He once more elicits a great performance from Gong Li and the rest of the cast, with leading man Ge You giving the best one of all. The film has occasionally been criticised for throwing piling too much tragedy on, but this is never done in an exploitative\/manipulative way, and Zhang Yimou avoids turning to melodrama to evoke an audience reaction... which makes him all the more likely to get one (and without the audience feeling used afterwards).In a career full of magnificent films, TO LIVE stands as one of Zhang Yimou's finest moments. The film is epic yet remarkably simple, and the execution is as near to flawless as I've seen. I doubt that even Akira Kurosawa could have handled the material better, which is to say that Zhang Yimou surely ranks in the world's top echelon of film-makers. Long may his life and career continueHighest recommendation!

First off, when I say that this is Shyamalan's most underrated film to date, I have to admit that I'm a big fan of his writing and directing, so I'm not out to bag on any of his other films.  I think that he has managed to breathe life into a genre of film (the paranormal thriller) that has long been shunned by most Hollywood studios.Contrary to some criticism, I think the acting in this film is superb. Willis does an exceptional job playing the part of the average Joe, working stiff who does not fully comprehend the implications of the situation he has been placed in.  The weight lifting scene is a perfect example of this.  Here he is attempting to confirm what he is slowly beginning to believe.  And for the people out there who criticise the fact that Willis can not remember the last time he was sick or injured, I myself can not remember those things, but I don't think that makes me a superhero. Quite the contrary, I would say that most people probably couldn't count the number of times they have been sick in the past year, unless they have a chronic ailment.**SPOILER**I also noticed the Dead Zone rip-off comment, concerning the fact the David could read people simply by brushing up against them at the end of the movie but there was no mention of it before that point.  Contrary to this statement, if you watch the movie again, you will notice that David brushes by the man with the pistol at the football game and then Shyamalan also bumps into him at the football game before he has his visions.  This clearly sets up the manner by which David arrives at his conclusions.**END SPOILER**All in all, I'd say this movie does not get the respect it deserves.  In this day of movies like X-Men and the Hulk, superheroes who are quite obviously different, maybe it is just too hard for some to imagine that an ordinary man can be blessed with extraordinary powers, of which he does not realize.  For those that didn't like it the first time around, rent Unbreakable and give it another chance before you pass final judgement.

This movie is actually enjoyable whether or not you like TMNT at all. I don't think I could sit thru Secret of the Ooze again even though it was my favorite as a kid. I always watch this whenever it comes on TV, its that good. Its a shame that this film, the best of the three, came out when the fad was dead causing everybody to dislike it, unfairly so. I would also like to say that being I was 11 when Pokemon hit it big, I as a big fan of the game, the show, and the cards, but I hated that they never made a live action movie. With TMNT, a cartoon show and a video game became an actual movie, with actors and stunts and everything. Pokemon wouldve been an even bigger success if they had, instead of pasting three episodes together and calling it a movie, had invested the time and money to make a live action film with actors, just so that it would be something worth remembering. I havent seen a single Pokemon movie, never will. I give a lot of credit to the makers of the TMNT movies for having the guts to take the trouble of taking a cartoon show and making a real movie, with puppets and actors. It just shows to just that only ten years ago the film industry was that much more daring. Rock on, American film makers. Forget that Pokemon joke. Anime is the worst stuff ever.

Chuck shows charisma for the first time in his career. There aren't a lot of fight scenes in this action\/thriller, but the ones that are there are good. The one-on-one fights between Norris and Libby are very realistic, but the biker bar fight was strictly by-the-numbers action-fu stuff. Not that it was a bad scene, because it wasn't. But they probably could have cut it and made the pace of the film smoother. While we're at it, they could have made significant cuts to the romantic subplot. The musical interlude during Chuck and Toni Kalem's boinking is laugh-inducing. The fat comic relief, Stephen Furst, is the movie's weakest part. In horror movies, typically, the comic relief is an annoying a-hole the audience is begging to see offed. The opposite is true in action flicks; the comic relief is loved by the audience and often times is the movie's saving grace.This movie had a problem trying to decide if it wanted to be an action or a horror movie; Furst's character is the proof of that. He's never funny, consistently annoying, and yet we're expected to give a rat's ass when he bites it. All this aside, though, I really did like the movie. It's kind of a slasher flick meets a Norris kung-fu vehicle. The highlight is the final battle between Chuckie and the killer (played by Brian Libby, who is nobody now and was nobody then but he does deserve credit for being good in this).
