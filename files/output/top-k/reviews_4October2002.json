I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!As a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal\/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.The movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.One small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time.  They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.Overall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game.  Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.  It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.

Otherwise, it's superb on so many levels, and the ending (even though I knew what was coming) was a happy surprise.Every single performance is good, with most of them actually great.  The script is faultless, as is the plot, the pacing, and the directing.  Even though it's a less-flashy style than in 99% or the movies these days, it's wonderful to be able to appreciate really good camerawork, clear dialogue, perfect editing..I don't want to go into great detail, because the movie is such a pleasure to watch.  I just hope this may convince you to see Dinner Rush, because it's quite possibly the best film of the year.  I am now going to pester friends & colleagues to rent it, until I can actually buy it and then force them to watch.

The main cast Al Pacino is as good as ever, and Robin Williams is doing surprisingly well as a villain. However, I don't understand how could the casting directors think that Hilary Swank was a match for the two Hollywood stars. To put things straight, she is not a bad actress, but she is also not good enough to play alongside Pacino and Williams. The script it's a book. That's the feeling you get. It's not predictable, but you get the feeling of where things are going. You have some dialog and then you have some scenery, and you just know how it could have been described in a novel. The story is very realistic, except for some minor flaws (SPOILER a detective wouldn't have called to L.A. to tell the wife of his partner about his death. Local police officers would have personally delivered the news.) Camera work fantastic. Incredible scenery is wisely used to give the viewer the atmosphere of what the place is like. Directing the whole concept of insomnia is missed somehow. We know Dormer can't sleep, but besides being reminded of it from time to time by his colleagues, we see no effect of it on Dormer himself, except for the last few minutes of the film. We don't see Dormer drink coffee every half an hour to stay awake, we don't see him use eye-drops, even though his eyes are perfectly clear with no signs of red. He sees some back-flashes from time to time, but that's not enough to give us a feeling of a man in a constant need for sleep, which he can not get. The score nothing original, the score is similar to music you have heard in tens of thrillers before. Conclusion this film probably deserves an 8, but I am a huge fan of Al Pacino. -) 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2002","score":"","review":"  You do not often have a feeling that you have just finished reading a fine book, but that's exactly the feeling this movie gives you.
