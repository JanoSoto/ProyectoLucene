The movie portrays two ditzy high school friends named Betsy (Kirsten Dunst) and Arlene (Michelle Williams), who work as  official White House dog walkers.  After a series of hilarious and coincidental events that occur throughout their employment, the girls discover that their president isn't the good-natured man that they think he is.  Betsy and Arlene  become the infamous Deep Throat information source, during a prank phone call to the Washington Post, in which they unknowingly reveal information about the suspicious events occurring at the White House.  These two actresses have a wonderful comedic chemistry between each other, and they are both able to play their characters very well with superb improvisations throughout their roles.  The critic's did not give Dick enough credit for the clever and unique screenplay.  The thorough details that are written into the script aren't often observed in recent movies, and certainly don't occur often in comedies.  If you've ever been curious about the Watergate scandal, or you're just in the mood for a good comedy, see Dick, it's a hilarious and witty movie.
