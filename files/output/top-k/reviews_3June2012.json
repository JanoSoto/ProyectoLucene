Yes I know it came out 13 years ago, and no I do not know why I never saw it previously. Thankfully, I caught this streaming on Netflix and felt inspired to write-up a review.Ghost Dog (Whitaker) is a hit man in New Jersey. He conducts hits for the for his mafia boss, in a freelance capacity. Ghost Dog is portrayed as a competent professional in these opening scenes. The shots, sort of called to mind the opening of the Michael Mann film Thief. Well that is if you added an amazing hip-hop sound track by RZA from Wu-Tang Clan.This is a highly stylized film from writer\/director Jarmusch. The samurai gun play alone will have you on the edge of your seat. While the pacing of the film is a bit slow, there are scenes of quick intense action, sprinkled throughout. In addition, just below the surface, there is a strong undercurrent of dark, dark humor in this character driven tale. Jarmusch also jams this film to the brim with philosophy, thoughts on the clashing of cultures, the role of honor in society, and many other things, that I am sure I missed on the first viewing.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is Ghost Dog's embracing of Hagakure The Way of the Samurai, in his daily life and in his work. As Ghost Dog reads and quotes from the code, the viewer learns about both the code and its applications to modern-day living. The concept of men living by an ancient code, despite the modern world rushing around them, filled with unhonorable individuals, is fascinating to watch. In this way its easy to compare this film to some classic westerns.Forrest Whitaker gives a very impressive performance as Ghost Dog. He manages to play an Anti-hero, that you can't resist rooting for, despite his violent and illegal occupation. He accomplishes this with a subdued and subtle performance, as he interprets and practices the Hagakure. Whitaker is an example of perfect casting, and really nailed this role as a giant, hip-hop listening, pigeon loving, samurai code living, hit man warrior.If you are a fan of movies, filled with a cast of quirky and unique characters, then you should watch this film. If you enjoy films with a philosophical message, that at the same time present the world, as a dark comedy, then you should watch this film. If you like classic westerns, samurai, or gangster movies you should watch this film. If you are a fan of arty independent films then you should watch this film.As you can probably tell from my suggestions above, of people who would enjoy watching Ghost Dog Way of the Samurai, I really enjoyed this movie. It certainly left me with the film spinning around in my dome, and wanting to discuss the picture after watching it. I realize, I probably missed about half of what was going on in this film, and will certainly need to re watch it to catch things I may have missed. For instance what is going on with all the mafia guys watching cartoons? You could probably write-up a whole post on that subject alone.

The body count is respectable, but we never *see* weapons come into contact with flesh that often, and when we do, it's a minor matter. Hooper and company lay on the thick and sweltering atmosphere in a movie that perfectly captures the utter desolation of its Texas locations. They firmly cemented the chain saw as an iconic weapon in the genre, and did the same for the memorable Leatherface character, played with true physical presence by Gunnar Hansen, who also gives him a human element by making him both childish and not terribly bright.After a slow and steady build up, the tension is cranked up more and more until the movie starts hammering away at its audience in the same way that its Final Girl, Sally (excellent screamer Marilyn Burns) is terrorized. It gives all of us a palpable you are there feeling; its immediacy is such that it's impossible to completely distance ourselves from the madness taking place on screen. It places its worst horrors right in our brains; we can *feel* a hook penetrate a body even though it's not explicitly shown. Beginning with ominous narration by a then unknown John Larroquette, it soon gives us a taste of what's to come with the use of some macabre imagery. The soundtrack merely adds to the authentic feel without ever distracting from it. The acting from all concerned is effective, although many fans often hold up Paul A. Partain's paraplegic character of Franklin as a prime example of an annoying personage in the genre. Kudos really goes to the four actors playing the murderous family Hansen is great, as is the lovable Jim Siedow as the schizophrenic Cook, John Dugan as the decrepit grandfather, and the hilarious Edwin Neal as the Hitchhiker, who adds much of the humour to the production. I think we just picked up Dracula, quips Franklin when he and his companions give the Hitchhiker a ride. Deserving of much praise is the art direction of Robert A. Burns, who gives the home of the cannibals some of the best macabre decorations ever to be seen in the genre. Best of all is the incredibly intense climactic dinner scene, which is kind of an assault on the senses. The movie has been much imitated over the years, but never equalled.Followed 12 years later by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2; Lou Perryman, who played L.G. in that film, was the assistant cameraman here. Three other sequels would come after that, as well as the subsequent remake and its own prequel. None of them, though, have the impact of this initial effort.10 out of 10.

The body count is respectable, but we never *see* weapons come into contact with flesh that often, and when we do, it's a minor matter. Hooper and company lay on the thick and sweltering atmosphere in a movie that perfectly captures the utter desolation of its Texas locations. They firmly cemented the chain saw as an iconic weapon in the genre, and did the same for the memorable Leatherface character, played with true physical presence by Gunnar Hansen, who also gives him a human element by making him both childish and not terribly bright.After a slow and steady build up, the tension is cranked up more and more until the movie starts hammering away at its audience in the same way that its Final Girl, Sally (excellent screamer Marilyn Burns) is terrorized. It gives all of us a palpable you are there feeling; its immediacy is such that it's impossible to completely distance ourselves from the madness taking place on screen. It places its worst horrors right in our brains; we can *feel* a hook penetrate a body even though it's not explicitly shown. Beginning with ominous narration by a then unknown John Larroquette, it soon gives us a taste of what's to come with the use of some macabre imagery. The soundtrack merely adds to the authentic feel without ever distracting from it. The acting from all concerned is effective, although many fans often hold up Paul A. Partain's paraplegic character of Franklin as a prime example of an annoying personage in the genre.

Rollerball is the only sport left in this futuristic society. It's gladiatorial combat with players on roller skates and motorcycles wearing crash helmets and spiked gloves. The teams are run by corporations, who also happen to control the world. Or at least they control what is left of the world after nation states were dissolved and the corporate wars ended. Is the world a utopian society where everyone's needs are met,or is it a dystopian nightmare where corporations destroy free thought and action while sucking the soul out of its denizens?At first it seems like Jonathan has it all. He's the greatest player in the only sport in the world, and on a defending championship team. The Houston corporation has him set up in a bucolic house, where he sits in the futuristic lap of luxury. He has a stable of hot women that the Houston Energy Corporation rotates every six months so he does not get bored. As a rare non-executive power player, he seems to be one of the few people sitting at the top of the success pyramid in this corporate society.However, Jonathan soon begins to question his place in society and society in general after he is suddenly asked to retire by Bartholomew, the executive running Houston Energy. In world where the corporate interests don't value individual achievement and success, it seems that Jonathan has become too big for the game and too popular. This request\/order also seems to reignite in Jonathan some anger he has buried, about an Executive stealing his wife from him when he was a younger player.With only a few games left before the championships, the corporate overlords start tinkering with the rules of the game. In a bizarre change of the rules, penalties will no longer be accessed and substitutions are limited. The more Jonathan questions what the executives and their sycophants are doing, the more they attempt to force his retirement by any means necessary. Will Jonathan quit the game he loves and retire to his blissful corporate provided horse ranch, or will he stand by his teammates in the quest for another championship?Rollerball, follows in the footsteps of the Kubrick films 2001 A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. While it pays homage too and is similar to those films, it gets tripped up along the way. The rollerball action scenes in the film are spectacular and fun to watch. It's pretty much a sci-fi gladiatorial combat film. The films failings mostly lie in the message the film is trying to put forward with regards to society run amok, with no free will and a lack of morality. Although a few scenes about this aspect of the film work, a lot of screen time is spent listening to Cann mumble, reflect upon his past, and fly around the globe trying to get to the bottom of things.Jewison, speaks about not wanting the film to be too violent, because he did not want it to distract from the larger message of the film. However, the best parts of the film are when the mayhem starts in the rollerball oval. If the film had focused a bit more on the rollerball action, and retooled the message about society, so it wasn't so rambling and disjointed, this would have been a stronger film. Rollerball seems to suffer from a bit of editing problems, as in, they took out too much action and force fed too much introspective drama.Rollerball is a good film, but not a great film, it has some obvious flaws. It is certainly worth checking out even if just for the rollerball action scenes. While the larger message of the film gets a bit lost with some heavy-handed screen writing and direction, the theme does resonate today. In an era where some politicians and parts of the government have deemed that corporations are people, the film may appear prophetic.

After two months I've seen every Kubrick film in order, from Fear and Desire to Eyes Wide Shut. And while I was a bit nervous about how then- 70 year old Kubrick would handle the topic of sex with Hollywood stars after a decade off from directing, I have to applaud this absolutely wonderful surprise of film, horribly underrated on this site, the IMDb.Eyes Wide Shut channels much of Kubrick's previous work, such as A Clockwork Orange and 2001 while crafting its own unique identity. If you've ever wondered how directors from previous eras would fair in this generation, look no further this film shows evolution. It's impossible to believe that this was made by the same man who made The Killing. But don't believe that this film is great because of its director or his past work the score reflects my opinion of the film on its own.Summarizing Eyes Wide Shut is difficult the plot consists of a couple fighting and he walks into a series of events causing an awakening. Is it romantic? Nope. Thriller, or a mystery? Yep, and a bit scary in places too. But for the the entire 2.5+ hour runtime its engaging, and constantly interesting. You'll wonder what happens next and how it all plays out, and there's a sense of wonder throughout movie magic. I wonder if Kubrick knew this was going to be his last film, because he references so much of his previous work, something I haven't noticed him to do much. Notably from Clockwork and Lolita is the content. From 2001 there is a sense of realization. Such as learning about the moment we evolved into what we are today, Eyes Wide Shut ironically opens our eyes to aspects of life we tend to pass over. A revolution.And from Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket, Eyes Wide Shut draws beauty. This film is beautiful to see, with extravagant upper class parties and a living city. I was shocked to learn this was all filmed in England.From this film I appreciate Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman more as actors.

As far as movies are concerned there aren't many films that I can say explain the sociological significance of Generation X, which only, to me, proves that Easy Rider is an ambitious 60\u2032s generation landmark film statement.I will only translate a brief film synopsis so as not to belittle the enormous significance of this film. Easy Rideris a film about two hippies( Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) traveling cross-country on their Choppers with the intention of discovering the American Dream. Little do these two hippie bike riders realize that the American Dream is heavily tainted by the unfortunate realization that bigotry and ignorance are inescapable even within their own homeland.Keep an eye-out for a young Jack Nicholson who plays an amazing role as George Hanson, a free-wheeling, southern politicians' son who is immune to the small-town politics that serve as his safety blanket.Do not miss this epic film that is designed by a mind expanding soundtrack including Roger McGuinn and an eye-opening cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs and Baird Bryan.

He runs with the other rich kids who don't have a very high opinion of those less fortunate, and when Blane starts up a mild romance with Andie, they give him grief, and eventually he un-invites Andie to the prom. But dad, even without a job, brings home a busy pink dress that he thinks Andie can do something with, she has a knack for design. So with the help of her imagination and her Singer sewing machine creates a very pretty dress, and goes to prom alone. As it turns out Blane is there alone also, they realize that they really do love each other, and if the movie had gone on for another 40 or 50 years they probably would have lived happily ever after.A very good 1980s teen movie.

It's an indicator of how fiercely the issue was beginning to burn, that even cautiously commercial Hollywood was in on the act, making a high-class production of Gentleman's Agreement.But unlike most of the movies on racism that were to follow in later years, Gentleman's Agreement is not about persecution of black people, but about anti-Semitism. This is not to downplay anti-Semitism, but given the relative scale of the problem in the USA it does seem as if Hollywood is just taking baby steps in the field of race relations. Especially since the movie specifically defines Jewishness as a matter of faith, not ethnicity. What's more, Gentleman's Agreement only really attacks prejudice as it exists in upper-class society &#x96; being refused entry to a club or having people turn their noses up at a dinner party &#x96; a long way from the hatred and violence that makes up the thin end of bigotry's wedge.Given that it now seems such a weedy condemnation of prejudice, perhaps better to view it simply as a drama. After all, director Elia Kazan is ace at dramas. Kazan's style is marked by the confidence to keep his subjects further back within the shot. There's a bit where Celeste Holm calls Gregory Peck from within her office, and their conversation follows with no change of angle, no cut to a close-up of Holm. While there never are any actual close-ups, the layering within the frame can produce an intense feeling of closeness at times. When Peck and Dorothy McGuire have an argument after he is refused a room at the hotel, they move from being near a set of double doors at the back of the room, then they move to the foreground, and the sudden gulf between them and the doors in the background make it feel like they have suddenly stepped into our personal space.And then of course we have a cast of top dramatic actors. Sadly lead man Peck's performance is rather a corny one. Watching his deliberation as he comes to the decision to pose as Jewish is almost painful. He's only good when he's being stern and forceful, and it's later in the movie he starts to come into his own. The great performances in Gentleman's Agreement belong to its women. Dorothy McGuire is nicely understated, her voice near to a husky whisper as she delivers her most pertinent lines. Celeste Holm is excellent, for most of the movie a joyful and easygoing presence, so carefree and likable that her steely outburst towards the end seems all the more stark and powerful. Anne Revere, always a monument of dignity even in the grip of an angina attack, proving herself one of the most effortlessly natural actresses of her generation. In her smaller role, June Havoc is very good too.Unfortunately, if we're going to take Gentleman's Agreement as a drama, it starts to look a very flimsy movie indeed. The romantic angle is as bland as day-old kebab meat, and the dialogue is corny and dull. It's a shame then that this was the first movie condemning racial prejudice to receive major plaudits, not because the social evils it portrays weren't worth attacking, but that there were other movies doing it far better. In the same year Crossfire also looked at anti-Semitism in a much more dynamic story framework, and with deeper eloquence and insight, but it was a runner up to Gentleman's Agreement's Best Picture win. A few years later Pinky (also directed by Kazan) and No Way Out would address anti-black racism, but while Pinky would receive a fair bit of attention, the ahead-of-its-time No Way Out was practically relegated to B-movie status.

It's an indicator of how fiercely the issue was beginning to burn, that even cautiously commercial Hollywood was in on the act, making a high-class production of Gentleman's Agreement.But unlike most of the movies on racism that were to follow in later years, Gentleman's Agreement is not about persecution of black people, but about anti-Semitism. This is not to downplay anti-Semitism, but given the relative scale of the problem in the USA it does seem as if Hollywood is just taking baby steps in the field of race relations. Especially since the movie specifically defines Jewishness as a matter of faith, not ethnicity. What's more, Gentleman's Agreement only really attacks prejudice as it exists in upper-class society &#x96; being refused entry to a club or having people turn their noses up at a dinner party &#x96; a long way from the hatred and violence that makes up the thin end of bigotry's wedge.Given that it now seems such a weedy condemnation of prejudice, perhaps better to view it simply as a drama. After all, director Elia Kazan is ace at dramas. Kazan's style is marked by the confidence to keep his subjects further back within the shot. There's a bit where Celeste Holm calls Gregory Peck from within her office, and their conversation follows with no change of angle, no cut to a close-up of Holm. While there never are any actual close-ups, the layering within the frame can produce an intense feeling of closeness at times. When Peck and Dorothy McGuire have an argument after he is refused a room at the hotel, they move from being near a set of double doors at the back of the room, then they move to the foreground, and the sudden gulf between them and the doors in the background make it feel like they have suddenly stepped into our personal space.And then of course we have a cast of top dramatic actors. Sadly lead man Peck's performance is rather a corny one. Watching his deliberation as he comes to the decision to pose as Jewish is almost painful. He's only good when he's being stern and forceful, and it's later in the movie he starts to come into his own. The great performances in Gentleman's Agreement belong to its women. Dorothy McGuire is nicely understated, her voice near to a husky whisper as she delivers her most pertinent lines. Celeste Holm is excellent, for most of the movie a joyful and easygoing presence, so carefree and likable that her steely outburst towards the end seems all the more stark and powerful. Anne Revere, always a monument of dignity even in the grip of an angina attack, proving herself one of the most effortlessly natural actresses of her generation. In her smaller role, June Havoc is very good too.Unfortunately, if we're going to take Gentleman's Agreement as a drama, it starts to look a very flimsy movie indeed. The romantic angle is as bland as day-old kebab meat, and the dialogue is corny and dull. It's a shame then that this was the first movie condemning racial prejudice to receive major plaudits, not because the social evils it portrays weren't worth attacking, but that there were other movies doing it far better. In the same year Crossfire also looked at anti-Semitism in a much more dynamic story framework, and with deeper eloquence and insight, but it was a runner up to Gentleman's Agreement's Best Picture win. A few years later Pinky (also directed by Kazan) and No Way Out would address anti-black racism, but while Pinky would receive a fair bit of attention, the ahead-of-its-time No Way Out was practically relegated to B-movie status. It's in a way remarkable that these other pictures existed at all, but a pity they didn't get the credit they deserved.

While I think that this is an improvement over The Great Valley Adventure, it also lacks the heart of the original.The story about the value of friendship, teamwork, and sharing was a nice idea and I think that it has some very nice dialog with such hilarious quotes including Me go play bullies somewhere else and Me unscareable. The animation is beautiful with some lovely colors, but also has some flat backgrounds due to it's below average editing. The songs, although not great, are very pleasant to listen too. The strongest aspects is the wonderful music from Michael Travera and it's excellent voice acting.Scott McAfee did very decent as Littlefoot and his singing was pretty good. I also liked Linda Gary and Kenneth Mars as Littlefoot's grandparents. John Ingle's narration was clunky, but Cera's father's gruff characterization really amused me.Overall, while an improvement on the Great Valley Adventure, it doesn't have the heart of the original, but it's still worth watching.
