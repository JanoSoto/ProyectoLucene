Just finished watching Underworld (2003) the film is similar to Blade and they are just both films so very good. I always have enjoyed watching Blade. Wesley Snipes best role till it's days ever! No one can play Blade like Wesley Snipes did! Blade is not an origin story, but it is a real world of darkness. And Blade is just so bad and anti-hero which is perfect for the world he drives in. It is my favorite comic book Vampire movie. I love this film, I love the action and I love everything in it! I love Wesley Snipes and Kris Kris Kristofferson so much they have such a chemistry between each other. Wesley Snipes Kicks ass!!!!! This is the most super hero Vampire slayer film ever made!The best dang vampire slaying movie ever(say that fast five times)! Its funny too, it shows him killing a bunch of vampires but then regular people are thinking that he is killing humans! I watch this film as a child and all the blood in it and the violence made me crunch. I grew up with this film, 11.years ago kept constantly watching this film over and over, till it's days it is my favorite best Vampire flick. Blood and the crunch in this movie is AWESOME!! Just awesome! So In this movie Blade is a half human, half vampire, hybrid he protects the human race from other vampires and in this movie he has to stop Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). Deacon Frost wants to resurrect the blood god La Magra, And he needs Blade's blood and he needs 12 volunteers. So that he can walk in the sunlight and declares extinction to human race. Blade is humanity's last hope!Wesley Snipes plays a half-mortal, half-immortal charged with ridding the earth of a race of vampires led by Stephen Dorff in this action-packed blockbuster.This movie right here oh my god! is this movie AWESOME! Watching this as kid you really don't know much, other that Wesley Snipes is a Bad Ass!!!! But now when you are older you can really know how much of a bad ass Blade really was and he does making a point! Wesley Snipes is AWESOME! Yes awesome! It is been so long since I last watch this film. I kept watching it 11.year ago in 2004 when Blade Trinity was been released I kept watching Blade 1 and 2 on my CD on my computer and on VHS tape that I had this film. Blade of trilogy was the only film I owned on VHS I did not owned Blade II or Blade Trinity at that time, but I have now the whole trilogy on Blu-ray. So yea... Wesley Snipes does a good job in this movie, everyone does a great job in this movie, so far, even Donal Logue as Quinn with a long hair and beard hi did a wonderful job. Stephen Dorff is actually pretty good, I haven't really seen much of Stephen Dorff's work yet, I'm pretty sure he is not even around today, I am not sure what happened today, I'm not sure if he just drop off the map or if he just quit acting all together, but yea. You would never guess this was MARVEL movie because MARVEL's name was nowhere near this property so far. So that was kind a odd to see this choice but yea, we all knew who he is anyways, so that become kind a cool, and yea violence, blood, the gore amazingly AWESOME!!!!! Yea, I brought the word amazingly back. It is crazy, over the top, sword fights, knives throwing's, all this wrapped in the one and you get that final fight between him and Deacon, dang that is good time! That is good awesome times you know. And it is just nothing like that right now and I am hoping that we get another sequel to Blade Trinity. The actress Arly Jover who played Mercury, Deacon Frost's girlfriend was so sexy and hot and she is so awesome with her hair and changing her hair styles for 11.years I was confused with a thought that Deacon's girlfriend was played by Traci Lords because she is blonde. It took me so long to figure it that out, that it was Arly Jover played Deacon's girlfriend and not Tracy Lords. What I like about the character Blade are his gadjets, the sharp ones in particular and his outfit and style! Bottom of line It is my favorite best film still I think Blade II is a little better than Blade, but I still love the trilogy. Movies like this don't exist today. The rating I give to Blade is 10\/10 A- Blade is a 1998 American vampire superhero action horror film starring Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff, loosely based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.

Not only does it takes 4.years for this movie to come out since the last movie, but we see Wesley Snipes returns as a Blade and he Is awesome!! So in this movie Blade is on a search for a Whistler, who is now a vampire in this movie. He tracks him down, he finds him, than he meets up with this group of vampires called the Bloodpack. They need his help to track down Nomak (Luke Goss. and he has basically an ability to turn vampires in to Repears that can hunt both vampires and humans. So, yea...That's your basic plot.There are a lot of twist from here and now, but it is AWESOME! Because Wesley Snipes knows all those martial arts, they are nice to look at, and since it is 2002 we now got in to the phase, where the fights scenes are awesome and the choreographer says something once heavy handed, you will see bloody violence right away when the character turns in to an CGI model and it is shown trough whole movie, you can really see that, specially old dude drops kicks, kicks Blade right in the face and goes in to an CGI character, you can kind a see that, kind a weak, but does it track down from the movie? Hell to the no! This movie is awesome!!!!! The beginning of the movie, in the first 10 minutes, Blade already kills like 25 people. That's how it is done, just like in the first movie! He killed like 50 or 60 people from the very beginning of the movie it is AWESOME!!! Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) is a bad ass! He is amazing bad ass! Norman Reedus like I said before still looks 12.year old boy, he is still Daryl Dixon, he still has the same hair style, the same look stubborn on his face and he looks like damn, don't you age boy. And you voice is going now heavy now todays world, but don't you age. Ron Perlman is awesome, he loves to make you hate him, but you can't hate him because he is Ron Perlman, you just laugh at him, because he is such a bad ass and he is such a an awesome, he is so awesome! Where is Hellboy III. Even in Alien Resurrection (1997) Ron Perlman was standout in that film, come on, the man is just AMAZING! The effects in this movie is pretty good too, besides the fight scenes when they turn the CGI character however, but that's okay I can kind a forget about it because Spider-Man (2002) come out the same year, of course they also did do the same thing, yea, I guess you have to live, with that back than, I'm pretty sure they can do better now this days. Choreograph and everything, Guillermo del Toro takes over, this movie has director, David S. Goyer returns as the writer in this movie. David S. Goyer is a good writer, I have to give him that, he is an awesome writer! How do you make Blade even a more bad ass, than he already was? I think that was possible, it is possible. This movie it is possible and it is awesome! Wesley Snipes has that charm back again, he has that to be a bad ass, but it has that humor aside Blade II, like in the strip club or whatever they were at. Ron Perlman really was about to shoot Blade and Blade had him track down at his gun and he sit like smiling, Wesley Snipes your gold boy your Gold!!! Without the doubt, the acting in this movie is awesome, Effects are awesome, Action is awesome, story is awesome, Cinematography it is kinda even a bad ass, you actually feel bad for one of the characters, tough she was cute, I am just saying. In the end of the day Blade II is one of the best sequel ever, you have to watch this movie!!!!! This is way better than the first Blade is, Guillermo Del Toro is endlessly imaginative when it comes to creating new style, action, and ideas for the vampire mythology. Now the plot doesn't have much character development, but it has just enough interesting twists to keep you interested as well as entertained. And like I said, if you are looking for a movie with brains, this movie should meet your criteria, but if you appreciate brawn, this will blow you away.

It was missing, a lot of great suspense and chills that made the first, watchable. It further departs from its predecessor by incorporating more graphic violence and gore, making it way too similar to other slasher films at its time. In my opinion, it went, a little too far, and became, more of a parody of its former self. The reprise horror music featured here, was awfully different from the 1st, with a more synth-heavy arrangement. Even songs like Mr. Sandman, seem out of place. Not the best composed from Alan Howarth. However, it still makes a lot of sense, that a sequel to the first movie would indeed be, made. After all, the first movie was kinda successful, plus it end in a cliff-hanger. Directed by Rick Rosenthal, the film immediately picks up where the last film had left off. After having shot, the escaped killer Michael Myers (Dick Warlock) six times, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) believes he has saved high school student, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Only to find out, that the seemingly immortal mask-man, has escape, and follow Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to a nearby hospital. Can, Dr. Loomis stop Michael Myers, once and for all or will Laurie Strode, be the latest victim of the mask-killer? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I like that the movie is set on the same night of October 31, 1978. However, it's doesn't make, much lick of sense. First off, the town of Haddonfield, acts as if there isn't a series of murders, going on. Second off, the police are not, telling people to stay at their home, or to be careful. What the hell!? I really didn't like this idiot plot. Third off, the hospital in Haddonfield seem a little too empty for a murderous Halloween night. You would think, the employees wouldn't even have, time to have sex, when dead bodies are coming in and out, throughout the night. Also, when we see a kid admitted to the hospital with the razor blade. You would think, he would, play a bigger part of the film, since the movie spent so much time on him, but no, he doesn't. He rarely mention in the third act. Is he, supposed to represented, how sadism, Halloween has come? Probably not, but if written better. He could! Honestly, this movie has a lot of a filler that rarely moves the movie along, such as the Ben Tramer subplot. Honestly, why is Ben wearing the mask? It wasn't that popular! Another is how the film, focus so much, time on the hospital employees. I really don't get, why the film does this, if they're not really, part of the main plot? You would think, this sequel written by John Carpenter, would be a lot better, but no, there is still a bit of misogyny and misandry sexual psychology terms in these types of films. The female\/male nurses are played as unlikeable whores & sex hounds. Another thing, while it's highly known and accepted, now. The revelation that Laurie was Michael's sister felt a bit misguided. Some felt that the reveal took away the menacing mystery that made Michael such an effective villain, as it gave a reason for him to stalk Laurie, instead of leaving it as an unknown motive. Others felt that Michael's obsession with killing his family members gives him, a good reason to continue to kill. This is rather divided twist to this day, but for the most part, people just seem to accept it as canon as it's used again in the remake in 2007 & 2009. In my opinion, despite Laurie being Michael's sister. His randomness of killing victims is still, pretty odd. I get, why he would kill the hospital staff, but, why does, he continue to killed random people, that has nothing to do with Laurie? Honestly, I really don't get his logic, why didn't killed the old lady in the beginning, or the man with boom-box? The only thing, I can take, is that he hate people that looks attraction. It's nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as Laurie Strode, however, it's not as memorable as the first movie. Most of the film, has her, bed-ridden trying to recover, from her earlier attacks. It was very short. It was also nice to see Donald Pleasence in this movie, though, most of the time, he seem less, and less, a doctor, and more and more like an armed vigilante. Dick Warlock as Michael Myers was alright for the most part; but he was a bit too short for the role of the Shape. One thing, that I really can't accept, about Michael Myers in this film, is how he can seem nearly impossible to kill. It made the film, less realistic, and more supernatural. So, it doesn't make sense that Michael Myers still able to survive, being shot, multiply times. It's really getting silly, when he able to drown people in boiling hot water, and not get blister. I know the sequels to this, are much worst, when it comes to him, getting injury but come on! This movie should had stop it, from continuing. Originally, Halloween II was intended to be the last chapter of the Halloween series to revolve around Michael Myers, but after the lackluster reaction to 1982's anthology film, Halloween III Season of the Witch, which feature a different story. The Michael Myers character was brought back in 1988's Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers in hope of recovering the film franchise. In my opinion, it never did. Overall While, the movie might be a little dated. It's still pretty scary. It was an alright sequel.

It further departs from its predecessor by incorporating more graphic violence and gore, making it way too similar to other slasher films at its time.
