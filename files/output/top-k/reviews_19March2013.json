The convicts are the good guys and the wardens are the bad guys? Wait a second there champ; isn't that the case for every prison movie there is? What is that? It has Morgan Freeman having lots of cool internal monologues that border the poetic? And speaking of poetic, isn't there a lot of poetic justice in this movie? There is? I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!OK folks, let's be straight about it. This movie is a teen adventure masked as a gritty drama. The setting is pessimistic as heck and the characters act like they are all boy scouts. If you see the whole thing from a realistic point of view, it is basically making heroes out of criminals and villains out of the system of justice. And it is also about rewarding the heroes and punishing the villains with a cop-out way and heading for poetic justice.Of course the movie was never supposed to be realistic and it is a mistake to go in with a critical mind. It is about a feel-good mentality, to never give up no matter what problems life throws at you. So seriously, don't try to reason that sweet old guy who didn't want to leave prison but the evil warden gave him his freedom and thus ruined his happiness. Neither try to make sense of why the system refuses you parole while you want to and agrees when you give up. Or how someone digs a tunnel for 20 years and an inspection never finds the hole or the soil he was removing. That is not the point anyway. It is about making the best of what you have and defending your ideals with your life. A thing which definitely stands out is that the objective of the film is not for the protagonists to escape. Freedom is not found outside the walls of the prison yard but in the state of your mind. This is what Andy manages to offer to everyone by gradually transforming the gray cells into a place where the inmates can find recreation, hobbies, and even wisdom through a library. They find happiness even when confined. Of course I am too much of a cynical bastard and I couldn't get into the above mood so well. Call it unwillingness to suspend disbelief but when I saw all the things Andy offered to the inmates I was only thinking of how more dangerous they will be if they ever get out, with added wisdom and crafts in their disposal. Because most criminals don't reform in prison as you probably know; they learn new tricks and come out more dangerous than before. Of course the movie was heading for the fluffy feeling of thinking Hey, if you give criminals enough hobbies and recreation in prison, and treat them like human being, they will be law- abiding citizens when they return to society. Sweet thought, but still unrealistic since it mostly takes for them to get a proper job to support a family and stay away from their criminal connections. And yes, I am missing the point but that is how I felt while watching it. Would any of the magic in this film work if we were told that every major convict had killed a dozen people, raped several women, and molested his own kids? Nope, but the past is not the point. It is abut offering redemption to them regardless of what they had done. Giving them a second chance if they deserve it and helping them to get back on their feet after all the beating life gave them. Sweet concept, very nicely presented, but I am still a cynical bastard, so I give it no more than a 7\/10.

Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail. What makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. Each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. You will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match. An extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. You are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an American state of the 50's. Something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy CSI method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world). The interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. It is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. This would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. It has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were. There are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. The whole film is made up of only white males. Not a single woman or member of a different race. Although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. That is why I like the 90's remake even more in overall. Although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. And despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way. Not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.

In the peaceful world of 2032, the bad guy Simon Phoenix (Snipes) goes on a crime spree so the police revive a former cop (Stallone) to bring him down. DEMOLITION MAN has actually gotten a little better with age but there's still no question that it has some major flaws throughout, which keep it from being a better film. I think one of the biggest flaws is some of the satire. Yes, I will admit that a lot of it works but at the same time there's a lot of it that doesn't work. Even worse is that there's a large portion of the film that deals with nothing but laughs and this here keeps Snipes off the screen for way too much time and especially when you consider how fun he is.

I can't even think of a place to start describing all the fails in this plane crash of a movie. First of all, this could be a decent movie if the characters would just shut up. The dialogue is simply horrible, the acting is beyond ridiculously bad, and there are so. many. cheesy word plays! Robin describing Mr. Freeze's henchmen as the hockey team from hell, Mr. Freeze telling people to chill before freezing them, Ivy telling Batman the plants have got a crush on him... It's just awful. Next, the character interpretations. Uma Thurman is the winner, as her Poison Ivy is recognizable from the DC comics. Then comes Clooney's Batman, which is in short, with no further ado, a tragedy. Next is Robin, whose role is to be a more mature boy wonder, but is acting like a baby throughout the movie. Was this intentional? It doesn't matter; it sucked anyways. And then there's Mr. Freeze. Aka roll your eyes backwards. Could there be any worse than the governator to play this man? If the movie is supposed to be based on the comics, follow the comics! Mr. Freeze is a sad and bitter man, not some clown with cheap word plays and jokes! Leave the actual fun to the Joker! Which brings us to the last villain in this movie, namely Bane. Good. God. DC portrays him as a brilliant strategist as well as a brutal and skilled in combat. He is the one enemy Batman seems unable to beat. And in this movie, he is nothing but a brain-dead, drug-fueled monster who can't do anything but smash bricks and roar. For those of you who don't know him, watch The Dark Knight Rises. That's the REAL Bane. I could go on covering all the errors for a pretty long time, but I think I would need more than 1000 words for the complete summary. In short, cast and crew belong in a life-time sentence with no trial. Shame on all of them.

The protagonist confronts the villain too early in the film to lend their conflict gravity. The villain's demise is ultimately unsatisfying and the film's resolution seems rushed. It is fair to say that the protagonist does go through a change in his view of the world, particularly what it means to be a hero, which lends the film merit. The tone mixes light-hearted Disney humor with the darker tones of the sword and sorcery genre popular in the 1980s. The film is ultimately interesting, in large part due to the animation and mature themes imbued in the plot. I loved that Disney, prior to the Eisner era, was willing to explore a dark sword and sorcery fantasy concept in its animation. This movie is no fairy tale, like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty. I doubt Walt would have green lit such a grim project, which has more in common with Lord of the Rings than Dopey and Grumpy. A few reviewers have complained that The Black Cauldron does not look or feel like a typical Disney animated movie; that's why I enjoy it!The cartoon is based on a book for older children and preteens written in the 1960s, which in turn was inspired by Welsh mythology. The aura of high fantasy pervades the animation, which lends it an element of coolness that no doubt would appeal to older viewers than is the case for Disney animated films. The characters' facial appearances have the look typical of 1960s to mid-1980s Disney cartoon movies, so expect that. The Horned King and Creeper look pretty cool; while not particularly vile when compared to the likes of the Wicked Queen in Snow White or Stromboli in Pinocchio, the Horned King is one the scariest-looking Disney villains designed. His skull-face and antlered cloak evoke a sense of the sinister supernatural not present in much of the Disney fare. His army of undead soldiers, the Cauldron Born, are especially creepy--again, preteens who feel too old for cute mice and who want an introduction to high fantasy may be drawn by the ghoulish villains. This film also has a bit more realistic violence than most Disney cartoons, which may also attract older kids the protagonist's cheek actually *bleeds* after a dragon attack, which is uncharacteristic for a Disney character! Granted, the plot and themes are pretty sloppy compared to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring films, but for any kid who wants a more mature fantasy-themed Disney movie may enjoy what The Black Cauldron has to offer. This film came out when high fantasy was en vogue, and films like The Dark Crystal, Conan the Barbarian and Willow were popular. Sadly, this movie was a flop, and marked a dead end for Disney's attempts to animate dark high fantasy cartoons for an older audience. I sometimes think of what could have been Disney might have released a slew of animated features based on adult fantasy novels, like Wheel of Time or Herbert's Dune; hell, they may have ended up producing the first R rated Disney animated film, perhaps an adaptation of Game of Thrones. Sadly, this film's ill-fated production precluded that possibility, and it would not be until The Lion King and the Pixar movies that Disney would market its cartoons to children and adults simultaneously. While not a classic, The Black Cauldron is worth a watch. Watch it to experience a truly unique Disney venture its first foray into high fantasy.

Filled with brilliant,non-stop Action,great direction and amazing special effects Predator is an excellent and unforgettable Action classic and is Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McTierman at their best.Set in Central America,Predator tells the story about a group of commandos who have been sent on a rescue mission. While they complete their mission the group discover that they are being hunted by a lethal alien. Now Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger)and his squad have to figure out how to stop this alien and stay alive.What if the character Rambo faced off against the Alien in the Alien franchise? You get Predator,an intense,Action packed film that is one of the greatest Action films of all time and an unforgettable classic that never slows down and is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. One of the things that I love about Predator is the way that it's set-up in the first 40 minutes. During the early part of the film we assume as the viewer that this is going to be just another Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle,but the film cleverly turns you on it's head when the alien attacks and kills and you know that this is not going to be your regular Schwarzenegger film,but a tale of survival and staying alive. The concept of Predator is original and brilliant because the alien is looking for big game hunting and skinning humans and wanting trophies the same way humans do when humans are hunting animals and in this film the concept of hunting is turned on it's head. The use of the Central American jungle is great and adds to the films dread and dark atmosphere because when the characters are in the jungle you'll feel like it goes on forever and that there is no way out and it's the end for the characters. You feel that none of the characters are safe. The hot temperature and sweating adds to the film as well because it's very realistic and you will feel like you're in a hot oven or heater and want to get out and scream at the top of your lungs. And speaking of the characters,despite their strong arms and toughness they a little depth and you feel for the characters and the plight that they go through whether it's dealing with the heat,the Predator,getting out of the jungle or trying to stay alive. The Action in the film is excellent because it builds up thanks to the suspense of most of the scenes and the tension element involved and when the film's tension stops the Action explodes like a bomb and the Action comes fast like a quick punch in the face and you never know what hit you. It's some of the best Action scenes in the 80s and of all-time. The Predator Alien is one of the greatest creatures in the history of cinema and I think one of reasons he's a great Alien and creature is because he's not like other Alien creatures. The Predator isn't trying to take over the world or possess a human body,he's just a hunter and a dangerous killer looking for trophies to take back to his planet. The Predator stalks his prey with smarts and a great use of his weapons. What's also great about the Predator in this film is that we don't see much until the very end which is a smart thing because it adds to the mystery of The Predator and I think makes the Predator more frightening. The Predator is such an amazing creature and when you first see him you will never forget him. The final 30 minutes of this film is a powerful and truly flawless execution of Action and white hot Suspense and is so intense that you will probably want to watch it again because the ending is very exciting and explosive. It is a truly amazing,thrilling and brilliant conclusion to this amazing movie one of the many reasons Predator is a classic.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent as Dutch,with Schwarzenegger bringing depth and charisma to the role. Carl Weathers is wonderful as Dillon,Dutch's friend and army buddy. Elpidia Carrillo does a great job as Anna,a girl that's captured by the commandos then helps them out. Bill Duke is menacing and intense as Mac. Jesse Ventura gives a fun and entertaining performance as Blain,the tobacco eating,big armed soldier. Sonny Landham gives a great,intense performance as Billy,a man of few words. Richard Graves is wonderful as Poncho. Shane Black does a good job as Hawkins,a guy who tells a good dirty joke. R.G. Armstrong gives a fine performance as General Phillips. The late great Kevin Peter Hall is brilliant as The Predator,using excellent body language and movements with his eyes and head. His performances in Predator 1 and 2 will live on forever. R.I.P Kevin Peter Hall.The direction by John McTierman is brilliant,with McTierman constantly moving the camera and using great angles,giving the film a excellent energy and fast pace. McTierman also does an amazing with the Action scenes and does with great intensity. Great job,McTierman.The score by Alan Silvestri is masterful,intense,dark and suspenseful and definitely adds to the greatness of the film. A great score. There's also a great use of the classic Long Tall Sally by Little Richard.The special make-up effects with The Predator creature by the late great effects artist Stan Winston is amazing and iconic and right next to the Terminator films this is his best work. R.I.P Stan Winston.In final word,if you love Action films,Sci-Fi films or Schwarzenegger films,I highly suggest you see Predator,a landmark Action classic that you can watch again and again.

Filled with brilliant,non-stop Action,great direction and amazing special effects Predator is an excellent and unforgettable Action classic and is Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McTierman at their best.Set in Central America,Predator tells the story about a group of commandos who have been sent on a rescue mission. While they complete their mission the group discover that they are being hunted by a lethal alien. Now Dutch(Arnold Schwarzenegger)and his squad have to figure out how to stop this alien and stay alive.What if the character Rambo faced off against the Alien in the Alien franchise? You get Predator,an intense,Action packed film that is one of the greatest Action films of all time and an unforgettable classic that never slows down and is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. One of the things that I love about Predator is the way that it's set-up in the first 40 minutes. During the early part of the film we assume as the viewer that this is going to be just another Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle,but the film cleverly turns you on it's head when the alien attacks and kills and you know that this is not going to be your regular Schwarzenegger film,but a tale of survival and staying alive. The concept of Predator is original and brilliant because the alien is looking for big game hunting and skinning humans and wanting trophies the same way humans do when humans are hunting animals and in this film the concept of hunting is turned on it's head. The use of the Central American jungle is great and adds to the films dread and dark atmosphere because when the characters are in the jungle you'll feel like it goes on forever and that there is no way out and it's the end for the characters. You feel that none of the characters are safe. The hot temperature and sweating adds to the film as well because it's very realistic and you will feel like you're in a hot oven or heater and want to get out and scream at the top of your lungs. And speaking of the characters,despite their strong arms and toughness they a little depth and you feel for the characters and the plight that they go through whether it's dealing with the heat,the Predator,getting out of the jungle or trying to stay alive. The Action in the film is excellent because it builds up thanks to the suspense of most of the scenes and the tension element involved and when the film's tension stops the Action explodes like a bomb and the Action comes fast like a quick punch in the face and you never know what hit you.

At first it appears to be only about a bunch of unemployed mercenaries doing their job by defending a village from bandits. It quickly turns to a rather complicating interaction of ideals, social norms, and internal conflicts. Although the bad guys (the bandits) remain generic enemies all the way, the samurais and the villagers are shown to be a lot more than the simple stereotype they begin as. There are lots of minor side stories that flesh them out and enrich the setting with a lot of gray overtones. The movie is not afraid to kill its characters, despite presenting them in a most heroic way. The death toll is high and it is interesting to see how almost all of them are killed by a rifle and not by a petty bandit's spear, which is a double way to show how great they are with the sword, as well as how all your talent means nothing before modern warfare. At the same time it does not leave the villagers to be nothing but passive spectators throughout the battle, as they are given the task to participate. Along the way they are shown to be far more than stunts, as even they have secret agendas and minor problems of their own. Even as far as action goes, the movie is still great, with the swordsmanship and the invasion of the riders, or the ambush in the forest being very well orchestrated, with believable fighting moves that never feel shallow poser nonsense. Even during the non-action parts, the characters are acting very dynamically and expressively, instead of just standing still and talking. Even the ending is basically bittersweet, as despite the losses and victories life goes on but the sadness of the realization of a never- ending struggle is just overbearing. p.s.

Happily, having watched it again this morning, I'm pleased to report that I was wrong - it has aged surprisingly well and is an engaging action thriller that makes you think (as good sci-fi should) and that fact isn't a surprise, given that the basis comes from Blade Runner scribe Philip K Dick. But part of me wanted this to remain more faithful to the original tale instead of twisting it into an Arnie vehicle with some occasional lapses of logic.The now-former Governator plays construction worker Doug Quaid, bored with his humdrum life on Earth with his blonde wife Lori (Sharon Stone) and troubled by dreams of himself coming a cropper on Mars. In an effort to rid himself of these nightmares, Doug visits a company called Rekall which can implant memories of a nice holiday and Doug seizes on the promise of a secret agent trip. Before he knows it, he is thrown into a confusing labyrinth of spies, conspiracy and everyone trying to kill him. Desperate for the truth as he begins to question reality, Quaid travels to Mars in an effort to unravel the mystery and finds himself aiding the rebel cause alongside a mysterious woman who appears in his dreams called Melina (Rachel Ticotin) against the villainous tycoon Cohaagen (Ronny Cox) and his thuggish lieutenant Richter (Michael Ironside).Very few Hollywood films seem to get sci-fi right, using the story as an excuse to bombard viewers with special effects and epic battles between good and evil - think Star Wars and you know exactly what I mean. Total Recall does things it's own way, working hard to maintain an intelligent and thought-provoking story amid the chaos and typical Paul Verhoeven-levels of gore. The film has a genuine feel to it, fed by a rush of ideas and details that make the film oddly believable. Where it lets itself down is when it can't maintain the high-brow and resorts to the usual action-movie trappings. For example - what kind of a world is it where we've colonised a fair chunk of the Solar System, can implant memories and manufacture extraordinarily complex disguises (in a scene at Mars immigration that almost veers into parody) and yet, we still require construction workers using pneumatic drills and the military still use machine guns? However, you rarely get a chance to consider such plot-holes as Schwarzenegger tears it up as only he can and even tries acting in places instead of his usual mix of grimacing, ultra-violence and cheesy one-liners (though these are still present and correct).The original Total Recall is a real surprise by being an entertaining blend of tense thriller, bloody action and smart sci-fi. Most of the effects and make-up have lasted pretty well and it just about manages to avoid becoming yet another futuristic blaster with a meat-head in the lead (stand up and be counted, Demolition Man). It felt a bit like I, Robot which is also an entertaining and intelligent action flick. However, like I, Robot, I was somewhat distracted by the sound of the author turning in their grave - I can't imagine Dick enjoying this movie as much as the rest of us as his ideas and themes become little more than an excuse for blood-stained violence and running gun battles. Imagine the reaction of Milan Kundera (the author of The Unbearable Lightness Of Being) if that film had been turned into a straight-forward skin flick with shameless nudity and endlessly repetitive sex scenes. Total Recall may be a bastardisation of the source material but it's still an entertaining and recommended movie for most viewers who aren't afraid of violence, gore and language.

But, I believe in certain group think circumstances, it might come true. Whatever the case, I think the movie gave a great portrayal of what it is like to be deemed genetically inferior.The main character's hard work and endurance to reach his dreams gave a universal meaning and message without coming off as too corny. Also, I didn't think his plight and efforts for greatness detracted anything from the message. Often movies try too hard at pushing their universal message that the story ends up being horrible and the message ends up being overly done.This movie can help inspire all to believe in hard work and dedication while showing that the spirit is the strongest thing a human can have.The only one flaw I felt in this movie was the swimming competition with his brother. After already beating him once, beating him again was useless. They should have saved him beating his brother for the second time, having him lose the first time in his youth. This would have made it more powerful.

Filled with great direction,brilliant Action,score and fantastic special make-up effects,Predator 2 is not only an excellent classic and not only one of my favorite Action movies,but one of my favorite movies period.Set in Los Angeles,California in 1997,ten years after the first film,Predator 2 tells the story of a futuristic Los Angeles where on the streets L.A cops are battling drug dealing Jamacians and Colombians for control of the streets. When a new Predator comes into the city and starts hunting and killing off Jamacians,Colombians and then cops,maverick tough cop Mike Harrigan(Danny Glover)wants to get the Predator who's in town with a few days to kill.I can not understand for the life of me why Predator 2 has such a mixed reputation with most Predator fans. There's a lot very silly reasons for the mixed reputation,Arnold wasn't in it,Danny Glover was wrong for the role and miscast,The City setting was wrong. Even in 2010 when Predators came out some were even saying that Predators was better than Predator 2. In my opinion all of those reasons are terrible and wrong and while Predators was a good movie in it's own right it is not better than Predator 2. One of the reasons I love Predator 2 is because of the futuristic urban setting in Los Angeles and that right from the beginning it gives us viewers a dark future in 1997 where violence and drugs rule the streets and people are living in a record 110 degree hot weather and where there's no rules. The city of Los Angeles is not a pretty place in 1997 and The Predator picked the right place and right time to hunt big game. What I also love about P2 is that while this film is a sequel to the original,P2 works and becomes it's own film and doesn't try to repeat the same things as the original which I think is a creative and bold move by the filmmakers. P2 is also a great sequel because it expands the universe of the Predator franchise and gives fans surprises and shocks. If the first film was a combination of Rambo and Alien,then P2 is a combination of Lethal Weapon and Alien giving viewers a thrilling and fantastic cop story and becoming it's own film with new characters giving viewers a wonderful Film-Noir detective story with the main characters trying to figure who's doing the killings and why. The main characters like Mike Harrigan,the other cops and the other characters in this film are different from the first which I think is a great thing. If the characters in the first film were strong commandos with huge muscles,the cops in P2 are regular looking people which I think makes the characters look more vulnerable and gives the film a sense of danger especially with the main character Mike Harrigan. Mike Harrigan is a great character who's tough and can fight and is different from Dutch from the first film because when you look at Dutch against the Predator you think he could survive,but with Harrigan you ask will Harrigan survive fighting the Predator? This Predator is a different Predator from the first one. Where as the Predator in the first one was much older and more mature,this Predator is younger and more reckless not hiding all the time and using the city of Los Angeles as his own playground hunting down drug dealers and cops not playing by the rules. The Action scenes in the film are great and are definitely up there with the first film because like the first film's Action there's a build up and intensity and when the Action comes it kicks you in the stomach. The ending of the film is great and lasts about 45 minutes and there isn't a wasted moment. The ending is fast-paced and is an amazing mixture of Action and Suspense. A great ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Danny Glover gives an excellent performance as tough cop Lieutenant Mike Harrigan,with Glover bringing toughness and intensity to the performance. And as for some of the fans who said that Glover wasn't right for the role and was miscast they're wrong,Glover was amazing. Kevin Peter Hall is brilliant in his performance as The Predator,giving us the same body language and subtle movements as in the first film. R.I.P Mr. Hall. Gary Busey is amazing as Peter Keyes,an agent who's been after The Predator for years. Ruben Blades does a great job as Danny,Harrigan's partner and friend. Maria Conchita Alonzo gives a great performance as Leona,a tough female cop. Bill Paxton is wonderful and funny in his performance as the new cop Jerry. Adam Baldwin does a good job as Garber,Keyes' right hand man. Calvin Lockhart is creepy and memorable as King Willie,a Jamacian drug lord. Mortan Downey is hilarious as Tony Pope a news reporter. Robert Davi(Captain Heinemann),Kent McCord(Captain Pilgrim)and Henry Kingi(Scorpio)give good performances as well. The direction by Stephen Hopkins is excellent,with Hopkins bringing a dark,Gothic visually stunning atmosphere to the film and using great camera movements. Hopkins also does a great job with the Action scenes and does the Action like it was easy. Great job,Hopkins.The score by Alan Silvestri is brilliant and intense and fits the dark tone of the film and matches the first film's soundtrack. Great score. There's also a few great rap songs from Papa Dee that go with the film.The special make-up effects by Stan Winston is amazing once again and while The Predator is different,the make-up remains the same and is amazing. R.I.P Stan Winston.In final word,if you love the first Predator,Action films or Sci-Fi films I highly suggest you see Predator 2,an excellent,underrated Action classic and brilliant sequel that deserves a second chance. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

You can try to earn an easy score through the bloody hard work of robbing a bank, or a railroad, and cross the river into the freedom of a country where no law applies to you, but once you've crossed the river you'll be consumed by the chaos that always flourishes in the absence of law. You can try to rescue a friend, but your gesture will be rendered useless by a knife blade's flash. Then, when there's no more running, and nowhere to run to, when you've given your word and found that no one values it, when you've played out your string right to the end, what will you do? The Wild Bunch is Sam Peckinpah's exploration of that question. An artist who knew and loved life on the land, who knew well, and hated, the corruptions of 'civilization', and was compelled to cross the border into lawless territory, to seek a freedom which his own knowledge could never let him inhabit, Peckinpah made this marvellous film. It's set in a physical and spiritual landscape that any thinking middle-aged man is appallingly familiar with - the world of turning a blind eye to one's own cruelty, of watching one's hopes trashed by malevolence and stupidity, of being betrayed by friends, of fantasizing about the stroke of good luck that will let a man walk away from his compromises and failures. And Peckinpah's refusal to accept false sentiment reflects a middle-aged man's knowledge that self-interest and cruelty tempt even the very young, that even the powerful dream of being a child again is an illusion promising no peace. The children dream of being as brave and powerful as the adults whose violent actions are so seductively exciting. In the film's penultimate cathartic moment, it's a child who pulls the rifle's trigger. So, in the face of the disintegration of his world, and the impossibility of returning to innocence, what must a man do? No, the characters in this film are not honourable. But they dream of honourable actions - helping one's countrymen, one's village, one's friends. Yes, the idea of the frontier as an escape, and a new beginning, dies, in a welter of bullets after a man is dragged by technology across the abrasive landscape of his failure to see the consequences of his own actions. But the freedom of the frontier is its uncompromising offer of a chance to assess what's really true about existence. Sam Peckinpah knew that the assessment was the important thing. Death will happen. . . the important thing is to be ready to face death honestly, and so be able to live truly. The Wild Bunch isn't a young person's film, but for people who are ready to live in the minute details of existence faced honestly, ready to face the inevitable truth of death, The Wild Bunch is the necessary film. Peckinpah's clear vision cost him his happiness, and his health, finally, but left the rest of us a tough, miraculous, work of art.

By the expression on their faces, it seemed like a movie filled with emotions and after seeing it I realized how right I had been. The plot of the movie is so well organized. That's the first thing that comes to my mind. They devoted enough time for every aspect of Will's character. Nothing was done in haste. First half of the movie is about his intelligence, about him and his Professor trying to improve his skills. And the other half highlights completely different side of him. It shows wide range of emotions that we hadn't known he felt. That even he hadn't known he felt. Throughout the movie, the story is developing slowly but surely and it's full of catchy lines and witty phrases. Another amazing thing about this movie is his excellence, Robin Williams. His portrayal of Sean Maguire is one of the best I've ever seen. And also, character lived up to all my expectations. I had known that Robin is a psychologist before watching the movie, and I find such characters highly entertaining, but this one is, by far, my favourite. So intelligent man, and yet, full of pain because of the loss he had suffered. His love for his wife tugged at my heartstrings and made me cry from time to time. The way he talked about meeting her for the first time is, in my opinion, what love should be. Though annoying he may seem, Prof. Gerald is not all that bad, in my opinion. Even though he completely neglected the emotional part of Will and was more concentrated on enhancing his skills, he had best interest in his heart for Will and I don't see that as a bad thing. He knows that life is hard and thinks that Will should use his smartness he was endowed with as much as he can.In my humble opinion, mixture of these two characters, Sean and Gerald, is the best parent Will could have ever had. The realistic one and sensitive one.I must admit, to my shame, that before this movie I had never seen any movie starring Matt Damon, but he blew me away. His performance was impeccable. And Will .. oh, Will is just so amazing. No super- intelligent character has ever been that adorable. That scene where he degrades that Mr. know-it-all from Harvard was both charming and funny. Skylar and him are also adorable and one of the most natural screen couples I have ever seen. And the best thing is that in the end, with all bad things that have happened to him in life and all doubts he had in the movie, he gets a happy ending.Also, the relationship between Will and Sean is so well-written. When they met Will was so arrogant, thinking he knows it all and started insulting Sean and making false presumptions about his life. Even though it offended him, he saw it as a challenge. He saw a kid who desperately needed help and accepted to see him in the future. The scene on the bench, in front of a lake is, the most touching and beautiful scenes ever made. Damon and Affleck are true artists for making this scene. And it was also the turning point for this relationship &#x96; that's where Will realized that there's more to that man that he had previously thought. Not to mention It's not your fault part of the movie. The more he repeated that sentence the more I was falling in love with the movie. So powerful and , as I had mentioned, artistic.In a word, the best movie I have ever seen and that's why I'm giving it a ten.
