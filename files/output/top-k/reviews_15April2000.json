Controversy is, after all, a thing I adore.  I must tell you that I was absolutely mesmerized by this wonderful film.  Everything about it was wonderfully done, right down to Christian Bale's cheezy smile and yuppy demeanor.  I went in kind of expecting a blood bath and came out nearly in tears from laughing so hard.  It was sheer enjoyment to watch all of the actors, especially Bale, run amok in the posh district of NYC in the midst of 80s excess.  I would like to extend a special thanks to the casting people of this movie, Christian Bale is at last going to get the credit he so badly deserves.  I thank my lucky stars that Leo what's- his-name didn't get this part.  Bale touches emotional points that Dicaprio will never be able to touch.  Bale is funny, scary and utterly sad as Patrick Bateman. His American accent is superbly done seeing that he is from Wales.  The Academy might as well hand the best actor statuette over to him as soon as possible. And yes, his performance is that great.  As for the script and directing, it is just as entertaining as watching Bale chop up a helpless co-worker with a shiny new ax as he listens to Huey Lewis and the News, which is very entertaining to be totally honest.  The satire of the 80s is perfectly done and the scene where Patrick and his co-workers show off business cards is bound to be a classic film scene for years to come. There is one thing that I do ask of you. DO NOT pay attention to the trailers for this movie.  It IS NOT a slasher film by any means what so ever.  Granted there is plenty of gore and sex in the film, it is all purely satirical and it is all there to get laughs out of the audience.  And one more thing, don't go into the theater expecting a big ending out of this film because you will be seriously disappointed.  The ending, although very good, leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  So you have to be a very open minded person to appreciate it.  Overall, I give American Psycho five stars and beyond...

Would it have been just as good?A stupid question of course it would have been.  Criticising Van Sant's version for being made in 1998 rather than 1960 is like criticising it for being filmed on Mondays rather than Thursdays; the complaint is so entirely beside the point that any attempt at refutation would be equally beside the point.  (Of course, making an identical copy of a film that's still around can be criticised on other grounds.  It is, for one thing, a complete waste of time and resources, an extravagant waste of millions of dollars worth of time and resources in order to do what a copying machine could do for next to nothing.

But it has much the same script, exactly the same story, a similar setting, similar camera work, a few affinities of mood and theme.  Under the circumstances it's possible, but surely extremely unlikely, for Hitchcock's film to be good while Van Sant's is bad.  And no, Van Sant's isn't bad.  It's decent enough.So all in all it's surprising how clumsy (compared to the original) it manages to be.  Perhaps it isn't surprising.  Imagine trying to trace a great pen-and-ink drawing if you succeed perfectly you produce a work just as good as the first; but you probably won't succeed perfectly; very likely the act of forcing your hands to move the way another's hands have moved will produce something curiously mis-shapen, something SEEMINGLY like the original, but devoid of all life.

It's like an opera performance where the conductor in the pit is grimly sticking to the letter of the score and the director behind the stage is making hay of the stage directions.Oh, and did you notice that Van Sant's version is in colour?  Judging from this and the only other Van Sant film I've seen (`To Die For' - a wretched piece) the man has no flair for colour at all; he serves merely to show how well Hitchcock was served by his decision to film in black and white.  I won't comment on Van Sant's decision to interpolate split-second shots of storm clouds between the knife slashes in his shower scene.  What could I say?

The chief difference four weddings was wonderful and comedic, this was lightweight fluff with a couple of cheap unfunny gags aimed at shock effect (e.g. who could confuse mayo with yogurt??, give us a break!).*SPOILERS COMING UP, I GUESS*The writer didn't even try to make it different from FOUR WEDDINGS. look at the similaritiesUS girl with southern accent goes to england and experiences mutual love at first sight with hugh grant. hugh grant surrounded by motley support group, including one quirky funky girl with weird hair and bizarre wardrobe and heart of gold. quirky funky girl ends up with tall blond foreigner and dances with him at wedding by his picking her up off the ground. girlfriendless friend of hugh grant meets girl in last scene. hugh and love interest go back and forth on the relationship issue. hugh says 'bugger' throughout the movie. boy gets girl and vice versa in climactic final scene.the main (and only) essential difference between the two movies is substance. in FOUR WEDDINGS, there is character depth and development. in notting hill, not. why don't we get to see julia's relationship with her career and her past? either that, or let her act and show something of the star's personality so we can see what hugh sees in her. in FOUR WEDDINGS we didn't know much about carrie, but she was a mystery and played it off well, with no explanations. in notting hill, there was a little tinkering around with the notion but it ultimately went nowhere.

This is reality based drama at its finest.  For once, we have a real story that is not rendered dubious by over-dramatization.Michael Mann directs his third consecutive triumph.  He only does one project every three or four years, but what he lacks in frequency he more than delivers in quality.  I liked all aspects of his direction, but I was particularly impressed with his use of the camera.  Mann has all the various camera techniques honed to perfection, but what is most impressive is his appropriateness in using technique in a scene to maximize effect.  If he gives us an extreme close-up or a foreground blur, it is exactly what is needed for maximum impact in the scene.  He uses technique to enhance the scene rather than using the scene as an excuse to show off technique, a disease that seems to have become epidemic, especially among hip young directors.Mann brings us taut drama with a relevant message.  He provides well defined characters that hook the audience emotionally.   His pace is always appropriate with moments of frenetic action augmented by dramatic buildup and suspense.The acting in this film was uniformly excellent.  Pacino is at his finest in this role.  It is clear that he had a real passion for the part unlike his stilted and phony performance in `The Devil's Advocate'.

Hillary Swank (who I've never seen before) is heart-stoppingly good as poor, sexually confused, Brandon Teena\/Teena Brandon. To see what happens to her is as agonizing as it is inevitable. The story is based on real events in late 1993 in and around the small town (pop. 5000) of Falls City, Nebraska, and the casual attitude of the authorities to Teena's assailants is staggering (just drop by the station in the morning, guys). Instead of course they go out and kill a few people. Apparently the filming was done near Dallas as memories around Falls City were still a little raw. I hope the good citizens of that town feel just a tiny bit of shame. At least the sheriff didn't get re-elected next time up.The film does present the killers, John and Tom, in a mildly sympathetic way &#150; white trash losers already with jail records unable to cope with discovering that their new mate Brandon, who has taken up with John's ex-girlfriend Lana, is actually a girl. It has to be said that they are not nice guys, being cruel, violent and unstable. I was relieved to discover that both got convicted of murder-it wouldn't have been surprising if they had got off before a Falls City jury. Perhaps their mistake was to have killed a couple of `normal' people as well as Brandon. After all, Brandon was just an `it'.Hillary Swank as Brandon and Chloe Sevigny as Lana, the boy-girl and the girl-woman, are excellent together. Brandon is not over-bright but he shares his trashy dream (flight to Memphis) with Lana, and she responds to a sensitivity she has not met in a man before.

Having never seen a tv show or movie with Ed Norton, Ben Stiller, or Jenna Elfman, it was a treat to see three professionals shine. They all embodied their roles so well, you never felt they were Ed Norton being a priest, Ben being a rabbi, and Jenna being a corporation rescue expert. There are two levels of humor in this film, in terms of physical comedy the big-laugh routines, and the small stuff. The small stuff had me laughing in the theater when nobody else was. Small stuff, like when Ed Norton needs a drink in Jenna's apartment, opens the little fridge, and stuffs a bottle of beer or liquor into the pocket of his jacket. It reminded me of old Ben, the guy living on the beach in Local Hero, when he went to a party and stuffed snacks into his jacket pockets. Good marks to the supporting cast. I completely didn't notice that the old priest who Ed Norton consulted late in the film was Milos Forman. Anne Bancroft was delightful. They flesh out the film so well, you can enjoy the stuff the supporters do.The writer of the script, a guy named Blumberg, I think has a cameo. Early in the movie, when Ed and Ben hold a sign at the airport for Jenna to recognize them by -it reads Anna Banana- somebody is standing near them with a sign, Blumberg. So, you might check that out.It runs a bit long, and they could have cut some of it out in the second act, when the friendship of the three is threatened by two of them falling in love (not Ed and Ben), leaving one man out. However, I was never bored. You can spot the ending long before it comes, but so what? It's a wonderful, light-hearted romantic comedy, it treats the religious issues with respect, and the most important question it deals with -keeping faithful to the things we say we love- is explored intelligently here.Excellent film, go see it. It's a great date film.  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 2000","score":"","review":"  This is a very funny movie.

What I personally love about The 'Burbs is that I sort of know some of these characters in one form or the other.  Mark Rumsfield has the best lines as the crazy Vietnam Vet who will not settle for simple flashbacks to the war, but needs to actually relive the moments.

I am not a musical fan, but this is a big exception.  This film has more than just songs and dances (which are really well directed by Oscar winners Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins), there is a lot of drama and romance, much taken from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  It shows 2 communities in New York's West Side that always never get along and rumble, except for 2 people, Tony and Maria who fall in love in a time of hate.  This, along with a great musical score and songs by Leonard Bernstein make this a landmark with It's memorable songs and actors.  Winner of 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Director(s), Supporting Actor and Actress and a special one for Robbins choreography.  Well done (for once)  A++.

This film had such a lot going for it; an excellent cast, great fx work, a great director and composer... and yet it all went wrong.First things first- I have never seen any other film with such a mismatched score. Did Ennio see a different film? MTM needed a powerful, driving score, not this wimpish romantic nonsense. Every time the film kicked into gear the music dragged it back down.Really though the plot-or lack of it- really buried this movie. Man's first journey to Mars will be the biggest event of all time, full of tension and drama. And yet thirty minutes into MTM we are there and its yawnsville. One of the greatest stories ever told passed over in a dissolve. Such a missed opportunity.Instead we watch great fx and fine cast wasted on a mismash of a movie that doesn't know what it wants to be. A serious film like 2001, a testosterone-fueled action drama like ARMAGEDDON... instead it winds up like a twisted child of both. It makes the ultimate sin of giving us 'heroes' we just don't care about- does anybody in the audience really care when Tim Robbins dies?For sci-fi fans it is worth seeing for the spectacle of the excellent fx work (ropey Martian aside), but this is really doing the genre no favours at all. There are better stories every week on tv shows like FARSCAPE, VOYAGER etc.  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 April 2000","score":"","review":"  Oh dear.
