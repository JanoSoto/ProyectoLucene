I had heard such good things about it, from friends and reviews on here. I had that chance recently, and have to admit it was a pretty good movie. Cate Blanchett plays a wonderful Elizabeth, the character development is rich and interesting to watch. This movie has a somewhat long running time but the time passes quickly and that's a plus. Your also drawn in from the beginning, to the duplicity, deception and numerous motivations of the many around her. One thing Elizabeth certainly isn't is boring.If one has always been fascinated by royalty, this movie is just about the perfect choice. I was and am,one who does have a strong interest in that, growing up I read many a book about kings and queens etc etc. Elizabeth creates the feeling of the royal court wonderfully. And I mustn't forget to mention the cinematography either which is wonderful.Elizabeth is a movie I liked a whole lot while never actually loving. I think that's because of the Amount of characters and the ambiguity of virtually all of them. So many characters are introduced, many peoples' motives are never revealed fully, it's absolutely,a movie, where if your distracted for a second or two you lose a great deal. While the character development for Elizabeth is darn near perfect it's not there as much in anybody else. Still, The story of Elizabeth is a fascinating one and this is an absorbing and good movie. My vote is 7.5 out of 10.

Based upon the likewise-flawless novel by Ira Levin and virtually unaltered by Polanski, Rosemary's Baby is a work of art, a classic which stands alone to this day, never to be surpassed.Everyone knows the story by now; Mia Farrow is the sweet and innocent Rosemary Woodhouse who, along with her actor\/husband Guy, finds the perfect apartment in New York. Despite a disreputable history, it seems the catalyst of good fortune for the happily married young couple. Their friendly, if somewhat brassy, neighbors are played to absolute perfection by Ruth Gordon (who received an Oscar for her efforts) and Sidney Blackmer. Despite some foreboding nightmares and the unfortunate accidental (?) death of a young woman, life is good for Rosemary and her husband, whose acting career seems to finally be taking off. But there's always a price to pay for good fortune. Unbeknownst to poor Rosemary, her husband has literally made a deal with the Devil. Shortly after a romantic dinner, some chalky chocolate mousse and the mother of all nightmares in which Rosemary is raped by a beast whilst her neighbors and husband look on, Rosemary discovers she is pregnant. But the pregnancy is a difficult one, her neighbors are not what they seem and the inevitable closes in around her over the course of nine long months time. Rosemary comes to believe that she and the baby are in danger, that her baby is a potential sacrificial victim for a coven of witches. The truth, however, is much, much worse.I've always thought of Rosemary's Baby as the blackest of black comedies, and of Rosemary as the butt of a very long and drawn-out practical joke. Fans of modern day horror films, used to gory death scenes and disposable heroes, will probably not appreciate the pace at which this film moves or its wry sense of humor. This is indeed a shame, because this film is everything that a good horror film should be; intelligent, subtle and almost rather dismissive of its own brilliance. The films climax is practically shrugged off by the characters who have brought it about. And Rosemary finally realizes that perhaps the only way to beat them is to join them; there is no fiercer predator than a mother defending her child, and as she accepts her role as the Mary of the Profane, we must wonder; will she triumph after all?I've hesitated to review this film for a long time, simply because I couldn't think of anything to say about it that hasn't already been said. It's a masterpiece, a work of art, an inspiration for many films to come, some good and some not so good. It continues to loom large over the genre, virtually untouchable and yet always accessible. No fan of film - horror or otherwise - should miss this. It truly deserves every word of praise it has ever earned.

I think this is a film that speaks strongest to those who have either tried to make a living off the land or have\/had grandparents or great grandparents who fought to survive on a hardscrabble farm during the Depression. Spending some time in Texas and getting to know the lay of the land probably ups the enjoyment factor, too.Many people have rightly pointed out the superb performances of the leads, but the more I watch this film, the more impressed I am with the performance of Terry O'Quinn, who played Buddy, Viola's husband. I'm so used to seeing him play either psychopaths or hard-charging soldiers or ruthless businessmen that it was a real treat to see him play such a normal character. In his short screen time, he conveyed warmth, tenderness, and concern and made you wish that the secondary story of the affair between Wayne and Viola had been fleshed out so you could understand how two people who had apparently loving spouses could decide to cheat on them--and by extension, their best friends. His performance really sticks with me.I know some people are dismissive of the trio of people who band together as just a handful of cliches, but ask yourself How could it have been written any differently? A drifter HAD to be the one to suggest that Mrs. Spaulding grow cotton. As concerned as friends and loved ones were about her, they not only lacked money to help her, but had seen her as the physically delicate, genteel sheriff's wife for so long that it never would have  occurred to them to suggest she take up farming. A stranger had to point that solution out. If the drifter had been white, the underlying messages about racism and prejudice would have been lost--and the film would have been poorer for it--and some audience members would have been disappointed that the drifter and the widow didn't get together. Because the racial divides of this time and place have already been graphically illustrated, the audience doesn't expect a typical Hollywood foray into a romantic subplot. As for the blind character, he was there because he had nowhere else to go and the way he became a boarder pointed out how under the thumb of anyone who had money and\/or power people like Edna were. She didn't want to take in a sightless boarder; she was pressured into it.

I start to wonder why the sisters laugh when one mentions who made the funeral cake. Was she a notoriously bad cook or a good one that bragged constantly about her baking prowess? The most startling thing I noticed on a recent viewing was how quickly the crux of the film--will back-breaking labor save the farm?--really played out. When we see characters out in the hot sun-- literally crawling on the ground--to get the crop in, I felt like these poor souls had spent months like this. I suddenly realized that it had to be about a week or two. I'm NOT belittling the effort it takes to plant, chop, and pick cotton. I was just a little shocked to figure out how compressed all that exhausting harvesting time was. See what I mean about watching a film too much?I love this film. I'm glad I saw it the first time.

It centers around this two guys who want to commit the perfect murder, that seems to be a theme in hitchcock movies but of course these two do not fool James Stewart, who sort of plays a mentor to both the young men ( I really hate this guy) and he is on to them like white on rice. of course when they do confess to him they expect congratualtions but instead James like a cop-out turns them to the police and of course immediately recants his philosophy. But apart from that its not really the plot that makes me enjoy the movie, it is the way the movie is filemd, if i am correct in 8 minute increments where the camera does not break scene. Rumor was that Hitchcock wanted to film the whole movie like that but opted for this because the camera couldn't hold that much film. This filme represents want i like about Hitchcock, his style. Only Brian De Palma can match this guy in stylish filming and De Palma barely comes close.

So, you can see, I am not afraid of Tarkovsky's complex poetic symbolism, his seemingly slow camera or the questions that he often leaves unanswered.With this said,I do not like Stalker and even more, I believe it was Tarakovsky's failure even though, the master's failure has got all signs of his greatness - stunning black and white cinematography, debates among the characters about meaning of life and nature of one's deepest desires, the journey into the zone to the magic room that is one of the finest dream -like pieces ever seen on the screen. But somewhere among all these fine pieces something very important is missing. Maybe the problem is with the main character of the film, the nameless Stalker who in a film is such a saintly, suffering, and I dare say pompous figure that I just can not care about him very much.***Spoilers for the book Roadside PicnicIn the original book Roadside Picnic by Strugatsky Brothers on which the film is loosely based the stalker had a name, Roderick (Red) Schuhart. He was not a saint; he was a human being with a lot of weaknesses. Like a Stalker in the film, Red had inhuman intuition and luck that had helped him to survive the multiple trips to the Zone. But the Zone caught up with him in the end, and he was playing the ultimate price watching how his only child who was born as a beautiful and joyful girl was turning into the strange and mute animal. That was why Red decided to make the last trip to the Zone and find the legendary Golden Sphere (the Room in the film) that could grant any wish. Red knew he could not go alone because just when you thought that you reached the Sphere there was an ultimate trap that could only be fed by a human being. Such great and desperate was Red's desire to get his daughter back that he took with him an innocent young man, teenager really, perfectly knowing that that man will never return from the Zone. The Stalker of the film KNOWS what other people's deepest and hidden desires could be, in the book, Red found out that after he finally reached the Sphere, he did not know what and how to ask; his only hope was that the magic tool would reach inside his soul and find that his soul was still alive and bleeding from pain and begging for his daughter and for forgiveness.

I do not understand how with a screenplay like that and with all its beauty the film turned to be remote, passionless, extremely long and (please forgive me all the fans) boring. I love every minute of 205 Andrey Rublyov's minutes and I would beg for more. I treasure every moment of 108-minutes long Zerkalo, and I have seen it five times.

Al Pacino is the dude of acting! lol It goes a lil something like this Kevin Lomax (Reeves) is a hot shot lawyer who's never lost a case. He's married to a follically challenged woman named Mariann (Theron) and they're happy as clams. John Miller (Pacino) hears about Kevin's streak and decides to recruit him. They go to NYC and are wined, dined, and bribed into accepting a job as a criminal lawyer in a network of top global lawyers. Once they start living the life and Kevin gets all his clients acquitted for their criminal deeds, things start to go haywire. Mariann starts to see demons in their friends and realizes she can't have the baby she desperately wants. She feels alienated and out of place while Kevin works. She eventually goes crazy, but only because she's seen the truth. Kevin is taken under the wing of John Miller and gets caught up in lying for his clients to maintain his perfect record. All is not what it seems as people start dying and Kevin finds out that he's the son of the Devil. As a child of a Bible-thumping mother, this creates a problem. Miller wants him to start a family business with his half sister (whom he secretly lusts) and basically wants to p*** God and all the angels off with the lack of justice in the world. I liked that this movie made people realize that the devil can be real and out there affecting forms of governments and other systems of power. This is obviously a movie, but the message to me is still clear. It was a unique angle to attack an age-old debate from. Satan is in the law? American law? Hmm....pretty interesting stuff. Sure would explain a lot and don't mention O.J. any of you, lol. Point is, the movie is fabulous and decadent and shows how vanity can be a deadly sin and probably Satan's favorite according to Pacino. Theron attacked her part wonderfully and made a fan out of me. She's absolutely stunning. Greed is a serious issue and this movie discusses that. It's a must see and they have it on TBS and TNT all the gosh darn time, so just watch it.

I regret I did.The story starts as Potter finds her boyfriend cheating, and her looking for another place to live. Now this is where the movie makes a mistake. Normally, I'm not that big on complaining about small details in a movie but when the movie sucks, I have to comment. What happened?Potter's character decides to live with 4 models, who apparently need her 500 dollars a month for pocketmoney... but why? As we progress in the movie it shows these models live for free, get thousands of dollars for their modelling and when they have a $1200 dinner the check gets picked up by some boyfriend... Just a mistake? Well, an annoying one.Then let me talk about a second mistake. It is a pretty depraved one. First of, we see Potter attacked quite sexually by a dog. And it's intented to have a sexual meaning. It really made me sick. Not nearly as much though as the comments of the 'Australian' model, who talkes about her uncle playing charades (or something) with her, completely naked. Such stupid jokes about phedophiles and incest I find hard to take in what is a romantic comedy. So please, next time, take them out.Back again to the story and Amanda, Potter's character. One day she meets Jim (Prinze Jr.), and (surprise surprise) falls for him. It turns out he's the neighbour across the street. They meet again at a party, once more on the street and... fall for each other. Why? Erm... dunno. But it fits nicely in the story I guess. Now all this happens during the first 30 minutes. So you know there's gonna be a mix-up, a surprise, something that's gonna drive the two lovers out of each other. Is it an old boyfriend? A secret from the past? No, this is where the movie takes quite a different turn than all those other romantic comedies... (TAKE WARNING, SPOILERS BEGIN NOW)... One night, Amanda sees how Jim kills a woman across the street (well, at least, that's what she thinks).Now, this is where the movie can go two ways. Either Jim IS the killer and it turns out to be a thriller kinda movie, or he isn't (and we all know it) and it's just a goofy comedy. But the movie doesn't decide... So we hear Jim talking about how 'the girl isn't a problem anymore' which can be interpreted a thousand ways. So we just don't know. But then, the key moment in the movie. Amanda finds out the woman she thinks she saw really was murdered, so she knows (well, she thinks she knows )) Jim is the killer, and she confronts him... and finds out he ISN'T, but an FBI agent pretending. So we, the public, only think for less than 10 seconds he really is the killer... this is all the excitement the movie offers. As we say in Holland, it's neither meat nor fish (I love that expression). So let's just think what would happen if Jim flat-out said 'yeah I killed the b*tch'. Now, this would have fitted his role. Us at home would really think he IS a killer. Excitement. Now THAT would be an OK movie...The rest of the movie is just a silly wrap-up of a bad thriller kinda movie (Miss Congeniality comes to mind). Only good part is that the end is at a fashion-show by Alfredo's... I really hope that's a tribute to Hitchcock (and his Rear Window). For the rest yuck! 2\/10.

The visuals convey a certain Depression-era drabness without being overwhelmed by it.  Conrad Hall's final film before his death is a spectacular way to finish a career, and the art direction is wonderful.  Few movies use vintage cars as well as this one does.The movie worked for me, even if I wasn't as emotionally connected to it as I might have liked.

They have the ability to hover in the air, move at rapid speeds, view their surroundings with a heat-sensitive POV, and detach various objects that can bore through their victims' skulls. In Phantasm III Lord of the Dead, we learn that there are thousands of these balls, and it made me wonder how The Tall Man has so much time to construct them, in between robbing graveyards, dissecting bodies, creating evil dwarves and driving across the country in pursuit of new towns to ruin. Sure, we now learn that he places dead people's brains inside the objects, but where does he craft these spheres? What are they made out of? How does he make them perfectly round? How are they able to hover in the air? How do the brains inside them function?No matter. Because Phantasm III is almost so bad that it's good. Almost. Unlike the second film, this one seems a bit campier, providing darker humor and less sequences of cornball dialogue. It's still terrible but not in a boasting sort of way. And the movie does a good thing by focusing on Reggie (Reggie Bannister) instead of Mike (A. Michael Baldwin). And is it just coincidence that the actors' names relate to their characters? Nope. Phantasm is one of the all-time low-budget family-oriented series. And when I say family-oriented, I don't mean it's targeted at families with children -- I mean the Phantasm family, the fans of the series. Because the entire way these movies are constructed are to entertain the die-hard fans. Just like the Critters series, Phantasm falls back on flashbacks, recurring characters, movie in-jokes that reference earlier sequels, and familiar gimmicks (such as the endings). It's a true cult movie.So the more you watch these films, the more you are guaranteed to enjoy them. But they're still terrible and very silly -- I can't imagine how so many sequels got made. Did they really make that much money?Taking place directly after Phantasm II, this film has Reggie joining up with Tim (Kevin Connors), an orphaned child, to help find Mike (now played by the original A. Michael Baldwin, who took a hiatus during the 80s to pursue spiritual enlightenment). With the help of old and new friends, Reggie finds himself face-to-face with The Tall Man and another dimension, where he finds Mike trapped and unable to escape.Hunky 80s teen icon James Le Gros (well, he was popular in Japan) looks absolutely nothing like puny A. Michael Baldwin (the original Mike from Phantasm), and after seeing Phantasm II, it seems as though Coscarelli has downgraded his hero. He wisely focuses attention on Reggie, instead, and Baldwin is introduced for the first time about halfway through the movie. I have nothing against Baldwin, and he was the original Mike after all, but he's completely different from Le Gros -- awkward, strange, silent, and boring. He's not a very good actor and he's not a very convincing hero. And because Le Gros and Baldwin are so very different, it's hard to remind yourself that they are supposed to be the same characters. I wouldn't even buy them as brothers. What's great about James Bond is that even after he changes images, his missions start fresh, so we don't feel a need to remind ourselves that Pierce Brosnan is supposed to technically be the same guy that Connery played. With a new look comes a new plot. But with Phantasm III, the plot is the same, and the flashbacks are present, which is often times quite confusing.The film likes to blend in humor, mostly the sexual kind. This time around, the ever-horny Reggie is now on a quest to get black chick Rocky into the sack (Ever tried vanilla? he asks her. Didn't I tell you? Dairy products give me gas.). So let's get this straight his wife and kid die, and two days later he's trying to get laid? Hmm... Reggie is the best character in the film, but as the sequels tread on, he looks increasingly tired and too old for it all. It seems as if Coscarelli decided to make a horror movie one day, and enlisted the aid of his friends to help him film the movie. Now, they've all outgrown the movies, but they're still making them. They should just stop. Part V is going into production soon. Why?It's hard to actually classify Phantasm III as a movie because it seems more like a home video project made on a low budget with a bunch of pals. The special effects are a great deal better than those in the first two, but a movie cannot be judged solely on its effects. As a horror film, Phantasm III isn't very scary at all, and as a comedy, it is only mildly amusing.I'll admit that I was entertained, to a certain extent, and that it seemed a bit better than Phantasm II, which I think tried a bit too hard to become something more than an independent horror film. But if you actually stop and consider the flaws of Phantasm III, they're way too enormous to pass over.Once again, Coscarelli uses an unexpectedly good and surprisingly lasting finale to close his motion picture. But the fact is that Phantasm III just doesn't make much sense at all, promising to reveal certain things when it only extends our confusion about them. And like those frustrating Matrix sequels, it ends with a tie-in for another installment; a cheap way of getting audiences to see the next film. And also like the Matrix sequels, it tries to answer too many questions about too many open plot holes, when all the audience wants is an exit door.* \/ ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"22 March 2004","score":"1 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":"  These spherical objects that The Tall Man creates in the Phantasm series are truly quite amazing.

I can watch it over and over and never grow tired. It's simply stunning. Mary Lennox is an orphan who must stay with her cold and emotionally unattached uncle in his expansive manor. Here, she keeps to herself and finds an old garden and brings it back to life with the help of the staff and a young boy named Dicken. She comes to meet her cousin, the lil brat Colin, and teaches him to walk again despite being told he's unable to. The garden is apparently magical, but in a realistic way. There's no fairy dust or other such nonsense. It's just allowing people to believe in themselves and be happy. The music is touching as are the relationships of the characters. Colin wanting to marry her despite their 1st cousin status was a little too much for me, but didn't cause a break in the movie. I wished they had shown what she looked like as a grown up instead of avoiding her face, but I guess that's to keep her forever young in our minds. The mean maid (whose name i forget she was in Sister Act) provided a challenge to Mary, but nothing she couldn't handle and eventually won her over. Mary was a royal brat at first, but only cuz she didn't know how else to be since her parents were self-involved. I was glad to see her come out of it. Dicken was such a cool kid, I loved him a lot. He was smart without having to go to school for it and was just loveable and helpful. In other versions, he and Mary were supposed to get together, but he died in some war and she took up with Colin. I really liked him though. Colin was a sicly kid who they constantly fussed over and he was snotty to show for it. He calmed down a little too, but could still be a royal pain. He was temperamental and that was annoying, but that was his character. The father, Lord Craven, was only emotionally unattached because his wife died in childbirth and he thought his son wasn't able to be healthy and he would just run away. How English of him, lol. The garden was absolutely beautiful and gorgeous. Made you wanna be a kid again and just frolick around in it. All the animals and plants were inviting. It seemed simplistic and a good place to be. Even though Mary was young, she could still make a difference to herself and others and that's what makes the movie special and timeless.
