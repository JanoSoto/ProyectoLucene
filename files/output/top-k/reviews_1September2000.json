The story as you may well know is based on the famous Les Liaisons Dangereuses and I know as well as you that this book has been made into a film a few times before ( the most famous version being the one with John Malkovich, Glenn Close, Michelle Pfeiffer, Keanu Reeves, Uma Thurman and Swoosie Kurtz (who actually is in this film too, as Sebastian's therapist)). I must admit I never saw one of the other films but after seeing this one, I can't imagine one of the other versions is better then this or can even live up to this one. Of course you could consider this top be some kind of a teenie film for all the young people playing the lead characters and maybe it is such a teenie film, but who cares it was good anyway. But leaving that out, the thing I liked very much about this film is that it is not set in the 18th century, but in present time. This makes the film much more believable and exciting, plus you can identify more with the persons and the situations they are in, because they are pretty similar to the world all around you right now.The story is about Sebastian (Ryan Phillippe) and his stepsister Kathryn (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who love each other but can not admit it. Instead they go around, having sex as much as they can and destroy people while playing their sick and twisted little games. Their latest games involves the daughter of the future principal of their university. Sebastian bets his sister that he can get Anette (Reese Witherspoon) into bed before school starts. If he does not succeed he must give his ride, a 56 Jaguar to Kathryn. If he succeeds though he gets Kathryn, who is the only girl he can not get into bed. Kathryn also has a little scheme of herself going on, besides that bet, which involves young Cecile (Selma Blair).All of the actors in the film deliver good performances, OK Selma Blair is the least of all actors in the film, but that is caused by the fact that she plays some kind of dorky girl who is kind of dangling behind the rest of the cast who all have had some experience in love or sex. The best performances in this film are clearly from Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar. They both play their roles great and are therefore most memorable. The other actors are good too, but they just do their job, these two characters however are most exceptional and therefore the best. Ryan Phillippe is really good as the wicked and Rich Sebastian, who can have every girl he wants but gets tired of it. He really delivers a great performance, especially in the beginning when he is very wicked and mean but also in the end. The enchanting, pretty and nice Sarah Michelle Gellar as we know her from Buffy really is the best one here (maybe I think that because I am a male but well, who cares). She does not only show that she can play something else then the nice girl but she also shows that she can do it good. In this film she is not enchanting, pretty and nice, on the contrary, she is wicked, sexy and horny. She really delivers a great performance, just see for yourself and be blown away by her. The only thing that I think is a bit pitiful in this film is that we did not see more of Gellar during her teasing sessions and that she had to wear these stupid sunglasses in the park scene with Selma Blair. If you think the same about that glasses, do not worry she won't be wearing them long, plus there will be a good repayment coming up (cool close up Mr. Kumble).On to the film itself, I thought it to be more of a comedy sometimes then a thriller, but hey that is what makes this film great, it's variety of contents, for I HATE it when in a comedy there is really only comedy. I want a mixture of fun, excitement, comedy and feeling and that is just what this film delivers. OK the excitement doesn't build up to the &#145;on the edge of your seat' amount, but you keep on wondering what will happen next, especially in the end which is a bit of a contrast to the rest of the film I must say. This is a film I can definitely recommend to all of you and if you liked Wild Things as much as I did, this is a must see for you.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 September 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is really a good film.

I broke a nail!' type girl.Anyway, see this one when it comes on TV! It IS exciting & will make you remember what Sly's career is really all about - ACTION!

The film never looked this good before (I never saw it in theaters). Anchor Bay, which released the DVD, is obviously aware that the film has its audience, and they tend to unite on certain levels 1) Jerry Goldsmith's score; 2) Faye Dunaway's scene-chewing, which is about as good a Faye performance (in the spirit of Joan Crawford) as you're gonna get after Mommie Dearest; 3) a sweaty Hart Bochner with no shirt on (woof!!); and 4) effects buffs. I suppose there is a contingency of superhero fans out there as well, or men who like Helen Slater's legs or something, but they are perhaps in the minority.  Some other person who commented on this film here at IMDB (and who was rather hostile...and what's THAT all about???) said that by today's standards the effects are abysmal. Well that is as stupid a remark as anyone could every make. ANY pre-1990s effects are, by today's standards, going to seem shoddy, or at the very least on some level primitive, or even quaint. It's absurd to look at a film that is over fifteen years old and which didn't even have access to computer graphics and judge it against achievements made in a film like The Matrix. A 1950s Sci-fi epic like Forbidden Planet is going to seem particularly dated. Like...HELLO, they didn't have computers even just 15 years ago to do some of what is so commonplace today that you or I can go out and buy the software to do it on our home computers!!  People who watch a film from the early 80s and whine about how abysmal the effects are because they need to meet today's high standards should have their VCRs or DVD players taken away from them until they can be given a crash course in How To Recognize The Merits Of A Film In The Context Of It's Time Period.  Now, it's a fact that Supergirl didn't hit its mark commercially and the film has been raked over the coals for its flaws for years. And it is flawed. Even the director concedes that in the commentary; but *why* this film didn't quite gel properly is difficult to pinpoint, outside of the script, which has but a few choice moments (and I bet they were ad libs!). Aside from the script and obvious visual flaws because computer graphics weren't available yet (eyes roll) it is only fair to acknowledge the flying stunts in Supergirl are actually better than in the Superman films. Why? Simply because they had to be for the sake of character development (as the director explains this in the commentary). Even the person who called this film trash might have to concede that the aerial ballet that Helen Slater performs is a pretty nice achievement. Then again, I wouldn't hold my breath. Did you know that the town in Illinois where Supergirl was shot wasn't even a town in Illinois but a town built totally from scratch in England at the studio?? This all comes out, along with much more, in the fifty minute documentary on the making of the film which is sure to interest anyone who is into seeing behind the scenes stuff. Took 'em lots of time and manpower to pull that town off, apparently. And this is where I personally think maybe the film got bogged down (in recreating a small, midwestern town on an English backlot), as convincing as the town IS (I defy you to tell me you think it was a set).  Certainly, the film doesn't quite cut it, and it could also have to do with the overall approach. Again, the commentary under the film and the making of featurette provide more background so the viewer is able to ponder this with a better grasp of the film-making process. It really is interesting. If it weren't for the DVD being a superb package with two cuts of the film on separate discs as well as all the extras, I would hesitate to recommend the VHS at all. It's washed out, pan-N-scan, and that should be enough to end the discussion right there. As for the film itself....well, Helen came off a bit wooden (this was her first feature film). Faye, well...ya gotta cut HER some slack; she was still haunted by the ghost of Joan Crawford, and (thankfully!!!) it comes through in a number of scenes. The making of portion of the disc documents scenes being in the process of shooting which feature Faye hamming like crazy, and it's terrific! She also introduces the production with a brief monologue in close-up which is to die for.  Humor in Supergirl is frequently unintentional, but keep your tongue in your cheek and you'll enjoy it. Peter Cook and Brenda Vaccaro are actually quite funny (especially when  you get to see minutes on minutes of footage that was not in the US release of the picture -- that's right, there was an international version that was longer than the US release). Anyhow, the extras and the extra footage restored to the film make the package a good deal. Try searching online for the lowest price on DVDs and you'll get it for around $20.  No, this film isn't an award winner, but it has some good points, and is at least worth a look-see if you get a kick out of Faye, like the music of Jerry Goldsmith, and enjoy looking at how films are made (especially how they were flown in the old days with wires and the aid of optical effects).

The Federation, The Queen, The Jedi and the Republic are merely puppets that he moves around. The happy ending at the end isn't a happy ending at all- it's the beginning of the end.3. Midiclorians- those little bugs inside you that communicate with the force. These things don't discredit the power of the force. Their introduction is a plot-point that will play out over the next two films. There's probably a reason why they aren't mentioned in the original trilogy. The jedi's belief in these things will help lead to their own downfall and cause the Clone Wars.4. Anakin is supposed to be a happy go lucky child in this film. If he were portrayed as an evil child, his downfall during the next two films would mean nothing. Anakin is not born evil; he will turn to evil for reasons we will soon know.5. All the characters, except Yoda, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Palpatine will be dead by the end of Episode three. Think about that when you cringe at Jar's Jar's antics.

I have to applaud how John Frankenheimer balances suspense and humor like a master.  Note to Oliver Stone you don't need to bludgeon your audience over the head with conspiracy theories, subtlety works much better, and is infinitely more disturbing.There are so many fantastic performances in this movie.  Frank Sinatra provides a good hero, a man who starts out doubting his own sanity, then gets caught up in the desperate race to save Raymond Shaw.  Laurence Harvey's Shaw is a paradox he is about as unlikeable a person as you would ever want to meet, but you can't help but feel sorry for him as his life flies apart.  Angela Lansbury's character is so far away from the kindly image we have of her today, it's hard to believe it's the same person, but she pulls it off.One minor quibble just why is Janet Leigh in this movie?  The whole romance subplot between her and Sinatra felt tacked-on, obligatory.  If she were in fact another Communist agent, Sinatra's controller (as some have suggested), then they should have fleshed it out.  As is, her scenes seem like an afterthought.  Oh, and the Lincoln imagery was a little heavy-handed, too.  C'mon, Frankenheimer, we get the point...In spite of that, The Manchurian Candidate succeeds as a fast-paced, intelligent thriller.

The ending of the first movie never happened either, since Connor and the Kurgan weren't really the last two immortals.)

People who didn't collect might not understand the distinction, but let me explain Marvel published Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk and Daredevil&#150;&#150;and Marvel published the X-Men. And as long as I read X-Men comics, I dreamed of an X-Men movie.  So, this past Sunday, it was not without considerable emotional baggage that I plunked down my $9.50 to watch the movie version of the X-Men.Let's back up a second.  Following are the top 10 comic book super-hero movies ever1. Superman (1978)2. Batman (1966)3. Superman II (1980)And that's it.  4 through 10 are a no-show, because the rest of those super-hero movies rot-including (and especially) the recent Batman movies. But then there's &#145;X-Men'.  Honestly?  I think &#145;X-Men' is #4.The tone of the X-Men movie is grim, but not humorless.  It takes the outrageous comic book conventions seriously enough that we believe they believe.  It's not burdened with the need to ironically joke about how stupid the very idea of superheroes is, and, as a consequence, the movie takes itself seriously enough to be fun.  And the movie's themes, about bigotry and human rights, aren't profound, but they're there.  Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is to Martin Luther King as Magneto (Ian McKellen) is to Malcolm X, if you can believe it.  As directed by Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil), this comic book movie actually has some interesting ideas in it.Okay.  The set-up for reasons nobody understands, some people are born with strange super-powers&#133; they're mutants.  But, just like there are good lawyers and bad lawyers, there are good mutants and bad mutants.  The X-Men are good.  Magneto is bad.Magneto is a powerful mutant with a dastardly plan to expose all of the world's leaders to dangerous levels of radiation, turning them into the things they fear most mutants.  Once they've been mutated, it stands to reason they'll have to defend their own rights as mutants.  It's actually a great plan, not the usual super-villain grab for power.  As much as he can in a story like this, Singer takes conventional good-vs-evil stuff and twists it.  Magneto isn't evil&#150;&#150;he's a Holocaust survivor who sees mutants as the next persecuted minority.   As my friend Jeff said, this may be the first movie ever where the Jew in the concentration camp is the bad guy.We don't get to know most of the characters in this movie, but anybody who's allowed real screen time is engaging-which is why Wolverine and Rogue are the most interesting X-Men.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is, hands down, the best X-Man here.  He was even sexy enough to elicit whistles from women&#150;&#150;and maybe men&#150;&#150;in the theatre I was in.  Wolverine is first seen making money in bar-fights and fighting off anti-mutant bigotry with his retractable claws. We're told his skeleton is made of metal, and we can hear his knuckles clang when he lands a punch.  Wolverine takes runaway teen Rogue (Anna Paquin) under his wing, and here the movie wisely merges two comic book characters, Rogue and Kitty Pryde, giving Wolverine a powerful little sister to protect (I told you I was a comic book geek).  Enough is hinted at about Wolverine's past to ensure he'll be back in &#145;X-Men 2 Electric Boogaloo'.As for the rest, the X in Professor X's name apparently stands for xposition, because that's all he gets to do.  Cyclops ought to be called Cypher, and Storm and Jean Grey just fade into the background.  The villains -- besides Magneto and super-model super-villain Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), are pretty dull, but then the X-Men never had great villains besides Magneto.  It doesn't matter much&#150;&#150;Magneto and Wolverine provide enough kick to get this movie series off to a strong start.Well, wait.  Maybe there were some other good villains.  The Sentinels?

Wolverine takes runaway teen Rogue (Anna Paquin) under his wing, and here the movie wisely merges two comic book characters, Rogue and Kitty Pryde, giving Wolverine a powerful little sister to protect (I told you I was a comic book geek).  Enough is hinted at about Wolverine's past to ensure he'll be back in &#145;X-Men 2 Electric Boogaloo'.As for the rest, the X in Professor X's name apparently stands for xposition, because that's all he gets to do.  Cyclops ought to be called Cypher, and Storm and Jean Grey just fade into the background.  The villains -- besides Magneto and super-model super-villain Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), are pretty dull, but then the X-Men never had great villains besides Magneto.  It doesn't matter much&#150;&#150;Magneto and Wolverine provide enough kick to get this movie series off to a strong start.Well, wait.  Maybe there were some other good villains.  The Sentinels?

I own Spiderman #3 (first appearance of Doctor Octopus).  I keep it in a mylar case, and I display it prominently in my home.  I collect comic books.  More specifically, when I was a kid I collected Marvel comic books.  People who didn't collect might not understand the distinction, but let me explain Marvel published Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk and Daredevil&#150;&#150;and Marvel published the X-Men. And as long as I read X-Men comics, I dreamed of an X-Men movie.  So, this past Sunday, it was not without considerable emotional baggage that I plunked down my $9.50 to watch the movie version of the X-Men.Let's back up a second.  Following are the top 10 comic book super-hero movies ever1. Superman (1978)2. Batman (1966)3. Superman II (1980)And that's it.  4 through 10 are a no-show, because the rest of those super-hero movies rot-including (and especially) the recent Batman movies. But then there's &#145;X-Men'.  Honestly?  I think &#145;X-Men' is #4.The tone of the X-Men movie is grim, but not humorless.  It takes the outrageous comic book conventions seriously enough that we believe they believe.  It's not burdened with the need to ironically joke about how stupid the very idea of superheroes is, and, as a consequence, the movie takes itself seriously enough to be fun.  And the movie's themes, about bigotry and human rights, aren't profound, but they're there.  Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is to Martin Luther King as Magneto (Ian McKellen) is to Malcolm X, if you can believe it.  As directed by Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil), this comic book movie actually has some interesting ideas in it.Okay.  The set-up for reasons nobody understands, some people are born with strange super-powers&#133; they're mutants.  But, just like there are good lawyers and bad lawyers, there are good mutants and bad mutants.  The X-Men are good.  Magneto is bad.Magneto is a powerful mutant with a dastardly plan to expose all of the world's leaders to dangerous levels of radiation, turning them into the things they fear most mutants.  Once they've been mutated, it stands to reason they'll have to defend their own rights as mutants.  It's actually a great plan, not the usual super-villain grab for power.  As much as he can in a story like this, Singer takes conventional good-vs-evil stuff and twists it.  Magneto isn't evil&#150;&#150;he's a Holocaust survivor who sees mutants as the next persecuted minority.   As my friend Jeff said, this may be the first movie ever where the Jew in the concentration camp is the bad guy.We don't get to know most of the characters in this movie, but anybody who's allowed real screen time is engaging-which is why Wolverine and Rogue are the most interesting X-Men.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is, hands down, the best X-Man here.  He was even sexy enough to elicit whistles from women&#150;&#150;and maybe men&#150;&#150;in the theatre I was in.

Scene after scene, Gere walks and walks and walks, probably working in the Damn, he's sexy angle.Even the actors couldn't save this movie (not to say that Gere is a shining example of acting prowess). It was full of one-liners that one would only expect in cheap, tawdry romance novels, but never on-screen in a major motion picture release. Unless... Gere says with an expectant look on his face when he explains to Charlotte (Ryder) that his date for a benefit party had canceled on him and he's not going because he doesn't want to go alone. The line is delivered with the same stinted, cookie-cutter way it was written. So perhaps I should be singing kudos to the actors for delivering exactly what the script dictated empty emotions and lost, plaintively hollow words. The story was lacking and clichéd to the point that I couldn't even have any sympathy for the plight of the characters. Charlotte was a caricature of a fey faerie, not a stretch for Ryder, and Will was a caricature of a rags to riches playboy, not a stretch for Gere.The *only* thing that kept me sitting in the theatre were the air conditioning and comfortable seats and the occasional bit of lovely cinematography. There weren't many images that were Wow, but there were a few, and that somehow made the $4.50 I spent on the movie *almost* worthwhile.
