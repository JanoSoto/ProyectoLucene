I begged my mom to let me see it in the movie theaters. But I never saw it in the theaters. But my grandma and grandpa had bought it on DVD, so when I was at their house one day, I decided to watch it, thinking I'd love it.Now I am saying this for every person who still has even an ounce of sanity left. THAT WAS BY FAR THE STUPIDEST MOST BORING MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!! What a waste of my time! The acting was OK, but some of it was bogus! The special effects was just plain fake!! There was no action in it, or at least not enough for me! I was COMPLETELY disappointed!! I hated the fact that Uncle Ben died. I didn't think that was necessary! As the time passed on I started getting bored. I kept glancing at the clock, and started reading books, and almost fell asleep. When it was over, I hurried up and turned the DVD player off and turned nickelodeon on. I kept telling myself how silly of me to think that it would be, like Spy Kids, interesting and fun and action-packed. I actually thought that! Boy, was I wrong! Those of you who still have some sanity left, take my advice and don't waste your money to buy the DVD. My dad bought the DVD 'cause he liked it, but I didn't like the idea of owning the movie. My brother liked it(although he was only 3 at the time)and then he kept on annoying me with his obsessiveness with the movie. Good thing we lost the stupid movie! But the sequel looks a lot better!! I just hope I don't get bored again!If you like this movie, I recommend Harry Potter1 & 2(16\/10;27\/10), Spy Kids1, 2 &3(110+\/10;210++\/10;310+++\/10) and 13 Going On 30(9\/10).Over all, this is my rating for the movie -100\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I saw the trailer of this movie and was expecting a very interesting and action-filled masterpiece.

This movie can't please anyone, but which movie can?There were some rather good psychiatric thrillers in last ten years (like Final Analysis), and this one isn't better or worse.  So if you like psychiatrists included in crime - as victims, witnesses, investigators, forensics, this is O.K. for you.  If you don't mind sex or murder in a movie, but prefer first, you have a good proportion here.  And I don't mind some car chasing if it's not the main point of the movie.  There are some dozens of broken cars, but in just one (long) sequence, so if it's not enough for you, don't start watching.  If you like violence, shooting, fighting, this one is definitively not for you.I saw a 134' version on TV - is it short or long one?  It didn't seem to be cut.  Willis&March scenes were beautiful, one of the most beautiful and most erotic for me (but everybody has his own scale that depends on what he likes both in movies and in life, his feelings, behaviour, religiosity, sexual orientation, culture etc so it's useless to compare them).I knew who the killer was about half a minute after he appeared on screen, but the motive was hidden till the end, and that's what surprised me.  But after reading so many Agatha Christie's and watching so many who-did-it movies (and so many with psychiatry included) I usually guess quickly. There was one thing I didn't expect.  When a private detective, doctor, taxi driver or anyone out of police starts investigating he is always more clever and more successful than the policemen.  But here, though Willis leads his investigation, it's Martinez who keeps everything (including Willis) under control.  It hasn't been shown or said, but it seems obvious that he gave informations to Willis (telling them himself or sending Anderson to do it) when he found it convenient and when it was helping him.  So Willis is not such a super-hero he (and most other amateur detectives in this genre) usually is.  And I like Willis more in such type of a role; for years I didn't watch his movies because he was supposed to be only an action hero.  Bakula is O.K. like always (how should a psychiatrist look like?).  March had more interesting character in The Lover, the script didn't get her much chance here, but she did very good what she was expected to do.  The therapy group maybe looks like Dear John group, some characters (Clark!) are stereotypes. but people like them exist (though a therapist with such a group probably wouldn't wait to be killed, he'd do it himself).This film is not bad at all, it is between good and very good, but only if your answers on my if-s are positive.

So Willis is not such a super-hero he (and most other amateur detectives in this genre) usually is.

Bakula is O.K. like always (how should a psychiatrist look like?).  March had more interesting character in The Lover, the script didn't get her much chance here, but she did very good what she was expected to do.  The therapy group maybe looks like Dear John group, some characters (Clark!) are stereotypes. but people like them exist (though a therapist with such a group probably wouldn't wait to be killed, he'd do it himself).This film is not bad at all, it is between good and very good, but only if your answers on my if-s are positive.

This movie can't please anyone, but which movie can?There were some rather good psychiatric thrillers in last ten years (like Final Analysis), and this one isn't better or worse.  So if you like psychiatrists included in crime - as victims, witnesses, investigators, forensics, this is O.K. for you.  If you don't mind sex or murder in a movie, but prefer first, you have a good proportion here.  And I don't mind some car chasing if it's not the main point of the movie.  There are some dozens of broken cars, but in just one (long) sequence, so if it's not enough for you, don't start watching.  If you like violence, shooting, fighting, this one is definitively not for you.I saw a 134' version on TV - is it short or long one?  It didn't seem to be cut.  Willis&March scenes were beautiful, one of the most beautiful and most erotic for me (but everybody has his own scale that depends on what he likes both in movies and in life, his feelings, behaviour, religiosity, sexual orientation, culture etc so it's useless to compare them).I knew who the killer was about half a minute after he appeared on screen, but the motive was hidden till the end, and that's what surprised me.  But after reading so many Agatha Christie's and watching so many who-did-it movies (and so many with psychiatry included) I usually guess quickly. There was one thing I didn't expect.  When a private detective, doctor, taxi driver or anyone out of police starts investigating he is always more clever and more successful than the policemen.  But here, though Willis leads his investigation, it's Martinez who keeps everything (including Willis) under control.  It hasn't been shown or said, but it seems obvious that he gave informations to Willis (telling them himself or sending Anderson to do it) when he found it convenient and when it was helping him.

It laughs at something that is very serious, and as such the humor may not appeal to everyone.That aside, this is John Cusack at his best. I never really appreciated his other movies, but this one he pulls off with finesse. John Cusack plays hit-man Martin Blank, a professional and effective assassin who is down on his luck after some hits gone wrong. His secretary, Joan Cusack, tells him his High School reunion is coming up, which he absolutely does not want to attend. After he is given what may be his final hit there, and is already set up to go, he returns to his home town of Grosse Pointe, which is outside of Detroit. There resides his former love, Minnie Driver, whom he stood up at the prom and disappeared from town.You catch about half the humor the first time around, and you'll catch the rest the second time. Most of the humor is very good, especially near the end. A lot of the humor is based on the absurdity of the moment, like the school bully reading poetry after Blank confuses him, Blank threatening his psychiatrist whom he drives crazy by threatening, the convenience store cashier playing Doom II oblivious to all hell breaking lose around him (there's double irony to that statement if you've actually played a Doom game), or Grocer (Dan Aykroyd) menacing Blank with his gun concealed in a brown paper bag, as Blank menaces Grocer with his gun concealed under a napkin. Some of the humor does fall flat, like Blank telling people he is an assassin and them shrugging it off as a joke (it gets old after a while).The line 'It's not me.' is way overused, but makes a glorious comeback as the final shootout begins.All the actors do a wonderful job, but could be better. Minnie Driver is convincing but nowhere near the caliber of the other actors, who fit their roles seemlessly. Her role is well scripted, but could be much better since they do a horrible job of transitioning her from hatred of Blank to Puppy love of Blank. Aykroyd fits his role especially well as the neurotic hit-man, and John Cusack is absolutely convincing as Blank.My only real qualm is that there are a lot of unanswered questions. By the end we still don't know Blank's life story, We don't know what happened to his mother, we don't really know what the hit on the final target (I won't reveal who) is all about, and we don't really know what the feds are trying to do (are they on Gorcers side?, do they want to catch both?, what is their purpose really?).Other than that, it's a solid movie that, while not for everyone, is well executed and hilariously funny.8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2004","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Before you watch this movie, realize that this is an absurdist movie much like Dr. Strangelove or Catch-22.

All of the criticisms one could make, cheesy sets, goofy acting, night one minute day the next, etc. give it a special charm. And since it is only 80 minutes, you can survive it!

It is extraordinary that such films were created about an alien monster that is a hunter with such a unique personality! I like the Predator movies because of the fact of what I mentioned above, the great stars that the movies consist of which a lot of the actors are really big men, the action is incredible, the special effects are phenomenal, and the music is just tremendous! In My opinion this score by Alan Silvestri is a classic and is one of the greatest ever! Below is an in-depth review of the characters in Predator!Arnold Schwarzenegger as Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer - Dutch is an intelligent muscular man. He has fought in other wars and this Guerilla battle that he and his team fought was no simple task. After the deaths of Hawkins and Blain and what Mac described to him what he saw Dutch knew to take this situation with extreme caution. Carl Weathers as Major George Dillon - The muscular Dillon is one Dutch's best friends. He joins Dutch and his team. Bill Duke as Sergeant 'Mac' Eliot - Though Mac maybe a nice guy but he also is no body to mess with. After he saw what killed Blain he lost it and from that moment on he made his own mission to kill what killed his best friend.Jesse Ventura as Blain - Big, tough, and strong is what Blain is all about. With his huge gun nothing stands in his way. Unfortunately what killed Hawkins shot Blain from behind. Sonny Landham as Billy - They don't come any braver than Billy, a muscular Native American Indian. He knows that something not human is lurking around in the jungle. After most of the commandos are slaughtered by the Predator Billy confronts this huge alien being one on one with his large razor sharp knife. Even with one hundred percent courage he is no match for this extraterrestrial beast.Richard Chaves as Poncho Ramirez - The smart commando is really handy at things. He speaks more than one language and can handle guns very well. When he got shot by the Predator's laser he was gone instantly.Shane Black as Hawkins - After chasing Anna through the jungle Hawkins found her but something found him and he just disappeared without a trace!Elpidia Carrillo as Anna - Anna was the lone survivor in the Guerilla camp. She is kept prisoner by the commandos but since she knows that something superior killed Hawkins right in front of her and that his body has disappeared she is asked by Dutch what happened and she tells him in English and is untied by Dutch.R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips - General Phillips, a long time friend of Dutch. He is an intelligent individual. He lets no man back talk to him! Sven-Ole Thorsen as Russian - This big Russian Guerilla is no body to mess with. He can handle just about any kind of fire arm with ease. He shot a prisoner that was tied up after kicking him hard in the stomach. Little did this large man know there was going to be a big surprise in store for the Guerilla camp.Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator - This being and his kind are one of the most intelligent life forms in the universe. The Predator is a giant reptilian humanoid. His visions infrared as he hunts unexpecting victims. He has great fighting skills and can be invisible. His laser mounted gun on his left shoulder is deadly and his right wrist blades are extremely sharp. The control panel on the other wrist is his most deadly weapon of all! I believe that there is other life in the universe. In fact, there's so much that we have yet to discover on our planet which a great example is Cryptozoology but when it comes to extraordinary things such as these subjects the planet Earth is a world of doubt and with that it can't know squat. This is all My opinion.

Little did this large man know there was going to be a big surprise in store for the Guerilla camp.Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator - This being and his kind are one of the most intelligent life forms in the universe. The Predator is a giant reptilian humanoid. His visions infrared as he hunts unexpecting victims. He has great fighting skills and can be invisible. His laser mounted gun on his left shoulder is deadly and his right wrist blades are extremely sharp. The control panel on the other wrist is his most deadly weapon of all! I believe that there is other life in the universe. In fact, there's so much that we have yet to discover on our planet which a great example is Cryptozoology but when it comes to extraordinary things such as these subjects the planet Earth is a world of doubt and with that it can't know squat. This is all My opinion.

It is extraordinary that such films were created about an alien monster that is a hunter with such a unique personality! I like the Predator movies because of the fact of what I mentioned above, the great stars that the movies consist of which a lot of the actors are really big men, the action is incredible, the special effects are phenomenal, and the music is just tremendous! In My opinion this score by Alan Silvestri is a classic and is one of the greatest ever! Below is an in-depth review of the characters in Predator!Arnold Schwarzenegger as Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer - Dutch is an intelligent muscular man. He has fought in other wars and this Guerilla battle that he and his team fought was no simple task. After the deaths of Hawkins and Blain and what Mac described to him what he saw Dutch knew to take this situation with extreme caution. Carl Weathers as Major George Dillon - The muscular Dillon is one Dutch's best friends. He joins Dutch and his team. Bill Duke as Sergeant 'Mac' Eliot - Though Mac maybe a nice guy but he also is no body to mess with. After he saw what killed Blain he lost it and from that moment on he made his own mission to kill what killed his best friend.Jesse Ventura as Blain - Big, tough, and strong is what Blain is all about. With his huge gun nothing stands in his way. Unfortunately what killed Hawkins shot Blain from behind. Sonny Landham as Billy - They don't come any braver than Billy, a muscular Native American Indian. He knows that something not human is lurking around in the jungle. After most of the commandos are slaughtered by the Predator Billy confronts this huge alien being one on one with his large razor sharp knife. Even with one hundred percent courage he is no match for this extraterrestrial beast.Richard Chaves as Poncho Ramirez - The smart commando is really handy at things. He speaks more than one language and can handle guns very well. When he got shot by the Predator's laser he was gone instantly.Shane Black as Hawkins - After chasing Anna through the jungle Hawkins found her but something found him and he just disappeared without a trace!Elpidia Carrillo as Anna - Anna was the lone survivor in the Guerilla camp. She is kept prisoner by the commandos but since she knows that something superior killed Hawkins right in front of her and that his body has disappeared she is asked by Dutch what happened and she tells him in English and is untied by Dutch.R.G. Armstrong as General Phillips - General Phillips, a long time friend of Dutch. He is an intelligent individual. He lets no man back talk to him! Sven-Ole Thorsen as Russian - This big Russian Guerilla is no body to mess with. He can handle just about any kind of fire arm with ease. He shot a prisoner that was tied up after kicking him hard in the stomach. Little did this large man know there was going to be a big surprise in store for the Guerilla camp.Kevin Peter Hall as The Predator - This being and his kind are one of the most intelligent life forms in the universe.
