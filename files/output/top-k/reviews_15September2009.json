At the same time, other non-American born film directors either made confused war-chaser movies like Zinnemann did, or they delivered filthy patriotic crap on the lowest possible level like the Hungarian Michael Kertesz did in his so highly-praised Yankee Doodle (1942). However, stop and think what Capra is showing us in the movie It starts with a sight-seeing tour that leads into the National Capitol of Washington, directly at the basis of American history. But the rest of the movie is dedicated to present the US Senate as a bunch of liars, betrayers and crooks who are as far away from the initial American ideas and ideals as anyone just can get. Hope comes for this continent in the person of the bum-chuck Jefferson Smith whose name is, of course, not arbitrarily chosen. However, it takes even him until to the last minute, before one of the criminal leaders who had misused American freedom, welfare and thrust of the public, breaks together. I would say This is a very brave little movie, it exudes exactly the same miraculous atmosphere of hope even in the most proceeded situations as It is a Wonderful World, Capras unsurmountable masterpiece, does. Such form of non-trivial, non-stupid and non-unnatural form of hope only such a director could inject into his movies who had it really deep in his heart.
