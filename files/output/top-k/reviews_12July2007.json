Between his latest, Perfume, his short in Paris, je t'aime, and the wonderful directing of Heaven from the late Kieslowski's script, I must say he is unafraid to use any technical ingenuity he can think of. This type of delving into mixed genres and cinematic senses needs to start somewhere though, and that start is Lola rennt. This film is an adrenaline rush for the entire duration being driven by the pulsating techno\/electronica beats behind all the action. From straight film to animation to freeze-frame montages of photographs, Tykwer never lets the viewer get bored. Even the script stays witty and poignant at the same time, portraying the love between our two leads as well as the crazy situation they have been thrust into. The film knows it is unbelievable, yet never uses it as a crutch. It shows us early what we are to expect and it never disappoints.The crux of the story is that Lola's boyfriend Manni has lapsed during his getaway from selling stolen cars. He gets scared on the subway when he sees the cops and accidentally leaves his bag of 100,000 marks on his seat to be stolen by a street bum. Blaming Lola for not being where she was supposed to be to pick him up, he calls her for any ideas on how to save his own skin. The problem, though, is that he needs to get the money before twenty minutes are up or his boss will kill him. Here begins the film and Lola's running to get the money from her bank manager father before Manni holds up the grocery store he is at. During her journey, she passes strangers and learns secrets from people she thought loved her. Tykwer brilliantly shows what happens to these people in quick-paced montages of photos on their activities in the near future. Depending on what happens when they encounter each other, though, this look into the future is not set in stone. How do they get to meet for the first time more than once? Let's just say Tykwer is not afraid to mess with life, death, and time in order to get his point across of love conquering all.Besides the innovative camera techniques and the humorous dialogue and plot situations, the acting doesn't falter either. All the supporting players know their roles and play them to full effect in order to complement our two leads. As for them, Moritz Bleibtreu fully encompasses the role of the up-and-coming criminal who's fear and lack of confidence seem to get in the way of his lofty goals and Franka Potente never slows down in her portrayal of Lola. Potente is that girl who has rebelled against her more stuffy family, dyed her hair bright red\/orange, tattooed herself, and fallen for the bad boy thug. Despite the lifestyle however, both of these characters are very much good people at heart, willing to do anything for each other in order to stay together. The cut scenes that bridge both moments of time travel help show this humanity. In bed, probably after making love, the two talk about what they truly mean to one another and whether love is true and if it will last after death.Tykwer has crafted a film that was totally fresh at the time it came out. This German gem could be seen as a precursor to films like Crank and The Transporter. By no means are they similar in subject matter or violence and action, however, the use of music and fast editing in order to create a non-stop ride for the audience is prevalent in both. Lola rennt is an amalgam equal parts romance, comedy, action, and thriller, but also a 100% fantastic spectacle.

But somehow, like the hoola-hoop, as shown in this film, it came around to me and I have to profess how amazing it all works so completely as a hysterical and hyperactive stylized comedy and as an example of homage going through a blender to come out with a fresh vigor. Its interesting this was in competition at the 1994 Cannes festival against Pulp Fiction, as the two of them carry a similarity (albeit the film that did win did deserve it) in the total lack of abandon for adhering to normal conventional storytelling, but at the same time staying rigidly controlled in how to USE conventions to a delirious advantage of making it more outrageous and infused with the best brio possible from the actors.For the Coen brothers, it's taking a big leap from the 44th floor- or is that 45th, with or without balcony- and it one's ready to go for the ride it's a lot of fun while having a small but effective point made about people at work. The premise is pure Hollywood farce an average dim-witted schmo named Norville (Tim Robbins) becomes the president of Hudsucker industries after unwittingly saving the life of Sidney J Mussburger (Paul Newman), and even has a good idea for a big product for, you know, the kids, which is a hoola-hoop. But it sounds fishy to news reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who goes undercover in a not-too-hard way into his office (You're a Muncie girl?!). In the typical Capra fashion- matter of fact very much a mix and match of It's a Wonderful Life and Meet John Doe (right down to the attempted suicide by jumping off a building ledge)- we're given the naive innocence of American optimism, and then the layers shown clear as day of the cynicism, and more crucially the ugliest side of capitalism, undermining the more optimistic aspects possible.But there's always the goofy wink and the very fast and wacky nod of little things going on in a scene adding up to a lot (don't drink that so fast while getting your ear chewed off by Archer, Norville!). And then there's the direction and cinematography and production design and music and so on and so forth, given the jolt of eight cups of coffee and a rigorous reworking of how to go through montage (through photos as well as in progressing the narrative, like Norville's transformation into an uncomfortable egotistical president from humble schmuck). If it weren't so spot-on in its efforts to make pure absurdity at about a five-second rate, then the style would probably become *way* ahead of the substance quick. There's just so much going on with the 'vision'- ironic considering their hero's simple genius in creating practical things- that the filmmakers are about as ambitious, if not more so, than they were later on with O'Brother, Where Art Thou, and going a step further than Raising Arizona in how every character, to a minor degree or keyed to 11, is zany or self-conscious in some respect or another.But they pull it off not simply because all of the departments are rich in pulling all of this together, it's also the cast too. It surprises all the time to see Tim Robbins when he's given a wonderful character to tackle, but it's even more amazing to see how not only is it such a 180 turn from his other well-known role from 94 (the Shawshank Redemption), but that (very) arguably it might even be better and at least matching the range that the Coens go for in their work. He's perfectly clueless and imbecilic in the early scenes as a foil, and then as he goes through his transformation he embodies a Capra hero and, as dumb as he continues to be (can one feel bad for an obnoxious elevator operator?), one can't help but root for the fool to win and stay alive. Meanwhile, Paul Newman plays such a dastardly one-to-two note heel that it's just dazzling to see him play it with just a touch of irony to the old villains of old movies and to still make it his own. And Leigh, adopting the Russell speed from His Girl Friday, is also amusing when she gets the chance (watch her reactions to the reincarnation dialog with Norville during the party), and holds her own against Robbins. And per usual, the Coens flood their film with recognizable faces Charles Durning (his re-appearance in the climax is a laugh riot, fake halo and all), Steve Buscemi (beatnik), Bruce Campbell (newspaper stooge, oddly enough not the funniest side character even with the doodle he draws), John Mahoney (typical newspaper publisher, matching Leigh's vocal speed), and even Peter Gallagher as a pop singer! Filled with enough little visual gags for two movies, the various jokes ranging from nuanced to just plain bad puns, and many of the most obvious in-jokes to old movies told with (semi) straight faces I've ever seen, it's a wondrous work of parody; even if the film won't really strike the viewer too hard, it's hard to deny the love for the films the Coens are lightly yet swiftly skewering. The Hudsucker Proxy was not worth waiting so long, quite the opposite, it pains me to think how long I wanted to see this for such an unreasonable reason. Then again, there's always second chances.

Loved the way Ms. Johnson keeps teasing Michael Caine at the dinner table after they made love on the beach! Also loved Caine's covering his naked self with sand when a couple who are acquaintances with him meet him there. Ms. Johnson does reveal her amateurish acting skills when she attempts to confess her affair with a middle-age man (without IDing him) to Caine's best friend and her father, Joseph Bologna, but maybe she's supposed to sound like that. Anyway, this was a leisurely sex-romantic-travelogue comedy with some witty lines and visual touches provided by co-writer Larry Gelbart and director Stanley Donen. Also making the most of her part is Valerie Harper as Caine's wife who's considering a divorce.

One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a normal guy as our hero. Now I won't pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from &#150; if you rely totally on technology then you'll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you'll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980's, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar man's man type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (ladies & gentlemen); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans' ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start &#150; John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist &#150; the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between man's man and new man &#150; a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a quick-draw style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid buddy; Godunov is a real physical threat &#150; even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced.

But,for vascular surgeon Richard Kimble(Harrison Ford),life could be better. This is due to Richard Kimble being a rich,successful,and respected vascular surgeon. On top of that,Richard Kimble has a beautiful wife with whom he has a loving relationship with,Helen (Sela Ward). This has made Richard Kimble's life perfect,and given Kimble what most people dream for\/of.But,one night,everything perfect and wonderful in the life of Richard Kimble suddenly comes to an end. This is when Richard Kimble comes home,only to discover that his beloved Helen is being murdered by a man with a prosthetic arm. And then,before Richard Kimble knows it,he is falsely convicted for the murder of his wife. The result? Kimble being sentenced to Death Row.However,one night,a stroke of fate steps in for Richard Kimble. This stroke of fate allows Richard Kimble to escape imprisonment,and allows Kimble to return to Chicago(his hometown)to solve the murder of his wife. Richard Kimble has several loyal,trusted and respected friends\/colleagues. Because of this,Kimble has a very strong chance at solving the murder of his wife,and bringing the people who are responsible for it to justice. But,the Chicago Police and the United States Marshals have a tight watch over Richard Kimble. This complicates Kimble trying to solve the murder of his wife and bringing the people who are responsible for it to justice. On top of that? The man leading the case against Richard Kimble is Samuel Gerard(Tommy Lee Jones),a United States Marshal who's determination and obsession in finding Richard Kimble is aided by his intelligence.The only things that will tell who is able to win the whole case between Richard Kimble and his friends\/colleagues and Samuel Gerard and his team of United States Marshals,alongside the Chicago Police Department? Time,decisions,and intelligence.The script for The Fugitive is a bit unarranged,and could have been easily fixed by director Andrew Davis before its release. But,other than that,The Fugitive is a well-written film and adaptation. Based off of a 1960's television series created by the late Roy Huggins (RIP),The Fugitive succeeds in taking the television show that it based off of,and keeping several elements of the show,remaining true and original without recycling the show. There are a lot of original elements to The Fugitive,which helps it out a lot,at the same time. And,despite the fact that the script for The Fugitive happens to be a bit unarranged,it does a good job at documenting Richard Kimble trying to solve the murder of his wife,and the case being lead against Kimble. The way that everything leads up to another is perfectly arranged. At the same time,The Fugitive successfully takes crime drama,action,and plenty of chemistry,alongside a small amount of humor,and blending it all together in one.There are also a lot of strong performances that are to be found in The Fugitive. In Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble,Ford turns in a richly executed performance. This is by Harrison Ford understanding how his character of Richard Kimble is feeling,and bringing Kimble's feelings to life. The beauty of it? Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble does not find Ford portraying Kimble as a big,tough guy who's enemies better look out for themselves. Harrison Ford's performance as Richard Kimble paints a picture of Kimble as a smart and laid-back man,who is just trying to solve his wife's murder and bring the people responsible for it to justice. What makes this performance tick is viewers seeing that Richard Kimble is no tough guy whatsoever--letting the plot and script have an interesting and creative twist to them. In Tommy Lee Jones's performances as Samuel Gerard,Jones understands how Gerard feels about the case of Richard Kimble,and Gerard's determination and obsession to find Kimble,alongside the intelligence of Gerard. This keeps The Fugitive moving along well at a well-structured and constructed pace. It helps viewers of The Fugitive clearly know and understand the two sides of the story. Anytime a scene in The Fugitive calls for humor out of Tommy Lee Jones' performance of Samuel Gerard,Jones takes the humor and brings it to life,allowing the humor to be worthwhile and viewers of The Fugitive have a few laughs. All of these elements all work not only being blended together,but also for the scenes in this film that feature both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones and the scenes with action (the action here is well-mixed in with the script;it is fitting and suitable,but does not push itself a mile to being an action film,on behalf of the way it is arranged in the script for The Fugitive and the performances in the scene with the action).It is also worth noting that even though you will only find Sela Ward through a small half of The Fugitive,Ward's performance as Helen Kimble is one of the film's highlights. Why? In Sela Ward's performance as Helen Kimble,Ward puts a good amount of compassion into her scenes,and even though very little,emotion when it is called for (You'll know what I mean.....). Sela Ward's performance of Helen Kimble contribute to The Fugitive being as good and successful as it turned out to be. It also succeeds in allowing viewers of The Fugitive know how Richard Kimble feels as they watch Richard solve Helen's murder. All of this allows The Fugitive to fully come together,and be the good and successful film that it turned out to be.Overall,whether you have or have not watched the television show that The Fugitive is based off of,if you enjoy crime drama films and enjoy a film with a good cast and good acting (most of the cast here is obscure,but they are all great actors who are perfect in their roles here),The Fugitive is the film is for you.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 July 2007","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Truth be told,the job of a vascular surgeon is not the most pleasant job that there is to be found out there.

No question about it. He stylizes the film with momentary flashbacks and slow motion -- but just enough. Not so much as to interfere with the narrative or attract attention to the director. And the photography, as is usual in his films, is truly splendid. Coney Island never looked quite so inviting, at least not for the last fifty years or so.The story -- the best high school basketball player being tempted with all sorts of material benefits to sign up for prestigious schools -- gives Lee a chance to indulge his fascination with basketball. I must admit that basketball never fascinated me. When I was a kid there was nothing but baseball. But, now, it seems that instant gratification trumps patience. Who wants to wait for the pitcher to dig his cleated shoe into the mound, remove his hat and wipe the sweat from his brow, acknowledge signals from the catcher, glance at first base, the wind up, the pitch, the call -- yawn. Basketball is all motion by regulation.Still, White Men Can't Jump was a pretty good movie about basketball. And He Got Game doesn't have that much basketball in it, and nothing at all that's technical. It's chiefly a story of Ray Allen, who must choose a lesser school or see his father (Denzel Washington) go back to Attica. And it's the story of the relationship between Washington, who accidentally offed his wife, and Allen, who despises his father. There isn't really a boring moment in it, although, to be sure, it wanders all over the place and explores, however briefly and unsatisfactorily, a number of issues and the conflicts they generate.Lee has chosen to use Aaron Copeland's music to provide a symphonic score that is curiously at odds with the lives we're watching. The visuals get down on their knees and sob for hip hop. Yet the score is appropriate because it helps to universalize a story that otherwise might seem locked into too narrow a cultural setting.Ray Allen, sports figure, can't act very well. He's an object of envy anyway. Full of principle, for one thing. Old Denzel's future would have been lost the moment that Italian salesman offered me the two-million dollar platinum watch. Also, is there a greater imaginable thrill on Planet Earth than getting it on with Rosario Dawson while in the cage of one of those giant swings in the amusement park? Denzel Washington gives one of his best performances and the others are easily up to par, especially Bill Nunn as Allen's new Dad who is unable to see any future that doesn't include diamond pinkie rings and a new Lexus. He's hilarious.I've always been chary of Spike Lee since Do the Right Thing, which closes with admonishments from Martin Luther King, Jr., and Malcom X -- in that climactic order. The last words were by any means necessary. When the goal to be achieved is something as vague and general as freedom or democracy, using any means you consider necessary can get you into trouble. Instead of achieving freedom you're liable to achieve jail, and instead of achieving democracy you're liable to achieve a somebody else's civil war. There are sentiments that belong on bumper stickers and nowhere else.However, Lee's films generally have been far from rabble rousers, and He Got Game is no exception. It's a well-done drama with a couple of clunkers in it. (A magic basketball sails all the way from Attica's exercise yard to the court at Big State University.)

Police Chief Martin Brody fears it may be sharks but is told to keep his mouth shut. Soon the creature strikes again, and now he decides to take matters into his own hands and go find and kill what may be the largest shark the world has ever seen.Let's get the problems out of the way first, because I feel as though Jaws, while very decent, isn't as scary as people say it is. Jaws genuinely made people afraid to go out in the water..in 1975. The movie itself does not age well and doesn't hold up to a more modern audience of today, although it still manages to send a chill or two down the spine.Besides not holding up well over time, this movie tends to go too long. Running at a span over a little over two hours, there's a lot that could have been cut out to make it a smooth shark movie. Some of it was character development, and I understand that, but some of it were scenes that felt stapled on or just felt out of place. The scene where the three men sing together comes to mind. Not to mention some of them were repeats of scenes produced earlier. Mainly most of the flaws were in that second half, once Brody and crew go to find the shark.But the first half is one hell of a ride from the quiet opening scene of a teenage girl being attacked while swimming, to the less subtle but more terrifying scene of a boy being swallowed completely while on a raft in broad daylight. Plus the shot of everyone running and screaming out of the water is historic, among other things. Jason or Freddy can't make THAT many people run away from them. Well, Jason did, but it was a bunch of kids. And you could feel sympathy for the creature, it's just doing what comes natural. But they won't let you. This shark will eat you if you go into the water, it's an eating machine!This movie also made me feel for the characters involved. Whether it was the main star, who just wanted to help everyone but didn't have the respect or the support, or the shark expert, or even crazy man Quint. All characters had something about them to make you genuinely care whether or not Jaws had them for lunch or not. It built them all up solidly, even Quint who before he went after the shark didn't have much screen time. This movie, even though it was PG, managed to throw in some gore. It's a killer shark, he's not going to be clean. Gushing blood, severed arm, severed head and a guy gets chewed up. Pretty good for a PG, and quite surprising given the MPAA's strict standards, which were even stricter to horror back then.I would go as far as to say that Jaws is 2\/3 of one of the greatest horror films ever made. There are some genuinely terrifying moments, a pretty good adventure story thrown in, but there is 1\/3 that could have been cut and just feels unneeded. However, I strongly recommend Jaws, because it's still quite good and this is a historically important film. If you haven't seen it, crawl out from the rock you've been living under and watch it.Rating **** of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"12 July 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Starring Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody Robert Shaw as Quint Richard Dreyfuss as Matt HooperPlot There's something out in the waters of Amity Island killing people and eating them alive.

This shark will eat you if you go into the water, it's an eating machine!This movie also made me feel for the characters involved. Whether it was the main star, who just wanted to help everyone but didn't have the respect or the support, or the shark expert, or even crazy man Quint. All characters had something about them to make you genuinely care whether or not Jaws had them for lunch or not. It built them all up solidly, even Quint who before he went after the shark didn't have much screen time. This movie, even though it was PG, managed to throw in some gore. It's a killer shark, he's not going to be clean. Gushing blood, severed arm, severed head and a guy gets chewed up. Pretty good for a PG, and quite surprising given the MPAA's strict standards, which were even stricter to horror back then.I would go as far as to say that Jaws is 2\/3 of one of the greatest horror films ever made. There are some genuinely terrifying moments, a pretty good adventure story thrown in, but there is 1\/3 that could have been cut and just feels unneeded. However, I strongly recommend Jaws, because it's still quite good and this is a historically important film. If you haven't seen it, crawl out from the rock you've been living under and watch it.Rating **** of ***** ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"12 July 2007","score":"24 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":" To fans of early horror, director F.W. Murnau is best known for 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens,' his chilling 1922 vampire film, inspired by Bram Stoker's famous novel. However, his equally impressive 'Faust' is often overlooked, despite some remarkable visuals, solid acting, a truly sinister villain, and an epic tale of love, loss and evil. The story concerns Faust (Gösta Ekman), an old and disheartened alchemist who forms a pact with Satan's evil demon, Mephisto (Emil Jannings). As God and the Devil wage a war over Earth, the two opposing powers reach a tentative agreement the entire fate of Mankind will rest on the soul of Faust, who must redeem himself from his selfish deeds before the story is complete.Relying very heavily on visuals, 'Faust' contains some truly stunning on screen imagery, most memorably the inspired shot of Mephisto towering ominously over a town, preparing to sow the seeds of the Black Death. A combination of clever optical trickery and vibrant costumes and sets makes the film an absolute delight to watch, with Murnau employing every known element &#150; fire, wind, smoke, lightning &#150; to help produce the film's dark tone. Double exposure, in which a piece of film is exposed twice to two different images, is used extremely effectively, being an integral component in many of the visual effects shots. In fact, aside perhaps from Victor Sjöström's 'Körkarlen (1921),' I can't remember double exposure being used to such remarkable effect.It's often difficult to judge performances in a silent film, but I've certainly got a generally positive attitude towards the acting in 'Faust.' I was particularly astonished by Gösta Ekman, whose character, given limitless evil control, is transformed from a withering old man to a handsome youth. Despite my impression that two different actors had been used, it seems that Ekman convincingly portrayed both the old and young man, which is a credit to both the actor and Murnau's make-up department (namely, Waldemar Jabs). Emil Jannings plays Mephisto with a sort of mysterious slyness, always one step ahead and always up to no good. Whilst I wasn't completely blown away by young actress Camilla Horn as Gretchen &#150; the woman with whom Faust falls in love &#150; her acting is adequate enough, and she certainly shows some very raw emotion in the scene's final act, when her forbidden romance with Faust sends her life in a downward spiral.'Faust' was F.W. Murnau's final film in Germany, his next project being the acclaimed American romance, 'Sunrise A Song of Two Humans (1927).' At the time, the film was the most expensive ever made by the German studio, UFA (Universum Film AG), though it would be surpassed the following year by Fritz Lang's classic science-fiction epic, 'Metropolis.' Notably, there were five substantially different versions of 'Faust' produced, several of these by the director himself these include a German original version, a French version, a late German version, a bilingual version for European audiences, and an American cut compiled by Murnau especially for MGM in July 1926. Each of these altered particular scenes and camera angles, and often included material that would be more relevant to the target cultural audience (for example, the US version reportedly contains a joke about the American Prohibition era).At the heart of 'Faust' is a love story between the corrupted title character and his doomed love, Gretchen. I felt that the scenes when Faust is trying to coax Gretchen into loving him were the slowest parts of the film, much less exciting and invigorating than the darker and more effects-driven sequences that preceded and followed it. Nevertheless, F.W. Murnau's 'Faust' is an absolute gem of 1920s silent horror, and anybody who doesn't look out for it is very surely missing out on something special.

The dark and horrible images of New York City are captured beautifully on camera. The footage taken from the Taxi Cab is brilliant, giving us the feeling we are driving that cab. The viewer gets the feeling that they are seeing and even feeling everything that is happening. Absolutely brilliant camera work! The story is brilliant. It focuses around the actions of a disturbed individual (Robert De Niro) who drives a Taxi cab during the most dismal times in New York City. The result, is an increasingly growing anger for all the filth and scum that he sees around him living in the city.Robert De Niro portrays a psychotic and isolated Taxi Driver named Travis Bickle who is a Vietnam veteran. This is, in my opinion, De Niro's best performance in a film. His character is extremely unstable and his portrayal of the anger, hatred, and cockiness in his character is phenomenal. The intensity he has on screen is unmatched by only a handful of performances I can think of. This is Robert De Niro at his best.

Not just his lines, but other quotes from the film that leave you shocked or laughing. Another example, is simple actions performed by the characters. De Niro is not just amazing in how he talks, but also his actions. Small things like when Bickle smiles or smirks and when he points his finger to his head and starts to make gun shot noises is incredible. And the background music at that point is amazing.

It's an engaging detective mystery. Emotions wash over you when viewed as a, if not the, most beautiful love story of our time.Feel your mind turn stone cold, upon realizing, in 1986, Director Lynch and his ensemble provided a prophetic societal X-Ray.It's all in Blue Velvet. If you've looked, you've seen. The Teachable readily grasp Lynch's stark metaphors. He doesn't beard incoherence with obtuseness. The Yellow Man metaphor is straightforward. He's a crooked narc. He wears a yellow jacket. He stings.Kidnappings, vile 'public-private' partnerships - The Yellow Man's supplying of Frank Booth with dope looted from druggie corpses - white slavery, veiled paedophilia, all are well represented in Blue Velvet. As Blue Velvet was crafted, the press stupidly quacked and pols self-servingly gushed of how Yuppie biz prowess would benefit society. Twenty years tells the tale. Bloated Hole-i-garchs use public 'partners' to loot a shrinking middle class of dwindling wealth and liberty.Catherine Austin Fits states she read a thousand books in three years, to try to make sense of her ordeal by Judicial Terrorism. Like Jeffrey Beaumont, she saw things that others wished she hadn't. Thugs 'partner' with Court and other public officials to commit Judicial Terrorism - described as 'devious, deviant, and demonic' - against those who would bring them to justice.Isn't this the same method by which Frank Booth ruins his enemies, via Detective T.R. Gordon, 'The Yellow Man'?Ms. Fits' sage counsel forget books. You're perplexed by baffling, vicious post-modern civilization? Answers await, at the video store.Blue Velvet has them. Performances are majesterial. Frederick Elmes' cinematography projects the subconscious. Alan Splet weaves yet another haunting soundtrack, as masterfully he did previously, in Eraserhead. Blue Velvet holds up sturdily after twenty years of repeated viewings. Blue Velvet is dark, funny, unsettling. Fraught with death and treachery, punctuated by Frank Booth's mental blocking of self-realizations, Lynch's film ultimately uplifts.Laura Dern is a modern-day Beatrice. Frank Booth is Satan incarnate, a perfect representation of those who jacked the planet during the 1990s, and convinced many that poison was nectar. Kyle MacLachlan's hero is everyman, split twixt dark and light. Detective Williams, masterfully played by veteran George Dickerson, is Blue Velvet's balance wheel, the understated hero.

From what I remember, I liked it a lot at the time. I'm not sure exactly how many times I've seen it since then, but I watched it again about three months ago, for the first time in a while, and I still enjoyed most of it, but probably not quite as much as before. I just watched the movie once again, and this time, I still laughed, but I was definitely less impressed than I was during any of my previous viewings.Tommy Callahan Jr. is not a very bright individual, but after seven years in college, he just barely manages to pass. After graduating, he returns to Ohio, where his dad, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory. When Tommy Jr. returns, he soon finds that he has a new job at this factory. He also learns that his dad, a widower, is about to marry a woman named Beverly Barish, and apparently, Tommy is about to have a stepbrother named Paul. Sadly, Big Tom suddenly dies during the wedding, and after this, the factory is looking at going under! In order to save the business, Tommy Jr. must go on a road trip with Richard Hayden, Big Tom's assistant, to try and sell brake pads. Tommy's stupidity will make this mission more challenging, and to make matters worse, he doesn't know that Beverly and Paul are not who they claim to be! Tommy Boy, starring Saturday Night Live comedians Chris Farely as Tommy Callahan Jr. and David Spade as Richard Hayden, has quite a bit of very funny slapstick (a kind of humour which I usually like a lot), but also has some lame gags and cheesy quotes, which brings it down a bit. It's pretty shaky around the beginning, showing the shortcomings of the film a lot. It eventually improves, becoming funnier and looking more promising, but unfortunately, it doesn't stay that way for the rest of the movie. There are times after that when the movie goes back to those shortcomings, and the gags involving Tommy's clumsiness may wear a bit thin after a while. Fortunately, however, all this doesn't TOTALLY ruin it.Some consider the late Chris Farley a great comedian, while others don't think he was any good at all. (Personally, I don't think he was the greatest comedian of all time, but he could be hilarious. R.I.P.) If you strongly dislike Farley and his antics, Tommy Boy is not for you, as throughout the film, his presence on the screen would likely just annoy you. However, if you're a fan of Chris Farley, and you don't mind seeing a lot of silliness and filth in a comedy, this movie could be fun. It may not be as good as some of the SNL sketches featuring Chris Farley, but you should probably still give it a chance.

The script by David & Peter Griffiths just isn't that involving or interesting, it's rather sedate, the action scenes are flat, forgettable & bland while it has the usual assortment of silly plot holes. The plan to blow the FBI guy's up at the end was so intricate & relied on countless things going to perfection that it stretches the films already thin credibility, you can't make a snake slither down someones throat, the snake wouldn't voluntarily slide down someones throat, what about the guy's gag reflex & the snake would probably die before the person. Then there's the scene at the end when two people are engulfed in flames yet reappear moments later without so much as a singe, you cannot slide down elevator cables with a belt wrapped around your hands because the friction would tear through the belt & then your hands like a knife through butter & I wouldn't advise anyone to break open a metal pipe that carries flammable gas with an axe because the axe hitting the metal pipe would almost certainly cause a spark & ignite the gas which would then explode & blow you to pieces. This could have been a great action flick but lightweight action & fight scenes (Arnold never fires a gun on screen for heaven sakes!) along with the unpleasant depiction of all Colombian's being either drug lords, corrupt or terrorists doesn't help it's cause.Director Davis doesn't really do anything special here, the action scenes are dull & lack excitement or any real mindless violence.

Jane Fonda is his eagerly awaiting, fun-loving wife who has found them an apartment for $125.00 a month (that alone is amusing, to think of an apartment in NYc was ever at that price!).Margaret Natwick is her mother, and a character role with Charles Boyer as an eccentric attic neighbor (Mr. Velasco) adds some amusing scenes to the problems of a young couple living in a tiny studio apartment. There are some amusing scenes where Boyer takes them all to an Albanian restaurant, and falls in love with Fonda's mother.Overall, I would not be harshly critical of this film, it is well-written and acted and better than any romantic comedies I have seen since 1989. 8\/10.
