I am normally sceptical on awarding a film on the merits of it's main actor but Caine just oozes menace and really feels like a hard-nut. He dominates the screen but (alongside director Mike Hodges) leaves breathing spaces for the other actors to do act as well as they do. This leaves a feeling of realism and knowing the characters from real life That is not to say that the rest of the film isn't that good. It's all top notch stuff, with the documentary style camera work and use of genuine locations makes for a fantastically gritty feel which goes hand in hand with the sour atmosphere and never lets up. I mean, I can't really believe that Newcastle was that grotty but clearly it was. It certainly doesn't make me feel nostalgic for living in the UK. I think it is mostly the simplicity of the camera work and the fact that there are no flashy visuals that makes it so interesting and exciting to watch. It makes you feel like the whole affair could be happening and probably has quite a few times. Once again, like The Wicker Man and The Italian Job, Get Carter is another example of a great British film's legacy destroyed by a Hollywood remake.

Some say it is because it was the first 'talkie' to win Best Picture. Others say it is due to the amazing phrase its title is (common admit it is catchy). Yet others still insist it is due to the amazing adaptation of the book it was based on. However, All Quiet on the Western Front is best remembered by me as a gritty and realistic portrayal of a war nearly entirely forgotten.All Quiet on the Western Front follows the story of Paul Baumer, a German teenager who enlists in the army upon the onset of World War One. Along with his classmates, he believes the war will be more of an adventure than a war. That is until they are thrown into the trenches and confronted with the horrors of trench warfare and no mans land. Slowly the many teenage soldiers begin to lose their innocence in this war to end all wars. All Quiet on the Western Front is one of those few films that takes us into the lives of a soldier. It does not drop us into some distant battlefield and hold us there until the end. Instead the film gives backgrounds and liveliness to the characters. Everyone is made out to be someone you could run into on the street any day of the week. This is a work of Remarque (the man who wrote the book) and is brought forth perfectly by the actors portraying the characters.What made the book so wonderful was its accurate portrayal and feelings of World War One soldiers. Neither side had a vast majority vicious fighters who sought to destroy the enemy, they were there because that is what their government told them to do. These men were not glorious heroes because of the killing they did but for what they did for each other. The movie (just like the book) shows us that these men are not soldiers but human beings who are trying to survive in the war to end all wars. Another upside to the film is its realistic showing of trench warfare. The battle scenes are anything but watered down. The three or four scenes of actual battle are gritty and unnerving. The slaughter shown is accurate to the point of pain when compared to casualty statistics of the First World War (1,058,407 lost at the Battle of the Somme for anyone doubting that). Lewis Milestone paved the way for epic war battles with this film.Lew Ayres is an unknown actor to me. Granted I don't see many films from this time period but I thought his work as the young Paul Baumer was excellent. We literally see him age throughout the film and are easily able to relate to him and understand him. We understand the pain he suffers, we understand the emotions he is feeling all through Ayres fine acting. I hope to come across more of Ayres work in the near future, he was a great actor from what I saw in this movie.While Ayres gives a magnificent performance he is overshadowed by Louis Wolheim who portrays the leader of the bunch, Kat. Wolheim died a year after making this film and to me this was his best work. He is so close to perfection as the battle hardened Kat that it is almost unreal. His acting isn't like the melodramatic work of most actors of this period. It is as if you were watching an actor out of the present day. The work other than what is on the screen is marvelous. How the film did not win Best Cinematography is beyond me. It won two Academy Awards and perhaps the two biggest (Director and Picture). Remarque's anti-war classic is brought to life and loyally followed in the film adaptation. All Quiet on the Western Front goes down as one of the earliest war films. It also goes down as one of the most intense, most gruesome, and most brilliant anti-war films I've ever seen.

That is not to say that Hopkins and Pitt turned in bad performances; they were both what you'd expect of them Hopkins at turns stiff and explosive, Pitt utterly chameleonic. Rather, it is the ineptitude of the writers (all FOUR of them!) and the director that fails this movie so miserably...and what is there to a movie after that? So much of this film reminded me of Peter Sellers' 'Being There,' but that movie worked with a fluid story, single-minded direction and all spot-on performances. This...well, the story is single-minded, the direction is sloppy and the performances are (at best) spotty. Even the usually excellent Pitt's character is all over the place one moment he's naive or petulant as a 5-year-old, the next he's as omnipotent and stern as a god! Again, not his fault clearly. His performance at every turn is solid, but the turns he's given are just too much. Behind all this is a score that sounds like it's been lifted from 3 or 4 other movies. It sweeps, dips and soars often completely counter to the action on the screen. Nowhere is this more evident than in the last conversation between Hopkins and Pitt. My wife and I were convinced at any moment they were going to be pressing their faces together in a climactic kiss! But, no, it was just a chat...that went on forever. My pregnant missus was laughing so hard, she felt certain it was going to induce labour! The writers of this movie should've stuck to TV scripts. It's clearly what they do best. Too much of this story was too trite, and too much of the dialogue sounded like it was pieced together from greeting cards. The best example of this is Hopkins early speech to Forlani on the plane, regarding looking for true love. That monologue jumps from one cliché to the next, as though the writers stood in a drugstore on Valentine's Day, rifling through a rack of niceties and copying down the insides. I gave it a 4 out of the IMDb 10, and that mainly because it wasn't 'Manos The Hands of Fate,' and did have a pretty solid core cast. But do yourself a favour avoid this movie.

Viewers who require movies to shovel piping hot, sex-and-violence-drenched plot down their gullets won't get this movie; it will pass right over their heads.If you are the kind of observant, sensitive person who can see someone sitting on a park bench and intuit their biography from the way they wear their scarf, hold their bodies, and read their newspaper, you will *hear* all that this movie is saying, and it will move you to tears.Helene Hanff (Anne Bancroft), is a single New Yorker, of mixed Jewish and Christian family. She is a no-nonsense lover of life, cigarettes, hard liquor, and books. She is the kind of reader that every writer dreams of writing for -- she is like a sponge, soaking up every word; she is like a bell; when an author's words strike her, she rings. She is like the very best of interlocutors. Writers dream of having a reader like this to interact in dialogue with their works.When Hanff can't find a book she needs locally (and that she can't find a book she needs locally tells you something about her expansive tastes -- she lives in Manhattan, after all, not a shabby place to book shop), Hanff begins writing to a London book shop, Marks and Cohen, staffed by one Frank Doel. Doel meets her needs. That's in 1949. Their exchange of letters lasts decades into the future.The film lovingly and deftly chronicles the decades' changes in fashion, not just in clothing, but also in architecture. Both Helene and Frank are living in distinctly 1949 dwellings when their exchange begins, and are living in more modern dwellings toward the end of the story. Hair styles, current events, the sound of rock music heard from a passing radio, act like clocks to remind the viewer of the passage of time in this relationship.That chronicling, via visual cues, of the passage of time is just one of the many ways this movie communicates that may be too subtle for many viewers. What the film is saying in these details is this these two people and their acquaintances and colleagues who participate in this correspondence, are investing time in each other in a drastically changing world. As the world spins precariously around them, from the post-WW II rationing in Britain to the introduction of the miniskirt, Helene and Frank continue to be there for each other.There are so many other ways in which this movie tells a wondrous, rich tale that have nothing to do with conventional ways that films communicate. There are no conventional love scenes, or fight scenes. What there are are scenes that, in painstakingly crafted detail by painstakingly crafted detail, build up a story as rich as full fat cream.By the end of this movie, the observant viewer will *know* Helene and Frank in a way that very few movies allow viewers to know their characters. The observant viewer will have participated in these people's real lives in a way that feels almost like watching a home movie.Watch Frank react to being asked to participate in a conga line. Watch the joie de vivre that Helene brings to ordering gifts from a Danish catalogue. Listen to Helene talk about books. Watch Frank as he goes about the business of meeting his customer's needs.The two loudest scenes in the movie are the scene in which Helene goes to a movie theater and watches Brief Encounter, a classic film about a brief, extra-marital affair. While watching this movie, Helene fantasizes about finally visiting London. That scene, and that choice of movie, tells you much about how Helene feels about Frank. Similarly, carefully watch a scene in which Frank reads, aloud, a Yeats poem which ends, Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. There are so many movies about people who are nuts about sports. Movies about people who love guns, or war, or cars.84 Charring Cross Road is the best movie I know about unbridled passion for books, for words, and the kind of intimacy that can take place when one person who loves words makes contact with another who shares, or at least appreciates, that passion.If you don't get this movie, I really think you can become a better, more sensitive, more aware person by watching it again, and trying to hear all it says. To the person who really listens, 84 Charring Cross Road is one of the richest movies I know.PS the film is perfectly cast, and every performance is spot on. Anthony Hopkins has never been more sympathetic. Anne Bancroft was born to play Helene Hanff. Judi Dench, Mercedes Ruehl, Oscar winners all around -- how can you go wrong?

The observant viewer will have participated in these people's real lives in a way that feels almost like watching a home movie.Watch Frank react to being asked to participate in a conga line. Watch the joie de vivre that Helene brings to ordering gifts from a Danish catalogue. Listen to Helene talk about books. Watch Frank as he goes about the business of meeting his customer's needs.The two loudest scenes in the movie are the scene in which Helene goes to a movie theater and watches Brief Encounter, a classic film about a brief, extra-marital affair. While watching this movie, Helene fantasizes about finally visiting London. That scene, and that choice of movie, tells you much about how Helene feels about Frank. Similarly, carefully watch a scene in which Frank reads, aloud, a Yeats poem which ends, Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. There are so many movies about people who are nuts about sports. Movies about people who love guns, or war, or cars.84 Charring Cross Road is the best movie I know about unbridled passion for books, for words, and the kind of intimacy that can take place when one person who loves words makes contact with another who shares, or at least appreciates, that passion.If you don't get this movie, I really think you can become a better, more sensitive, more aware person by watching it again, and trying to hear all it says. To the person who really listens, 84 Charring Cross Road is one of the richest movies I know.PS the film is perfectly cast, and every performance is spot on.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"9 April 2007","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" 84 Charring Cross Road is a luscious, intelligent, delicate, epistolary love story.It isn't for everybody. Viewers who require movies to shovel piping hot, sex-and-violence-drenched plot down their gullets won't get this movie; it will pass right over their heads.If you are the kind of observant, sensitive person who can see someone sitting on a park bench and intuit their biography from the way they wear their scarf, hold their bodies, and read their newspaper, you will *hear* all that this movie is saying, and it will move you to tears.Helene Hanff (Anne Bancroft), is a single New Yorker, of mixed Jewish and Christian family. She is a no-nonsense lover of life, cigarettes, hard liquor, and books. She is the kind of reader that every writer dreams of writing for -- she is like a sponge, soaking up every word; she is like a bell; when an author's words strike her, she rings. She is like the very best of interlocutors. Writers dream of having a reader like this to interact in dialogue with their works.When Hanff can't find a book she needs locally (and that she can't find a book she needs locally tells you something about her expansive tastes -- she lives in Manhattan, after all, not a shabby place to book shop), Hanff begins writing to a London book shop, Marks and Cohen, staffed by one Frank Doel. Doel meets her needs. That's in 1949. Their exchange of letters lasts decades into the future.The film lovingly and deftly chronicles the decades' changes in fashion, not just in clothing, but also in architecture. Both Helene and Frank are living in distinctly 1949 dwellings when their exchange begins, and are living in more modern dwellings toward the end of the story. Hair styles, current events, the sound of rock music heard from a passing radio, act like clocks to remind the viewer of the passage of time in this relationship.That chronicling, via visual cues, of the passage of time is just one of the many ways this movie communicates that may be too subtle for many viewers. What the film is saying in these details is this these two people and their acquaintances and colleagues who participate in this correspondence, are investing time in each other in a drastically changing world. As the world spins precariously around them, from the post-WW II rationing in Britain to the introduction of the miniskirt, Helene and Frank continue to be there for each other.There are so many other ways in which this movie tells a wondrous, rich tale that have nothing to do with conventional ways that films communicate. There are no conventional love scenes, or fight scenes. What there are are scenes that, in painstakingly crafted detail by painstakingly crafted detail, build up a story as rich as full fat cream.By the end of this movie, the observant viewer will *know* Helene and Frank in a way that very few movies allow viewers to know their characters.

She has a very individual, very strong, not to mention incredibly hot, presence and is one of the major scene thieves of our time. She is by far the best thing about My Cousin Vinny, which would hardly be even close to being as worthwhile without her. She is the only reason to watch Just A Kiss. She is wonderful in Happy Accidents and In the Bedroom. In Unhook the Stars, she is a joy to see, not just for her presence and ability to intrigue even inaminate objects but also for the freedom-emblazoned attitude she fleshes out in her character. She is not at all subtle, but she is a realistically subtle contrast to Gene Rowlands, who plays opposite her. However, in this film, Gena Rowlands serves to be the first person I've ever seen who's stolen any scene from the likes of Marisa Tomei. Tomei's earliest scenes are brilliantly fiery, both hilarious and alarming, one of these great instances involving dialogue with other characters while she is in another room cursing and raving into the phone incidentally during the natural pauses in between the other characters' exchanges. But gradually, Rowlands earns our focus a bit more, because I've hardly felt more deeply for many other characters in many other movies.Gena Rowlands plays a mother on the latter end of middle age whose daughter gives her great disrespect and constantly runs off, leaving her to do her paper route. She has a highly serious and successful son who lives for admiration and objectifies his wife. Rowlands is lonely, riding the gentle winds through the motions of life at home. When Tomei, grungy, aggressive young mother, asks her to babysit her young son while she's at work, a new and beautiful relationship emerges into Rowlands's life, giving her great happiness and fulfillment, but the natural interferences and oncoming decisions of life seem to taper it. The scenes with her and the young boy are so touching and full of emotion. I won't explain further into her character or the story that is driven by her, but I will say that what she is is a touching, very very deeply felt characterization of a common, lonely mother of great selflessness, surrounded by the self-absorption of the people she cares the most for. And you will be surprised at how much you care for such overlooked people, people who rarely come to be the lead character in a movie.Though Nick Cassavettes doesn't quite have the intensity or fluently original technique that his father, John Cassavettes, had, he does carry on in the Cassavettes tradition of plain and direct interpretations of reality. His film is about loneliness, and about the sort of person who takes so little from us in return for so much that she gives, and how she is prompted to live.

The first cut of the film was over four hours long, but there was never any intention to release this, and Lynch himself shot scenes which consolidated the final product into a more manageable length.Allen Smithee, a protest pseudonym adopted by Lynch when he disassociated himself with the 3 hour version of this film, is also alluded to in Lynch's latest film - Inland Empire. A portion of a film studio in Inland Empire is Smithee's Room - a metaphorical insight into Lynch's feelings about Dune, and studio-controlled film-making in general.Given the tremendous investment made by the studio, Lynch's general distaste for the final product, the repetitive cliché soundtrack, and the occasionally bizarre use of voice-over narrative in the TV version, it seems more a DeLaurentis film than a Lynch film. Although I am very interested in Lynch's films and other projects, I am evaluating this solely from my own perspective. Despite the great director's poor opinion of this film, I enjoyed it and it is one of my favorite sci-fi films. Frank Herbert, author of the novel upon which it is based, approved the theatrical version, but he had the benefit of knowing what he was going to see. If you haven't read the book, these films can be somewhat difficult to understand. And if you come to the experience expecting something like Star Wars, you should probably find something else to do.The soundtrack is repetitive and only interesting the first time you hear the film's major theme (the Eno composition). The use of rock orchestration simply does not work in this film. Happily, Lynch learned from the experience and used rock instrumentation beautifully in later films (especially Wild at Heart and Lost Highway). The camera work is generally less inspired than the rest of Lynch's portfolio. There are occasional visually striking scenes which will remind you of the film's origin, but there are too many static shots - especially during the action scenes. The soundtrack is easy to explain - like the inclusion of Sting in the cast - this is a marketing move by the production company, not a creative choice of the director. The camera work is much less easily explained. Perhaps Lynch was asked to avoid doing anything surreal or bizarre with this film (sort of like asking Groucho Marx to avoid being funny), or the studio was trying to appeal to fans of Star Wars by simplifying and sterilizing its story.The recently released special edition DVD reveals some very interesting aspects of the production. Lynch's influence, not surprisingly, is best explored in the short documentary concerning the film's design. As an artist, Lynch spent a great deal of time and energy envisioning the material culture &#150; both historical and modern &#150; of each culture depicted in the film, helping to create a consistent and unique characterization for each. This spilled over quite naturally into costume design. The sets and costumes used in this film are really spectacular. The special effects, often derided by contemporary viewers, required a great deal more effort that the synthetic art of today's computerized extravaganzas and, the documentary concerning their production on the DVD is also appropriately respectful.What you will see is an intense visualization of several, fully realized alien cultures whose art, architecture and general heritage are as well realized, if not more so, than in Herbert's epic novel. To fully appreciate this, don't just check out the extras on the DVD, turn down the sound and just watch the sets, costumes, and effects move through each scenes. There is, as with Lynch's entire portfolio, a great deal to be seen. And the acting and direction are fine throughout the film.The longer version fleshes out the stories, themes and intricate subplots of Herbert's book more thoroughly, and maintains a much steadier pace than the cinematic release. Even so, both films, to some extent, suffer from too much story, overwhelming visualization, and a un-Lynchian frenetic pace. The later TV mini-series by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety, but runs about 246 minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design. Lynch's cinematic release, by contrast, rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in pace.PLOT Dune is the story of Paul Muad'ib Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides the Just and his Bene Jesserat concubine Lady Jessica. Combining aspects of fantasy, sci-fi and anthropology, the story follows young Paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung. The plot is exceedingly complex &#150; in both Lynch versions of the film much is left out of Herbert's original work. Subplots abound, but, true to form, Lynch avoids short-cuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voice-over narrative in the theatrical release. The TV version, however, attempts to provide even more detail, and uses voice-over to patch up the areas glossed over by Lynch's script.SUMMARY If you're a Lynch fan and not a big Herbert fan or you don't have a great deal of patience, see the cinematic release. It is the class of the lot.If you haven't read the book, or you are a Herbert purist who will accept only what was written, choose the Sci-Fi Channel version (review forthcoming soon) - but be forewarned - it is very long.If you want something that compromises between story and cinematic artistry, go for the TV version.

Nothing they do shows that they really care for each other. Unlike the Notebook which i read and didn't like i thought the movie was great understanding and had some scenes from the book. This did not. For example, the writing was badly written(for the play). didn't they know this movie takes place in 1958 not 2002? and didn't they know that Landon and Jamie had more moments, and more sad moments. Didn't they know that Jamie asked him about the grave yard and she didn't go. and she didn't have a list. I was disappointed that's all. I wanted the movie to be similar to the book. The movie didn't make me cry but the book, sure did.

Kurt Russell is one of the most underrated actors of all time, but he pulls off Wyatt Earp as none have before. But just when you see Russell making Earp come to life, Val Kilmer takes Doc Holliday to a new level of brilliance! It is mesmerizing to watch Kilmer BECOME Holliday as none have done it before. His manners, his words, his drunkeness, are so incredibly wonderful to watch, that as good as Russell or anyone else in the cast are, you could throw them all away and just watch Kilmer doing Doc. Many people have wondered why Kilmer didn't win any award for this, and I can only say that it is a travesty of the system. There is no finer performance in any role by any one. The Val Kilmer interpretation of Jim Morrison is almost as dead on, but Val just lives Holliday in this, they are one and the same, and it is so real that you actually forget it's a movie. The drunken sweating cup twirl is fantastic, but even before that, when he talks Latin to Johnny Ringo and then just watches as Ringo twirls his own gun in Docs face, is sheer wonderfulness.

It's such a tragedy that John Candy is no longer with us - he was a hilarious guy, and never more so than in this film. What could have been just a wacky, dime-a-dozen bad taste comedy turns out to be a heart-warming feel-good movie with real emotional depth, thanks in no small part to Candy's performance here.Planes, Trains & Automobiles was a significant departure for John Hughes, who was previously best known for teen angst high school comedies such as Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Steve Martin is a cynical, highly-strung marketing executive who is flying home to Chicago for a family Thanksgiving dinner, only for his flight to be cancelled. On the way, he has the misfortune to bump into John Candy, a bumbling blabbermouth who makes a living selling shower curtain rings, and who is on the way to Chicago too. Steve hates poor John from the outset, but manages to rub along with him through the chaos of cancelled flights, shared hotel rooms (and double beds!), exploding cars and broken-down trains, in the vain hope that he gets back home to his family before the turkey goes cold. Of course, along the way, he decides that he doesn't half like old John after all, and they become reluctant buddies.The happiness fades to tragedy when John reveals that his loving wife died eight years previously, and that he no longer has a home - the travelling life is now all he knows. Steve is sufficiently touched by this that he invites John home for an extra-large portion of turkey, and they all live happily ever after. Hooray!There are so many funny moments it's difficult to pick a favourite. The moment when Steve realises he's been drying his face with Candy's Y-fronts, the spooning scene in the motel room bed, the various mishaps with the rental car - these are all up there. The F-word fest when Steve finally confronts the smug car rental clerk is also hilarious, even if it is a little bit incongruous in what is otherwise a family comedy (without this scene, the film could easily have been a PG). Mind you, part of it's appeal is that it's unexpected - it wouldn't have been half as funny if the rest of the movie was peppered with cuss words.Kevin Bacon's scene early in the movie is great - the facial expressions are priceless - but he was a little bit wasted here, as he doesn't crop up again later in the film. I have heard that a much longer cut of the movie exists in Paramount's archives, and I have to wonder if there was an entire subplot involving Bacon that ended up on the cutting room floor. (Note to Paramount a Special Edition DVD release is sorely needed!) What else can I say - it's John Hughes's best movie bar none, and it's John Candy's finest hour too. You must see this.

I didn't know quite what to make of it on seeing it the first time, but it has had the power to draw me back for many viewings.It's the story of Gal (Ray Winstone), a former London gangster, who is approached by Don (Ben Kingsley), a one-time accomplice, to participate in a big heist. Gal has retreated to a Spanish villa with his wife Deedee and considers himself well retired from a life of crime. It is an understatement to say that Don is not the type of person who will take No for an answer.Kingsley's performance is absolutely riveting. He plays Don as one of the most frightening and sinister characters I have ever seen on the screen (and, thankfully, in real life as well). He is so good that you have to rethink what sort of person Kingsley really is that he could so embrace this role.You should not let Kingsley's performance overshadow that of Winstone, as his performance is quite nuanced and in its own way is as impressive as Kingsley's. He is perfect at playing the part of the tough guy gone soft. Winstone has some great reaction shots - in response to one of Don's outbursts Gal gives off a subtle wry smile that says, This guy really *is* a piece of work, and makes you think that somewhere in the past Gal had some fondness for Don, or at least had an appreciation of his unique qualities. Also, in the restaurant scene early on when Gal is told that Don is going to show up at his villa, Winstone's reaction is wonderful to behold.The relationships between Don, Gal, Deedee, Gal's friend Aitch and Aitch's wife Jackie are complex. We get to know these characters at a much deeper level than in your average crime drama. One can only speculate about Don's past, but you feel he has never been able to achieve any successful relationships and has reacted to his rejections by becoming an intimidating bully. However, I don't think you get as far from the norm as Don without having some genetic predisposition. Don is attracted to Gal (at one point he actually says, I love you Gal), but he is also intensely jealous of Gal for being a person whom everybody likes. Don's frustrations manifest in vitriolic verbal abuse and when Gal confronts him with a truth about his concealed feelings for Jackie, Don unleashes the most vicious verbal attack that you are likely ever to see. Truly scary. Gal's love for Deedee is tenderly portrayed - in the opening scene where Gal is sunning himself by the pool, the camera cuts to reveal interlocking hearts inlaid in the tiles at the bottom of the pool. The boulder that rolls out of the hills smashes these hearts and presages things to come. Then there is Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) who is the mastermind behind the heist. Teddy has a smile that is so evil that it's enough to make you recoil when you see it. In one scene between Teddy and Gal you can hear Gal's shallow fearful breathing and well understand the reason for it. Don and Teddy make your common thugs seem rather harmless.The entire cast is first rate. Of note is a winning young Spanish boy named Enrique (Álvaro Monje) who helps around the villa - he plays a small but essential part. Don is suspicious about just what Enrique's role is at the villa, and we are left to wonder about that as well, but it is clear that he and Gal have an affectionate relationship.In addition to the outstanding performances, some fantastic editing keeps this film going. Why the film did not win an award, or even a nomination, for best editing I don't know. Some sequences are pure genius, like the cutting in and out between past and present when Don is explaining to Gal what the heist is all about. And some of the quick cuts between Gal and Don that match their staccato conversation are effective. The rapid fire cuts between past and present toward the end are striking. The music is an essential element; it neatly underscores the varying moods. There is original music by Roque Baños - his musical accompaniment to Gal's fear dreams adds a haunting quality to those masterly filmed sequences. And there are other noteworthy tracks such as Peaches by the Stranglers (that helps make the opening scenes so transfixing) and Sway from an early 1950s track by Dean Martin (that serves as a pleasant desert played over the closing titles). If your audio system does not have full bass, you will be missing the complete emotional experience the soundtrack has to offer.Americans may have some trouble with the accents - turn on subtitles for your first viewing. I have seen this movie so many times now that I have pretty much memorized the dialog. Also, if you are offended by strong language, you may want to give this a miss.At the end we are enticed into thinking that things have returned to carefree living in the villa for Gal and his friends. The broken hearts in the pool have been repaired and all is well with the world. But beneath those patched hearts lies a past that may come back to haunt these happy people. Teddy could decide to come visit at any time. Indeed, we are all trapped by our pasts, every move we make is constrained by our previous history.In summary, I quote Gal from the first part of the movie as he is sunning himself by the pool, Fan-dabby-dozy-tastic.

Don's frustrations manifest in vitriolic verbal abuse and when Gal confronts him with a truth about his concealed feelings for Jackie, Don unleashes the most vicious verbal attack that you are likely ever to see. Truly scary. Gal's love for Deedee is tenderly portrayed - in the opening scene where Gal is sunning himself by the pool, the camera cuts to reveal interlocking hearts inlaid in the tiles at the bottom of the pool. The boulder that rolls out of the hills smashes these hearts and presages things to come. Then there is Teddy Bass (Ian McShane) who is the mastermind behind the heist. Teddy has a smile that is so evil that it's enough to make you recoil when you see it. In one scene between Teddy and Gal you can hear Gal's shallow fearful breathing and well understand the reason for it. Don and Teddy make your common thugs seem rather harmless.The entire cast is first rate. Of note is a winning young Spanish boy named Enrique (Álvaro Monje) who helps around the villa - he plays a small but essential part. Don is suspicious about just what Enrique's role is at the villa, and we are left to wonder about that as well, but it is clear that he and Gal have an affectionate relationship.In addition to the outstanding performances, some fantastic editing keeps this film going. Why the film did not win an award, or even a nomination, for best editing I don't know. Some sequences are pure genius, like the cutting in and out between past and present when Don is explaining to Gal what the heist is all about. And some of the quick cuts between Gal and Don that match their staccato conversation are effective. The rapid fire cuts between past and present toward the end are striking. The music is an essential element; it neatly underscores the varying moods. There is original music by Roque Baños - his musical accompaniment to Gal's fear dreams adds a haunting quality to those masterly filmed sequences. And there are other noteworthy tracks such as Peaches by the Stranglers (that helps make the opening scenes so transfixing) and Sway from an early 1950s track by Dean Martin (that serves as a pleasant desert played over the closing titles). If your audio system does not have full bass, you will be missing the complete emotional experience the soundtrack has to offer.Americans may have some trouble with the accents - turn on subtitles for your first viewing. I have seen this movie so many times now that I have pretty much memorized the dialog. Also, if you are offended by strong language, you may want to give this a miss.At the end we are enticed into thinking that things have returned to carefree living in the villa for Gal and his friends. The broken hearts in the pool have been repaired and all is well with the world. But beneath those patched hearts lies a past that may come back to haunt these happy people. Teddy could decide to come visit at any time. Indeed, we are all trapped by our pasts, every move we make is constrained by our previous history.In summary, I quote Gal from the first part of the movie as he is sunning himself by the pool, Fan-dabby-dozy-tastic. ","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"9 April 2007","score":"","review":" Sean Penn delivers one of his finest performances here as Emmett Ray, who was, or is at least portrayed as, the epitome of the self-centered artist. His art, in this case the guitar, is the one thing the cares about before anything or anyone else. He preserves himself because of the art he lives for. The women who are unfortunate enough to be taken by him are objectified, as he makes it ungracefully and perfectly clear to them that it's their responsibility to change, move, and provide help for him and not at all the other way around. He has a much-talked-about but never-admitted feeling of inferiority to another guitarist, who is quite famous and known as the greatest guitar player in the world, whom Ray fainted in front of both times he saw him perform. The motif of the film is how he absolutely never lets any of his feelings go expressed, keeping them all sealed tightly inside of him, for if he let himself care about anybody else, there goes the thoroughly focused passion that drives his art. The outstanding element of Penn's wonderfully intriguing performance is how he expresses unexpressed emotions and keeps a sympathy and lack of judgment consist in the audience towards such a brutally selfish person.I was not at all interested in the subject matter of this film before I saw it. I only wanted to see it because I am going through a big Woody Allen phase. Woody Allen, one of the finest writers and filmmakers in the world, has a way of writing and directing dialogue so that no matter what off-the-wall one-liner is delivered, everyone sounds so real that you naturally grow to care for them and become very involved and interested in what will happen to them. We care about what horrible thing one character does to another, yet we care about both of them.One of the film's highlights is Samantha Morton, who some time ago stood out in The Libertine, perhaps further out that even Johnny Depp did. She plays a mute girl that loves Emmett Ray unconditionally, and her performance is full of bright-eyed, nearly tearjerking selflessness.Uma Thurman, as always alluring, and Anthony LaPaglia, playing the sort of role one could immediately see him in in reality, arouse anger for us, mostly for the inexplicable care we have for Penn. Sweet and Lowdown is a quick and entertaining detour by a filmmaker who constantly impresses me.

Daman Wayans plays a network writer that needs a hit, so he comes up with this completely racist show which pokes fun at the old black face films of the early twentieth century. The only problem is that it backfires on him. The viewers and the critics love it. This causes Wayans to forget what he originally set out to do. Before long, the black community is against him and the white community loves him. What I liked about this film is that it really was pretty accurate in its portrayal of how white people act.

The cinematography is great. The script is solid, and for once the voice over actually works. A lot of times I hate voice over, but it works really well in this film. The acting is great. The guy who played spud most likely deserves an Oscar for the scene where he does a job interview on speed. I couldn't understand a word he was saying but it cracked me up. Having the tourniquet and needle in the heel of the shoe was pretty cool looking. Though I frown upon elicit drug use. I love when they bring a bag of beers to go hiking. It seems so funny the drinking culture in the UK. In almost every scene at least someone is drinking a beer. The parents are concerned about their children's drug habits, yet they all seem to be alcoholics. I love the club scene. Why they put Ewan McGregor in a mid-drift t-shirt I don't know, but I loved it. This movie takes having for all intensive purpose crappy life and makes it seem OK. The characters are fascinating and you just like them so much you want to know what they are up to even though it's most likely screwing their lives up even more. I love this movie and I highly recommend everyone watch it. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 April 2007","score":"","review":" Trainspotting is a really well crafted film. The cinematography is great. The script is solid, and for once the voice over actually works. A lot of times I hate voice over, but it works really well in this film. The acting is great. The guy who played spud most likely deserves an Oscar for the scene where he does a job interview on speed. I couldn't understand a word he was saying but it cracked me up.
