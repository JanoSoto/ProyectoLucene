Jackie Chan doesn't come to terms with his place in the universe.  Tucker runs his mouth and Chan kicks some a**.  The jokes are funnier than the first movie, and the action sequences are more elaborate.  So, if the comedy aspect is funnier, and the action aspect is more intense, what more can you ask for?Oh yeah, babes.  The first Rush Hour was lacking in females,  we had the kidnapped daughter, and we had Tucker's friend.

One day I was going through my old toy collection when I found one of my Gundam action figures and I remembered how much I liked those shows. At that point, I became more and more interested in trying to find an anime film that is made for a more mature audience. I went out to look for that kind of movie one night and found Akira. At first I had little interest because of the cover (Kaneda walking up to his motorcycle). There weren't many other options, however, so I decided to go for it. That night I once again became hooked on anime. The animation of Akira is simply breathtaking, and the plot is so involving; many adults will have to think about the ending for a few hours to clear everything up. I will not hesitate to say that some people will be turned off by the intense violence of Akira, and many will be disturbed by the powerful story about two friends being torn apart by a force that no one can control.

Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it's kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can't recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is.  And `Planet of the Apes' couldn't have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn't make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true.  It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we've been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good.  But does being able to showcase make-up and F\/X wizards justify resurrecting this one?  I guess the bottom line is, this movie's going to make a killing at the box office. \tIt all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things.  One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before.  He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he's some four to five hundred years into the future.  He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans.  And it's then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here.  Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything.  He readily discerns that there doesn't seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor  He runs.  And the adventure begins in earnest.\tIf this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director's chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,' `Sleepy Hollow' and `Edward Scissorhands' (just to name a few).  But there just isn't that much story here.  It's an incredible journey, to be sure, but it's just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets.  And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!' of the cash register.\tAs the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn't a role that required much emoting.  Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his.  He did and it was.  And to his credit, he did it very well.  Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get.  No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn't make any difference.  He's the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that's all you have to know.\tHelena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them.  Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration.  You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant\/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.'\tAs General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he's played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.\tThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston.  Taken at face value for the action\/adventure film it is, `Planet of the Apes' is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium.

One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before.

He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans.  And it's then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here.  Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything.  He readily discerns that there doesn't seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor  He runs.  And the adventure begins in earnest.\tIf this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director's chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,' `Sleepy Hollow' and `Edward Scissorhands' (just to name a few).  But there just isn't that much story here.  It's an incredible journey, to be sure, but it's just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets.  And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!' of the cash register.\tAs the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn't a role that required much emoting.  Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his.  He did and it was.  And to his credit, he did it very well.  Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get.  No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn't make any difference.  He's the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that's all you have to know.\tHelena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them.  Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration.  You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant\/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.'\tAs General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he's played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.\tThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston.

He is failing all his classes, his parents don't talk to him, and he is head over heels in love with Lainie (Meredith Salenger), although he dates Shelly.  But, an accident involving Bobby and Lainie and Coleman and Geena (Jason Robards and Piper Laurie) causes Coleman to take over Bobby's mind and body, and part of Geena's mind takes over Lainie.  Now, Coleman has to find a way to switch back and get his wife back. But, Bobby isn't so willing to, unless Coleman can correct his screwed-up existance, while helping him to get Lainie.Fave scenesThe opening scene intercut with the opening credits involving Bobby and Dinger (Corey Haim) talking about Bobby's infatuation with Lainie, as well as singing the blues and why Dinger's leg was broken (reason his mom ran him over with her Volvo), the accident scene, the dream sequences, the scene where Bobby discovers that he's Coleman, and when they were having a hard time going to sleep, the scene in the gym when they were dancing to the rock version of Dream a Little Dream of Me, and the closing credits with Bobby and Coleman dancing to the same song.  I guess you can say that I enjoyed EVERYTHING!!This was a wonderfully romantic movie with an original plot. It was adorable, and Corey Feldman was kinda cute,despite the Michael Jackson look, something he was into for a few years.  The Dream sequences wre really interesting, filmed in a strange blue tint. The movie also had an interesting plot, and great music (especially Frank Sinatra's Young at Heart and both versions on Dream a Little Dream of Me.).  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the two Coreys, good acting, creativity, or body switching movies.

It ranks up there with The Wizard of Oz, Watership Down, Heathers, and Titanic.I laughed through this movie not because I think molesting, rape, and killing is funny, but more at the thought of all the fake happy people who were watching this and what they were thinking. The directing was great from the start the two in a car driving through fake backgrounds with nothing but mind numbing music playing in the background...to the Sweet Jane seen...to the I Love Mallory scene... and the quite moving Will you Marry me Mallory scene. I thought that scene was very sweet and I realized the movie was more like a love story.People read way to much into it with the message and should just relax and go with the flow. I also don't think you can connect with the movie if you don't come from the same place the characters Mickey & Mallory come from. You know.... the a nauseating 2 hour MTV video, the so many different types of filming & quick cuts it made me dizzy, it was empty with mindless killings. I think the movie would thank the viewers for all those comments because that is just what it is and wanted to be empty, dizzying, unstable, with no-soul-type-of-movie like its Characters who just don't give a damn. It was the type of film that kicked you in the face, punched you in the groin, spit on you while you were down and then kicked you somemore. It was an art film that threw all the colors on the canvas then smashed the canvas over your head.

So maybe the apes on the planet came from the monkeys on the mother ship instead. This is lots better! It could explain how they turned into gibbons, gorillas, orangutans, and every kind of ape EXCEPT chimps, and this in a very few years.

Perhaps those who have not seen the movie yet can bone up on these thoughts and then see if I am still missing something.1) The monkeys in the beginning are genetically engineered to be smart, so that is why they were able to become dominant on the planet....OK, so one little chimpanzee crash lands on a planet with no monkeys. A whole bunch of years later, this chimp has not only acted like a plant seed and sired lots of other monkeys (of different species, no less) without sex or other monkeys to mate with. That IS intelligent. But wait, there WAS something about the 'crashed' mother ship that the hero finds on the planet...maybe our hero mated with those, but no, they are dead by the time he arrives. So maybe the apes on the planet came from the monkeys on the mother ship instead. This is lots better! It could explain how they turned into gibbons, gorillas, orangutans, and every kind of ape EXCEPT chimps, and this in a very few years. I guess that they were genetically engineered to evolve in amazing ways too. I could go on and debunk every argument I have seen for any part of this making sense, but I don't have all day. The plot in this regard is pure nonsense, and that is pretty much it.2) Humans had developed genetically engineered monkeys on Earth, and these clearly had also taken over, so the hero returns to Earth and finds out that they have become dominant there too. Well, I seem to have missed how this would change Abraham Lincoln into a monkey. Perhaps the symbology was just too extreme and the Old Abe thing a bit overboard. OK, then how did the Earth ape culture know the name of the general on that other planet to celebrate him? It was pretty clear that the hero's mother ship was not near Earth, but maybe the time warp ALSO send him back to Earth as well. Or not. The coincidences really need to pile up for this to even begin to be plausible. And since the film makers did not contrive the plot development to demonstrate any such path of reasoning, I don't think THEY actually had thought it through either. They just came up with a stupid and unsupported twist for the end of the movie. If you really need for the movie to make sense in order to enjoy it, then go ahead and rationalize meanings to your heart's content.3) By the way, it was pretty realistic that a huge and obviously orbital-space-only mother ship was able to land on a planet at all, much less intact. Enough so that the apes and humans on board could survive to populate another planet. Enough so that the engine(s) still work after so many years. Right.4) It was pretty clever for the film makers to suddenly let a tiny shuttle craft become capable of interstellar travel. Even WITH time warps, etc.The upshot is, this movie has no real level of excitement, no plot worth mentioning, no character development, no internal logic, unreliable presentation of core 'facts' to the audience, and precious little entertainment value. The money makeup was pretty decent though.

And, to an extent, Lawrence fits this bill-- few films can match it in the department of grandness. Yet the film is anything but simplistic in its approach to its characters and the themes they represent. Indeed, Peter O'Toole's Lawrence is surely one of the more complex and perplexing heroes to ever grace a movie screen. Just who is this man? What does he stand for and what makes him great? For that matter, can he really be called great at all?Viewers may be persuaded by this lack of resolution inherent in O'Toole's Lawrence to criticize the film on the grounds that it fails to adequately tell us about the person it purports to portray, the British officer of the first world war, T.E Lawrence. But they would, I think, overlook one of the most noteworthy aspects of the film. For Lean never claims to really know who this man was; he never saddles his protagonist with a pat identity or set of values from which we might glean an opinion as to his intentions.From the outset of the movie, in which we are shown Lawrence's funeral, we are told that the subject of this film is a man about whom little can be readily agreed upon. Several men at the funeral praise Lawrence; they call him a great man, reciting phrases that sound as though they were memorized out of history books. Others are not so kind; they refer instead to his oddness and penchant for self-promotion. Still others admit to ambivalence; they never really knew Lawrence, they confess, even though they spent considerable amounts of time with him during the war.Lean proceeds throughout the rest of the film to show us the character of Lawrence from many contradictory angles. He is both Arab and Englishman, idealist and fatalist, messiah and murderer. Lawrence, the film suggests, was a man who was defined by his lack of resolution. What's more, Lawrence himself recognized this; indeed, his struggle with his own duality was central to his very being. At the end of it all we the audience are in no better position from which to judge Lawrence than were the funeral-goers from the film's beginning. That Lawrence accomplished great things cannot be denied. But the man remains a mystery.Of course, Lawrence of Arabia doesn't just examine the character of T.E. Lawrence; it also demonstrates how he affected (or failed to affect) the tribal Arab factions he attempted to unite. In doing so it asks us, What is the nature of a great man? How does he inspire himself and those around him, and to what end? Can one simply will a miracle, and if he does, will it be enough to support a revolution? Those who watch this movie will see that Lawrence did indeed will a miracle. But the end result of his efforts was perhaps not what he had originally hoped for.No discussion of Lawrence of Arabia should be without a mention of Lean's artistry as a director; the film is overflowing with extraordinary images and larger than life action. Utilizing many long shots of tiny, ant-like figures transversing great stretches of sand, Lean makes us feel the vast, brutal power of the desert in a way that no other filmmaker ever has. Additionally, the score is memorable and epic enough to match its visual accompaniment, and the performances by the cast are for the most part outstanding. O'Toole in particular turns in one of the more unique performances in movie history, and every single word uttered by Alec Guinness' Prince Faisal is positively captivating.If you can't tell, I admire this film a great deal, both for its qualities as an epic and its ability to somehow encapsulate a man who was perhaps beyond easy definition.

While the two definitely have feelings for each other, they are bound by several factors that they cannot overcome.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, much like the equally over-rated Gladiator was a smash-hit in 2000. It became one of, if the not the most, successful foreign-language films in the history of films. It captured four Oscars after a whopping 10 nominations and was a real threat the whole way to win the Best Picture Oscar. Critics hailed this film from every direction and most of the mainstream audience has been enthralled by it. However, the film has so many shortcomings that it is destined to be little more than a curiosity in the future. The performances are all weak except for the young Ziyi Zhang. She is the only intriguing character and although she has a very large part, she probably should have had even more time on the screen. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are basically stunt actors that are physically impressive, but are below-average performers and it shows even more in an ambitious film like this. The small details are impressive and Ang Lee does a good job with the direction, but his job with this film is over-rated as well. Many were blown away with the fight scenes and special effects, but many Asian films from the 1950s and 1960s did the same thing with much more limited resources.

These problems hurt Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but what I really disliked about the film was the blundering screenplay that never did know where it wanted to go.

We spend the rest of the film wondering why Weidmann is so cocky toward Kingman and so close-mouthed about the film, but we are rewarded in the final act.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"4 August 2001","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  ** out of ****Hmm, I believe Wes Craven may be the Michael Caine of film directors, which basically means that no other acclaimed filmmaker has made as many bad movies as Craven, which leads you to wonder if he actually is a good director at all(Seven of his theatrically released movies have an average IMDB vote below 5 and are quite deserving of it).  From what I can recall, the only movie of his that I truly liked was The People Under the Stairs and it's been awhile since I've seen that one, so it might not be as good as I remember it to be.  I'm still at a loss as to how he has so many fans, and considering the fact that he's still churning out Scream films (getting worse as they move along) only serves to make him look worse (Carpenter, Romero, and Raimi have gotten over their own respective horror series a long time ago; the latter two also realized that each new film in a series works better when you try something new, rather than just regurgitating the previous material as Craven has done).  Thus, it's with some respect that I say that The Serpent and the Rainbow is actually not bad at all.  The movie's got some great imagery, some good shocking scenes, fine performances, and actually solid direction from Craven (mostly when it comes to a visual sense) so why is it I only consider it so-so?  What went wrong?  The story, while intriguing, is surprisingly unengaging and the movie simply feels a little too padded at times.  The movie's generally watchable with a couple of spooky moments, but it's not enough to sustain the entire running time and the movie as a whole feels rather inconsistent.The plot is about a man named Dennis Alan (Bill Pullman), an anthropologist studying a certain powder down in Haiti.  His assignment is to get a sample of this powder, which harnesses the ability to actually a zombify a person, make them appear dead.  Believing this could be useful for medical science, he searches for the powder's origin.  With the help of a beautiful local doctor (Cathy Tyson), Alan tries to find out what's going on behind the zombifications and meanwhile incurs the wrath of a deadly voodoo priest.   When it comes to stylish visuals, Craven does a very good job at the helm.  For every scene, he creates this eerie feeling of something unpleasant lurking around the corner.  He usually pays it off rather weakly here, but I suppose he thinks the set-up is the best part (and who knows, maybe it is).  There are some very good individual moments in the film, such as the dream sequences, which feature the creepy dessicated corpse of a bride who constantly haunts Pullman throughout the movie.Of course, the scenes that seem to have the most startling effect for viewers are probably that torture room sequence and when we actually see one of the characters get buried alive.  There are even other more casual scenes that have this eerie feel to it, such as the sex scene between Pullman and Tyson (okay, maybe that's not casual, but you get the point).  It's a lot creepier than it is erotic, and you almost get the feeling something strange is going to happen any minute.  Angel Heart, this sex scene is not; it's actually more unnerving.  Another good example of a seemingly casual scene is when Pullman is suddenly attacked by a possessed woman at a dinner party; this is a very well-handled scene.The locations are great and it's good to see Craven wisely take advantage of the mysterious Haitian setting.  The performances are all quite good, which makes it a change of pace whenever there's a well-acted horror movie around.  Bill Pullman is his usual charismatic self and Cathy Tyson makes for a good partner, even if she is underused in the last half-hour.Brad Fiedel's musical score is another fine plus.  It's among his best work to date.  Like the film's look it's stylish, atmoshperic, and eerie.  It does a fairly good job of maintaining some interest during the really slow moments.Yet, despite all this, the movie's pacing is often a slow crawl, and it's never always interesting.  Because of the locales, there were even times I felt like I was watching a nature documentary, and while it's a bit nice to see these scenes, it's incredibly distracting and interrupts any gained momentum.  Along with this, I have some problems with the characters, who are not very well-developed and neither are their motivations made clear.I like the fact the movie mixes science into its ideas.  I also like the fact that it puts voodoo into the mixture.  What I don't like is its serious abandoment of credibility in the finale (minor spoiler here), which features a cheesy-looking showdown that pits men who actually...well, throw each other around.  It's embarrassing to watch, really, and almost a little funny.  It doesn't help that one of the characters has a burned face, but looks more like he's wearing oatmeal.I also do not like the voice-over narration, which further gives the movie a distracting documentary feeling when it all works better as pure fiction.  Believe me, the things Pullman say can be easily deciphered or outright stated in a different manner.  I do not like Pullman and Tyson's constant conflicts with the Haitian government, which also distract from the film's main plot, and I most certainly did not like the voodoo priest (Zakes Mokae) as a villian, since he's hardly frightening; the bride corpse is three times scarier.

From what I can recall, the only movie of his that I truly liked was The People Under the Stairs and it's been awhile since I've seen that one, so it might not be as good as I remember it to be.  I'm still at a loss as to how he has so many fans, and considering the fact that he's still churning out Scream films (getting worse as they move along) only serves to make him look worse (Carpenter, Romero, and Raimi have gotten over their own respective horror series a long time ago; the latter two also realized that each new film in a series works better when you try something new, rather than just regurgitating the previous material as Craven has done).  Thus, it's with some respect that I say that The Serpent and the Rainbow is actually not bad at all.  The movie's got some great imagery, some good shocking scenes, fine performances, and actually solid direction from Craven (mostly when it comes to a visual sense) so why is it I only consider it so-so?  What went wrong?  The story, while intriguing, is surprisingly unengaging and the movie simply feels a little too padded at times.  The movie's generally watchable with a couple of spooky moments, but it's not enough to sustain the entire running time and the movie as a whole feels rather inconsistent.The plot is about a man named Dennis Alan (Bill Pullman), an anthropologist studying a certain powder down in Haiti.  His assignment is to get a sample of this powder, which harnesses the ability to actually a zombify a person, make them appear dead.  Believing this could be useful for medical science, he searches for the powder's origin.  With the help of a beautiful local doctor (Cathy Tyson), Alan tries to find out what's going on behind the zombifications and meanwhile incurs the wrath of a deadly voodoo priest.   When it comes to stylish visuals, Craven does a very good job at the helm.  For every scene, he creates this eerie feeling of something unpleasant lurking around the corner.  He usually pays it off rather weakly here, but I suppose he thinks the set-up is the best part (and who knows, maybe it is).  There are some very good individual moments in the film, such as the dream sequences, which feature the creepy dessicated corpse of a bride who constantly haunts Pullman throughout the movie.Of course, the scenes that seem to have the most startling effect for viewers are probably that torture room sequence and when we actually see one of the characters get buried alive.  There are even other more casual scenes that have this eerie feel to it, such as the sex scene between Pullman and Tyson (okay, maybe that's not casual, but you get the point).  It's a lot creepier than it is erotic, and you almost get the feeling something strange is going to happen any minute.  Angel Heart, this sex scene is not; it's actually more unnerving.  Another good example of a seemingly casual scene is when Pullman is suddenly attacked by a possessed woman at a dinner party; this is a very well-handled scene.The locations are great and it's good to see Craven wisely take advantage of the mysterious Haitian setting.  The performances are all quite good, which makes it a change of pace whenever there's a well-acted horror movie around.  Bill Pullman is his usual charismatic self and Cathy Tyson makes for a good partner, even if she is underused in the last half-hour.Brad Fiedel's musical score is another fine plus.  It's among his best work to date.  Like the film's look it's stylish, atmoshperic, and eerie.  It does a fairly good job of maintaining some interest during the really slow moments.Yet, despite all this, the movie's pacing is often a slow crawl, and it's never always interesting.  Because of the locales, there were even times I felt like I was watching a nature documentary, and while it's a bit nice to see these scenes, it's incredibly distracting and interrupts any gained momentum.  Along with this, I have some problems with the characters, who are not very well-developed and neither are their motivations made clear.I like the fact the movie mixes science into its ideas.  I also like the fact that it puts voodoo into the mixture.  What I don't like is its serious abandoment of credibility in the finale (minor spoiler here), which features a cheesy-looking showdown that pits men who actually...well, throw each other around.  It's embarrassing to watch, really, and almost a little funny.

Instead we get a gripping,character-driven drama which is set against the backdrop of thesummer of '77 in New York, in which the Son of Sam killings werea major factor but hardly the only one.  As usual, Lee does abrilliant job of creating a sense of time and place, with detailsabout the weather, the Yankees, and the music all contributing to agreat realization of the setting.  But the real achievement in this film is the fascinating and even, inthe end, poignant story of Richie, an Italian-American kid whodesperately wants to get out of the neighborhood, his friend Vinnie,who loves his wife but can't seem to get his life under control, andhis wife, who wants nothing more than to please him.  Fantasticperformances all around, and contrary to what a lot of people say, Ifound the direction to be pretty restrained.  Look at Richie'scharacter  you sense that he wants to transcend his upbringing,that what's behind his obsession with punk is that it offersacceptance to someone like him who feels alienated from hisbackground (and who is unsure of his sexuality).  In a lesserdirector's hands, however, this would all have been told to us viacorny speeches about wanting to get out, wanting to makesomething of himself.  Here, Richie never articulates what it is thatdrives him--we just pick it up from the performance, from the story. In fact, there's a lot of inarticulation going on in this movie.  In onesense, it's a study of characters who are unable to converseexcept in shouts and profanity, who don't really know what they feelor why and couldn't explain it very well even if they did.  Vinnie's likethat  his problems largely stem from some fairly confusedattitudes toward sex and gender roles, but he's never able to bringhimself to examine these attitudes he was raised with, much lessdiscuss them with his wife.  Which is ironic, because we get thefeeling all along that she's much smarter and would probably haveunderstood him.  But by the end, we realize that sex isn't his onlyproblem--by the end he's not only lost his wife but out-and-outbetrayed his best friend.  Catch the last shot of his face as helooks at Richie and realizes what he's done  it's the look of a manwho completely loathes himself but doesn't know how to change.Watch Mira Sorvino's performance as Vinnie's wife, too  greatacting, and this should quiet all those critics who say Lee can'twrite for women.  The part is sensitive, nuanced, and deep, and inthe end she's the strongest character in the movie, the one withthe most sense of who she is and what she wants.Great performances all around.  A fantastic film.One thing confused me, though, and I think it confused a lot ofpeople.  This was a film by Spike Lee, but it had no real blackcharacters, and except for the Willie Mays-loving detective, all of thescenes that featured African-Americans were extremely  unflattering.  Brilliantly done caricatures, to be sure, with Leehimself as a black anchorman for a white network, confronted byresentful residents of Bed-Stuy (one of whom has one of the truestlines in the movie  that if the Son of Sam had been black, the citywould have been one huge race riot).  But then later we get all thatfootage of the looting during the blackout.So what is Lee doing here?  Did he just have a great idea for amovie that didn't happen to involve black characters?  After all, Leeshould no more be confined to making movies only about blackcharacters than Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility) should beconfined to only making movies about Chinese characters.Or is he making a subtle comment about how white America likesto see their movies?

In otherwords, Lee is showing us what white New Yorkers were being toldat the time about black New Yorkers.Still, I think there's more going on even than that.  Notice thecontrast Lee sets up in the blackout scenes between the way thelooters were behaving versus the way the local mob boss controlshis neighborhood and turns it into a block party.  Outsiders getbeat up, but everybody in the neighborhood is safe, andcommunity is affirmed.  Is Lee criticizing the black community fornot pulling together in the same way?
