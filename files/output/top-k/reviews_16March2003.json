This is the first time I've seen it since I saw it in the theaters.  And I liked it almost as much as the first time.I'm a 34 year old guy and I look back on the year 2000 and its movies and music with sentimentally like no other year since my high school & college years in the 80's.  And this movie was one of the reasons for my sentimentality.  Like Field of Dreams, it has as part of its many themes, baseball and the bond between fathers and sons - and its just as effective in helping us appreciate how important the (unfortunately underappreciated) father and son bond is through cinema.  But that's just for starters. Imagine trying to pitch this movie to a studio head.  The practice is to encapsulate it into a couple of words - a sound bite  sort of  - to make it 'sellable' for the studio head.  Like a buddy comedy, for the female demographic, dramedy, sci-fi\/adventure, mystery\/thriller, etc. There is no way to do that with this movie.  Its part Sci-Fi, its part nostalgia\/sentimental pic, part cop\/mystery, part thriller, part family\/father-son pic, part tear jerker, & I'm sure you can find more elements.  There is simply no other movie like it - its an original.  It complements Field of Dreams quite well in that it covers the same emotional territory but 'mines' it more directly.  I will never forget where and at what time of my life I had seen these two movies when they were released in the theaters and how thoroughly satisfied I was - they were magical experiences.  The Bravo channel did an episode of  their From Page to Screen series on Field of Dreams, and they spent a lot of time talking about how that movie brought grown men to tears when it came to the heartfelt subject matter of the father and son bond in this movie. Playing catch with your father for a boy is so much more than most women can probably understand.  This movie evokes the same spirit.It was good to see Dennis Quaid again in a crowd pleaser like this - the last time was in  Inner Space with Martin Short and Meg Ryan.  And it really seems to have launched the careers of the actor who played his son, James Caviezel, and the screenplay writer Toby Emmerich.  Before this film, according to IMDb, Emmerich had been the soundtrack executive on many movies.  After Frequency,  IMDb shows, he apparently became producer of many mainstream large budget movies.  But he hasn't written another screenplay.  Makes me curious as to how the screenplay came about and the writer's inspiration and why Emmerich hasn't gotten another on screen.The only objectionable part of the film was the graphic, sadistic visuals of the victims of the Nightingale Serial Murderer.  If they were much more tame with that part of the story, it would have become more appropriate for entire families to enjoy as a classic for many years to come.  In other words they should have gone for a 'PG' rating, instead of 'PG-13' rating, which IMDb says is for intense violence and disturbing images in the case of 'Frequency'.   Otherwise it would have been a movie with something for all kinds of movie goers.  I have a suspicion that New Line and its history of horror film making had something to do with it or that history has made them used to OKing and making that sort of story.  Too bad.  When I know in advance that a movie has those kind of scenes, I vote with my dollars and make it a point not 'patronize' them.  Luckily, I don't think they used any of those scenes in their promotions.  On those grounds I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars (which is only 1 more than the average voted by IMDb voters at this time).Actually, I don't remember it having much of a massive ad campaign.  I had seen very little about it on the entertainment and talk show circuits - oh yeah - I didn't have a TV that year (with the quality of television & media in general it actually was a blessing really).  It was good thing because, I imagine I had the kind of experience that people in the 1930's & 1940's did. Walking into a movie theater back then you had a totally novel\/virgin experience of a film because you didn't get bombarded with commercials and trailers that give away half the movie as you do nowadays.  I always treasure those movie experiences in which I discover it for the first time when I walk in the theater and I'm blown away by the experience of being immersed in a unique world.  That was the kind of experience this movie was - leaving me walking on air afterwards for an hour or so.  This movie deserves to stand the test of time like 'Field of Dreams'.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"16 March 2003","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  I just saw Frequency on its so called network premiere on ABC.  This is the first time I've seen it since I saw it in the theaters.  And I liked it almost as much as the first time.I'm a 34 year old guy and I look back on the year 2000 and its movies and music with sentimentally like no other year since my high school & college years in the 80's.  And this movie was one of the reasons for my sentimentality.  Like Field of Dreams, it has as part of its many themes, baseball and the bond between fathers and sons - and its just as effective in helping us appreciate how important the (unfortunately underappreciated) father and son bond is through cinema.  But that's just for starters. Imagine trying to pitch this movie to a studio head.  The practice is to encapsulate it into a couple of words - a sound bite  sort of  - to make it 'sellable' for the studio head.  Like a buddy comedy, for the female demographic, dramedy, sci-fi\/adventure, mystery\/thriller, etc. There is no way to do that with this movie.  Its part Sci-Fi, its part nostalgia\/sentimental pic, part cop\/mystery, part thriller, part family\/father-son pic, part tear jerker, & I'm sure you can find more elements.  There is simply no other movie like it - its an original.  It complements Field of Dreams quite well in that it covers the same emotional territory but 'mines' it more directly.  I will never forget where and at what time of my life I had seen these two movies when they were released in the theaters and how thoroughly satisfied I was - they were magical experiences.  The Bravo channel did an episode of  their From Page to Screen series on Field of Dreams, and they spent a lot of time talking about how that movie brought grown men to tears when it came to the heartfelt subject matter of the father and son bond in this movie. Playing catch with your father for a boy is so much more than most women can probably understand.  This movie evokes the same spirit.It was good to see Dennis Quaid again in a crowd pleaser like this - the last time was in  Inner Space with Martin Short and Meg Ryan.  And it really seems to have launched the careers of the actor who played his son, James Caviezel, and the screenplay writer Toby Emmerich.  Before this film, according to IMDb, Emmerich had been the soundtrack executive on many movies.  After Frequency,  IMDb shows, he apparently became producer of many mainstream large budget movies.  But he hasn't written another screenplay.  Makes me curious as to how the screenplay came about and the writer's inspiration and why Emmerich hasn't gotten another on screen.The only objectionable part of the film was the graphic, sadistic visuals of the victims of the Nightingale Serial Murderer.  If they were much more tame with that part of the story, it would have become more appropriate for entire families to enjoy as a classic for many years to come.  In other words they should have gone for a 'PG' rating, instead of 'PG-13' rating, which IMDb says is for intense violence and disturbing images in the case of 'Frequency'.   Otherwise it would have been a movie with something for all kinds of movie goers.  I have a suspicion that New Line and its history of horror film making had something to do with it or that history has made them used to OKing and making that sort of story.  Too bad.  When I know in advance that a movie has those kind of scenes, I vote with my dollars and make it a point not 'patronize' them.  Luckily, I don't think they used any of those scenes in their promotions.  On those grounds I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars (which is only 1 more than the average voted by IMDb voters at this time).Actually, I don't remember it having much of a massive ad campaign.  I had seen very little about it on the entertainment and talk show circuits - oh yeah - I didn't have a TV that year (with the quality of television & media in general it actually was a blessing really).  It was good thing because, I imagine I had the kind of experience that people in the 1930's & 1940's did. Walking into a movie theater back then you had a totally novel\/virgin experience of a film because you didn't get bombarded with commercials and trailers that give away half the movie as you do nowadays.  I always treasure those movie experiences in which I discover it for the first time when I walk in the theater and I'm blown away by the experience of being immersed in a unique world.  That was the kind of experience this movie was - leaving me walking on air afterwards for an hour or so.  This movie deserves to stand the test of time like 'Field of Dreams'.

I was expecting a grim story of a war of revenge sparked off by a car crash - a kind of asexual War of the Roses, with more blind rage and less black humour. This is the last thing anyone would WANT to see.I don't believe in revenge. Not only don't I think that the urge for revenge justifies anything, I don't think that there really IS an urge for revenge - at least, not as a stable mainspring of human behaviour. When we're wronged or injured, we want to strike back; to thump the guy who honked his car horn at us, say. But this feeling lasts, what, half a minute? I can't see the desire for revenge for a past wrong (as opposed to an ongoing injustice, like the occupying of one's city by an army) lasting, unprompted, more than an hour, and certainly not beyond a good night's sleep. People who desire revenge for longer than this have to really work at it, and they work at it, I suspect, because we've all been told that revenge is something we OUGHT to want. The desire for revenge, like the need to believe in supernatural gods, is a fundamentally unnatural desire we're told we have in order to sell us something.(It's no accident that, in fiction, revenge is used as a motivating factor mainly in B-grade genre films and Italian opera ... places where formula is everything, psychological accuracy counts for little any old trumped-up motivation will serve.)Changing Lanes understands the true nature of our desire for revenge. Of the two main characters Doyle is more prone to it in day-to-day life, and his acting on it is limited to, when he's under great stress, ripping out a computer terminal when he's denied a home loan which he badly needs (or thinks he badly needs), then wishing he hadn't. That's all. He lashes out - or doesn't - for a brief moment, then the feeling passes.In any case, the story isn't primarily driven by revenge even of this kind, but by misguided practical rationality. Gavin cuts off Doyle's credit not out of spite but because he thinks, and has some reason for thinking, that only by so doing can he recover the file he needs. Doyle - who by now, after maybe an hour, had lost all desire to strike back, responds with a threat partly out of a kind of moral pride (to not want to give into blackmail is not to want revenge), party to safeguard his own interests. After things turn much more sour each party engages in ONE act of revenge each - and regrets it immediately afterward - not so much out of a desire to hurt the other person but out of a desire to DO something, anything, in a hopeless situation. The fact that the two parties are talking to each other and bear no ill-will at the end is perfectly natural. Many people, of course, would keep the feud, which had never really been a feud in the first place, going, but if Gavin and Doyle had done so it wouldn't have been because they really wanted to; it would have been because they'd been told, by films less intelligent than this one for instance, that this is how people behave. It isn't. At least, if it weren't for the propaganda, it wouldn't be.Reading through the comments here the one that surprises me most is the claim that the film is boring. In fact it's the opposite the rare film that is not even a little bit boring. That people can be bored by a film like this, intelligent, well written, splendidly acted by all concerned (note also the supporting players, Sydney Pollack and Australia's finest acing export, Toni Collette), with something of genuine interest hanging on the outcome of each scene, and on top of it all worthwhile things to say, is as incomprehensible to me as it is that people can manage NOT to be bored by something as clumsy, as monotonously bloodthirsty and as empty as, say, The Two Towers.

It's not that important for the world to form itself regarding our wishes, but what is  of any relevance is the fact that we understand that many things in life don't came that easy. As Elliot comes to the conclusion, one can not wave a magic wand so that all things become as desired by an individual.This film conquered me through its charm and the way it actually sends us an important message. It's not even that much that the viewer has to really sense the message because we get it told right into our ears.No movie is perfect though, but this one scores high where it has to. It's entertaining, the actors are, generally, funny and their actions and reactions believable and it has A MESSAGE. If anything in life doesn't have a real purpose, that is if a work of art doesn't have a real purpose and doesn't carry a message, then it can often be a waste. There is of course a difference between the delight of the human eye and the delight of the human intelligence. Anyone can see that. I would dare to say that this movie offers both delights. If there ever were a comedy I would recommend it would be this one. It makes you laugh, it makes you think and it makes you feel good. What else can you ask for from a good movie? Not much in my opinion. There are few movies which carry you into a state of exaltation at their ends, and, at least in my case, this was one of them. This film earns, in my opinion, a well deserved 8\/10   ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Romance"},{"date":"16 March 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  One of my favorite scenes from this movie is the Gimp scene.. just amuses me the whole litle dialouge about get the gimp... the gimp sleeping lol... okay umm sorry.. continuing on.....What amazes me the most about this excellent movie is that it contains great performances from actors and actresses I've never been big fans of.

Occasionally, the second feature (Torch Song, Female on the Beach, The Story of Esther Costello) featured an actress named Joan Crawford, whose gargoyle face was scarier to me than any horror film  we saw. Years later, when the studios released their old film libraries to television, I discovered that, when she was younger, that same Joan Crawford was not only a first-rate actress (Mildred Pierce) but when she was VERY young, naturally beautiful and vulnerable (Grand Hotel). When I became a member of the movie business (journalist, publicist), I loved hearing stories from the old-timers on film crews who had worked with the screen legends way back when.  One of their favorites was Joan Crawford, whom all agreed was the best, most loyal and caring  friend one could ever wish for. In the late 1970s (a few years after Miss Crawford's death), New York Magazine ran excerpts from a forthcoming book called Mommie Dearest, written by Ms. Crawford's adopted daughter, portraying her mother as the ultimate witch-from-hell.  It--and the book (which I had no interest in reading, the excerpts were more than enough)--caused a sensation.  Most of the film people I knew who had known Miss Crawford were outraged, claiming Christina had made the whole thing up to cash in on her departed mother.  A few others simply shook their heads, sadly. When Mommie Dearest was made into a movie, I was invited to a press screening but skipped it when a friend of mine at Paramount told me it was utter garbage (I was never a Faye Dunaway fan anyway, finding her as cold and off-putting as the middle-aged Joan Crawford).  The reviews of the film were terrible, but within weeks, journalist friends informed me that a phenomenon had taken place--the movie had become an instant camp classic, with audience-participation unrivalled since The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Moviergoers flocked to the theaters showing Mommie Dearest, armed with wire hangers and cans of Ajax.  I was amused, but not enough to check it out. A year later the film hit HBO and I finally watched the damned thing.  I wasn't bored, but saddened.  The tale of an an aging movie actress, over 40, put out to pasture by the major studios, and driven by loneliness to alcoholism and then to child abuse didn't strike me in the least bit amusing.  (Nor do I enjoy scenery-chomping performances like the nauseating freakshow given by Miss Dunaway--whom many of my friends had worked with and, for the most part, disliked intensely.) I'm glad the majority of the comments on the IMDB website find immense enjoyment in this admittedly one-of-a-kind movie. I find it clammy, clumsy and depressing.  As over-the-top and shrill as it is, I'm afraid Christina Crawford's account of Life With Mama is, for the most part, basically true.  And alcoholism and child-abuse are not, for me, sources of entertainment. In her later years, Joan Crawford was obviously a very disturbed and unforgivably cruel parent to her two children. Perhaps the most telling remark about the uproar caused by Mommie Dearest (the book, not the movie) came from the always gracious and intelligent Eve Arden (a friend of Miss Crawford's with whom she appeared in Mildred Pierce). Asked by a reporter if she thought the allegations brought against Miss Crawford by her daughter were true, Miss Arden paused and then said  Joan tried to be all things to all people.

This answer was provided at the very beginning, but by the time the movie was over, I completely forgot having seen or heard the explanation, and found myself asking the same question.It's when they're out catching lobsters and Matt educates Natalie's son There's an area in the trapper called a bedroom.  One poor fella (lobster) lost his arm.  That's what can happen when more than two lobsters are in the bedroom.  Two's company, three's a crowd.  Matt then describes the pregnant female lobster.  The older lady, the lobster with babies is very dangerous.  She can take out two males -- no problem.Yes, this movie was slow moving and as many have said downright boring at times.  But isn't that what real life is like?  The average person doesn't have these kinds of tragic things happening.  Movies are watched because they are an escape from our own boring realities.  The difference here is that this movie includes that aspect of our lives in between the rare, horrible things that happen to these people.*********SPOILERS**********SPOILERS**********SPOILERS**************One thing that was very clear was how Matt and his wife didn't communicate AT ALL about the death of their son until it just couldn't be contained any more.  It was like if they didn't talk about it, it didn't happen, or they wouldn't have to deal with their feelings about it.  This was a couple that didn't communicate about anything bad.  I'm familiar with families like that and it's very sad.The thing that I found hard to believe in this movie was that Matt could actually pull off kidnapping and killing his son's murderer.  I kept expecting the other guy to get the upper hand.  Natalie's ex-husband was young, strong and obviously had a wild temper.  In real life, I think Matt's attempt would have failed.  Either Matt would get killed, or he'd get charged and put away for murder himself.  And so there'd be another tragedy for his wife to handle.  Either result is predictable, yes, but, more believable.The movie and acting were very good, but I wouldn't consider this a must see.Mary  ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 March 2003","score":"45 out of 90 people found the following review useful","review":"  I want 2 hours of my life back.  David Lynch deliberately stole two hours of my life with an arbitrarily complicated plot intended to confuse the be-jeezus out of people...the only possible reason he had to do this...because he didnt have enough time, money, or idea to finish this movie.
