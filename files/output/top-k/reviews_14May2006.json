When it came out in 1967, America was already primed for the worst. Farrakhan had predicted the revolution, Malcolm was gone and so was JFK, Bobby Kennedy and Martin were next in line to check out the following year, young black men were being drafted into the propagandized white man's war of Vietnam, and Black America was in dire need of positive leadership. But Guess Who's Coming to Dinner takes a slightly more optimistic picture of the times by injecting a biracial romance into the fray. Over the years, it's come under fire for being too liberal and if the filmmakers really wanted to start serious discussions, Poitier's character could have been something more blue-collar like a construction worker or truck driver. I think what they miss is that black people were just starting to be portrayed in a more positive light in Hollywood circa '67 (with Poitier leading), so WE needed all the good press we could get. Being a sucker for romances, I could care less about the film's racial politics and subtext and just instead be moved by a great love story, and that's what I get here in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. As the film opens, John and Joanna have just arrived back in Joanna's hometown of San Francisco after some time getting sun in Hawaii. It was there she met the good doctor John Prentice and the two are talking marriage, but they first have to break the news to their respective parents, which is easier said than done. Joanna's parents, Matt and Christina (the belated real-life lovers Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn &#150; Houghton is her niece), are both liberal about this sort of thing but still need to work around their underlying prejudices and be happy with Joanna's decision. With John's parents (played by Beah Richards and Roy E. Glenn, Sr.), it's going to be a little bit harder since they grew up with the in-your-face hell of hatred towards interracial couples. In the mix to watch the events unfold, are the Drayton's housekeeper Tillie (Isabel Sanford), who's highly suspicious of (what she thinks is the high-yellow) John, and family friend Monsignor Ryan (Cecil Kellaway). True there is a lot that dates Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and our society has grown more tolerant of interracial romances, but we have to remember when and where it's all coming from. Future entries into the genre would include Spike Lee's Jungle Fever (1991), Something New (2006) and even this film's remake Guess Who, which came out last year with a reversed agenda and no, I do not wish to see it. Directed by Stanley Kramer and written by William Rose, I cannot help but shower praise on Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and Poitier's charming performance here amongst other acting legends, all of whom are white. Though it's billed as a comedy, it has qualities of a dramatic stage play with a tense undercurrent of social commentary. There's something genuinely moving about Tracy's closing monologue, the last great work of a truly great actor, who passed shortly after production ceased. He states the discrimination and outright hatred that John and Joanna are sure to face will mean squat, if their love and marriage are true, and nothing &#150; nothing will stop it &#150; and he's right. Lastly, if I could ever land a date with a lady of another skin tone, I might pop this in and maybe we could watch it together.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Though I haven't questioned it in my lifetime (despite never even having a girlfriend), the thought of entering into an interracial marriage has crossed my mind, but never with the caution that soon-to-be newlyweds Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) and John Prentice (Sidney Poitier) have.

It's been available for next to nothing at the local DVD\/CD shop here for longer than I can remember, and not long ago, I finally pulled myself together and bought it. Today, we sat down to watch it. I must say, this movie astounded and impressed me. From the first frame, it had me. It gripped me and didn't let go until the ending... if even then. If I'm not still in its clutches. The plot is excellent, and the way it's told is very interesting. It develops constantly, though never too quickly; the film never stands still, yet never moves too fast, either. The pacing is among the best in any of the films I've watched... and that list count nears one thousand titles(as I'm writing this, I'm nearing my way to 700 written reviews... but I've got a good 17 years of watching movies prior to my starting to comment on them). The acting is incredible. I can't think of a single performance I found anything less than flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The cinematography is nothing short of amazing. The way they created all those great shots, be it stationary or those with movement, at that time, with that equipment... magnificent work. Fritz (either Lang or the cinematographer, they share a first name) knows his way around cameras, and knows when to use movement... and, perhaps more importantly, when not to. This film has its share of both kinds of shots, and both work perfectly. The film uses the art of hinting to the fullest; something Hitchcock, the very master of suspense, would later employ, in huge thrillers such as Psycho. Shadows, suggestive camera movements, a tiny movement in body or face... things that, in a film of today, would be simply not be found. The silent and unclear would replaced by loud and obvious. One of the most important things to note about this film is how little it says outright... and how much it merely... hints. A careful, subtle remark, presented casually... in place of an absolute. Having recently watched Scarface, a film from the same period(it was released about a year later) which leaves little to be pondered over by the viewer(and much to be desired in that very area), the contrast between an open movie and a closed one is blatantly obvious. There is much to debate over and consider in this film. It reminded me of Alejandro Amenábar - a man whom I very much admire - the Spanish director who also employs few definite truths in his films. It's not up to the director to decide what is right... but rather us, the viewers, the movie-going audience. Alejandro knows that. So did Fritz. I will have to watch more films of his. Another thing is the level of detail in this film... reminiscent of Kubrick, another master of the art of film-making, this film is packed with detail. So many seemingly meaningless, but endlessly insightful little things. A scene that shows shady types idle... a subtle touch that would be edited out as early as during the script-writing phase of most newer movies... characters that are seen once and then never again... the examples are endless. Fortunately, this review isn't that, and on that note, I'll refrain from further listing of them. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. If you can, get a original version of this film... not a dubbed one. No matter how awful you are at the language, it just fits better in German. Just make sure you've got good subtitles... I myself am rather hopelessly poor at the language, and I noticed that many times, the lazy Danish translator skipped entire sentences(though I noticed it to be prominently used words and sentences, that, when uttered and translated once, were from then on left to only be heard, and not seen, which I guess is at least more acceptable than the worse alternatives). This film is full of suspense, and some of the best I've ever seen. Again, I would guess that Mr. Hitchcock took a lesson or two from Lang and this film. I was on the edge of my seat for just about all of this, and I couldn't have taken my eyes off it had the house been on fire. Well, I might've gotten up, once my chair was caught in the flames. Last but not least... the film-noir qualities. The interplay of light and dark, the dreary atmosphere and the tone... all spot-on. The film deals with several very difficult subjects... not to be mentioned here. I suggest you watch it for yourself and make up your own mind about each of them. Lang won't force his opinion on you. For such an old film, this is really not terribly dated... apart from some things that have obviously changed over the 75 years, three generations, yes, three quarters of a century that has passed, but they're really not that obvious. Had this film been made today, little would have to be changed. Sadly, it would not get made today... for many reasons. Unless it was on the indie scene, this simply would not be made. I can't see any studio accepting it as profitable. By today's standards, it's event-less, tame and, well, black and white. Of course, that says quite a lot more about today's standards(which, in my humble opinion, are far, far lower, and, indeed, too low) than the quality of this film, which is impeccable. I recommend this to any fan of Lorre, Lang and noir. Heck, crime, thriller and suspense fans will enjoy it as well.

Whilst most commentators (rightly) praise Anthony Perkins for his astonishingly nuanced performance, many overlook the subtler, more measured work done by Janet Leigh.At first, it seems paradoxical that Leigh could be overlooked in what is certainly her most famous role (one of the most famous roles in American cinema, in truth), but it is that very fame that causes people to overlook the actual quality of the work she is doing. After all, the part of Marion Crane is seen almost entirely in relation to the plot's structure - the heroine who is killed half way through the film, and leaves us and the camera somewhat stranded in the Bates Motel, where we begin to follow the story of Norman Bates. It doesn't help that her death scene is probably the most iconic film sequence yet recorded (the Odessa Steps sequence in 'Battleship Potempkin' doesn't have the pop culture cache, trust me). Who notices the actress when Hitchcock's structural and technical experimentation come together with such incendiary force? And yet Leigh is extraordinary, giving what might be the performance of her career. She'd proved herself a winning comedienne and musical star in the fifties, but often seemed to be left on the sidelines - as in the enjoyable 'Scaramouche' and the turgid, tacky 'Black Shield of Falworth' (which nevertheless shows her at her most beautiful - the improbably gorgeous black gown she wears in one scene is the epitome of 'devastating'). Of the three dark thrillers she made in the late fifties and early sixties, she would be excellent in what amounts to three scenes in 'The Manchurian Candidate', and had been perfectly cast but arguably peripheral to the story in 'Touch of Evil'. In 'Psycho', she disappears after forty minutes, but for once gets to hold the screen absolutely in the time she does have.It's a precise performance that shows no strain.

She'd proved herself a winning comedienne and musical star in the fifties, but often seemed to be left on the sidelines - as in the enjoyable 'Scaramouche' and the turgid, tacky 'Black Shield of Falworth' (which nevertheless shows her at her most beautiful - the improbably gorgeous black gown she wears in one scene is the epitome of 'devastating').

So I appreciate the more modern-era of movie-making where at least we see actors who can throw and hit. This movie is about as close to seeing real baseball as you're going to get very realistic diamond action.

Too often the object of that legal system has been terribly lost in the process.This film has become my favorite Al Pacino role. I don't think he was ever better on the screen as Arthur Kirkland, an attorney who cares maybe too much for his clients both for his career and his own mental health. During the course of And Justice For All, Pacino has two clients who for reasons I won't go into here, do not get their proper day in court and both stories end tragically. The clients are Robert Christian as the cross dressing Ralph Agee and Thomas G. Waites as Jeff McCullaugh and both players give stunning performances. The hardest audience heart out there will feel their pain.Their stories are mixed in with Pacino's running feud with a malevolent judge played by John Forsythe. John Forsythe in this film is not the John Forsythe of Dynasty or Bachelor Father or the disembodied employer of three shapely female private eyes. As it turns out this law and order judge thinks he's quite above the law. And he involves Pacino in his effort to prove his innocence after he's accused of rape.Life does have a funny way of imitating art and later on the New York State Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, Sol Wachtler, was brought down in a similar scandal to what Forsythe is accused of here.Jack Warden is another judge operating out of that same Baltimore courthouse that Forsythe does. He's quite a whack job himself, sitting on a window ledge eating his lunch, wearing a concealed revolver under his judicial robes. It's a crime for the rest of us to do that, but he's another judge who feels himself above the law.Pacino has some very tender scenes with Lee Strassberg who plays his grandfather and Sam Levene who is Strassberg's friend at the nursing home they reside it. They're all such good players that you don't even think while you're watching them that this is a reunion of Michael Corleone and Hyman Roth. His scenes with them are his link to a world beyond his chosen profession.The tragedy of And Justice For All is not so much the personal tragedies of Christian and Waites, bad as they are. It is the arrogant abuse of the rules and procedures of our legal system by the very men who are a bound by it as Pacino is. Pacino finds himself so boxed in that the only way he can see justice done is blow up his own career in a now legendary courtroom climax scene.In the post Watergate Era, And Justice For All found its audience.

Dick by Josephine Leslie, who wrote the 1945 novel The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, and muir also being Gaelic for the sea . This publication was bought by 20th Century Fox, who then turned the helm over to Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Mr. Mankiewicz has the credit of directing this quaint little love cum ghost story, set around the fictitious English coastal area of Whitecliff-By-The Sea and its rustic Gull Cottage around the time of 1900. With the guest of honour going to the very beautiful Gene Tierney, as the head strong and fiercely independent young widowed mother, Mrs. Muir. Also piped on board is the charismatic and extremely talented Rex Harrison, as The Ghost. The ever suave and sophisticated actor George Sanders, as Miles Fairley, meets this three-way split love triangle at one point. With a young child, Anna, on board, played by an exceptionally young Natalie Wood, as well as her maid, she sets sail and looks for her new life, away from London and her demanding and blasted in-laws. Besides the early observations of Lucy's independent mind, the most noticeable piece in this movie is the beautiful musical score of one Bernard Herrmann. Mr. Herrmann was born in 1911 in New York City, and whose work consists of Citizen Kane, The Day The Earth Stood Still, including, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Vertigo. This was to also include greats such as North By Northwest, Psycho, The Birds, Jason and the Argonauts and the 1976 movie Taxi Driver, which was to be his last work before he passed away on Christmas Eve, 1975. The score here has to be one of the most emotionally driven film scores I have had the pleasure to listen too. With its driving winds that highlight the ghostly suspense to the feeling of a ship lost in the doldrums of loneliness. This work has weighed anchor and cast adrift to the seas of emotion and the complexity of Love that only Old Father Time can Captain. Breathtaking and heart-warming. To govern this toward the horizons in the light of day and with the stars at night is Charles Lang, with his sextant as his visual guide, a cinematographer who has set the course to stunning, majestic, haunting and most certainly atmospheric, to help propel this story of two love birds flying over the oceans of companionship. He has worked on The Magnificent Seven, How The West Was Won and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice amongst others. His work on Mrs. Muir was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, Black-and-White in 1948.Adapting the novel to a level of emotional audience participation has been the work of Philip Dunne, who has the pedigree of The Last of the Mohicans and The Robe. This script has set sail to lands of intelligence, wit and humour, then to set anchor, occasionally, to remind us of the forbidden love and the seemingly impossible future, that a living being can fall in love, and be the recipient of love with a soul passed over. This is a script that will have your heart in the storms of both love and loss. Mr. Dunne has opened the heartstrings and made us look into the future, and the significance of the human need for Life. A powerful and deeply touching and mature script to set sail to. In all, the name of this ship The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, is a ghost story, a love story that concerns both sea-lovers, land-lovers and with nothing but sea-grit, we are never to be shipped wreaked and marooned on the island of solitude. With a story this powerful, the sea-change will have us in our own vessel, to tick away the hours, the days, the months and the years of self-sacrifice, searching for that inevitable box of tissues.

Mr. Dunne has opened the heartstrings and made us look into the future, and the significance of the human need for Life. A powerful and deeply touching and mature script to set sail to. In all, the name of this ship The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, is a ghost story, a love story that concerns both sea-lovers, land-lovers and with nothing but sea-grit, we are never to be shipped wreaked and marooned on the island of solitude. With a story this powerful, the sea-change will have us in our own vessel, to tick away the hours, the days, the months and the years of self-sacrifice, searching for that inevitable box of tissues. The Ghost and Mrs. Muir is a Grand Old Lady, sail upon her, and set the right course for Life.

Uh, I think not.All the negative reviews this film has received leave me scratching my head in total shock and disbelief. What is wrong with all these people? The Relic was just about the single most entertaining monster movie I had seen for many long years prior to its release. To this day, I am still struggling to understand what made the novel so special. Some people here seem to believe the book was better than the movie. Well, you know something, folks? The book was flat-out garbage! Perhaps I'm being too critical when I say that. But, in all honesty, I have always had trouble getting through books with more than one author. I guess that was the main reason why I could never finish the book this movie was based upon. The writing styles of the two authors kept conflicting and never quite fused.This was easily Peter Hyams' best overall film! Regardless of what the nitpickers may claim, the script was very well written, the dialouge was snappy, and the monster was just about the most ferociously terrifying thing I've seen on a movie screen since Alien. Believe me when I say that Stan Winston really outdid himself with this bad boy! All throughout the film, before we even see this creature, you hear an unsettling wheeze that sets your spine on edge. I kid you not. It gets to the point where you're literally asking yourself, what is making that noise? That was the fun part of this movie for me. I loved that aspect of it. And, of course, when the people in the museum begin turning up with their heads missing, that's when the real roller-coaster is set in motion.I would advise anybody reading this to simply ignore all the negativity they've read regarding this film. It is nowhere near as bad as these cynical reviewers are making it sound. Check it out! And, if you really want a cool effect, watch it on Halloween night with all the lights off!

A group of nubile teens(OK, not so different to begin with)go to their friend's remote island home somewhere in the Northwest. Here, they laugh, have sex, joke around because it is April Fool's Day, and, oh by the way did I mention, have sex. Although this part of the movie is pretty typical, it is well-shot compared to other films of its ilk and we do get some character development(not a lot) but some. Soon, people begin to die and things get serious. For a slasher film, this movie is very well-paced and, more importantly, is not over-the-top in blood and guts. The acting is uniformly average(something a Friday the 13th films craves!). What really takes this film beyond the mundane; however, is the stylish twist at the film's end. This, almost all by itself, allows this film to rise in the ranks. The ending is deftly done and does not look foolish or silly or forced; all of these things could have easily happened.

The Troma Company can be proud to have had the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Costner and the actress Marisa Tomei as early rising stars on their books, and with over 165 movies, to date, to their name, Troma Entertainment has become very entertaining indeed.With a strong zest for independence, shock, black comedy, sex and with a youthful cast, these movies have become cult figures that certainly deserve the recognition and respect amongst their peers and fans alike.As with their biggest hit, The Toxic Avenger is a clever filming of parody and sardonic humour. Is The Toxic Avenger a social comment on the narcissistic and materialistic and bigotry ways of Western society or just a plain horror movie parody reflecting on how society should be more tolerant to difference? This is the story of Melvin, the Tromaville Health Club mop boy, who inadvertently and naively trusts the hedonistic, contemptuous and vain health club members, to the point of accidentally ending up in a vat of toxic waste. The devastating results then have a transmogrification effect, his alter ego is released, and the Toxic Avenger is born, to deadly and comical results. The local mop boy is now the local Superhero, the saviour of corruption, thuggish bullies and indifference.There has been a lot of hard work put into these movies special effects, for a movie of this genre, it has worked very well. With the extremely visual talents of Jennifer Aspinall, she has made this movie virtually her own, her numerous Award winning flair on special makeup effects is astounding. There is also her movie pedigree to reflect on too, such as Spookies (1987), Street Trash (1987), the Saturday Night Live and Mad TV television shows, The Mexican (2001), Ticker (2001) and A Cinderella Story (2004) and others.Apart from the well thought out stunt fights, car chases, clever make up and witty script, The Toxic Avenger is, down to base level, a very funny movie, this has, no doubt, been used as a stepping stone to greater things for some here. The humorous gags, the amateurish acting, the experience in front of the camera, as well as behind, have most definitely not been a (toxic) waste.Seeing is believing, and believe it when you see it.

It's more like a teenage drama-turned horror flick when the last thirty minutes come along.The film follows the basic story of the book, with a little bit of changes here and there, some things excluded. Carrie White is a nerdy teenage girl who is tormented by her high school peers. On top of that, she has a fanatical religious mother, who comes off more as crazy then holy. Carrie begins to realize she has a special power - if she concentrates enough, she can move objects with her mind. This is called telekenesis. As prom nears, a girl named Sue Snell convinces her boyfriend to take Carrie to prom, to try and make up for a cruel incident that took place in the girl's locker room. But there are Chris Hargensen and her boyfriend, Tommy, have plans to turn Carrie's magical night into a night of horror - which turns out to be a night of horror for the entire student body.The acting here is great, Sissy Spacek is wonderful and Piper Laurie, who plays her mother, does a very good job at being genuinely scary. I saw this film at a young age and that image of Carrie's mother with the butcher knife still haunts me to this day. The whole sequence is scary, the creepy score accents Laurie's crazed performance. Sissy Spacek really garners some genuine pathos here, living the sheltered life with her religious fanatic mother, all of the girls at school treating her like an animal. I felt bad for her throughout the whole movie, even after she killed the whole prom. She suffers throughout the whole movie, so you really feel bad for her. Carrie is not a horror film for everyone. The majority of the film is more like a teenage drama, focusing on an outcast high school girl. But as tension builds in the film, in the last 30 minutes, all hell breaks loose. So if you aren't a fan of slow-building horror films, then you probably won't enjoy this. But for those who do, this is a classic. 10\/10.

But there are Chris Hargensen and her boyfriend, Tommy, have plans to turn Carrie's magical night into a night of horror - which turns out to be a night of horror for the entire student body.The acting here is great, Sissy Spacek is wonderful and Piper Laurie, who plays her mother, does a very good job at being genuinely scary. I saw this film at a young age and that image of Carrie's mother with the butcher knife still haunts me to this day. The whole sequence is scary, the creepy score accents Laurie's crazed performance. Sissy Spacek really garners some genuine pathos here, living the sheltered life with her religious fanatic mother, all of the girls at school treating her like an animal. I felt bad for her throughout the whole movie, even after she killed the whole prom. She suffers throughout the whole movie, so you really feel bad for her. Carrie is not a horror film for everyone. The majority of the film is more like a teenage drama, focusing on an outcast high school girl. But as tension builds in the film, in the last 30 minutes, all hell breaks loose. So if you aren't a fan of slow-building horror films, then you probably won't enjoy this. But for those who do, this is a classic. 10\/10.

It's more like a teenage drama-turned horror flick when the last thirty minutes come along.The film follows the basic story of the book, with a little bit of changes here and there, some things excluded. Carrie White is a nerdy teenage girl who is tormented by her high school peers. On top of that, she has a fanatical religious mother, who comes off more as crazy then holy.

Consider In 1957 it was still unnacceptable to make a film without a single decent character so non-talented Kim Novak had to play an ingenue role in a story that didn't allow for one; some of Larry Hart's lyrics - especially 'In Our Little Den Of Iniquity' were far too 'adult' for Hollywood so that half the Broadway score was jettisoned in favor of material from other Rodgers and Hart shows - I Didn't Know What Time It Was, There's A Small Hotel, My Funny Valentine, The Lady Is A Tramp - so that the overall effect was that of a sleek ocean liner with four limpets clinging to it. On the other hand there was Frank Sinatra. Let me say that again On the other hand there was Frank Sinatra, who single-handedly cancelled out these flaws even the almost impossible mistake of giving one of the finest ballads ever written (Funny Valentine) to a wooden actress with no discernible singing voice or style. Sinatra was born to play this role and he grabs it with both hands and towers above everyone and everything else on view. The book can't quite match John O'Hara's original 'book' for the Broadway show but then what could, nevertheless we get a reasonable facsimile and, let me say again, Sinatra to bring the whole megillah to life.
