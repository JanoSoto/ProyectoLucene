[{"date":"19 February 2015","score":"","review":" Almost Famous. The title is classic. The name alone is legendary like The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Raging Bull, and Scarface. It became a classic right away upon its release in 2000 and rightfully so. Almost Famous has been raved as being the best rock 'n' roll movie ever. It is not about rock, it is a coming-of-age movie with rock being just one of the elements the movie contains. It is about a high schooler in the early 70s named William Miller (Fugit) who has a knack for writing who gets a break as a journalist for a rock magazine. He is able to worm his way into meeting an up-and-coming called Stillwater before they open up for Black Sabbath. His genuine kindness and admiration for the band causes them to ask him to go on a tour with them. Rolling Stone magazine has their eye on him and his mother (McDormand) keeps reminding him, don't take drugs. Sure the story is about a kid that tours with a rock band, but it contains a whole lot more that we can learn from and appreciate. One of the things I love about this is the whole 70s style and classic rock element. Stillwater isn't really that good of a band, but I like their style and overall sound. The song structure and quality just never clicked for me. They have long hair and beards, much like Three Dog Night or Grand Funk Railroad. Miller meets band-aide Penny Lane (Hudson) who is there for the band, but he learns lessons about love when he falls for her. He witnesses the chemistry between the band members themselves. This movie takes an excellent glimpse at what life is like on the road, without focusing too much on the sex and drugs. It does have those, but it is able to keep its messages afloat by not focusing on the sex and drugs. We also get a good look into the life of a journalist and into the world of journalism. Writer\/director, Cameron Crowe was a teenage journalist who went on tour with a rock band during the 70s. Miller tries to get to know all about the band, its individual members and life one the road with any special situation. Rolling Stone takes his story and puts their own spin to it. That's journalism for you. It happens all the time. These bits are the underlinings of all the wonder, joy and laughter that should be in a movie.

This isn't a film about gold so much as it is about the people who seek it and how the fantastical material pursuit affects character. Fred Dobbs is no Daniel Plainview, but both of them travel down a road to the worst of their humanity. Dobbs is a Bogart I didn't expect. This was my first experience of him, and cornerstone of American acting and cultural icon such as he is, the image I had of him in mind was more one of nobility and bravado. The sentiment of Rick Blaine is not welcome here. From the moment we're introduced to Dobbs, he's washed up, desperate, scrounging for meals and for work. But this is Bogart, and he's got a hardened edge to him. In that sharp equine face, there's an eagerness for adventure. But instead of that, he gets conned out of a pay check for doing back-breaking labour in the intense heat. It's an inhospitable world, where self-preservation is the ultimate concern.I like the languid Mexican town, Tampico, which the film and its characters initially dwell in, struggling to find a way out. It's sort of like a Casablanca; not a destination that you choose, but a place in which you end up. Except this little Oasis doesn't have that beating heart of optimism, romance, or solidarity. The only common ground the people find here is their need for their next monetary fix. Dobbs meets another American in the same tired situation as him, a man named Curtin (Tim Holt) who counterbalances his roughness and edginess with a more relaxed, take-it-as-it-comes personality, and when they eventually decide on their quest of gold and shake their hands in bargain, you just know which one of them is going to hold up their end of the deal. But it's how you get there of course, not necessarily where you're going.There's a wonderful saloon brawl early on in the film, when Dobbs and Curtin confront the man who cheated them out of their pay, and it's an uneven and almost pathetic display of flailing limbs and thrown weight that is interesting to watch, because it ignores the standard of a quick and easy fight that usually ends in some cheap retribution, and thereby kind of sets the tone for the film; that in this Western world, things can be unfair and bloody and one has to go to uncomfortable lengths to protect or pursue your interests. The third adventurer, Howard, is a delicious performance by Walter Huston and he plays that wizened yet giddy old man perfectly; he's the type of character that can impart sage advice and dance and click his heels simultaneously, so it's something to relish in. So the three men all provide interesting counter-points to each other, with Howard as a reflection of the hardened selfishness of Dobbs and the compassion and loyalty of Curtin, yet neither entirely either one. He is an old man who has been through more than these two men combined, and still reached this far. He admits at one point that had he been younger he might have actually succumbed to the temptation to betray his partners. Wikipedia describes this as neo-western, and however credible that may be, as these weird categorisations are often convoluted and obtuse, it is definitely not incorrect, as this is not a typical, romanticised Western, where everything hero prevails and everything is right in the world. Yet it is not an 'anti-western' like Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian, where there is no hope or unconditional love in the world and everyone's lives are subject to the whims of nature and man, entirely out of their control. This film has a fairly neat, melodramatic conclusion where the characters reflect on preceding events and reach some sort of realisation in their lives (two other films, both of which I love and were coincidentally also released in the same year as this, 'Drunken Angel' and 'Rope', include this type of ending) and the heroes, if we wish to restrict them to a simple title, do prevail, and the bad guys do die, and everyone does, arguably, get their just reward, but this conclusion is earned rather than forced, as there is real human conflict to get there. The actual gold-procuring part of the film in which the three men live on the mountain for however long reminded me, oddly, or not so oddly, of Brokeback Mountain. In writing that I realise that it may seem my mind has wandered to stupid and immature territory, but I like making odd and tenuous connections with things. Both films have their most consequential moments in the isolated natural landscapes of their respective western worlds, in which their characters become their truest selves. In Brokeback, the two men are alone, herding, in these gorgeous sweeping vistas, and they are in the heart of their Western, slowly drawing closer together but realising this can't happen back home. Here, the men are in a rough, harsh landscape and become more suspicious of each other. They elect to kill a man who insists on working with them, because they can't summon the necessary trust as their energies are consumed entirely by their fortunes. The fortune is gold of course, and we realise, in a concise moral conclusion like those at the end of movies released in 1948, that when man reaches gold, the gold often reaches the worst of him.

In fact, it might not even qualify as a road trip comedy since at least thirty-five minutes of it are spent at the destination of Aspen, Colorado. It has kind of a story to it, but primarily it just takes some everyday situations and puts them into comedy format.The movie introduces another dynamic comedy duo to join the ranks. You can tell that Harry and Lloyd are good friends, but they also have distinct personalities. This is highlighted by the balance of screen time that they have together and separate. Lloyd is a little bit goofier and more adventurous than the somewhat irritable and nervous Harry. Both parts receive good, arguably spectacular, performances. Despite how the film is titled, the two are not as stupid as one might think. They show that they are resourceful in a number of situations, though there does seem to be some part of their brains that have something missing. Their stupidity is almost paradoxical, because they know how to drive and make some kind of money, but there's just certain things that they don't really get like Christmas as in the holiday?- No Christmas as in tree. There are various minor characters that drive the plot along. These consist of the scattered cops, the guy and girl that chase Harry and Lloyd, and Mary Swanson. The plot is nothing special, but it's also not the main focus of the movie and can be absorbed in a variety of ways and at a variety of levels. The whole story behind the suitcase is kind of funny in itself because it's such a serious thing, but it get's inadvertently messed up by the unsuspecting and innocent Harry and Lloyd. Each part is acted pretty well, though you could make a case against the quality of the script.There is a pretty good balance of verbal and situational comedy. I got more of a bang of the verbal comedy, which primarily came before arriving in Aspen. A lot of the situational humor comes from the minor characters overestimating Harry and Lloyd's intelligence and getting outwitted, sometimes unintentionally. The humor isn't outrageously crude or raunchy, though it is rated PG-13 for a reason.If you enjoy Jim Carrey movies, this fits the bill, and he gives a performance that is on par with his other work. It's pretty good if you like slapstick, though the overall feel doesn't quite spell slapstick. I guess you could say it's kind of in it's own genre.
