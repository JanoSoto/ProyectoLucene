It seems the Matrix raised the bar too high.However, I found this little gem of a movie, and it is the first post-Matrix sci-fi movie that I have actually liked! And I liked it a lot! The themes of the two movies are similar, but this is no Matrix-clone. The action is almost non-existent, so it relies more on thinking and story-telling. You can read other posts if you want to learn about the plot, and they are accurate so there's no need for me to repeat them. The acting in this movie was very good, even though I have never seen much of these actors before (except for D'Onofrio, who acting style I usually hate in Law & Order btw, but he's very good in this film). The story contains plenty of twists to keep you entertained and thinking throughout the entire movie. And most importantly, it is a movie that you continue to think about (in a good way) AFTER the movie is over. I'm looking forward to watching it again, with my wife this time, so it has re-playability and is a good candidate for purchase instead of rental.For anyone interested in seeing a very good movie with a Matrix-like plot, make sure to get this film. As I said before, I'm very spoiled when it comes to sci-fi films now, thanks to the first 2 Matrix films, but this movie managed to stand up very well in comparison. I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and recommend it to sci-fi fans, and non-sci-fi fans, whole-heartedly. But don't expect a wham-bam Matrix-clone. It's really in the same category as films like Gattaca (another great flick).9 out of 10 stars.

I know Paul W. S. Anderson is hated by many, mostly because of MORTAL COMBAT and SOLDIER, but I think this is by far his best directing (and writing) work.What I like the most is how the movie stays true to the spirit of the games in spite of moving away from the original plot and characters. The story is sort of a re-imagination of the first game with a few things taken from the second (mostly the Liker, the train sequences and the ending), but you can find the key elements that make up the Resident Evil universe Racoon City, the Umbrella Corporation, the T-virus, the zombies, the dogs... And though none of the original characters appear in the movie, those created specifically for it could fit nicely into the games Alice is some sort of a mix between Jill Valentine and Claire Redfield, Matt seems inspired by Leon S. Kennedy, Spence seems inspired by Wesker, and Colin Salmon's character is a compendium of all the Umbrella operatives seen through the games. The actors are serviceable, and I think Salmon stands out in spite of his limited screen time. Mila Jovovich is also perfectly cast as Alice, and though she's not a great actress, she makes the part her own. Michelle Rodriguez is also good, if only because she plays the same character in all of her movies. Of course, more character development would have been welcome, but I think there is enough for an action movie. Also, the script cleverly avoids a common mistake in this kind of 'combat team in hostile ground' stories The most generic and interchangeable characters are killed early on (I wish Salmon had survived longer, though), so you can focus your attention in the rest &#150; unlike in the recent STARSHIP TROOPERS 2, where there were too many cardboard cut-outs&#133; I mean characters.Another area where RE succeeds is in the balance between horror and action. Just like the games, the movie kicks off in what is (more or less) our everyday world, and quickly turns into a nightmare. The settings reproduce what you are used to find in the games, like the mansion, the laboratory, the train, etc. They all help to create the right atmosphere for the movie. On the plot side, I know the use of amnesia as a narrative device has been done to death, but here it serves the narration well Just like Alice, we find step by step where we are and what is going on. Some scenes are adequately creepy and well handled, like the moment when the zombies show up for the first time. The action scenes are well edited, so you can tell what's going on (a rarity these days). The pace is also good, except for a few moments when you can tell that some scenes have been cut (particularly at the end of the conversation where Matt reveals his true identity to Alice). I also liked the epilogue. Though a bit overlong, it has the greatest Resident Evil feel in the movie (particularly the final shot).Overall, this is a good horror\/action movie, specially for those who liked the games. As always happens, some of them may be disappointed, but I still think we've been far luckier than most Tomb Raider fans.

As noted by other reviewers, Chariots of Fire includes a cast of relativelyunknown actors (with the exception of Sir John Gielgud). However, it is not fair to say that no one in the film went on to do any note worthy films afterwards. Ian Charleson (Eric Liddel) has the best excuse - he passed away a few years after the film was made. Ian Holm has gone on to do many other respectable films,such as Lord of the Rings (Bilbo Baggins). Despite other films that the actors did (or didn't do) after Chariots of Fire, the general performance throughout the film is believable and moving.I would recommend Chariots of Fire for those who want a break from the movies with roaring action, but little plot. It is a quiet film based on a true story, but one that will stay with you long after you've returned the DVD.

We saw it with Carrie, we saw it with Scarface, and now, we see it with The Untouchables. Now, those are the only three movies of his that I've seen, but if all of his movies are like this, then so be it. If not, then please forgive me for this review, and chalk it up to ignorance on my part. The plot is very good, and mostly well-paced; I understand that it's not entirely accurate to the original, actual story of Al Capone, but it's based somewhat on him. Personally, as long as the film is interesting, and somewhat true to facts, I don't mind the film not being the real story. Now, I said the pace was *mostly* good; once the first hour and a half has passed, the film goes a little slowly for the next fifteen minutes or so, but then it picks up again, and doesn't drag at all for the rest of the picture. The acting is all great; Costner, Connery, Garcia, Martin Smith, De Niro... even the supporting cast was great; I seriously doubt that Frank Nitti could have been portrayed better than Billy Drago did. His snake-like appearance and behavior was excellent, really made the character. Robert De Niro probably gives the most impressive performance in the whole film; unfortunately, he gets far too little screen time. Whenever you do see him on-screen, you thoroughly enjoy it. The four untouchables have great chemistry, which is what really makes their team work, together with their diverse personalities. The way they did the whole late twenties look, with the cars, the buildings, the clothes, etc. was great. It looks and feels authentic. The dialog was well-written, but the film does arguably have too many one-liners, for this type of film. The action is well-done, well-choreographed and very cool. The shootouts, the chasing... the film also seemed to have a very impressive amount of great, memorable scenes, for such a short gangster piece(compared to, say, The Godfather, which is three hours long). The score is excellent; Ennio Morricone usually does great scores, and this is no exception. The cinematography is pretty impressive, and De Palma makes great use of closeups, pans, zooming and long takes. All in all, a great film that is just slightly less than a masterpiece.

I came into the movie with semi-high expectations since I had gone on a blitz of watching Best Picture winners that I hadn't seen before (Patton, The Last Emperor, Kramer Vs Kramer and The Apartment) I was truly disappointed by this and wonder why it got the thumbs up over Reds.Part of the problem is that the directing seems to be impassioned by the material it is presenting and there is an over emphasis on slow motion photography and echoed voices to be used as dramatic effect. In addition, I didn't really care about many, or a bit more accurately, any of the characters since they were all already pampered ivy-league kids.The only guy I liked was Ian Holms character, the trainer of the Jewish athlete. He seemed to have his feet on the ground with a solid head on his shoulders. Also, I think they used religion to get on the good side of the public due to the fact that it oozes out of every pore of this movie's soggy skin. I'm not against religion in movies, but I think the purpose of the scriptwriter was not wholesome.And just to make matters a bit worse, the movie insults my intelligence by repeating dialogue the characters have already said (used as narrative during a climatic or in order to remind me of the motivation of character. The only time this method of usage of past material used as a narrative to remind the audience is acceptable are mystery movies where the plot may become so convoluted you miss details along the way. This just seemed trite and lazy.The last detail that bothered me was the use of electronic music as the film's score. I know that little ditty they play is famous but I don't think that it was appropriate due to the time the movie took place. Because of this, I was constantly reminded that the movie was made in the eighties when there was a blitz of such music out (think of 80's rock) but the fact that this movie took place in the 1920's I was constantly dragged out of the time (even though the costumes were well done). If the electric guitar hadn't been invented yet, why would you use a synthesizer?Anyways, watch it if you want but I don't suggest it. The Academy just gave a conservative movie a title it didn't earn because Raiders Of The Lost Ark was too much fun and Reds was too controversial. Even On Golden Pond was better than this dribble. Think back to when A Beautiful Mind beat out The Fellowship Of The Rings or when The English Patient beat Fargo.This is a boring and thankfully forgotten movie.

Sadly, if falls a long way short of the standards set by its predecessor, sacrificing any attempts at plot or character development in favour of a non-stop succession of action sequences, flashy gadgets and hi-tech sets. The result is a film that is mildly entertaining but lacking in any real tension, threat or depth, making it one of the most forgettable and disappointing entries in the Bond franchise.One of the big disappointments of the film is Pierce Brosnan's Bond. After his excellent debut performance in GoldenEye, which presented OO7 as a well-rounded character, Brosnan is given a script in TND which requires him to do nothing more than go through the motions. He therefore does all the usual Bond things - the fighting, the seduction, the quips - but the depth that he brought to the character in GoldenEye is totally missing, as this film is only interested in Bond as action hero. There is one particularly cringeworthy scene where Brosnan wanders around wielding a machine gun like Arnie or Sly Stallone, not exactly the behaviour you would expect from Ian Fleming's gentleman spy, but certainly what you would expect from filmmakers whose only concern is to make as many dollars as possible.Brosnan's flat performance is matched by his co-stars. Jonathan Pryce's Elliot Carver is arguably the weakest villain ever to appear in a Bond film; he is not remotely threatening, and Pryce is so hammy in the role he just makes Carver camp and extremely irritating. As for the women, Michelle Yeoh's high-kicking Wai Lin certainly holds her own against OO7 in the fight scenes, but Yeoh is far from being either an accomplished actress or a great beauty, and Wai Lin is a forgettable and one-dimensional Bond girl. Teri Hatcher, as the doomed Paris Carver, scores over Yeoh in the looks department, but Paris is another character who lacks any real depth, and in any case she is disposed of quite rapidly. The film's lack of originality is also underscored by the appearance of yet another blonde, Red Grant-style henchman, who is about as unmemorable as you can get. The only cast members who really shine are Vincent Schiavelli as the comically evil Dr Kaufman, a classic talking villain, and Judi Dench as M; Q is also back once more, in an all-too-brief scene, in order to give Bond his fancy remote-controlled BMW.Rather like the characters, the plot takes second place to the action, although the premise of a media tycoon trying to engineer a war for ratings is at least contemporary, and if it had been fleshed out properly it could have been interesting. As it is, the story is just a peg on which to hang the action, and all it really does is retread the scripts of You Only Live Twice and The Spy Who Loved Me, albeit in glossier fashion. As far as the action sequences themselves are concerned, director Roger Spottiswoode undoubtedly pulls them off with flair, but for the most part they just feel formulaic and unexciting; indeed, there are points where TND feels more like a John Woo-style film than a Bond adventure. The look of the film is also very stylised and self-consciously modern, so much so that it will probably seem quite dated in years to come, more so than some older Bond films. It is another element that makes the film all style and no substance.In essence, TND is about as shallow as a Bond film can get. I did like David Arnold's Barryesque score, and Sheryl Crow's title song is quite good, but generally speaking the film is nothing more than mindless popcorn entertainment. There is nothing inherently wrong with that, of course, but Bond films can, and should, amount to something more, and for that reason TND is one of my least favourite in the entire canon.

Cesar leads the good life; women love him, his friends love him and he's got lots of money. His life is turned on it's head when he finds the love of his life, Sofia (Penelope Cruz), much to the dismay of his less good-looking best friend, Pelayo (Fele Martinez), who brought her to the party where she and Cesar meet. Not content with just one major twist in his life, Cesar's life is turned on it's head again, when his disgruntled bed-buddy, Nuria (Najwa Nimri) takes him on a car journey that he'll never forget; and one that will ultimately cost him his precious good looks.As mentioned, Open Your Eyes is a tale of beauty. At many points during the film, Cesar says that his disfigurement has turned him into a monster; but as Sofia says before she sees his new face; You are a monster, and that he is. He is a serial womaniser, he doesn't care about people; only himself, and that respect; he is monster, but it's only on the inside. His selfishness and material persona is then epitomised again later on in the film during his conversations with the doctors; I'll pay anything, he pleas for them to fix his face. His looks are everything to him, and when he has them he doesn't care who gets hurt or what pain he causes. When he loses his looks, however, he quickly finds out what life is like on the other side of the fence; and he doesn't like it. The only difference between him at the start of the movie, and after the accident is his face; but he lets the disfigurement consume him. Open Your Eyes is the epitome of the age-old anecdote; True beauty is on the inside.Open Your Eyes is written and directed by the supremely talented Alejandro Amenabar. Amenabar unleashed himself on the film world with the fantastic 'Tesis' in 1996, which was also one of the best films to come out of his homeland of Spain for years. Alejandro's direction is sublime; he is a master on top of his craft, and if he carries on going the way he has with this film, Tesis and the not quite as good, but still good; The Others, he will surely mature into one of cinema's finest assets. For this movie, Alejandro has re-recruited his two leading men from Tesis; Eduardo Noriega (who also starred in The Devil's Backbone) and Fele Martinez. These two are a great couple of young actors, and Amenabar was right to hire them again. Noriega in particular is great in his role; he creates just the right amount of intrigue and sympathy for his character. Starring alongside them is Tom Cruise's divorced wife to be, Penelope Cruz. Penelope is absolutely beautiful and she's very talented too; and makes for a great leading lady.Open Your Eyes is one of the most outstanding and original pieces of cinema I have ever had the pleasure of watching. When Tom Cruise saw the film, he liked it so much that he remade it as 'Vanilla Sky' in 2001; and it's not hard to see why, as I would have done the same thing if I had enough money. Vanilla Sky isn't anywhere near as good as the original; it's far less gritty, and far more Hollywood, there's a lot of unneeded elements added, such as a silly dialogue about being cats in the next life, and overall it isn't as good as the original. And I'm sure anyone that has seen both films will agree with me.

To begin with the fanboys begin dissing this film months before it was released because they have too much time on their hands. Things went south from there.I like this movie despite its many faults because, for the most part, I buy into it. I suspend reality -- reality has no place in films of this nature.If you're gonna remake a movie, one assumes it will be a completely different animal. How can it not? The original Godzilla costume would have looked ridiculous in modern day New York. The original was a lumbering dinosaur. How many reptiles do you know lumber? So let's end the dissatified comments on how the creature looked. They did a good job updating it. Do you have idea how dumb the original would have looked strolling down Park Ave??Okay, lets dig deeper. The acting styles from all six major characters were very different -- that's the directors fault. Broderick had no business being in this movie (This is not the thing he does well, he is an emotional actor) Action is not his thing. The horrible actress who played his college girl friend was so awful, she was in a different movie. Totally incongruous to the rest of the story -- like she was in TV drama. Jean Reno (all praise Mr. Reno) was the only actor who knew he was in a Radition Theatre Action film and played his character accordingly. His funny team was cool too. Hank (Animal) was sweet comic relief BUT did we need the character? Did we need to know the army personnel, especially that red haired horny woman. God I prayed for her to be eaten by Godzilla. In conclusion, there were too many characters, too many subplots,But I accepted it. The studio wanted a big film. Different stories, perspectives. In a ID4 we were given different parts of the country responding to the alien event, each region, each situation, each actor rang true for their segments. I believed Randy Quaid and his portion of the film. The President scenes also. I believed each region -- it was focused.This studio decision of a Big Flick was wrong for Godzilla. Wipe out the newscaster subplot and the ex girlfriend entirely and concentrate on the hero, the anti-hero's (the French) and the bad guys (The army) This would have made for a better film.But who the heck cares about a better film!! This isn't a drama. This is cartoon action. This is a ride film. This is check your brain at the door and hang on.My last comment is about the lack of respect for Godzilla the film makers exhibit. We had no point of reference to . . . the twins, other alien monsters, no hero-Godzilla, no Japan influence -- no spirit. It was just an animal looking to lay it's eggs -- and that isn't a Godzilla film and that's why people were upset and stayed away. But who cares. It's a ride movie, kids.
