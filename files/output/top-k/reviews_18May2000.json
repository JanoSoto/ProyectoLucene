Very, well written, very well directed, and very well acted. Alvy Singer meets Annie through a friend at a tennis match and instant karma emerges between them. After tennis Annie needs a ride home so of course woody wouldn't let her down and offers her a ride which soon turns into going to his house for a drink and that's when one of the most honest and hilarious scenes takes place were alvy and Annie are talking and in subtitles below translate what they are thinking about what one another is saying and what they are thinking, I have to say that is the best written scene ive ever seen, in any movie. They soon begin to go out and then the brilliant story goes on it is very funny as it is touching and real. If you haven't seen this ingenious masterpiece yet I highly recommend you see this film. Even though most Allen films offend something or someone and a lot of people don't like him for this and the fact they cant watch his movies without making a comment I really think you should give this one a try and maybe if your a star wars fan, don't you want to see why it one best picture.

Secondly I would like to say that, if I should ever find myself in the position of teaching a high-school English course,  I would definitely screen this adaptation of Hamlet while covering the play.  That is not to say I find this the best rendition I have ever seen, but it comes pretty near close and I would rank it far higher than Branagh's film.  A lot is made of the modernization of the play and how it provides some sort of metaphor for contemporary America or international corporate culture.  Rubbish.  The play is, as always, about people.  I don't know why anyone would be so amazed that this play seems so appropriate in a contemporary setting.  What I find remarkable is that it ever made as much sense during the time of its initial production.  Shakespeare was not only ahead of his time, he was so vastly ahead of it that he was quite out of fashion, in most parts of the civilized world, for some period after his death (Racine and Corneille were considered the real guys).  One can only imagine what an Elizabethan audience would have made of such a conscience stricken protagonist.  In those days any prince worth his salt, faced with such an uncle as Claudius, would have hewed strictly to a 'shoot first, ask questions later' policy.  If Almereyda's film seems so perfect, it is not that his execution, as good as it is, is so fitting of the material, it is that the material is so fitting of the execution.  Expanding upon this I would like to say that the cast, for the most part is wonderful. Yes, even Mr. Hawke, who one doesn't think of as the strongest of actors, was finely suitable as a confused, young man of grave burden.  Bill Murray was wonderful as Polonius, giving the character an ruefully comic twist that only he could provide (there were moments, when he was opining on Hamlet's madness, that I almost expected him to say, The Ham-Man, that nut!).  Sam Shepard gave the most doleful and bitter performance of the The Ghost I have ever seen, Karl Geary provided a wonderfully warm Horatio (why has this guy not been in more films?) and Liev Schreiber, Diane Venora, Steve Zahn, etc. were all marvelous in their respective roles.

Yes, it not only can be possible, it is, and Aliens not only proves a fantastic sci-fi movie in its own right but again proves the power that Sigourney Weaver has in the right film, as well as the over-powering direction of James Cameron.Picking up 200 years after the fact, Weaver is once again thrown into a battle along with the Space Marines that are called to the planet where Weaver's team originally found the alien of the first film.  The colonies that have been built there have been obliterated of all life and they are being sent there to wipe out every last alien on the planet.Of course, in a movie like this, nothing is as it seems, and that's a positive quality.  Weaver misses nary a beat as Ripley, a woman as un-trusting of aliens, most humans and just about anything else in general as she was before.  It's only when they discover a small girl (Carrie Hehn) left alive that she finally finds something that perhaps shows she has some feeling left.Of course, there are other great performances by Biehn, Henriksen, Goldstein, Paxton and Reiser, playing well fleshed-out characters against a backdrop of desperation, fear and outright gut-wrenching horror as they find out their mission wasn't as easy as they all thought. But then comes James Cameron.  Having proven his mettle with The Terminator, he works with a bigger budget and shows just as much ingenuity and flair for big, flashy action as any ten action directors.  But even if the story seems routine, Cameron's approach is not; he makes every single moment seem as fresh now as if it were being seen for the first time in motion picture history.  Always a good thing in science fiction, where there aren't exactly new ideas coming out every day.As with the original Alien (and Cameron's Terminator), the last half-hour or so is so much edge-of-your-seat and nail-biting tension that you'll feel like a wrung-out wash rag by the time all is said and done, and rightly so.  And, more than ever, you'll empathize with Weaver as her character fights not only for her own survival, but for that of others as well.

All the characters that belonged to Pakistan, be it George Khan, Mr. Shah or all those Pakis George meet in Bradford (or is it Bradistan?) were stupid, ill mannered and devoid of any common sense. If that was not enough, they all were cruelly ignorant to the feelings of their families.   Character of Om Puri (George Khan) is very uni-dimesional.

And boy was I disappointed!I've very rarely found British comedy films exciting and &#145;East is East' is no exception. The last one I saw was Blue Juice and it was even worse than this. Why Britain continues to produce amazing actors and actresses (Anthony Hopkins, Sean Connery, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet etc.) and fail to produce great filmmakers is beyond my comprehension.`East and East' could have very easily been an engaging sentimental drama about a Pakistani immigrant and his family trying to cope in a foreign culture. But instead it is an obscene and vulgar comedy that makes mockery of Pakistanis in particular and muslims in general. All the characters that belonged to Pakistan, be it George Khan, Mr. Shah or all those Pakis George meet in Bradford (or is it Bradistan?) were stupid, ill mannered and devoid of any common sense. If that was not enough, they all were cruelly ignorant to the feelings of their families.   Character of Om Puri (George Khan) is very uni-dimesional. He is, ignorant, cruel, violent and doesn't seem to give a damn about anyone of his family. Never once do we see him talking nicely to anyone of his seven kids. Minnah was the only daughter among six sons, that should have made at least her an apple of his eye, or like many other of their misconceptions about Islam and Pakistan, the filmmakers thought that all Pakisatnis think less of their daughters than their sons? Throughout the film we hear that he wants the good for his children and never once does he talks politely to them? And was he blind or something to marry his oh-so handsome sons with such ugly looking girls? What was the director's message? That if u grow up in a Pakistani environment like Mr. Shah's daughter's did, u turn up like that?One more thing, in the wedding sequence at the beginning of the film, we hear `Allah Ho' played in the background. It was my first experience of hearing a mystical song on a wedding! Even the most radical families of Pakistan tends to sing certain traditional wedding songs and George's family was from Punjab where they have probably thousands of songs for this particular occasion only. Lack of knowledge Mr. Director? Or was it your unfathomable British sense of humor? The only commendable thing about the film is acting. Everybody has given a decent performance and it is useless to elaborate on how great an actor Om Puri is! The accent, the language, the facial expression were simply superb. I wish if only it had been for a better film. `East is East' is disappointing in every sense and to know that it has been rated as one of the finest British comedies ever made only suggests the standard of the British cinema.

It was released in the biggest number of screens, received the best reviews, but it seems that the audience didn't like it very much. Well, Andy Kaufman is almost unknown here (I confess I had never heard about him before reading about the film). Only the people who watch Taxi on Sony Entertainment Television may know him. But I'm sure that about 60% of the people who went to the movies to watch Man on the Moon left disappointed because they were expecting a slapstick comedy- the last thing it is. In the audience I attended to, there was a group of stupid teen girls (whose favorite film is probably She's All That) who didn't seem to get the point of the amazing, hilarious beginning. At the end, I heard one of them complaining 'This is the worst movie I've ever seen.' And another one said a kind of nonsense thing 'This is even worse than Sleepy Hollow!' &#150; another great film, I have to say. So I got very angry and thought 1- They don't know that this is a biography about a REAL person. 2- They've never heard about a genius named Milos Forman; Amadeus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest mean nothing for them. 3- They were expecting Dumb and Dumber- Part 2 or Ace Ventura Pet Detective- Part 3. 4- I'm sure they also didn't like The Truman Show. 5- They are futile, disposable people who should be ignored (I'm sure they would make annoying jokes about the frog rain in Magnolia, like 'Duh! Senseless!').Man on the Moon is another great creation of Milos Forman. He has been criticized for making an empty film, without telling details about Andy Kaufman's life, showing only his shows, his polemics. But that's how biographies should be. Who cares if Andy lost his puppy dog hit by a car when he was a child? Who cares if his parents used to fight? Who cares if he had problems at school? What is important in the life of a person, more specifically an artist, is how he\/she became famous, how he\/she faced it etc. And Man on the Moon shows it perfectly well. Milos Forman had already done masterpieces as One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus (another unusual biography) and, in my opinion, Valmont. The People vs. Larry Flynt was also a different kind of biography and was almost perfect. That's what happens in Man on the Moon- it is almost a masterpiece. As in Carrey's previous picture, The Truman Show, there is a small, almost imperceptible thing missing. Here I guess it's the presence of Courtney Love's character in Kaufman's life. She could have been quite more significant here.But this small flaw can be left by the side in the middle of so many qualities an amazing director, a great screenplay (with hilarious moments and some emotional ones) and, above everything, Jim Carrey. It was just prejudice, I think, his snub at the Oscar. This was the Oscar of snubs Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson, Eyes Wide Shut, Stanley Kubrick, Being John Malkovich, Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon and there it goes. But the Academy should have forgotten Carrey's mistakes of the past (hey! Hilary Swank was in The Next Karate Kid!). I guess it's the best performance of his career- by far. God! I don't know almost anything about Andy Kaufman, but Carrey resurrects him. Personification, whatever! HE IS ANDY KAUFMAN!Man on the Moon is a must-see- specially if you like Forman's style of film-making. There are many memorable scenes the beginning, the concert in Carnegie Hall, the funeral and the ambiguous ending- ambiguous in a good way. It's superbly directed, acted and written. Even if it can't be between Forman's masterpieces, it is something worthy of much recognition.
