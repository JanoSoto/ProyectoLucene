In fact, I was in the middle of the Fellowship when I saw the movie this weekend.  Therefore, I can say I hold very little bias towards this movie since I grew up on the Hobbit, Redwall, and Dune rather than the Rings series in general.For the most part, I was quite impressed with this cinematic giant of a film.  It had the best cinematography in a movie that I've seen since A Thin Red Line and Braveheart, and I'll go even as far as to say that it has vastly outdone the others in that respect.  New Zealand was the perfect setting for this film.  The sweeping landscape shots are excellent, as well as the scenes from Isingod and the dwarven mines.  Besides the cinematography, kudos go out to many of the fine actors and actresses who poured their hearts into this film.  Ian McKellon as Gandalf give probably the best performance in the film, followed by Christopher Lee as Saruman or Elijah Wood as Frodo.  Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett aren't bad for their limited amount of screen time. Overall, mostly everyone was well cast and the screenplay was nicely written.  My favorite scene would have to be the wicked wizard duel between Saruman and Gandalf. This movie ties with Memento as the best film that I've scene all year.Now for the downsideFor avid Tolkien readers, many will be dismayed with the script's departure at times from the text.  Some major omissions have occured in the form of the complete absence of Tom Bombadil and other changes which give some characters more important roles than the text had permitted.  Also, the ending is kind of disappointing, but movie viewers should remember that unlike films such as Back to the Future and Indiana Jones, this is one book broken up into three major parts.  The book continues after the end of a part, not starting anew with some brand new adventure so the static ending is kind of understandable.  Other qualms arise due to the fact that some characters are severly underdeveloped, especially legolas, the Dwarf, and the other hobbits following Frodo.  You don't get to learn a whole lot about them and in a three hour movie, you'd figure you would be able to(which brings me to my next point.) This movie is a three-hour epic in every sense, which means you must bring your attention span to the theatres and make sure the theatre you go to has good surround sound and comfortable seats.(Trust me, I saw this movie in a crappy and uncomfortable theatre, which made the viewing quite unpleasant.)Finally my only other complaint is thisMOMS AND DADS, PLEASE DO NOT BRING YOUR UNDER 12-YEAR OLD CHILDREN TO SEE THIS FILM UNLESS THEY ARE QUITE MATURE.  THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ATTENTION SPAN AND THEY COULD BE QUITE FRIGHTENED BY SOME OF THE MONSTERS IN THIS MOVIE. THIS IS NOT WALT DISNEY NOR IS THIS A CHILDREN'S MOVIE.  IT'S PG-13 FOR A REASON, AND NOTHING MAKES OTHER MOVIE GOERS MORE UPSET THAN CRYING OR INQUISITIVE CHILDREN WHO TALK THROUGHOUT A THREE-HOUR MASTERPIECE!!!(as you can see, I ran into a few of these cases during my viewing and I was not too happy.)-In summation, The Fellowship of The Rings is a great movie with some understandable flaws.  Many will enjoy it, Many will love it, and Many will hate it.  It's changes from the book are understandable and are the interpretation of those who produced and directed it, and no book save maybe The Shawshank Redemption can be translated nearly word for word into a movie. Overall, I felt that Peter Jackson did an excellent job with this movie and I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD so I can enjoy it that much more from the comforts of my own home. 8.9\/10    ","genre":null},{"date":"24 December 2001","score":"","review":" Here we goFor starters, I had not finished reading the Rings series before seeing the movie.

The scenery was actually great, if the camera would ever stop whirling around long enough to allow it to be enjoyed. I appreciate a sweeping camera move judiciously used to set off a dramatic vista, but that device was done to death. The action scenes are such a blitz of brief incoherent cuts that they were hard to watch. The lighting is frequently peculiar, for example everyone in Rivendell looked waxy and sallow. Then there is the music. I am afraid the composer has watched Conan the Barbarian a few two many times. Operatic choir music = bad guys, every time you see them. Yuk! Those are just the minor flaws in this piece of trash.The endless action cliches and cheap devices left me groaning at such a ham-handed treatment of Tolkien. From the sacrifice of Sam, Merry, and Pippin's characters for the sake of comedy, to the crumbling staircase in Moria, to the silly wizard battle between Gandalf and Saruman (complete with the dive off the tower, only to be caught by the eagle ploy). All of this was invented by Peter Jackson, as if the book does not provide enough exciting events to draw upon. It is a long book, and clearly cuts had to be made for a manageable movie. But to expend precious minutes on protracted combats and repetitious detail of Isengard, while leaving out important story and character development is truly sad. In fact, Jackson goes so far as to drag material belonging to The Two Towers (the shortest of the three books) into this movie (which is the longest of the three books).Many of these changes do nothing for the story, sometimes even weaken it. In the books Saruman is in it for himself, believing himself to be the one person who could stand up to Sauron, if only he had the ring. His view of things has been warped by Sauron's subtle control of what he sees through the Palantir. This is much more interesting than Saruman as the avowed lackey of Sauron. The former case makes sense of the treatment Saruman gets at the end of The Two Towers, while the later does not!The combat and action should have been brief, intense, and significant. In the book none of the combat with Boromir defending Merry and Pippin is seen, just the tragic result. The battle in Balin's tomb takes up 1 page out of 400. It is short, fierce, and to the point. The incident of Frodo turning out to be okay after being speared is actually rather funny in the book. In the movie this is blown so far out of proportion I thought I would gag. It is turned into the worst of manipulative `character is killed, oh no they are okay' scenes. And for those long minutes (and many others like them) they sacrificed the Barrow Downs? Frodo's `Cow Jumped Over the Moon' table dance? The hobbits actually getting to know and trust Strider on the way to Rivendell?The worst part is the butchery of the characters. Legolas loses his light-hearted singing nature. Gimli is a caricature from a bad D&D game, replete with Irish brogue. Absent was their caustic interaction and the development of their friendship, one of the hallmarks of the books. Hobbits go from the stealthy nimble people of the books to bumbling comic relief. In the book Sam is clever, loves all things elven, knows old ballads. In the movie he is just dumb and loyal. In the movie Merry and Pippin are turned into witless juvenile troublemakers sucked into the quest willy nilly, instead of dedicated friends conspiring with Sam to go on the quest to support Frodo. And Frodo's own strongest moment, when he defies the Nazgul at the river, is taken away, leaving him just a helpless victim dragged along. And finally, back to that ending battle where is Aragorn's poignant agony watching the Fellowship fall apart under his leadership? And his tortured choice over which way to go? He doesn't have to make it, because the movie adds a scene between Frodo and him settling the matter.Then there are `the bad guys'. We can start with Sauron in the beginning. He looks like some sort of battle droid transformer monster. What is that?! He is a wizard, and in the history of Middle Earth is most famous for his guile and lies, not being a walking tank. The orcs of course they are supposed to be scary and nasty. But they are in fact a people. It is clear throughout the books that they are more than beasts. Much of the beginning of The Two Towers hinges on their own politics and personalities, as do the events in Cirith Ungol in The Return of the King. But what we see in the movie are almost-zombies who hiss and growl and grunt a word or two. The biggest problem with all of the evil portrayed in the film is the complete lack of subtlety or mystery. It's all shown in full special effects glory, rather than hinted at as in the books. Have I been frightened at movies? Plenty of times. Was I ever frightened during this one? Never.In fact, that is the big flaw in all of this. Peter Jackson has no sense of subtlety. Everything is explicit and obvious and the viewer is clubbed over the head with it. The movie is informed less by the books than by the stereotype-ridden gaming genre that came out of it. If the movie I saw was in turn novelized, the result would be just one more derivative hack and slash novel that would be forgotten a couple of years after publication.

Frodo's `Cow Jumped Over the Moon' table dance? The hobbits actually getting to know and trust Strider on the way to Rivendell?The worst part is the butchery of the characters. Legolas loses his light-hearted singing nature. Gimli is a caricature from a bad D&D game, replete with Irish brogue. Absent was their caustic interaction and the development of their friendship, one of the hallmarks of the books. Hobbits go from the stealthy nimble people of the books to bumbling comic relief. In the book Sam is clever, loves all things elven, knows old ballads. In the movie he is just dumb and loyal. In the movie Merry and Pippin are turned into witless juvenile troublemakers sucked into the quest willy nilly, instead of dedicated friends conspiring with Sam to go on the quest to support Frodo. And Frodo's own strongest moment, when he defies the Nazgul at the river, is taken away, leaving him just a helpless victim dragged along. And finally, back to that ending battle where is Aragorn's poignant agony watching the Fellowship fall apart under his leadership? And his tortured choice over which way to go? He doesn't have to make it, because the movie adds a scene between Frodo and him settling the matter.Then there are `the bad guys'. We can start with Sauron in the beginning. He looks like some sort of battle droid transformer monster. What is that?! He is a wizard, and in the history of Middle Earth is most famous for his guile and lies, not being a walking tank. The orcs of course they are supposed to be scary and nasty. But they are in fact a people. It is clear throughout the books that they are more than beasts. Much of the beginning of The Two Towers hinges on their own politics and personalities, as do the events in Cirith Ungol in The Return of the King. But what we see in the movie are almost-zombies who hiss and growl and grunt a word or two. The biggest problem with all of the evil portrayed in the film is the complete lack of subtlety or mystery. It's all shown in full special effects glory, rather than hinted at as in the books. Have I been frightened at movies? Plenty of times. Was I ever frightened during this one? Never.In fact, that is the big flaw in all of this. Peter Jackson has no sense of subtlety. Everything is explicit and obvious and the viewer is clubbed over the head with it. The movie is informed less by the books than by the stereotype-ridden gaming genre that came out of it. If the movie I saw was in turn novelized, the result would be just one more derivative hack and slash novel that would be forgotten a couple of years after publication.

Good call. Although the first Scary Movie was disgusting and funny, Scary Movie 2 doesn't deliver as much big laughs as the first one. Another point, is that the sequel isn't as sick as the first and that's a nice quality. The spoof on old movies doesn't work all the time, but the Charlie's Angels, Titanic and Mission Impossible II do. The returning cast is good (especially Cindy and Brenda), but not Ray (who's sexual identity is still questioned), and I wish a few other people would have returned.

Everything everyone knows is wrong! Let's look at this differently. Let's look at the facts here (and I'm going to point out some things that may spoil the movie for you if you have not seen it, but that's ok... You don't want to!)1. The plot is absolutely paper thin. Aliens invade earth (the aliens have no intuition on human culture, but they know what tourist landmarks to hit), and Americans fight them. That's it! Roll credits, and it's over. 2. This movie follows a time worn cliche of event location. If something big happens in an American film, it has to happen in the United states exclusively. not in the Virgin islands, not in Switzerland, not even in Canada... America. And, of course, if there is a problem, the Americans will be the only ones able to solve it. 3. Then, if Americans are going to solve it, it's going to be a band of stereotypes. This includes a rural every guy, the know it all scientist, the president (who flies a jet, no less!), and Will Smith. 4. In a really bad mix of product placement and worn plot device, an Apple computer is used to destroy an entire alien supercomputer... That destroys an entire alien superstructure... That destroys a multi million dollar movie super budget. 5. The aliens are never explained! why do they attack Earth? Who knows, but if it looks groovy, who cares? Absolutely no thought is put into the aliens. The only interesting thing about the aliens, perhaps the whole movie, is that the aliens work in space suits that are aliens in themselves. But once again, it is never explained. And the aliens are the atypical asexual non-clothed bi-pedal beings we have come to expect in sci-fi flicks. 6. The design of the alien hardware follows another worn cliche, of design following that of the decade that a movie is made. In other words, being a 1990's movie, expect lots of chrome (ala Terminator2)and compound curves. The 'mother' ships suffer from 'CG-Itis', a curious aftereffect of over indulgent CGI use. The result is a ship that looks like a pizza pie made out of glitter stucco. 7. Same guy who made this movie made Godzilla (American version...which takes place in America, not japan... see a link here?), and scads of other filmed explosions disguised as movies.And there's much much more. But given all that, people still just eat up this movie. And of course, as the response, Hollywood makes more just like it.

I'm used to finding fault with overwhelmingly popular films.  For instance, I think American Beauty is good, but far far over-rated.  But this is something new for me.  This is a film that is overwhelmingly adored, which I find to be not only over-rated, but not even any good at all.This is a bad movie, plain and simple.  Its got a really bad script.  The characters are terribly thin (with one exception Gandalf), and certain events have been so hurried that either they lack all dramatic force (The Council of Elrond) or they are utterly impenetrable to someone who doesn't already know what's happening (Lothlorien).  I realize that Jackson had the near impossible task of condensing The Fellowship of the Ring into a mere three hours (I think four is necessary, at an absolute minimum).  But the decisions he made (what he omitted, what he condense, and what he lengthened) reveal his intention to make an epic action film, rather than an epic fantasy adventure film. Even the flaws of this movie are entirely in keeping with that goal.  Action movies don't need good characters.  They need good special effects.  Action movies don't need drama, they need fights.  There is a very small minority of filmgoers who feel that action is boring.  As long as the characters are fighting, they are not in any way advancing the story.  And for a story to be good, it has to move.  There is plenty of movement in The Fellowship of the Ring.  But there are also massive sequences where the story advances not one jot for unendurable stretches of time, to allow the characters (or their obviously computer-generated counterparts) to battle some massive computer-generated foe.  The worst offender is the Moria sequence, which was at least twice as long as it ought to have been.  To those of you who say that this is the best movie ever made, I must strenuously disagree.  It's not the best movie I've seen this year, much less ever.  Nor is it the best movie I've seen this month, or even this week.  This movie is bad.

The plot is intense and interesting.  In fact, this movie has only one bad point--its low replay value.  A large part of the movie's intensity revolves around being in the same shoes as the protagonist, not knowing anything about a character beyond a brief hand-written note.  Once you know the full chronological story, which characters are good and which bad, the movie loses a lot of its effect.If you haven't seen Memento, go rent it--it's excellent.  However, once you've seen it once, little can be gained by seeing it again.Rating  10\/10 for first viewing, 4\/10 after that.  8\/10 overall.

Boring is probaly the best word to descripe this film, though you good use several others like corny, crappy, sappy, trite, disrespectful, Titanic-wannabe, or just plain bad.  The dialouge is laugable, and the actors delievering it don't do anything to help matters.  The movie so badly wants to be Titanic but can because of Michael Bay.  He should realize that he is no James Cameron, and that every film he has directed with the exception of The Rock has been horrible; this guy has absolutely no talent what so ever and needs to get out of the film business.  Another thing that makes me angry about this film is that it is trying to make money off of one of the worst events in United States history.  In the movie soliders bodies are flung across the screen like extras in a Rambo film with absolutely no respect in the least bit. Everyone involved with the film should be ashamed for not only making one of the worst movies of all time, but for being so shameful with their handling of the matter.  Take my advice, don't ever ever watch this movie.  I give this piece of crap film 0\/10.
