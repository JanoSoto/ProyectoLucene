Its writer and director is Michael Crichton who is mainly known as a novelist. His books have been adapted into other films, like the excellent earlier hard sci-fi movie The Andromeda Strain and the more adventure-orientated later film Jurassic Park. Westworld shares some pretty obvious ground with that latter Steven Spielberg blockbuster, with its story revolving around a fun-park for adults that goes horribly wrong, resulting in the human visitors becoming the prey. For my money though, Westworld is a far superior film and is a lot more involving.Its story is as simple as can be. A couple of friends go to a new high-tech fun-park called Westworld where they can play at being cowboys for a week. Not only are the environs a carefully replicated model of an 1880's Wild West town but it is also populated with androids that look and act like characters from the Wild West. The trouble is that something malfunctions and the robots turn on their human guests.It would only be fair to say that you need to stretch your incredulity a little bit to accept the scientific premises presented. The reasons given for how people cannot be harmed here are fairly ropey to say the least. But, ultimately, this isn't too important as the basic idea of the film is so interesting, so if you just roll with it you will be rewarded. The very fact that the film can play up the pleasures of both distinctive genres is in itself a great start point. What also helps is that the main characters are pretty good and believable. It's interesting how it also goes against audience expectations somewhat too with it being the meek character played by Richard Benjamin who becomes the main figure and hero, whereas the more typical alpha male James Brolin is killed off. Benjamin is pretty good in the role and makes for an engaging enough lead. But it's Yul Brynner that everyone really remembers. His turn as a cold-eyed, black-clad, gun-man android is easily the most iconic in the film. He is perfectly cast really and is excellent throughout. We also get to see the other two worlds too - Medieval World and Roman World &#x96; and it is kind of fun seeing the incongruous crossover of a gunslinger from the old west walking through Roman gardens and a medieval castle, as well as the high-tech corridors of the control area of the park.

To the point of being entirely different genre. Star Trek The Motion Picture was somewhat dull but ambitious, lagging but visually stunning, based on quite typical, but anyway interesting premise, resembling old science fiction stories. It was the slightly poorer cousin of 2001Space Odyssey. STTWK is nothing of these. It is a simple adventure movie accidentally placed in space. Its story has almost no SF elements, they are to be found only in movie's scenery. As a result it's difficult to compare both movies and I don't understand almost all such comparisons made here, on IMDb site. But personally I find STTMP superior in virtually all elements, including special effects and visuals (in the 1979 original one can really see the effort and its big budget).Putting original aside, and judging STTWK only by modern action-adventure standards I find it an extremely dated film. The acting is weird and\/or weak, the main villain outright ridiculous. Khan's motivation is unconvincing, his actions mostly unintelligent (despite film's claims of his being 'superior'), he wears rags on bare chest and looks bizarre and hilarious at the same moment. The story is full of plot holes and, in the end, is utterly boring.

However, for me, the biggest problem lay with the writing.Ronin is plagued with ambiguity throughout; we begin with a team of mercenaries who have been assembled by Deirdre (Natasha McElhone) who I think is supposed to be some kind of Irish freelance terrorist. The problem here is that we're given no background information and no real character development for any of the mercenaries. We never really learn anything about them which made it hard for me to invest in the film.The whole plot of the film revolves around Irish Terrorists and the Russian Mob both fighting to get their hands on a silver case. The Irish hire mercenaries including Sam (De Niro) and Vincent (Reno) to retrieve the case with a reward of £20,000 each for the successful retrieval of the case. Then we have the Russian Mob trying to bid for the case from the Chinese. The problem here is that we never learn why both parties want the case and we also never find out what's in the case. This was what bothered me as all through the film I kept thinking why hasn't this been explained? In the end, I just thought 'Oh well it'll be explained at the end' Alas, nothing ever was explained.Another issue I had was with Jonathan Pryce as the villain. He's a good actor, but I think he was miscast as a tough guy villain - for me he just looks too wimpy and somewhat geeky to play a tough mob type guy. To be honest, I had the same problem with him when he played the baddie in Tomorrow Never Dies and that for me made him one of the worst Bond villains despite him being a good actor.Plus points for me were that the car chases were fairly exciting and the action sequences in general were fairly impressive. The biggest problem I had was the frustratingly ambiguous story telling - poorly developed characters, no explanation of the importance of the case and no explanation as to why the Irish and the Russians were fighting to get their hands on this case. I'm not the sort of person who generally needs to be spoon fed plot points, but I think it helps if you give your audience a chance of gaining a reasonable understanding of what you are putting in front of them.

It's evident from the trailers, the reviews, the feedback, the history, heck &#x96; the posters even. In most cases for myself, despite all I hear from others, I do all I can to go in with an open mind and give the movie a fresh start. And, typically, a truly horrible movie doesn't begin that way; the set up, plot development, atmosphere and characters typically don't sink the movie within the first minute of departure.Battlefield Earth was not very typical.BAM! Right out of the gate, this movie sucked. They wasted no time in the telling the audiences this movie will be bad, and should never have been made. In fact, I am very curious to hear from the very first person during production to question the morality of the filmmakers. I certainly hope one person had their eyes open during filming.Probably not. From a laugh-out-loud opening back-story naming the aliens as Psychlos, to hilariously and amateurishly tilted shots, to special effects that would only take up a tenth of an Atari 2600 memory cartridge, to sidesplitting dialogue and acting, this movie immediately takes you for a fast ride on an unfinished roller coaster. And all I described there, you can see for yourself within the first 5 minutes of this overlong 118 minute film. Sadly, yes, this movie that was intended to go on to be a trilogy &#x96; HA &#x96; was nearly two hours.Of course, I've heard of this movie, ever since it premiered in 2000 and even before that when they were filming it. I had no desire to see it, even when people hadn't spoken the horrors this movie would produce. Once word got out, I had less a desire to see it &#x96; especially when I learned more about this new cult Scientology and its connection to the movie.Years passed and it got brought up time and again as one of the worst. Now, I might have been a bit curious just to see what many did label as the worst movie ever made, but part of me thought well, it seriously couldn't be that bad.My excuse in seeing it for the first time in almost 14 years since its release, was that a fantastic podcast (How Did This Get Made?) ran one of their segments on it. In order for me to enjoy that podcast where they dissect a film and make us laugh at the craziness the subject film was, I needed to see it.As mentioned above, my eyes, my ears, my soul could not have prepared me for this. I've been watching movies for over 30 years now and remember timeframes pretty well. Now, I wish I had seen this in theatres in May of 2000. This is a rare movie for any generation, and especially back during that time. Rare as in, most movies, as bad as they might be, would not be as colossally bad as this. So, it would've been a hoot to have my eyes wide open and mouth agape on some turkey like this actually being released during that summer.Obviously, I've bashed this movie and its, ah-hem, quality, and you might think I'm over exaggerating the depth of madness here. Don't take my word for it. If those first five minutes doesn't tell you that you're in for a disaster bigger than the Titanic, watch on.After the first blow to my stomach, i.e. those opening five minutes, the movie, mercifully, didn't get that much worse. Most movies, as described in my opening here, start okay or somewhat bad and get progressively worse as they continue. Here, what you see (in the opening) is what you get for the rest.Some movies are so bad, they're good. This is not one of those. It was an extreme chore to get through this. The clichés, the unintentionally hilarious scenes, the Travolta outbursts, the camera angles, the clumsy editing, the Star Wars rip-off scenes, the lack of charismatic heroes, pointless plot twists and numerous flaws were all so tiresome to keep up with.Some actors go crazy in the public's eye, and still, they appear to be doing their job on screen. This was everyone's chance to see John Travolta hitting rock bottom on screen. (Actually, during this year's Oscars, he pretty much proved he's not just crazy in movies.)If you don't subscribe to How Did This Get Made?, run away. Don't waste your time. There are plenty more so bad, it's good films out there. Like Troll 2, The Room, Birdemic, anything Syfy makes. Heck, Syfy films could actually remake this and put some rogue sharks with laser beams on their heads in space. And THAT would've been a better movie.* * * Final thoughts When movies are as bad as this, I generally take hundreds of notes and turn my review in to a Top Twenty-Nine (or so)&#x85; list of what I think are the funniest thoughts that entered my mind during the film. I did in this case, but gave up on #5, which is not enough to make an entire list. The reason? This movie literally bored me to tears. The shock of how bad it was over about 20 minutes in and then I just lost interest. But, not enough to turn it off. I was just determined to make it through this sewer of sh|t so I could listen to the guys (and gal) at How Did This Get Made? rant about it. At least, that part &#x96; the podcast &#x96; was worth it.

Sadly, yes, this movie that was intended to go on to be a trilogy &#x96; HA &#x96; was nearly two hours.Of course, I've heard of this movie, ever since it premiered in 2000 and even before that when they were filming it. I had no desire to see it, even when people hadn't spoken the horrors this movie would produce. Once word got out, I had less a desire to see it &#x96; especially when I learned more about this new cult Scientology and its connection to the movie.Years passed and it got brought up time and again as one of the worst. Now, I might have been a bit curious just to see what many did label as the worst movie ever made, but part of me thought well, it seriously couldn't be that bad.My excuse in seeing it for the first time in almost 14 years since its release, was that a fantastic podcast (How Did This Get Made?) ran one of their segments on it. In order for me to enjoy that podcast where they dissect a film and make us laugh at the craziness the subject film was, I needed to see it.As mentioned above, my eyes, my ears, my soul could not have prepared me for this. I've been watching movies for over 30 years now and remember timeframes pretty well. Now, I wish I had seen this in theatres in May of 2000. This is a rare movie for any generation, and especially back during that time. Rare as in, most movies, as bad as they might be, would not be as colossally bad as this. So, it would've been a hoot to have my eyes wide open and mouth agape on some turkey like this actually being released during that summer.Obviously, I've bashed this movie and its, ah-hem, quality, and you might think I'm over exaggerating the depth of madness here. Don't take my word for it. If those first five minutes doesn't tell you that you're in for a disaster bigger than the Titanic, watch on.After the first blow to my stomach, i.e. those opening five minutes, the movie, mercifully, didn't get that much worse. Most movies, as described in my opening here, start okay or somewhat bad and get progressively worse as they continue. Here, what you see (in the opening) is what you get for the rest.Some movies are so bad, they're good. This is not one of those. It was an extreme chore to get through this. The clichés, the unintentionally hilarious scenes, the Travolta outbursts, the camera angles, the clumsy editing, the Star Wars rip-off scenes, the lack of charismatic heroes, pointless plot twists and numerous flaws were all so tiresome to keep up with.Some actors go crazy in the public's eye, and still, they appear to be doing their job on screen. This was everyone's chance to see John Travolta hitting rock bottom on screen. (Actually, during this year's Oscars, he pretty much proved he's not just crazy in movies.)If you don't subscribe to How Did This Get Made?, run away. Don't waste your time. There are plenty more so bad, it's good films out there. Like Troll 2, The Room, Birdemic, anything Syfy makes. Heck, Syfy films could actually remake this and put some rogue sharks with laser beams on their heads in space. And THAT would've been a better movie.* * * Final thoughts When movies are as bad as this, I generally take hundreds of notes and turn my review in to a Top Twenty-Nine (or so)&#x85; list of what I think are the funniest thoughts that entered my mind during the film. I did in this case, but gave up on #5, which is not enough to make an entire list. The reason? This movie literally bored me to tears.

In most cases for myself, despite all I hear from others, I do all I can to go in with an open mind and give the movie a fresh start. And, typically, a truly horrible movie doesn't begin that way; the set up, plot development, atmosphere and characters typically don't sink the movie within the first minute of departure.Battlefield Earth was not very typical.BAM! Right out of the gate, this movie sucked. They wasted no time in the telling the audiences this movie will be bad, and should never have been made. In fact, I am very curious to hear from the very first person during production to question the morality of the filmmakers. I certainly hope one person had their eyes open during filming.Probably not.

Now, this is only my second time ever seeing this and I'll get into my first time many, many years ago later.

Every inch of the screen (and mind you, I don't even have a TV that can give me the best BluRay offers &#x96; 720dpi) was immaculate.But, then again, so was the movie. I am not one to look for flaws in this movie, but an hour in, I had to pause myself and think this movie has no flaws. Everything worked.

If you haven't, you must see it. Above all else, to either group of individuals, go out and buy a BluRay player (assuming you haven't already) and then buy this movie. Even cold. Buy it on BluRay and relish in the beauty and wonder of The Sound of Music.* * * Final thoughts I was born 9 years after this movie's release. Hard for me to believe that as I now think about it.

(Prices from when both the movie and chain opened.) I thought well, I've never seen it, it's considered a masterpiece and why not view it on the big screen for the first time?Almost immediately in the movie, during the opening credits, they play an instrumental medley of multiple of the movie's songs. I sat up instantly thinking Oh! I know that song! I didn't know it was in this! and repeated that thought a couple more times. It was then I was thoroughly excited to see the rest of the movie.While the movie, songs, etc, didn't disappoint, the print did. It was an original print filled with scratches, a pink tint &#x96; many discolored scenes and cuts. There was an unintentionally laugh out loud scene for me when Julie Andrews was on one side of the room and suddenly the movie jumped to her on the other side.

I mean that every single work of us is just an imitation of other people, so does the movie. The same thing that movie bring is the idea, and this little idea grow fast. Let's think about science-fiction idea, when we enter the world of cinema, we know that Metropolis is one of the first science- fiction motion pictures. Or, like Psycho, the very first American- great-horror-film. The idea of horror, however, imitated by other movie creator, that they can make people frightened with their movie. And even the idea of the movie is basically from the experience of the creator, which is influenced by other people. With that assumption, I think that Yojimbo brings brand-new-soul of the movie. As note, this is my first Kurosawa's, so maybe there was another more pure idea than Yojimbo. This new idea is the idea to impart, take sides to the truth, the real- truth, and the deep meaning of peace. I mean the feeling when you are in safe and wealth. The thought that we must not escape the reality and keep fighting until the truth win against falsity. Yes, that idea is in many stories, but the idea to translate such a complex story to a background such as this movie is really brilliant.With one literal story, Kurosawa delivered a big deal of reality of the world explicitly also implicitly. What I always thought is two criminal family refer to two great nations of the world those days. You know, it is actually like Cold-War, when two force have great-amount of power but lack of courage to attack. I mean each side want the other side lose without being blame by another people. It can be seen clearly when two criminal families first meet and try to strike each other, but the result is nobody have guts to attack. However, every side try to rent bodyguard (yojimbo) to defeat the other side. When the first maneuver begins, the protagonist just laugh, like some people laugh about the stupidity of Cold-War.But the idea not end just like that. With the wisdom and intelligence, The Samurai try to end the tyranny of two gangs. He knows that he is alone, I mean with some help of the restaurant owner and coffin maker, but he can seek the weak point of each side. He knows both side need money and will do anything for it, he can take advantage by this weakness. He broke out the winery and storage. Even, in the deep chaos, The Samurai still can feel compassion about other people. This is a kind of surprising idea. In the name of people's peace he sacrifices all his energy. Maybe, that person is what the world looking for. I mean the man who can end the long Cold-War, but that's just idealistic. As conclusion of the inner part of the movie is it brings new experience of crime even before the epic crime movie pops. You know is like Batman Begins, but that movie was released 44 years after Yojimbo. So this is an authentic one. With smart and simple twist that makes the audiences enjoy.I don't have much comment for the packaging. What I always remembered is the suspense of the music. The battle is realistic and not hyper- realistic. It is, in my opinion, very well directed and also critical. With the Japanese background, that you will not find in another culture, this movie is nothing but outstanding.

Yes, that idea is in many stories, but the idea to translate such a complex story to a background such as this movie is really brilliant.With one literal story, Kurosawa delivered a big deal of reality of the world explicitly also implicitly. What I always thought is two criminal family refer to two great nations of the world those days. You know, it is actually like Cold-War, when two force have great-amount of power but lack of courage to attack. I mean each side want the other side lose without being blame by another people. It can be seen clearly when two criminal families first meet and try to strike each other, but the result is nobody have guts to attack. However, every side try to rent bodyguard (yojimbo) to defeat the other side. When the first maneuver begins, the protagonist just laugh, like some people laugh about the stupidity of Cold-War.But the idea not end just like that. With the wisdom and intelligence, The Samurai try to end the tyranny of two gangs. He knows that he is alone, I mean with some help of the restaurant owner and coffin maker, but he can seek the weak point of each side. He knows both side need money and will do anything for it, he can take advantage by this weakness. He broke out the winery and storage. Even, in the deep chaos, The Samurai still can feel compassion about other people. This is a kind of surprising idea. In the name of people's peace he sacrifices all his energy. Maybe, that person is what the world looking for. I mean the man who can end the long Cold-War, but that's just idealistic. As conclusion of the inner part of the movie is it brings new experience of crime even before the epic crime movie pops. You know is like Batman Begins, but that movie was released 44 years after Yojimbo. So this is an authentic one. With smart and simple twist that makes the audiences enjoy.I don't have much comment for the packaging. What I always remembered is the suspense of the music. The battle is realistic and not hyper- realistic. It is, in my opinion, very well directed and also critical. With the Japanese background, that you will not find in another culture, this movie is nothing but outstanding. From the purity of peace-idea and the very end of production design, Yojimbo is really thoughtful, entertaining, but also deep. Fantastic one!

With a lovely voice cast to guide us through and it's running time being perfect, we can now truly say that Ice Age is not just a film aimed at 3 year olds. My personal feeling with this was that it is a strongly good movie and worth a watch, and so well here below is why I think it is a movie you should watch.The story is nicely paced and as said the running time doesn't drag it, it actually makes it better. The plot is fun and not icy at all with some fun jokes but with a sweet centre that can at times pull at the heart strings(well enough to say this is animation and extinct animals). I did love the characters to and I will get onto them in a little bit but they contribute massively to the story and make it flow even nicer. Maybe not superbly funny, the film I feel is meant to be just a big old adventure and if you enjoy that, then give it a go and see where it takes you.Now on to the characters, I particularly liked all three together as Ray Romano(Manny), John Leguizamo(Sid) and Denis Leary(Diego) work well and really make this film even more fun. Everyone talks about Scrat the little saber toothed squirrel who does make this film even more higher up in the world of animation with a performance that will be remembered for years, and everyone will remember he just couldn't get that acorn out. Finally on Cast I felt the voices were good and varied and I liked the way that the Saber toothed tigers sounded the same as each other, and things like the Dodo's also sounded similar.Animation isn't the top thing about this and I didn't feel it moved flowingly to be fair, although a fair point is that it was made in 2002 so I guess not to much can be expected of it in that department if made then. I loved the effect used though and some lovely looking things like snow falling and even fire are done well, but on the technical side of the film there isn't too much to talk about so best move on.It isn't that funny and maybe a point why this isn't a great film, the humour is there but sometimes it feels as if it is aimed too much at kids and that the adults taking there children there, just won't be in the cinema with them. I also said about the animation being a bit poor and well at times it can be very plain the movie scenery wise but in all fairness the animation was never a point I dragged this down on.I could just tell you that kids will enjoy this, but I also feel adults can too and if your up for an animated adventure then this is for you, especially also that isn't too long a film either. Those who want a really funny film don't watch and people who dislike more slapstick type humour also don't watch, but I would also like to say that I would recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't always watch things like this.Overall a 7\/10 from me as I felt it was Strongly a Good film, quite near to being very good but what I put in criticisms just didn't allow it. Either watching this with children, or watching by your yourself Ice Age has a little something for everyone, you won't be crying with laughter but I do think this film will leave a little warm feeling in you, and you may want to see more of it, of which there is plenty.

Yet for some reason, you can't resist her charm and you're ready to pay the big price. We're part of the same hypocrisy but when our senses are aroused, it's hard to say 'no'.This is why I believe that the greatest trick Basic Instinct ever pulled was to rise above its content, which can objectively be described as basic trash, and make people believe it had a plot, something easily disguised under the soft and silky drapes of a half-glamorous half-Hitchcockian directing, that's the film-making instinct, its one-salvation merit. Paul Verhooven is not a director renowned for his subtlety, he knows why most people will buy the ticket, and why no less will inevitably buy or rent the VHS, but after all, if you're going to make trash, why not do it with some style? Speaking from my own experience, back in the 90's, I remember Basic Instinct was the cinematic incarnation of the forbidden fruit. I was about 15 or 16 when I lamentably avoided eye contact with the VHS vendor, but obviously she knew I hadn't the profile-type of the movie geek. I saw the film waiting for the infamous leg-crossing interrogatory, then for the first sex scene between Michael Douglas and the fittingly named Jeanne Tripplehorn and then my virginal senses culminated with the climactic sex scene&#x85; needless to say that I couldn't care less about the plot; I cared for the purpose and its visually educational value, so to speak.And I guess my own experience works as a perfect defense against the allegiances of manipulative writing- manipulative here doesn't refer to the kind of plots that leads us to believe something before getting us with a 'aha' revelation, but rather the plot that doesn't ruin or elevate the film, no matter what happens - At the end, it's not about Catherine Tramell being the ice-pick killer or not &#x85; it's just about a cop, finally succumbing to his most basic impulses, and selling his soul to the devil. It's his presumption of a definite killer's innocence that seals his status as a passive character, but his weakness was the only possible driver for the sex scene. If plot there is, it only serves the purpose.The plot serves the purpose, not the opposite, indeed, but are you really surprised? What would you expect from a cop who accidentally killed innocent people, who lives alone, who's not bad-looking and who realizes he's the subject of one of the most beautiful women's fascination? -well, because besides being sexy, Sharon Stone is extraordinarily stunning and Verhooven's camera knows how to value it - the investigation, the horrific crime, the whole suspense, it all leads up to one thing  sex, sex and sex, and from the film's perspective money, money and money. And for us pleasure, pleasure and pleasure. That's the symbiotic triptych that makes the film works.Of course, this is not to diminish the cinematic merit of the film. It's easy to see in Basic Instinct some elements borrowed from the film-noir genre with Tramell as a modernization of the femme-fatale archetype. On that level, we're literally hooked to Stone's sex-appeal and during the interrogation scene, we can tell that the policemen in the room looks at her like we do, a piece of unreachable woman, a living fantasy; she's rich, she's beautiful, sexy, she has no boundaries when it comes to sex, she loves having new experiences, so many qualities that make her being a potential killer  a chance many of us would take, let alone, a flawed and loose cannon like Douglas' character.So, as we follow the mystery, the evolution, wondering if she or her lesbian lover or any woman who idolized us in the past committed the crime, we realize that these considerations hardly matter, because at the end, the 'hero' slept with her before the investigation was over. The plot reminds of Sea of Love but there are reasons why Basic Instinct stood out for posterity (besides the leg-crossing), its Sharon Stone and the way this cloud of false ambiguity never ceases to surround her. But as if it was victim on its own take, it's so ambiguous it never wants to take the chances to reveal us, who done it. Is it a flaw or strength? Again, does the pay-off make the film any less enjoyable? After 22 years, the film isn't as crude as today's productions. If I was a teen now, I wouldn't probably need to rent the DVD, with the Internet and the globalization of pornography, the standards of fantasies have been raised to infinitesimal summits &#x85; and for some reason, it deprives the material from the 'trashy' core that repulsed the critics. We look at it like a movie about a cop being alienated by his own lust, and making the line between crimes, sex and moral thinner and thinner. It's all about these 'basic' instincts, and that look in Sharon Stone's eyes on the iconic poster.Well, on a basic level, the film works, the directing is smooth and confident, and maintain an atmosphere of eeriness and mystery thanks to Jerry Goldsmith's score, one of the most defining of the 90's, and it launched Stone's career, making her the top-off-the-head star when it comes to define sexiness.

Sure, there are many &#x96; millions? &#x96; that do adore him and more power to them. And I could easily suggest they watch this movie to prove my point on how incredibly untalented, unfunny and dumb this lucky sob is. But&#x85;in Sandler's defense (GULP,) anyone could have a shaky start such as this one. So, while this disaster of a film isn't really proof of much&#x85;it is a hint of what his movies will eventually become.I came home one night from work nearly two months ago &#x96; yeah, it's taken me awhile to finally write this &#x96; and all I wanted to do was watch an incredibly bad movie to laugh at and not with. Normally, I wouldn't select a Sandler film &#x96; they're typically so bad, my mouth is agape more than anything else, but when I learned of both the viewer rating on this (which is currently at 1.9\/10 stars) and that it was his first film, I had to see it.This movie disgusted me more than made me laugh. Still, to this day, it's like sh|t is still on my clothes that I cannot discard and I am powerless to that awful smell. I am not kidding this movie is that bad.It didn't help that the movie started off with the vilest of cartoon intros. If I was able to post pictures in this review, I would provide you with proof of how insane, repulsive and gross they are. And I am not talking about potty humor or body parts. I am speaking of poorly drawn cartoons of Sandler's dumb facial expressions.Had the rest of the movie continued as an animated feature with that cartoon caricature of Sandler, I surely would've turned off the movie. Well, I should've anyways, because it didn't get better.Yeah, the budget seemed like it was at near zero and Sandler, himself, warns us of there being no money, but the lack of any talent from anyone behind the camera, in front of it or even holding it is more disturbing to me than the money fronted to make this happen.Basically, and I am giving the plot too much credit with that word, Adam's jealous of another funny man on a cruise ship and spends most of the movie daydreaming his way into the spotlight.Nothing works here. Not a single line, not a single joke, not a single frame. I would say the movie was written by preteen boys with their horny minds, but even they would find this movie in offensively bad taste.Sure, I despise Sandler's work. This wasn't going to change my mind one way or another. But, nothing, NOTHING, could've prepared me for this train wreck of absolute garbage.* * * Final thoughts #1 this movie came out in 1989&#x85;in the SUMMER season. Why couldn't this have pushed his future career overboard?? #2, it *did* have a budget. Of $200,000. If you dare, and I highly recommend you don't, please, PLEASE, tell me where any of that was spent. #3, this doesn't even fit in the so bad, it's good category. You can watch any of the most recent Sandler movies for that category. Say, the past two decades worth of this films.
