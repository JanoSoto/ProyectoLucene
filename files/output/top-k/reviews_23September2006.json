Hitch was actually famous for stating that he never read the base material more than one time before beginning to think the film.For people arguing that Minghella's adaptation is closer to the source material than Clement's I have to say that You are missing the point. Both are pretty good psycho-thrillers, but both only borrows parts of Highsmith to prove their own point, which I, as Hitch would have, believe is the sane way of adapting.Actually what is called The homo-erotic Overtones in comments are blown up in the latest version more than they are toned down in the first one. Highsmith is quite aware of the frigthning aspect of a male villain that seem to be too much interested in another male character - and she used that very well in Strangers on a Train. But she used it as Hitchcock did, not only when he was adapting her stories, but in much of his work. The Hero\/Villain would in his film often be sexually weak (think Rear Window, Rope, Psycho) but more that making these characters gay - which some of them obviously was - he used this as conveying a strangeness to the character. Some might say, that he would have made his characters more obviously gay, had he lived in a time, where it is possible to do so (the same might be said of Clement), but again we're then missing the point.We should never object to elements in a movie, suspecting it would have been different (better) were it made today. It's a fog blinding the real qualities of the movie itself.Now what about Plein Soleil You'd might ask. It's no masterpiece but a nearly forgotten gem that should be seen on as big a screen as you can get it to play on. Nino Rota (credited as Rotta) has made a compelling score, the cinematography is excellent and the acting is from very good to outstanding.And should we compare the two versions, Minghella has surely ripped of the best of the scenes from the original adaptation. Not that stealing isn't allowed in the arts - but it IS a bit funny, that a movie about a con-artist, that can imitate whoever he want, is itself a sort of an impersonator.See them both.

Apparently, the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties! Despite this, the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie. In some ways it's a lot better and in other ways, it is definitely not.The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people. In fact, the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking. The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair (particularly on the back and shoulders) and his lady love is, to put it frankly, unattractive. They are a very, very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version. And the ill-fated husband is really, really obese and loves to walk around shirtless--and his counterpart in the American film, Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking (and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads, actually). And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film--since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed dish like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway--I am 100% sure she would have had dozens of better offers! Whereas, the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable.Part of the Italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex. The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway, they never actually get around to sex! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic. In addition to the casual sexuality of the film, it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life--with lots of sweaty people, a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath.The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film. And what you get due to brevity isn't all good. The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film--with grainier footage, relatively poor orchestration and sets. It sure ain't a pretty film, but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic. But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot. Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over. And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film--and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats (the best part of the American film).So which is the better film? Well, a lot of this probably depends on you. As for me, the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic (though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles)--but it packed a great ending. And the Italian film was much, much more realistic--until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed. So neither film is exactly great, but I'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better. It's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film.

Apparently, the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties! Despite this, the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie. In some ways it's a lot better and in other ways, it is definitely not.The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people. In fact, the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking. The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair (particularly on the back and shoulders) and his lady love is, to put it frankly, unattractive. They are a very, very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version. And the ill-fated husband is really, really obese and loves to walk around shirtless--and his counterpart in the American film, Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking (and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads, actually). And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film--since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed dish like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway--I am 100% sure she would have had dozens of better offers! Whereas, the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable.Part of the Italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex. The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway, they never actually get around to sex! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic. In addition to the casual sexuality of the film, it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life--with lots of sweaty people, a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath.The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film. And what you get due to brevity isn't all good. The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film--with grainier footage, relatively poor orchestration and sets. It sure ain't a pretty film, but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic. But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot. Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over. And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film--and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats (the best part of the American film).So which is the better film? Well, a lot of this probably depends on you. As for me, the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic (though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles)--but it packed a great ending. And the Italian film was much, much more realistic--until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed. So neither film is exactly great, but I'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better. It's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film.

Then i had to see it again. This time i went with some friends.When i walked out after the second showing i realised that the film was disaster rubbish with sit com comedy dominating the entire feature. The proof is in the daft stereotypes. Jeff Goldblum takes the film seriously for about five minutes (during the arrival of the massive ships over the New York skyline) after that as far as Goldblum's concerned its Laurel and Hardy time with Will Smith's fighter pilot when they team up at the end to take on the mother ship. Then there is Will Smith. The director must have just said to smith 'Just be yourself' meaning Fresh Prince of Bel air in a military uniform. Smith is much better in Men In Black (a real comedy) and the excellent i, robot so it is a shame he just made his character into a complete parody of the Hero.Special mention must go to Randy Quaid for playing one of the most annoying characters in movie history. Rand's character is to this film what Jar Jar Binks was to the later Star Wars prequel The Phantom Menace.The potential to make a great invasion thriller with measured humour and stunning thrills and chills is lost amid silly comic capers and daft one liners between insipid characters.

So scientist and military and politicians must now find a way to destroy the beast before it destroys all of Japan. The movie is very good and rather sad at the same time. The sweeping march on Tokyo is very well done as there is a rather good scene of a mother with her children surrounded by flames trying to comfort her kids by saying they will be with their father soon. Also a very good ending and very sad ending. It is also an ending in the Japanese version that warns that other Godzilla's may emerge and indeed they do as the next Godzilla to emerge would actually never be killed and end up being somewhat of a hero, kind of funny they did turn one of the most effective destructive monsters scarred by radiation into a hero, however I liked those Godzilla movies as well.

I was so immersed in the film, had i not been told it was a 3hour movie, I wouldn't have guessed.I must admit, the basic synopsis of the movie 'Guy takes on the role of Postman to ensure the mail gets through during an apocalypse', its not a very inspiring one, and its one that the critics absolutely hammered on about. In fact I wouldn't be surprised that a lot of the critics hadn't even seen the movie, and judged it solely on that synopsis.Shame on them!Here was this movie that got absolutely slated by the critics and the media, and plenty of people who clearly had never watched it. It seems to me the boy Costner had the audacity to do well with Dances With Wolves, and the claws were out after that.I liked The Postman. It was as thought provoking as DWW, but in a different way.Solid performances from the cast, especially Will Patton who does well in every role he plays.I really was expecting it to be a stinker, and it was so not a stinker. Perhaps the critics opinions had swayed me a little.Its interesting to note that most of the comments left by people about this movie are quite positive. I've read through quite a few of the negative comments, and most fall into the category of utter sheeplike banality, trying to outdo each other for the most 'humourous' missive, generally aimed at Costner.I think in the future, time will be much kinder to The Postman than the critics of past were, and people will begin to appreciate it more and more.When you get a popcorn movie like Transformers exceeding 2hrs in duration, all of a sudden, The Postmans running time doesn't seem a lot.If you haven't seen the movie, i implore you to do so, never have the critics got it so completely wrong.Had the movie been boring, i couldn't have sat there for 3 hours uninterrupted.It's a pity that the critics 'won' against Costner, because he hasn't done a movie like this again, which is a crime as he's a very capable director and actor. Still, no doubt it will be some other poor sods turn next. Watch your back Mel Gibson!

Have we learned anything? Charlie Sheen is excellent, and never looked better (at this point he was not as marred by his celebrity). While the young son is worried about Rolexes and how to make skim money from shareholders, Martin Sheen as his father at the airline, which will soon be decimated by Gordon Gekko (well portrayed by Douglas). The scene with his father in the elevator is brilliant; as Budd Fox (Charlie Sheen) is quoting Gekko's mantras, Martin Sheen replies ...I never judged a man by the size of his wallet...; so sad and true. The two generations at odds about lifestyles and careers. Martin Sheen also quotes the Bible; regarding false prophets, he basically tells his son the same rape and pillage has gone on for centuries; very well-written.Oliver Stone presents everything in a filtered, other-worldly haven; sushi; the ten million dollar NYC apartment (I have allowed for inflation), a beach house in the Hamptons, this is after all the American dream. We are supposed to cheat, steal, maim and kill to get it.We see Gordon Gekko's wife (Sean Young) a nice ornamental symbol of his success. Even his child who is briefly seen, may as well be another consumer product (just like the robot toy he buys for his son). Darryl Hannah was a perfect choice as the unfazed one-dimensional decorator, hooking up with Sheen for awhile (until he loses his money that is).The sets and characters are priceless, including the crude NY realtor salivating over her commission as Sheen picks out his first Upper East Side apartment. Look for John C. McGinley as a young arrogant trader (too funny) Hal Holbrook as the traditionalist. Terence Stamp is excellent as Sir Larry Wildman, who is a robber baron, but still has some conscience (as opposed to Gordon Gekko) Overall though, Charlie Sheen was never better; James Spader also has a brief cameo.Everyone who missed the 80's should watch this film. For those of us who survived, we can breathe a sigh of relief, and those who think corporations will take care of them in ten years, will be in for a rude awakening. Hopefully Oliver Stone will soon do another film of the same nature, perhaps he could use Enron to tell the side of the story from a human perspective. 9\/10.
