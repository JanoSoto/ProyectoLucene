The Deer Hunter is very different from most films. Aside from having some the best performances ever witnessed, the direction of both the films and its character's contribution to the film is like a play divided into acts. Act one centers around a group of Russian American Steel workers, Michael (Deniro), Nick (Walken) and Steven (Savage) all prepare for a journey that will change their lives, as much as those whom love them most. The setting is 1968, Clairton Pennsylvania, in the dark times of Vietnam. The film's leads are preparing for their service into Vietnam, enjoying their final days of fun and freedom with as much free spirit as any other day they went drinking, only to at some point lose that very spirit of hope at the wake of the dark times ahead. Aside from having the well talented leads, lets introduce the other members of this laid back, and almost family bonded group of friends. There's Axel (Aspegren) and his poetic ways of talking, Stan (Cazale) their womanizing, gun flinging nut, John (Welsh) their bartender, and Linda (Streep) Nick's girl. Just from seeing them sing so cheerfully in the bar, celebrating Stevens wedding to be, shows just how close this group is, and how devastating the very events to come will be. As many can remember, Vietnam was a Hell America never wishes to revisit. The damage done by Vietnam is well examined in the The Deer Hunter, as it shows the effects of it's mental and social damages to so much more than just it's 3 leads. Michael and the gang prepare for quite a good bye, in their last Deer hunting trip, traveling up to the mountains. One Shot a quote made by the proud and very direct leader Michael. Michael character is both a likable, but on some occasions a very questionable guy, using a calm and serious attitude to motivate his actions through most of the film. He hunts deer with complete discipline, and he follows his friends with absolute loyalty. In the wake of the films second act, the Vietnam arc, we witness torture, inhumanities through the sadism of Russian Roulette, and even a mental penetration through the 3 friends, especially Nick, forever damaging their hopes of living a normal life. Michael comes back in one piece, Steven not so much, and Nick doesn't even come back home, using his pain and convinced belief of his friend's demise to bury his old life, and start a new, and only more tainted way of living. The 3rd and final act flows more nicely, as Michael's return home is explored with the typical mental anguish of all Vietnam vets, feeling not right in the head, as well as having a much more valuable understanding of life. With his one shot code, he misses his chance in hi latest chance at a deer. His bonding with Linda, grows even more, as his personal feeling for her become more open and more real, in the midst of their lips touching. Despite how charming the tone of the3rd act seemed it all came to end with the death of Nick. Upon discovering he was alive, Michael traveled to Saigon, hoping to keep his promise of never leaving him there, and bringing him home. His attempts at finding and returning Nick home are almost as chaotic as the images of the fall of Saigon. Nick's made quite name for himself in Russian Roulete, making the concept of gambling so much worth while in the eyes of the money grubbing monsters. As the American attraction, his state of mind is both cold and shattered, for upon his reunion with Michael, there is nothing. His memory is somewhere else, all caused by the drug abuse, and the very image war has caused for him. Michaels loyalty to his friend was strong enough to break through, but not enough to save him from what had already consumed him, or his friends war. The Deer Hunter is both a riveting exploration into the very damage done by war to both soldiers, and their surroundings. Director Michael Cimano gives each character something to have been affected by Vietnam. Michael no longer hunt deer, seeing the true nature of taking it's life, Nick couldn't even think right anymore that it drove him to running away and burying his old life in drug abuse and sadism. Steven's loss of his limbs affected both his marriage as well as his capabilities of talking to his wife. Basically Vietnam affected all of them. This whole group of friends began so happy, and ended so miserably, picking themselves off in Nick's funeral with the glory of America's national anthem, thus lifting their spirits from the dark abyss life had put them in. On a personal note, I think of this film is so much more than just an examination on the effects of War. I think it goes to examine the concept of life, and how it can just change so easily, affecting the way people continue, or chose to live it from that point. Aside from that note, it's a movie that I can call a personal favorite and truly extraordinary in both the acting and direction. It's also very oriented on trademarks, especially on the uses of its Russian religion in both the wedding scenes and even during their attributed toasts. The memorable trademark is the use of Russian roulette. I know it's very sick, and almost hard to watch, but it establishes itself as main negative factors towards several of the character's inner destruction.

Cunningham, director of Friday the 13th, probably the next most influential slasher film after John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), the film does have a nice suspenseful tone, some pretty creative camera-work, and some of Tom Savini's best special effects work outside of what he's done with George A. Romero (it is a shame that the tight-wads at the MPAA censored the crap out of this movie, and most people wouldn't be able to see this film in its full uncut gory glory until 2009).Too bad the rest of the movie isn't up to par. Friday the 13th, to its credit, does rehash many of the stylistic techniques made famous in Halloween (though of course that movie didn't originate them, but made them popular), including hiding the identity of the assailant by giving a first-person perspective of the mayhem, a gutsy female protagonist, a memorable score (by Harry Manfredini), the first-person stalking of potential victims, and lots of creative blood-drenched killings.I must say that I am not a fan of the Friday the 13th movies. I've always believed them to be the least innovative of the post-Halloween slasher imitators. I tried to watch this film a long while back, but stopped after about 20 minutes because I thought it was so bad. Having watched the film in its entirety finally, I feel that I can at least confirm my mixed feelings about this flick. To give credit to the filmmakers, the deaths are pretty slick (I have yet to see the uncut version of the film yet, but oh well), the mood is pretty intense especially in the last 20 minutes, Tom Savini's special effects - what's left of them in the film, at least - are off the wall, the Manfredini score chills you to the bone and I can honestly see why it's so popular finally, though I'm not sure I agree with the reasons why.The film is nicely directed, but lazily written and acted (the low-budget can probably be blamed for some of this, but I think I can excuse it). Friday the 13th opens at the now-infamous Camp Crystal Lake in 1958, and two hormonally-charged camp counselors are promptly dispatched by an unseen assailant. 22 years later, the camp's owners are trying to get it fixed up in an effort to have it re-opened. Despite the warnings of the town's superstitious locals, six new counselors have showed up in town to aid in the repairs. Soon enough, they all start getting knocked off one at a time in some pretty creative and gruesome fashions.Friday the 13th is most notorious for having jump-started probably the longest-running horror franchise in cinema history. It's also notorious for giving birth to the most boring screen slasher ever Jason Voorhees. Though of course, in this movie the killer is actually Jason's mother Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer). Jason wouldn't appear on-screen himself until the next feature, Friday the 13th, Part 2 (1981).5\/10P.S.

The man then drives off at speed and after abandoning his broken down vehicle, Bone completes the rest of his journey on foot.On the following day, the body of a high school cheerleader is found in the alleyway and Bone becomes the chief suspect. After having been questioned by the police, he gets released and later joins his friend Alex Cutter (John Heard) at a street parade where he sees the man that he believes he saw in the alleyway the night before. Bone doesn't know who the man is but crippled Vietnam War veteran Cutter does and immediately wants to follow through on this lead.J.J.Cord (Stephen Elliott) is a powerful oil tycoon who Cutter has known about for many years. He's aware of some terrible things that he's done in the past and resentful of the fact that people like him don't seem to get punished for their crimes. Cutter learns that Cord's car was found burnt out on the night of the murder and the victim (who was sexually assaulted before being brutally murdered) was last seen near the hotel where Cord was attending a function. These pieces of information are enough to convince Cutter of Cord's guilt and he decides to try to expose him as the culprit.Cutter and the murdered girl's sister then devise a plan to blackmail Cord. Bone is reluctant to get involved but is eventually (against his better judgement) persuaded to help. The blackmailing scheme doesn't go as planned but Cutter continues with his efforts to bring Cord to justice right up until the movie's excellent conclusion.Cutter and Bone were part of a generation that, after the idealism of the 1960s , became deeply disenchanted in the 1970s. The ways in which the two men reacted to this situation, however, were quite different. Cutter had lost a leg, an eye and part of one of his arms in the War and returned home angry and bitter and also full of hate for some of the powerful people in society (such as J.J.Cord) who never suffer in the same way that the veterans do. Cutter's ever present fury led to him becoming a volatile alcoholic who became obsessed with satisfying his overpowering need to take his revenge out on Cord who, in his eyes, was the very embodiment of evil and corruption.Bone by contrast worked as a yacht salesman and was a part time gigolo. His experiences had made him cynical and seriously apathetic. He no longer had any beliefs or commitment to anything and had no desire to challenge anyone with Cord's type of wealth and position.Cutter's wife Mo (Lisa Eichhorn) had seen her world collapse and had also responded by hitting the bottle. She was tolerant and understood the ferocity of her husband's feelings but her situation had also made her habitually depressed. She cared deeply for both Cutter and Bone but also felt that her existence had become directionless.The portrayals of Cutter, Bone and Mo are all exceptionally good and leave a lasting impression.

The man then drives off at speed and after abandoning his broken down vehicle, Bone completes the rest of his journey on foot.On the following day, the body of a high school cheerleader is found in the alleyway and Bone becomes the chief suspect. After having been questioned by the police, he gets released and later joins his friend Alex Cutter (John Heard) at a street parade where he sees the man that he believes he saw in the alleyway the night before. Bone doesn't know who the man is but crippled Vietnam War veteran Cutter does and immediately wants to follow through on this lead.J.J.Cord (Stephen Elliott) is a powerful oil tycoon who Cutter has known about for many years. He's aware of some terrible things that he's done in the past and resentful of the fact that people like him don't seem to get punished for their crimes. Cutter learns that Cord's car was found burnt out on the night of the murder and the victim (who was sexually assaulted before being brutally murdered) was last seen near the hotel where Cord was attending a function. These pieces of information are enough to convince Cutter of Cord's guilt and he decides to try to expose him as the culprit.Cutter and the murdered girl's sister then devise a plan to blackmail Cord. Bone is reluctant to get involved but is eventually (against his better judgement) persuaded to help. The blackmailing scheme doesn't go as planned but Cutter continues with his efforts to bring Cord to justice right up until the movie's excellent conclusion.Cutter and Bone were part of a generation that, after the idealism of the 1960s , became deeply disenchanted in the 1970s. The ways in which the two men reacted to this situation, however, were quite different. Cutter had lost a leg, an eye and part of one of his arms in the War and returned home angry and bitter and also full of hate for some of the powerful people in society (such as J.J.Cord) who never suffer in the same way that the veterans do. Cutter's ever present fury led to him becoming a volatile alcoholic who became obsessed with satisfying his overpowering need to take his revenge out on Cord who, in his eyes, was the very embodiment of evil and corruption.Bone by contrast worked as a yacht salesman and was a part time gigolo. His experiences had made him cynical and seriously apathetic. He no longer had any beliefs or commitment to anything and had no desire to challenge anyone with Cord's type of wealth and position.Cutter's wife Mo (Lisa Eichhorn) had seen her world collapse and had also responded by hitting the bottle. She was tolerant and understood the ferocity of her husband's feelings but her situation had also made her habitually depressed. She cared deeply for both Cutter and Bone but also felt that her existence had become directionless.The portrayals of Cutter, Bone and Mo are all exceptionally good and leave a lasting impression.

T Anderson, the man who would go on to create There Will Be Blood, this film is not one you watch lightly, but rather one you set aside a whole evening for, lights out, preferably alone or with someone equally as enthusiastic (as is the case with most of his work) and engross yourself in for a good three hours.That three hours is an unusual urban tale in which a host of strangers' stories intertwine, each affecting another in some way. The film is about death, regret and lost opportunities (uplifting stuff!) It is moving beyond measure, a good 90% of the film set to a stunning soundtrack, including powerfully relevant tracks by Aimee Mann, that becomes as vivid and important a character as any of the screen players. This is unconventional cinema that requires some patience, but rewards that patience massively, with great, complex characters, played by a top-notch cast amongst whom there is not a weak link Tom Cruise is a perfect scumbag with whom we empathise anyway; Julianne Moore is at career-best as a woman who was a gold-digging leach, and who then fell in love with a man whose fate is now out of everyone's hands; William H Macy is an ex boy-genius, now a lost soul just looking to fit in for once, and the young Jeremy Blackman is the current boy-genius, sadly destined to follow in his footsteps. We have Philip Seymour Hoffman, who it would appear can do no wrong, in a relatively small but impacting role as a carer, John C. Reilly as a devoutly religious cop, who is in love with a cocaine-addicted no-hoper, played with intensity by Melora Walters. And there's plenty more...P.T. Anderson's ability to manage tone is remarkable, the film at once funny, heart-warming, sad and heartbreaking, part music video (at one point quite literally), and with a surreal final act, which can put some people off, but whose religious reference is important to those who would understand it. Anderson is a fascinating filmmaker, and love or hate it, you certainly won't walk away from Magnolia unchallenged or without reaction. He would go on to up his game with There Will Be Blood, but this is nevertheless a superb and strange drama that has high impact.
