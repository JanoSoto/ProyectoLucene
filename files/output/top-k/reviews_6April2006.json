I took one film class in college, but none of those movies struck so many nerves as this one...one of the best movies I've ever seen...not an exaggeration.(A)...so many themes...a great whodunit, father\/son relations, first loves, haunting past\/present memories, race relations, good cop\/bad cop (and grayness in between), immigration, political maneuvering, and probably several others I missed (need to watch it again and again). Somehow they were all blended together and presented in a way that wasn't overwhelming or too cerebral. I have the sense that this film has a timeless quality and will never be dated (kind of like The Godfather). (B)...such perfect casting and understated acting where the story is front and center and the actors blend into it. The story overshadows all else, especially when you realize how little McConaughey and Kristofferson are actually on screen...but their characters are so powerful and dialogue between present-day figures fills in the mythic proportions that these characters take on. Cooper and Pena are fantastic together, and you can feel the smoldering heat that has remained over the years...not necessarily from the dialogue, but the momentary pauses and gazes between them, and the way they don't address things head-on but dance around them because they're too painful or heavy.(C)...I loved the cuts from past to present day...seems like such a simple camera technique but maybe the brilliance is in the simplicity. And the jail scene where Sam helps release Pila's son...as Pila walks off, the camera backs away but locked onto Sam, and you can just feel his enduring but suppressed love, even BEFORE you know the full history between him and Pila...so brilliant! I just love the way the story was revealed slowly and deliberately...no instant, MTV gratification here...the payoff is following and enjoying the slow and winding pace of the story. The bluesy musical arrangements also provided a melancholy backdrop...the Texan landscapes, passionate\/deliberate characters, and the sense of loss and passage of time.I definitely need to rush out and rent\/buy some Sayles movies, but I can't believe I've never heard of this brilliant, talented individual.

It was a definite groundbreaker, on the level of stuff like Star Wars, for nothing like it had been seen before and since then, it has had a slew of followers, none of which have quite lived up to it's greatness (even from Pixar themselves). To date, I have seen story around as often as I have seen Terminator 2 (six or seven times) and, fittingly it ranks up there with my favourite films. So you could imagine my surprise back in 2000 when the sequel to Toy Story, Toy Story 2, continued the legacy of the original. Sure, it isn't quite as groundbreaking, but hell, whatd'ya expect, it's a sequel! To think that Disney was going to make this one straight-to-video. That would've been disgraceful for a film of this magnitude. I have 'only' seen Toy Story 2 around three or four times. As fate would have it, I saw it again last night. As a teenager, I am almost ashamed to be enjoying this film, but hey, that's Pixar for you...not only do they appeal to little kids, they appeal to adults and teens as well. They've always had that mystic quality about them (with the exception of the disappointing A Bug's Life). The plot is decidedly interesting. Woody winds up with a few old collectables from his old show, The Roundup Gang. Turns out that he is of a lot of value. There's Stinky Pete (look for a hilarious outtake at the end credits which shows why he is called 'Stinky Pete') and Jessie the cowgirl. It is here that, us, as the audience, witnesses a somewhat overly sentimental yet interesting deconstruction of Jessie. How she was abandoned by the girl who loved her. Woody, it would seem, will have to face up to a similar problem when Andy grows up. Buzz Lightyear and his crew get caught up at a toy store. On the way, some funny pratfalls do ensue, such as the regimented wackiness of the 'replacement' Buzz and those three aliens (Look! It's the mystic portal!). The outtakes at the end also give us a good reason to stick around.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen show their funny sides. It is clear here that Tim Allen can be a funny guy sometimes (shame we rarely see this) and he appears to have found his calling with the character of Buzz Lightyear. Tom Hanks plays Woody like he did in Toy Story; as philosophical yet somehow optimistic cowboy who does not know where to go. They are well supported by Joan Cusack and Kelsey Grammar, who play their characters, Jessie and Stinky Pete, appropriately.There is of course, the animation to discuss. As usual, I will not discuss Pixar's animation in any great depth, since you, the reader, will know what I will say about how dazzling, clean-cut and colourful it is, etc, etc. In short, Toy Story 2 is a wonderful film which should not be missed for the world, by kids, adults or even teens. It is right up there with the best of Pixar, second behind only Toy Story. That is only due to the fact that the first Toy Story is more groundbreaking. Try as they might, Dreamworks' best, both of the Shreks, cannot realistically match up to either of the Toy Story movies. Time will fly by as you watch this.

Schneer and Ray Harryhausen, this one is easily the weakest. Firstly, Patrick Wayne is dull as heck in the role of Sinbad. Secondly, the film is much too long. Thirdly, the dialog and story are poor even for this kind of movie. But not to despair there are several great reasons to watch it. The great Harryhausen monsters and the very sexy Jane Seymour are the main reasons. The great locations in Malta, Jordan and Spain are also very well chosen and add to the atmosphere. They seem like mysterious lands where monsters could be lurking at every turn(and usually are). The Harryhausen monsters are great especially the Troglodyte and the chess playing baboon. The Minoton is also cool (only in the animated sequences but certainly not when it is a man in a rubber suit). What can I say about Jane Seymour but WOW!! What she lacks in acting ability she makes up for in screen presence and beauty. Upon re-viewing the film I realized that the Sinbad character does almost nothing useful until the very end when he fights the Tiger. He is mainly there to go along with the other characters and look good. Wayne plays him with almost no personality whatsoever. Taryn Power (Tyronne's daughter) is OK in a secondary role but I suspect she was cast more for her looks than anything else. Margaret Whiting is completely over-the-top as the villainous Zenobia but at least she seems to be having fun with all the corny dialog(her transformation into a seagull is laughable and the only bad special effect in the film). One thing that struck me as odd is with the amount of great location footage shot in this film almost all the closeups were shot in a studio with a blue screen. This is very weird as it is obvious that the main cast are in the long and medium shots, shot on location. Did the producers run out of time or money before shooting the close-ups or what? Overall a good film to see on a rainy day or with a child. If you let your imagination take over it works even better.

There are so many scenes in this movie that are memorable, I couldn't talk about them all without taking up way too much space.The dialogue in this film is magnificent. Samuel Jackson and John Travolta as hit men have most of the best lines, but they are not the only ones with incredible lines.

It is not particularly original - I have seen this sort of cop-buddy movie done about a thousand times before, along with the 'renegade cop' thing. But Beverly Hills Cop stands out as one of the better ones of its genre. One reason for this is Eddie Murphy. Lately, his presence has been a waste of screen time - look at him in The Haunted Mansion! But here, he seems in his element - he's fresh, he's likable and he's pretty funny at times. He always seems to inject his humour at the right times, like when he rants on about Michael Jackson and defuses a potentially awkward situation. Beverly Hills Cop is a slick movie, it must be said. It may just be Beverly Hills, but there is a slickness about the movie which is noticeable. For example, the expensive hotels, the luxury cars - yes indeed, Eddie Murphy's character, Axel Foley, is really out of his element here. A real...fish out of water. Foley, you see, is used to living in the 'ghetto' that is Detroit - crappy car, derelict buildings - no, Foley doesn't have it easy. Another thing which apparently doesn't exist in Beverly Hills is the unorthodox nature of Foley. I am just thinking about how unoriginal all of this really is - the stupid chief, the renegade cop who is always right, etc, etc. But it still works better than a movie like Die Hard 2. Mind you, Die Hard 2 is not a bad movie (see that review for more), but Beverly Hills Cop has something that Die Hard 2 doesn't...maybe some humour. Or maybe the fact that there is no strip bar scene in Die Hard 2! ) The theme music here is memorable, as well.The acting was OK I guess. The only one who really does well, like I said, is Murphy. Steven Berkoff is somewhat cold (although not really menacing) as the villain of the piece, while the rest are adequate.As well as being a good comedy, Beverly Hills Cop also delivers on action. There is a good shootout near the end of the film, at what I believe to be the same mansion which was used in Commando. The chase scene at the start is also eyecatching and I couldn't help laughing when Foley threw one of Berkoff's thugs into a buffet. And what about the banana trick? Overall, this is a good action movie which provides some good comedy as well. It does not score any points for originality, but it does deserve it's reputation as one of the better cop-buddy movies. Although I would never call Beverly Hills Cop great as such, it is still definitely worth a watch or two. I could definitely watch it again.4\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"6 April 2006","score":"","review":" Out of curiosity, I decided to get Beverly Hills Cop.

Starting with the animated blowing, popping bubbles, the entrance to the Daytime Awards, the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet, the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech, the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer, under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then, all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way, no, make that a great way. This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives, she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower, but if I run across an episode I'd watch it. Robert Downey, jr., does a great turn as slimy, smarmy, snaky, sycophantic David Seaton Barnes, the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show, if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead.Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie, just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. Here, all she has to do is scream I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP! or give one of her anti-Celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin, and she has me rolling in the aisles. Yes, Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress, and one hell of a comedienne. Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies, and we're all reminded why she is who she is today, having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor, but like a caterpillar in a cocoon, the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy, serious roles, that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen.How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher, if only for a glorified cameo. She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. She takes a role which, in the hands of a lesser actress, could easily have been forgotten, but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself.How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! At the time, she wasn't really known for much. Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute (yes, I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price), but she didn't hold my attention - - much. But here, she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who, of course, turns out to be the niece's father, and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother.I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy, or at least a novela. If you've seen it, then reminisce. If you haven't, you've missed a real classic, but not really. The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years, and this movie is timeless, so what the hell.

While he has been accused of exaggerating things about his life in his books, the stories presented still are realistic and shocking, and give insight about the mind of this complex and often-troubled man, regardless if if they are real or fiction. Chopper, the movie, is not based exactly on Read's life, but in the series of anecdotes he wrote in his first books.Eric Bana plays Chopper and gives one of his best performances to date, capturing the very essence of the living legend Chopper has become now. It is not a surprise that this film gave him recognition out of Australia and turned him into an international star. but even when the movie is centered around Chopper, Simon Lyndon and Kate Beahan's performances shine in their roles as Chopper's cell mate Jimmy and Chopper's girlfriend Tanya respectively.Like Read's books, the movie is not exactly a biography, but a collection of tales surrounding the now-mythical figure of Chopper, presented in a way that perfectly mixes strange surrealism with harsh realism. The gritty semi-documentary look the film has enhances this feeling as well as the cold way the violence is presented. Like the real Chopper, the film walks the fine line between fact and fiction, and that's what makes it very appealing and interesting.It could be said that Director Andrew Dominik painted an accurate portrait of Chopper the legend, not of the real person; and that's probably what the real Chopper may prefer. Domink plays with the moods, going from serious drama to awkwardly funny scenes in this character study that presents us a charming yet dangerous man, who probably has been through more than what we would like to do, yet less than what he would likes us to believe.The film is very intense and tough, and very good at it; Bana is perfect as Chopper and shows great promise as an actor. His characterization makes very difficult to don't like this common man with a very uncommon life. Director Dominik makes a straight-to-the-face film that stays true to Chopper's persona (fictional or not), and does it without being pretentious or manipulative. It basically lets Chopper's charisma speak for itself playing with the audience's fascination with crime and violence.If as flaw was to be found, it would be that it never tries to go beyond its goal or push too much the envelope. It is not much of a flaw, as the results are still brilliant, but leaves one wondering at how far could it had gone considering the talent of those involved.

All the characters are cool, and there is plenty of exciting War action as well, plus Nicolas Cage is simply amazing in this. It's extremely violent and bloody, and I thought Cage worked extremely well with Adam Beach and had awesome chemistry with him, plus the opening is memorable and quite sad. This film is really underrated in my opinion, and there are so many explosions to enjoy as well, plus you will feel for Cage's character and root for him. It also has some good humorous moments, and I thought the ending was the best part in the film as it was so sad and very emotional, plus it's pretty well made and written. While it did have a long running time, there was so much action that it didn't bother me, and while it's not the best War film it's certainly a really good one, plus Cage had a really cool training scene in this one with him running on the beach!. This is an awesome John Woo film, that's also a really good War film as well, with a great story and top notch performances, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. John Woo does an awesome! job here with excellent camera work, cool angles great shots during the battle scenes and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace.There is tons and tons of violence. We get tons and tons of extremely bloody gunshot wounds,tons of bloody impaling's ,plenty of stabbing's ,countless people are blown up in graphic detail, lots of blown off legs ,bloody slit throat ,extremely gory decapitation and lots more.The Acting is top notch!. Nicolas Cage is amazing as always and is amazing here,he is extremely likable but a man with a haunted past, and we feel for him, and start to root for him, as you know he's been through a lot, I also loved the way he took command in the battle scenes, he was so intense, he also had fantastic chemistry with Adam Beach, he was amazing! (Cage Rules!!!!!!!!). Adam Beach is fantastic here, he worked really well with Cage, was vulnerable, very likable, had a good charm, and also had a very good scene at the end I really liked him!. Mark Ruffalo is really good here with what he had to do in his role, surprising to see him in this type of film though, still he was great! (Ruffalo Rules!!). Peter Stormare ,Noah Emmerich and Brian Van Holt are all excellent in there roles. Brian Van Holt did good with what he had to do. Christian Slater didn't have much to do but shined when he was on screen I just wished had more of it, he did a very honorable thing in this film! (Slater Rules!!!!!!!). Roger Willie is excellent in his role, I liked the music he played and he had some great scenes with Slater, I really liked him. Frances O'Connor did well with what she had to do which was not much. Rest of the cast do fine.Overall a must see!. **** out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 April 2006","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is an awesome John Woo film, that's also a really good War film as well, with a great story and top notch performances!.

This was the first Ray Bradbury adapted science fiction story to be made into a movie and was based on his story The Meteor. An early film from the career of director Jack Arnold who would go on to make some of the classics of the genre in the 1950's including Creature From the Black Lagoon, Revenge of the Creature, This Island Earth, Taranula, and The Incredible Shrinking Man. Even though Jack Arnold became well known with his sci-fi flicks they were still all B-movies and this is only the third film of his directorial career so it's truly a B-movie. amazingly it won a Golden Globe Award for Best Newcomer to Barbara Rush. Rounding out the cast are Richard Carlson, Kathleen Hughes, Russell Johnson and Charles Drake. Screewriter Harry Essex did some good screenplays in his career and wrote for some well-known films like Creature From the Black Lagoon and The Sons of Katie Elder.

I also read the book AFTER seeing the film, which I think gives me a unique perspective as opposed to those who read the book, then saw the film as a disappointment.With that having been said, I was amazed with the excruciating detail that the novel's Patrick Bateman went into when describing his life and routine. Bret Easton Ellis is a truly remarkable author, and the novel is really a masterpiece of 1980's satire. I honestly can't say enough good things about it. Every page was amazing to me, and I felt that a portrait of a madman had really been painted for us in a way that nobody has done before.The film lacked a lot of this detail, but it was only noticeable after reading the book. I can see how someone who read the book first, then saw the film could have been disappointed, but seeing the film before the book really made me appreciate both much more than I may have otherwise. For someone who has no experience with either the film or the book, I would recommend the movie first, then followed up with the novel. The movie is very enjoyable and interesting on it's own, and the novel adds a tremendous dimension and back-story to the characters and their motivations.Also, one of the criticisms that I read in a previous review had to do with the locations not being believable due to the limited budget of the production. However, as a lifelong resident of Manhattan, the sets and locations ring very true. Pat Bateman's apartment in the movie is a really accurate representation of what a multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment actually looks like. Money does not go very far in this town, and it actually states in the book that Timothy Price made approximately $190,000\/year, so it can be presumed that Bateman earned a similar amount. A hefty sum for the time, but not quite billionaire status. The restaurants and offices are also quite realistic and believable, especially since I have actually been to most of the places that are mentioned in the book.Finally, after the film and novel, I have to say that I actually found Pat Bateman someone who I could really relate to on some level, scary though that may sound. The obsession with material possessions; having everything in your life arranged perfectly; the drive to have the best (clothes, apartment, dinner reservations, women, etc), is something that still permeates the culture here in NYC to such a degree that I found many of his obsessions (compulsions?) and mannerisms extremely familiar. Disconcerting as it is, I can easily see where Brett Ellis' mind was when he fleshed out the Bateman character. From this point of view, it's almost easy to see how such behavior can mutate into insanity without even the blink of an eye. It's certainly made me look at my own life in a different light.

Mankiewicz for an even better film. The Ghost and Mrs Muir, while a little pretentious at times, stands out as one of the finest romance films of Hollywood's golden period, and an interesting and entertaining fantasy film to boot. Over four decades before Demi Moore fell in love with a ghost in the sentimental, sappy trash flick 'Ghost'; Gene Tierney was doing it in far better style with this film. As you might expect from a film that features a woman falling in love with a spirit; there's more than a few plot holes on display. However, the film has this great ability to make the audience believe in it - and that is mostly down to the fabulous performances from all concerned. The plot follows a widow who moves into a house by the sea in order to escape her meddling in-laws. She knows that the house is haunted before she moves in, but the idea of living in a haunted house fascinates her; and she's fascinated further when she finds herself falling in love with the ghost of the previous owner.It has to be said that, with the characters, what you see is pretty much what you get. Gene Tierney, whom I'm becoming a bigger fan of every time I see one of her movies, is the headstrong widow - while Rex Harrison is the cantankerous seaman. The characters mostly bathe in their own traits, but this helps the film immensely as it means that it's their relationship that always takes centre stage, and that is the biggest draw of the film. The film is very romantic, but it never gets dull or sappy. The ending brilliantly shows the film in its best light, as it's as heart-warming and tragic as the film deserves. Aside from romance, there's a strong comedy element in the film - and the best is often made of that, most notably in the hilarious sequence that sees the in-laws visit our heroine's new house. One thing I love about old films is the way that they show how different things are nowadays - this is best shown here by the fact that, in one scene, Rex Harrison is told off for swearing; after saying 'blast'. Overall, this is an excellent and criminally under seen movie that comes with high recommendations!

There are some decent set pieces and a potentially interesting story about corporate greed and government corruption. But then on a scene in a plane the film switches gears and becomes a ridiculous orgy of preposterous violence.Now I fully admit that it's somewhat stupid to moan about an Arnie flick being preposterous, but there's a fine line between being enjoyably silly (Commando) and just being dull. For example, in Commando you have Arnie annihilating an entire army in someone's garden; it's hilarious. But in Eraser he does the same with silly science-fiction laser phalluses; it just ain't the same.But like I say, the film starts off well enough. It opens with an ex-gangster being beaten up by the people he ratted out &#150; the ex-gangster is in the witness protection scheme. Arnie then turns up and kills the gangsters swiftly and efficiently. It's a nice little scene. And then after that we have another enjoyable action scene where Arnie protects a witness who's going to give evidence against a corrupt arms manufacturer. He turns up at the woman's house, gets a nail in the hand (which he pulls out &#150; nice!) and then blows her home to smithereens, killing the bad guy's in the process. It's not bad.However, in that action scene, the first warning sign of the impending crapness manifests itself. And it manifests itself in the form of the 'Rail Gun'. It's meant to be a hi-tech piece of weaponry but it looks like an over-sized Super Soaker (if you want real phallic guns, just watch Aliens). And things get worse when the rescued witness tells Arnie the technology behind them. Apparently they fire aluminium rounds almost at the speed of light. Come on, I'm no scientist, but at least give me some credit. And she also says that they work through EMP. She then explains what EMP is. But because I've heard EMP explained about a million times before in Bond films, I was almost nodding off.But there was one thing that I absolutely loved in the action scene in the house. The female witness is using her computer to try to access some information she's stolen from the arms manufacturer. Tension builds as it's hinted that someone else is in the house. However, it turns out to be her ex-boyfriend. The boyfriend gets about two lines of dialogue before he's zapped by a round fired (almost) at the speed of light. Then after Arnie rescues the woman, and as they're driving away from her exploded house, she briefly voices some remorse that her boyfriend got killed. But a second later she's over it and the boyfriend doesn't get another mention. You've got to love cannon fodder.Another good scene is where Arnie and James Caan go to the house of a witness whose whereabouts may have been compromised. You think the two men are working as a team, but while Arnie stabs bad guys through doors and kicks them out of windows, Caan shoots the witness. And to make it even more perverse, when Arnie enters the room, Caan pretends to give mouth to mouth. Then when Arnie leaves he sucks the life out of her. I enjoyed that a great deal.But after this there's a scene on a plane and everything begins to unravel. Caan drugs Arnie, tries to persuade him to join the dark side and Arnie then manages to kill a couple of people before opening the plane door. Then he blows up a jet engine, loses a parachute, flies out the plane and catches up to the parachute Moonraker-style and puts it on. Ah, but it doesn't end there. Caan gets the pilot to aim the plane at Arnie. For a few moments it appears that Arnie is going to get splattered but he pulls out his gun, fires at the plane and gets the plane to sail over him. And then because of that Arnie gets tangled in the parachute and has a nasty landing on top of a van in a junk yard where he's greeted by a couple of comedy children. Where am I? Earth. Welcome. I can only shake my head. Again, I can accept Arnie sailing through a shopping centre Tarzan-style in Commando, but I just can't get my head around a man accurately firing at the pilot of a jet plane while falling to Earth with a parachute. I guess it could have been enjoyably silly had the effects work been better, the stunt double less obvious and the children less annoying (or completely removed), but it just doesn't work as a sequence.Neither does the scene with the alligators. They waddle like they've got piles and the animation curiously looks like it was done with stop-motion even though it's CGI. However, the scene is almost made worthwhile by the legendary pun that is, You're luggage. But let's face it, it's not as good as Arnie stabbing a Freddie Mercury look-a-like with a pipe and then uttering, Let off some steam, Bennett. And that reminds me, in Eraser Arnie visits a gay bar. That's just too self-aware for a Schwarzenegger flick. I much prefer the latent gayness of Eighties Arnie to the nodding and winking of the post-modern Nineties Arnie.But the final action scene is where the film becomes absolutely terrible. You have comedy Italian gangsters, phallic light-speed gun shoot-outs and about a million explosions. Plus Arnie gets shot and then has the strength to climb on top of a shipping container and beat up James Caan. I know Arnie's indestructible, but there's only so far you can push it, especially when the film takes itself somewhat seriously.

It has an excellent comedic script, an extremely original science fiction and adventure plot, great suspense near the finale of the movie, very cool action sequences, a musical number and a romance subplot.In this classic comedy, Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a 17-year-old from Hill Valley, California. He is a friend with Dr. Emmet Brown or Doc (Christopher Lloyd), a mad scientist who invented a time-machine out of a DeLorean. When they are testing it out for the first time, Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955. He bumps into his teenage parents, before they are married, and by chance, his mother starts to like Marty and wants to go out with him. He then meets up with a younger Doc who helps him to try and make his parents fall in love with each other or else Marty won't be born and have him go back to 1985, the year he was originally from.The characters are excellent. I loved the character development and how Marty made everyone change for the better. It put a smile to my face seeing the impact that he had on everyone else. Marty and Doc have excellent chemistry and everyone in it had an excellent performance. I preferred Crispin Glover's performance as Marty's father, George McFly. His total nerdiness just made me crack up when he spoke.The script is also one of my all-time favourite screenplays. The humor is very clever and I loved the many one-liners. The plot is absolutely brilliant. It was truly one-of-a-kind and it made me think deeply of the concept of time travel and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I cannot find a single flaw in this great feel-good movie. They couldn't have made it better. Out of the hundreds of movies I've seen, this is the most fun I had watching a film.I rarely give out perfect scores but for Back to the Future, my rating is a 10\/10, I could not recommend it more. This a great movie to watch if you want to have fun! ","genre":null},{"date":"6 April 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Wow, this movie had it all! It has an excellent comedic script, an extremely original science fiction and adventure plot, great suspense near the finale of the movie, very cool action sequences, a musical number and a romance subplot.In this classic comedy, Michael J.
