Obsessed with her job, we find her working late Friday night, chain smoking, listening to music, with the tools of her trade messily scattered about. Or hacking with other engineers, probably making intuitive leaps and guesses. Most would find her emotional investment in the project abnormal, but we can easily ignore this, given the fantastic product she and Michael are working toward.Never having had time to polish her social skills, she attacks the investors on two different occasions. Which we can also forgive, as they are foreshadowed to be the bad guys.Lillian's statement about good projects getting canceled or shelved is all too true. Small & medium-sized companies are susceptible to changes in funding, takeovers \/ relocations, bad management, warring departments, and warring individuals.Michael is also likable as the Architect. As in the real world, he is so interested in getting on to the interesting part of the project, he is incapable of writing good documentation. (And probably leaves lots of bugs in his work, though that isn't depicted.) He also feels personal ownership of the project, as everything around him was once only a design in his head.The investors (think venture capitalist) make moves to protect their investment, replacing the middle management that won't play along, and locking down the assets. Having lost his friends and the free environment that he is used to, we see Michael put up with it for awhile, but eventually his strong personality (think Steve Jobs) leads to a clash.Alex is recognizable at the Chief Technical Officer, who needs funding to remove roadblocks for his team. So badly, it turns out, that he can't be choosy about where the money comes from.Hal is the Project Manager, memorably seated next to his Gantt chart, and later on the golf course. While his corporate role isn't fully developed, we see his people skills, which he would use to evenly distribute pressure from upper management, making deadlines appear reasonable, and cajoling when necessary. (Non-coincidentally, my last two project managers have spent a lot of time on the golf course.)Summary. If you can ignore (or fast-wind) the silly evil-military portion of the film, the characters can be believable and engaging, and the love story is at times touching.Extra. Not in all cuts of the movie, the scene where Karen is singing softly (and poorly) to Michael gives the character a vulnerability that is identifiable as true love.

The ignorance many people have about sex is flaunted by them as morality or sensibility. What Bliss illustrates so clearly is that sexual ignorance and the patriarchal system are the things that are killing both good sex and understanding between the sexes. It's unfortunate-and yes, it's probably true as someone else here said, that for the sake of commercialism, the movie had to get an R rating and certain scenes and bits of dialogue were apparently trimmed. From what I read, one of the things left out for the sake of not getting that much-feared NC-17 was the word clitoris. (Can I say that here?) It's hard to believe that a mere clinical word could cause that much censorship trouble-in a movie dealing with orgasms, at that. The movie should have left out the word frigid since the psychiatric profession no longer uses it that much, preferring pre-orgasmic instead. But there you have it. The male-dominated society we live in indeed makes certain rules-and it is those rules and how they affect sex and the destinies of the sexes, that are nevertheless gently skewered in this film. If Maria has been damaged by her past, her husband and most men have been damaged by simply being men-by playing the male role. To me this was a courageous movie, despite the censorship, because it showed a man gradually unlearning his traditional male conditioning, to the point where (spoiler) he admonishes a friend not to speak of women as body parts. True liberation means that men spread the word to other men. Did you also notice the difficulty with which at first the husband speaks about sex to another man(the therapist?) He learns to take sex seriously. We don't know how deeply he has been damaged by his upbringing as a normal American male, but at the beginning, his reactions are close to violence-while at the end, he seems to be able to accept reality  without raging so much. These are important messages-and those who commented that this was just a sex film are not watching the appropriate film.

","genre":"Action, Biography, Drama"},{"date":"27 September 2002","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  1941 was a phenomenal year for films. The number of great ones is too long to list here. Two of the most beloved movies from this remarkable year are Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon. On the surface, they couldn't be more different, and yet there are at times amazing similarities and contrasts that makes them worth discussing together. For one thing both were the directorial debuts of men who would each play a dominant role in American movies for the next several decades, Orson Welles and John Huston. Kane was highly touted by its studio, yet created a sensation anyway; while Falcon was made on a modest budget and turned out to be the sleeper of the year, putting its star, Humphrey Bogart, in the major leagues once and for all. While Kane made its director a celebrity, Falcon did not do the same for Huston, though as the years went by he became as famous as Welles. Kane is flamboyant, adventurous, baroque and outrageous, moving all over the place in space and time. Falcon is small-scale, taking place mostly in cramped rooms, with few exterior shots, on standing sets. The cast of Kane consists mostly of friends and colleagues of Welles' from his radio days, while the cast of Falcon was made up largely of people who scarcely knew each other, though they would become friends later, and in many cases work again on other movies. Both films are mystery stories, but the mystery of Kane is the character of its larger than life protagonist, while the mystery of Falcon is the relatively prosaic matter of who killed Floyd Thursby. Kane is about a man who already has a lot of money, who seeks glory, while the Falcon is about people who could care less about glory but care an awful lot about money. Both films deal with relationships between people who use one another a lot, and neither ends (spoiler here?) happily. The Maltese Falcon was actually the third screen adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's detective novel. It's story is, again, like Kane, hard to follow. What makes it a classic is the way it's done. Everything about this movie is low-key. Voices are seldom raised. The photography is the opposite of flashy. As Sam Spade, the man who is working for three clients simultaneously, and who is out to find the fabled Maltese falcon of the title,--a black enameled figurine of a bird encrusted with jewels--longtime movie bad guy and soon to be superstar Humphrey Bogart gives a straightforward, unmannered performance, Hemingwayesque in its stoicism and sense of style. To put it another way, Bogart never overacts, but he never doesn't act. He's always in character. His work here is brilliant, and one of the reasons for this is that he never appears to be trying. It's one of the classic movie performances of all time, and yet it feels almost thrown away, as if Bogart just walked into the studio, put on his suit, and decided that morning he was going to play a detective. He makes acting look easy.In support, Mary Astor is every bit Bogart's equal, and steals a couple of scenes from him with her chic cafe society manner, like a cross between Katherine Hepburn and Margaret Dumont. Peter Lorre, as an oily effete foreign gentleman, is at times hilarious, and is especially good in his hysterical outbursts. Elephantine Sydney Greenstreet's sleek international crook, with his line of pseudo-scholarly chitchat, is sublime, and almost (but not quite) steals the movie from his co-stars. I especially like the way this treacherous bon vivant goes out of his way to impress detective Spade, as if the two of them were giants among the pygmies. It's small touches like these make the film memorable as much as anything. Then there's intense little Elisha Cook, Jr. as Greenstreet's hit man, trying so hard to be cool. He's like a Spade wannabe, but he's too small and nervous to pull it off, and Spade exposes him for the phoney he is.Indeed, Spade is, of the main characters, the only real deal among them. The rest are not only criminal but unreal. They're an amusing lot, fascinating, even charming at times, but they're all false faces. What trips them up is that their phoniness makes it impossible for them to recognize the truth in others, and this is Spade's trump card. He may not know what's going on, but he knows what's true. The others have at times a better sense of what's really happening, but they don't know themselves, as each character gets tangled up in his own little web of lies and deceit. Spade exploits all this, often cruelly, and in the end gets to the bottom of things. An existential detective film? In a way it is.

The number of great ones is too long to list here. Two of the most beloved movies from this remarkable year are Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon. On the surface, they couldn't be more different, and yet there are at times amazing similarities and contrasts that makes them worth discussing together. For one thing both were the directorial debuts of men who would each play a dominant role in American movies for the next several decades, Orson Welles and John Huston. Kane was highly touted by its studio, yet created a sensation anyway; while Falcon was made on a modest budget and turned out to be the sleeper of the year, putting its star, Humphrey Bogart, in the major leagues once and for all. While Kane made its director a celebrity, Falcon did not do the same for Huston, though as the years went by he became as famous as Welles. Kane is flamboyant, adventurous, baroque and outrageous, moving all over the place in space and time. Falcon is small-scale, taking place mostly in cramped rooms, with few exterior shots, on standing sets. The cast of Kane consists mostly of friends and colleagues of Welles' from his radio days, while the cast of Falcon was made up largely of people who scarcely knew each other, though they would become friends later, and in many cases work again on other movies. Both films are mystery stories, but the mystery of Kane is the character of its larger than life protagonist, while the mystery of Falcon is the relatively prosaic matter of who killed Floyd Thursby. Kane is about a man who already has a lot of money, who seeks glory, while the Falcon is about people who could care less about glory but care an awful lot about money. Both films deal with relationships between people who use one another a lot, and neither ends (spoiler here?) happily. The Maltese Falcon was actually the third screen adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's detective novel. It's story is, again, like Kane, hard to follow. What makes it a classic is the way it's done. Everything about this movie is low-key. Voices are seldom raised. The photography is the opposite of flashy. As Sam Spade, the man who is working for three clients simultaneously, and who is out to find the fabled Maltese falcon of the title,--a black enameled figurine of a bird encrusted with jewels--longtime movie bad guy and soon to be superstar Humphrey Bogart gives a straightforward, unmannered performance, Hemingwayesque in its stoicism and sense of style. To put it another way, Bogart never overacts, but he never doesn't act. He's always in character. His work here is brilliant, and one of the reasons for this is that he never appears to be trying. It's one of the classic movie performances of all time, and yet it feels almost thrown away, as if Bogart just walked into the studio, put on his suit, and decided that morning he was going to play a detective. He makes acting look easy.In support, Mary Astor is every bit Bogart's equal, and steals a couple of scenes from him with her chic cafe society manner, like a cross between Katherine Hepburn and Margaret Dumont. Peter Lorre, as an oily effete foreign gentleman, is at times hilarious, and is especially good in his hysterical outbursts. Elephantine Sydney Greenstreet's sleek international crook, with his line of pseudo-scholarly chitchat, is sublime, and almost (but not quite) steals the movie from his co-stars. I especially like the way this treacherous bon vivant goes out of his way to impress detective Spade, as if the two of them were giants among the pygmies. It's small touches like these make the film memorable as much as anything. Then there's intense little Elisha Cook, Jr. as Greenstreet's hit man, trying so hard to be cool. He's like a Spade wannabe, but he's too small and nervous to pull it off, and Spade exposes him for the phoney he is.Indeed, Spade is, of the main characters, the only real deal among them. The rest are not only criminal but unreal. They're an amusing lot, fascinating, even charming at times, but they're all false faces. What trips them up is that their phoniness makes it impossible for them to recognize the truth in others, and this is Spade's trump card. He may not know what's going on, but he knows what's true. The others have at times a better sense of what's really happening, but they don't know themselves, as each character gets tangled up in his own little web of lies and deceit. Spade exploits all this, often cruelly, and in the end gets to the bottom of things. An existential detective film? In a way it is. Citizen Kane's a bit like this, too, but here it's Kane himself who weaves the web, the others who stand by and try to figure things out.

I love most of Hitch's films. His bigger productions of the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s are probably best loved, but I really like his grittier, more reality-based films as well. During that period, The Wrong Man is almost entirely overlooked, despite being one of his greatest achievements. This kind of film was most common during his British career, where he had less money to work with. I myself am least familiar with the first chunk of the man's career, but I have seen enough of them. My favorite so far is definitely Sabotage (1936), which is another criminally underrated film. The first version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is a close second favorite. A terrorist group (led by Peter Lorre) kills a secret agent in Switzerland. Bob and Jill Lawrence discover that the group is planning to assassinate a foreign diplomat in London in the upcoming days, so the group kidnaps their daughter to keep them quiet. They're unwilling to tell the police about the kidnapping, and eventually take it upon themselves to find her. They have to do it quickly, for, if the diplomat is killed because they withheld information from the police, a second World War could rest upon their shoulders. The story isn't particularly complex, but Hitchcock's cinema is as spectacular as it ever was, while aiming for a low key. There are a dozen memorable scenes in the film, most notably the concert with the slowly revolving camera as Jill Lawrence scans the room for the assassin. And I love the realistic standoff near the end of the film, as the police slowly move citizens to safety as the terrorists shoot from the dark. The acting is also very good, with Edna Best (as Jill Lawrence) and especially Peter Lorre (how can you not love this guy?) standing above the rest. 10\/10.
