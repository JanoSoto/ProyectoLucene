Since, then, I have not seen it. I remember that at the end, when Jack dies, and Rose is left in the ocean that I cried a lot. A lot of people surely cried. In the last year, I have started to use IMDb, and I see Titanic gets a lot of hate. Well, I decided to see it again to refresh my memory.Let me start off by saying that Titanic gets a lot of hate because of its weak screenplay. Yes, the screenplay is the biggest problem. No, it is not horrible, but there are a lot of cheesy and badly written lines. Some scenes are very unrealistic(like Jack grabbing Rose when she slips in her red dress with only his hand). Also, like when Rose and Jack start to run away from water. Scenes like this make the film look bad, and some lines and dialogue seem unnecessary and poor. BUT let me tell you, that if Titanic wanted to give some emotion to its audience, then in that way, it does not disappoint or fail. The chemistry between Rose and Jack(played beautifully by Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio) is strong. Their love seems real, even though at times it feels too forced, and the way they met is unrealistic. BUT in having a romance story together with a real life tragic, it is done very well. The production design is very well done. The ship and the effects(i am sorry for saying the effects were bad, after seeing it all, they were not), well, they are magnificent. All the stuntmen and the effects done in the actual sinking of the ship is simply amazing. The last hour of the film is so intense, and it looks so realistic, visually, that you can't help but love it for that. Some scenes are so monumental, they are some of the most tragically horrifying scenes in cinema history. The costumes are also well done, for the period of 1912.Another great aspect of the film was the acting. Kate Winslet deserved her Oscar nomination, as did Gloria Stuart. All the actors were on par. The music in the film is simply heartbreaking, The original song by Celine Dion is just WOW. One of the best songs in film history, and its Oscar win is very well deserved. The direction is simply inspiring.Titanic as a whole is satisfying for every film lover. For people who like to be entertained, this is a great film for them, because even though it has some problems, it never fails to entertain, or to emotionally connect with. Yes, this film gets a lot of hate, but the honest truth, is, Titanic is a Masterpiece of its time. i am sure that it will be remembered in 50 years, simple because of how well a film it is.

While not quite as good as the first two (which were phenomenal) this film is still worth watching. The basic story is that Marty has to travel back to 1885 to save the Doc from being shot by the town bully. But things are complicated by Doc Brown falling in love with Clara, the new schoolteacher. Now they have to figure out how to get back to the future, and whether or not to bring Clara along.Now, as I said before, this movie was a lot of fun.

It is a science fiction film within a western, and the result is pretty cool.That being said, this movie was unbearably cheesy at times and I didn't particularly enjoy the love story between Clara and the Doc. But the absolute worst thing about this film was the ending (spoilers ahead, one final warning), in which the time machine is destroyed in 1985 without the Doc or Clara coming through with Marty, only to have them show up a minute later in a new time machine (defeating the purpose of destroying the Delorean). To each his own, but I would have much rather that all three came through, and the Delorean been destroyed more respectfully that being crushed by a train.

Coming out in 1967, it beat out some serious competition for the coveted prize including BONNIE AND CLYDE and THE GRADUATE, 2 films that to this day are considered landmarks of American film, and deservedly so. But that shouldn't take away from how special and great IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is in and of itself.The film stars the legendary, groundbreaking actor Sidney Poitier in one his great roles as Philadelphia police Det. Virgil Tibbs, who is passing through the sleepy, small town of Sparta, Mississippi in 1967. While waiting for his train back home to Philly, Virgil is falsely arrested by a Sparta policeman who mistakenly brings him in for a murder of a prominent businessman earlier that night. Virgil is taken to the police station and questioned by Sparta Chief of Police Bill Gillespie, played by the great actor Rod Steiger in a performance that won him an overdue Best Actor Oscar. Steiger beat out some SERIOUS competition that year in Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Paul Newman, and Spencer Tracy what a list of actors! Poitier and Steiger are brilliant in this film and each time I see it, I pick out another nuance in their legendary performances. This has got to be one of the great pairings in film history. The 2 actors play brilliantly off each other and there is not a false note in either performance. It's a shame that Mr. Poitier was not also recognized in the Best Actor category that year himself. It would have been great if there had been a tie and both men could have shared the award. I wasn't born at the time, but I saw an old clip of Steiger accepting the award and graciously acknowledging Poitier in his speech. Of course Poitier had won Best Actor a few years earlier, but for me, this may be my favorite performance and film of his.I'm not an expert, but anyone who wants a class in Acting 101 should pay close attention to these 2 stars of this film. Poitier is 100% believable as a police detective from a big city, not just in classy look and appearance, but also in his mannerisms and the dignified way that he carries himself. He is totally professional at all times and has a constant inquisitive nature. Steiger plays the middle-aged, burly, handpicked small-town chief to perfection. Although he reigns in his boisterous acting style and gives a much more controlled performance than appears on the surface, he imbibes Gillespie with old school toughness and when he lets loose and loses his temper, it is always done to great effect. He is totally believable as a Southern lawman.The murder victim was a rich man from Chicago who was building a factory in Sparta that would bring prosperity to the town, but in order to keep it going, his widow (played by Lee Grant in a brief but memorable performance) demands that his murder be solved or she will not go ahead with her late husband's plans. Gillespie, in order to keep his job and to satisfy the leading denizens of Sparta, asks Virgil to stay to solve the crime.Virgil reluctantly helps Gillespie with the murder investigation and goes through the typical rigmarole of being a black man in a racist Southern town that you would expect in the late 60s, but because of his guile, toughness, and self-respect, he carefully and methodically navigates through all the crap that he must take along the way to solving the murder and with Gillespie's support and help, does just that.Although the murder itself would seem to be a MacGuffin and the focus on the film is obviously on race relations and prejudice, it is actually an interesting and complex plot that holds the viewers attention to the very end. Even though I've seen it several times and know how it ends, I still find myself wrapped up in the mystery and thinking along with Virgil in trying to solve the crime. It's a great whodunit. But most importantly, it is a groundbreaking film about racism and its effects on the black man and how much extra he had (and still has) to go through in order to exist in a white man's world.With a fine supporting cast, an extremely solid script, a great story, and a socially conscious theme, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is recommended viewing for many reasons.

Coming out in 1967, it beat out some serious competition for the coveted prize including BONNIE AND CLYDE and THE GRADUATE, 2 films that to this day are considered landmarks of American film, and deservedly so. But that shouldn't take away from how special and great IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is in and of itself.The film stars the legendary, groundbreaking actor Sidney Poitier in one his great roles as Philadelphia police Det. Virgil Tibbs, who is passing through the sleepy, small town of Sparta, Mississippi in 1967. While waiting for his train back home to Philly, Virgil is falsely arrested by a Sparta policeman who mistakenly brings him in for a murder of a prominent businessman earlier that night. Virgil is taken to the police station and questioned by Sparta Chief of Police Bill Gillespie, played by the great actor Rod Steiger in a performance that won him an overdue Best Actor Oscar. Steiger beat out some SERIOUS competition that year in Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Paul Newman, and Spencer Tracy what a list of actors! Poitier and Steiger are brilliant in this film and each time I see it, I pick out another nuance in their legendary performances. This has got to be one of the great pairings in film history. The 2 actors play brilliantly off each other and there is not a false note in either performance. It's a shame that Mr. Poitier was not also recognized in the Best Actor category that year himself. It would have been great if there had been a tie and both men could have shared the award. I wasn't born at the time, but I saw an old clip of Steiger accepting the award and graciously acknowledging Poitier in his speech. Of course Poitier had won Best Actor a few years earlier, but for me, this may be my favorite performance and film of his.I'm not an expert, but anyone who wants a class in Acting 101 should pay close attention to these 2 stars of this film. Poitier is 100% believable as a police detective from a big city, not just in classy look and appearance, but also in his mannerisms and the dignified way that he carries himself. He is totally professional at all times and has a constant inquisitive nature. Steiger plays the middle-aged, burly, handpicked small-town chief to perfection. Although he reigns in his boisterous acting style and gives a much more controlled performance than appears on the surface, he imbibes Gillespie with old school toughness and when he lets loose and loses his temper, it is always done to great effect. He is totally believable as a Southern lawman.The murder victim was a rich man from Chicago who was building a factory in Sparta that would bring prosperity to the town, but in order to keep it going, his widow (played by Lee Grant in a brief but memorable performance) demands that his murder be solved or she will not go ahead with her late husband's plans. Gillespie, in order to keep his job and to satisfy the leading denizens of Sparta, asks Virgil to stay to solve the crime.Virgil reluctantly helps Gillespie with the murder investigation and goes through the typical rigmarole of being a black man in a racist Southern town that you would expect in the late 60s, but because of his guile, toughness, and self-respect, he carefully and methodically navigates through all the crap that he must take along the way to solving the murder and with Gillespie's support and help, does just that.Although the murder itself would seem to be a MacGuffin and the focus on the film is obviously on race relations and prejudice, it is actually an interesting and complex plot that holds the viewers attention to the very end.

I have read that a lot of people were initially put off by the premise of an intense loving relationship between two teenage girls, but it should be noted that their relationship, if sexual at all, is sexual in a purely symbolic way. If nothing else, Jackson has made a stupendous achievement of making a film about this relationship and completely preventing any sense of eroticism from creeping up. The movie tells the shocking true story of two teenage girls who crushed the skull of one of their mothers with a rock, and what led them to commit such a heinous crime. My understanding is that the story is told with a great deal of creative liberties, but the focus is on a kind of friendship that few people ever find. Two girls with strengths and weaknesses that perfectly complement each other, who run through the world at full speed giggling with glee as if unable to understand the pure happiness that they feel when they are together. Soon, various events come in the way of their friendship. Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline, and Kate Winslet, in her first film role, plays Juliet, who is noticeably horrified when her parents bring up the prospect of leaving the country for a mere three weeks. While separated, they write each other elaborate letters, describing events that take place in an imaginary world that they have created together. When the separations become longer (and more obviously because of parents' misguided (?) concerns about a homosexual relationship), their efforts to remain together become more and more desperate. As they say, never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers, or even the power and danger of a couple of teenage girls bent on maintaining their friendship. People are dangerous in groups, even groups of two (I realize, just this second, that tomorrow morning I have three classes of university students preparing to give final exam presentations in groups of two and three. I hope I haven't made a horrible mistake!!). Complicating matters for Pauline and Juliet are four wildly unhelpful parents. Juliet's mother is distracted by her disintegrating marriage and futile affairs while her professional father is benevolent and professional but both hapless and helpless, while Pauline's mother is over- controlling and militant about her discipline, and her father seems to just want the whole thing to go away. The parents and the children are pulling in opposite directions, and they pull harder and harder and harder until finally the rope snaps, as it must. There are a number of truly impressive and memorable sections of the film, such as the presentation of the imaginary world that Pauline and Juliet have created together, particularly the clay characters that populate it. These things make it a movie that is difficult to categorize but easy to remember, and they show a sense of visual style that Jackson later went on to develop even further in the Lord of the Rings films and King Kong. Some say that he will never be able to top the Lord of the Rings movies, but personally I think he still has a few things up his sleeve. We can hope, anyway.Note &#150; it's well known that the real life Juliet has been revealed to be the successful murder mystery novelist Anne Perry, which is a perfect ending to her story (although I would have expected Pauline to become the writer). Also, Melanie Lynksey has had a surprisingly successful acting career, appearing in many successful films, including a periodic role as the slightly crazy but immensely attractive Rose on 2 ½ Men.

In the film Of Mice and Men, director Gary Sinese did a good job making viewers want to see, rather than just read about, what would happen next. The filmmakers changed sequences from Steinbeck's book to make the story more cinematic, but did not alter the themes of the original novel. This is apparent in the characters' transportation to the ranch, the scene in Crooks's barn, and George's attempt to fit the horse with a new shoe.Instead of using the long bus scene from the opening of the book, the filmmakers had the characters switch modes of transportation from train to bus to foot. The first thing the reader learns about how the characters arrived in town is George's line We could just as well of rode clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talking' 'bout (5.) This is different from the movie, in which the characters start on a train, and then transfer onto a bus, and then walk. As they travel, we see an old-fashioned town, a gas station, and the land surrounding the farm. The filmmakers made a bus ride that was only spoken about in the book into three actual, separate events. This is appropriate for a movie in order to keep the viewers' attention. Movies should show more visual detail than books, and the inclusion of the small town and the speeding train make the scene more cinematic. The filmmakers do not, however, change the original purpose of the scene, which is to show how difficult it is to travel with Lenny.Instead of staging the long conversation in Crooks's barn between Lenny, Crooks, Candy, and Curley's wife from the book, the filmmakers created a number of different scenes in different places. For example, the dialogue where Curley's wife asks, Say, what happened to Curley's han'? takes place later, while George, Lenny, and Slim are farming, in the movie (76.) The filmmakers separated the barn scene into four different parts because they didn't want too many questions to be asked and answered at once. This is more cinematic because without the consistent change of setting and actors, the audience will get bored. It's easier to read one long scene in a book because the author will not have to continually re-describe new settings. The director showed the same themes of loneliness through Curley's wife and friendship through Lenny's obedience of George by keeping Steinbeck's dialogue even though he split the scenes up.The scene is which George takes Slim's horse to be fitted for a new shoe, which was not in the book, helps to visually describe George's dislike for Curley's wife. In the book, the reader only learns about George's feelings toward Curley's wife through lines like Lenny's George said I ain't to have nothing' to do with you, talk to you or nothing' (84.) We can infer that George doesn't like her because she always gets men in trouble. If Curley sees a man near her, he gets angrier than he already is. This is shown differently in the movie, in the barn scene where Curley's wife actually tries to talk to George and he turns his back on her. By adding this scene, the filmmakers made the movie more cinematic because they allowed the audience to actually see this conflict instead of just reading about and visualizing it. In the novel, women bring bad news when they get mixed up with men. This theme has not changed in the movie even though the director has invented a new scene.By keeping the original themes of Of Mice and Men and making the sequences more cinematic for the viewers, the filmmakers created a great movie.

Watching it recently as a young adult, I still love this movie. The performances are wonderful. Robin Williams always makes a good protagonist and is thoroughly entertaining with the funny voices he makes and the lines he delivers. In Hook, he's like a big kid. Julia Roberts, as usual, is lovely as the stout and comical Tinkerbell. But I felt the real magic came from Dustin Hoffman as the infamous Captain Hook and Bob Hoskins as his sidekick Smee. Both not only fit their roles perfectly, but they are also funny and steal the show a little bit. Maggie Smith is also an excellent addition as Wendy Darling.I heard it took thirty or so sets to make this film, which makes the costs very high to make this film. However, each one adds a uniqueness and grandeur that does not necessarily recreate the Neverland that I remember from the 1953 cartoon, but makes it bigger, elaborate, and real. The costume designs, artistic work of the make up, and visual effects plaster the film and imagination of such a world created by John M. Barre. Now a junkie of Oscar history, I'm very surprised that this film did not receive those awards.Like with all of Spielberg's movies, John Williams makes an outstanding score, although I will admit that it sometimes has a slight feel of Home Alone. Nonetheless, it helps bring the film to life at intense levels.As with the plot, I did not find any of it hokey that some other critics complain about the film. Sure, it's not in the league of The Godfather's or Schindler's List's, but it's a fantasy. It's not supposed to be serious. On a side note, the movie has the moral of family coming first over everything else and that happiness and imagination cannot die. Hook may not be Spielberg's best movie, but it will always a favorite of mine. 10\/10 -It hurts me that this does not at least have a 8.0 or higher.

Some folk seem to think it is the end of an era. If the script were flying-around Hollywood for so many years with no takers, maybe Eastwood just realized it would make money and give him a vehicle to say no more. I'm not really an Eastwood fan, but remember Play Misty for me as one of the best movies he's done. Is that a western? I guess David Webb Peoples was certainly happy his script had been taken-up by a major star to be filmed. I'm not really sure what the story is; I was confused at the beginning, before I knew it was supposed to be the end of westerns. I didn't know whether to laugh or just turn it off. I suppose - having been enlightened by others' comments - I'd have to agree that Eastwood (Bill Munny) did a good job directing. BUT - wasn't it apparent that he would eventually return to his old self by the end of the movie. Didn't surprise ME. As for it being a classic, I'm still wondering - after watching it closely again - how that can be.Gene Hackman as Little Bill Daggert, I guess, did deserve his Oscar. The comparison of home-builder and sadistic sheriff was clearly made, and his acting was very good. His brutality toward Richard Harris (English Bob) and Morgan Freeman (Ned Logan) made me wonder if he were an elected sheriff, or was just a dictator. I'm still not sure if we were supposed to be familiar with English Bob; never heard of him, nor was I aware that he ALSO was out to collect the bounty. How in the world did the prostitutes rake-up $1000 in those days, in such an out-of-the-way town like Big Whiskey? Jaimz Woolvert (Schofield Kid) didn't impress me in any direction. I guess there had to be someone to tackle the job of killing the cowboys who cut-up the prostitute (whom Munny should have married, for a good twist in the plot). That Ned couldn't shoot anyone after all those years was a good twist, but his death was really unnecessary. BUT - there had to be SOME reason for Munny to make the final leap back into his former life. Beauchamp's character wasn't important to me, although it did give Hackman a chance to emote. As for it being one of the greatest scenes ever filmed, who's kidding whom? I'm glad so many people loved Unforgiven - it's just not my kind of film. I guess there WAS a story, but it took some real imagination to find it. I gave it a 10 because all of the actors-actresses played their roles convincingly, even if I didn't understand why. I am all for seeing another good western - there DOES seem to be a shortage of them, since all of the popular shoot-'em-up films have moved-on to the current genre - lots of action.

The latter quote, in particular, has become associated with the 1980s; it is frequently used to sum up the money-obsessed ethos of the decade, even by people who have never seen the film.This period saw a number of films set in the world of high finance. Working Girl from 1988 takes a generally positive view of the capitalist system, despite the presence of a few bad apples like Sigourney Weaver's character, but Wall Street is a satire on greed and corruption, as one might perhaps expect from a left-wing director like Oliver Stone. Yet its prevailing tone is not necessarily socialist or anti-capitalist. (Many American leftists are in fact fairly centrist in European terms.) Its morality, in fact, has a lot in common with that of another film, Pretty Woman from 1990. Both divide capitalism into good and bad. On the one hand are companies which provide or deal in goods and services which ordinary people actually want to use. (Good). On the other hand there are corporate raiders like Gordon Gekko in Wall Street or Edward Lewis in Pretty Woman, who make all their money through financial sleight of hand, without ever producing anything tangible. (Bad).Another connection between the two films is that father-son relationships play an important part in both. Edward's main psychological motivation is resentment of his late father, from whom he had become estranged. In Wall Street there is an underlying tension between the main character, Bud Fox, and his father, Carl. The two are played by real-life father and son Martin and Charlie Sheen. Carl, an aircraft mechanic working for an airline named Blue Star, is a trade union activist. He values honesty and hard work more than financial success, believing that you cannot measure a man's success by the size of his wallet. Although Carl is not estranged from his son, he nevertheless disapproves of the young man's system of values, which is quite at odds with his own.Bud is an ambitious young stockbroker, for whom making money is the supreme goal in life. He becomes the protégé of Gekko, a ruthless and immensely rich financier, and under Gekko's patronage starts to enjoy great success, acquiring wealth, a luxury apartment in a desirable area of New York and a beautiful girlfriend Darien (who just happens to be one of Gekko's former mistresses). Bud is, at first, untroubled by the fact that Gekko's business methods are not only unethical but also actually illegal, as Gekko makes most of his money by relying on inside information. His conscience begins to trouble him, however, when Gekko makes a takeover bid for Blue Star. If successful this bid will make a huge profit for Gekko and his associates, but only at the cost of destroying the company and of making Carl, and thousands like him, unemployed.Pretty Woman is essentially a modern-dress fairy tale, and like all fairy tales has a happy ending. Edward has a change of heart, becomes a good capitalist rather than a bad one and walks off into the sunset with Julia Roberts on his arm, her past as a call girl presumably forgotten. Wall Street is a more austere morality tale, a secular sermon on the theme of What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his soul. Bud must choose between the values of his true father Carl and those of Gekko, who can also be seen as a father-figure, but in his case a wicked stepfather. There will not necessarily be a happy ending; if Bud does the right thing in moral terms, it is likely to cost him dearly in material ones- the loss of his job, the end of his relationship with Darien and a possible jail sentence for his part in Gekko's misdeeds.My main criticism of the film is that its morality is rather too cut-and-dried. Its division of capitalist enterprise into two forms, one creative and the other parasitic, was too simplistic, as in reality the two are intimately connected. Manufacturing and service industries are reliant upon the money markets, which they need to raise investment capital for their businesses. The plot can also, at times, be difficult to follow for anyone without an intimate knowledge of high finance or a degree in economics.The film's main strength, however, is its acting, particularly from Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas. 1987 was Douglas's annus mirabilis, the year which saw the two films, Wall Street and Fatal Attraction, which made him one of the most admired male stars of the period. He is particularly good in Wall Street, the film which won him his only acting Oscar. (He also received, as producer, the Best Picture award for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Gekko's surname was obviously intended to suggest someone cold and reptilian. (Oliver Stone seems to have overlooked the fact that in some countries geckos are welcomed because they eat harmful insects). Nevertheless, Douglas does always not portray Gekko as cold. He is often shown as a man driven by passion, but by a passion for money, not for love or sex. In private he can be a foul-mouthed, foul-tempered vulgarian, but in public he can often be surprisingly persuasive, proving that the Devil not only has the best tunes but also some of the best speeches.

Indeed, for me, in many ways, Mann's films take the genre to an even higher level, not least his stunning use of colour cinematography and his use of the superb Stewart, a far more interesting and complex (never mind less wooden) performer than Ford's amanuensis John Wayne. Both these attributes are much to the fore in this particular movie but this time I felt slightly let down by some under-par support acting and a not wholly consistent narrative plot. Taking these points in turn, I wasn't engaged sufficiently for example by Alex Nicol in a key role as the head rancher's spoilt and sadistic son - for me this part should have been played with much more edge and brio, (I could visualise the sometimes maligned Victor Mature making much more of the part, for example) and also wasn't greatly moved by Cathy O'Donnell either as Stewart's slightly plain-looking belated love interest. She lacks depth and fails to create a believable chemistry with him throughout. Perhaps that's why he rides away at the end without her in tow which only serves to make the depiction of her awakening feelings seem all the more contrived. Which leads me to the weaknesses in the plotting and characterisation. The way the story develops it seems altogether inconsistent that Arthur Kennedy as Vic, the adopted son and right hand man of old man Waggoman (what kind of name is that?), who we see repeatedly in the first half acting as reasoning peacemaker between father and son and son and Stewart should later be shown to be too cowardly to admit to killing Nicol \/ Dave in self-defence, especially after the former has callously wounded a defence-less Stewart. By the end of the movie, he (Vic) seems to be taking the blame too for supplying the Apache guns which were used to kill Stewart's cavalry-officer brother (and hence the latter's reason for coming to town in the first place) as well as cold-heartedly running out on O'Donnell at the same time. There's also a not fully or satisfactorily explained murder of a local blackmailer (Jack Elam) and the periodic insertion of a taciturn Red Indian assistant at O'Donnell's store who seems to serve no material purpose at all. The Lear-type plot (old Waggoman even goes blind at the conclusion) is noble in intent but for me just too convoluted in execution to cover the various plot-holes. That said, Stewart is excellent in his part as the crusading, idealistic but still ornery Lockhart and he, as usual is worth watching on his own. I also liked Arthur Kennedy's expressive acting in a confusedly-written part. Mann's direction has some real high-spots, a forward-tracking shot of Stewart advancing forward to confront young Waggoman in town and some great night-time shots of Vic in pursuit of same (ghost riders in the sky indeed) but all told, while wonderful to behold, tighter scripting would have better served the final outcome here.

Not depressed but rather enlightened. It numbs your senses.Life is beautiful and easy. But why do we have to insist on making it difficult. The films hero Lester is unhappy but wasn't always so. He has a boring job and feels trapped every single day. Just like us all right? You know it. We cant do anything about it because this is how things are right? This is what we have to do survive and be happy right? WRONG.You are wearing a mask and you can change your life anytime you want. Its only a choice. Lester realises this, and starts to make changes.This movie is wonderful. Watch it you must. Hear the messages you must. Life is short, and what we do of it now is what matters because there is only this moment ","genre":null},{"date":"29 May 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie is like a drug.

That's the plot of a great many films, but those films happen to be guilty pleasures for me. And this movie is no exception, it's an enjoyable film with a wonderful cast. Spencer Breslin, the actor playing 'the Kid' does a great job- and I've always been a Bruce Willis fan. The rest of the supporting cast also does some good work- Lily Tomlin is particularly fun. The movie gets you thinking about what you would think if you met yourself as a child- and what that child would think of you. And it shows you that just because you're an adult doesn't mean that you're ever done growing up. Good movie.

However now, the film is in my top three of all time. Watching it makes me forget completely those other things that are going on in my life and makes me feel that things just are not as bad as you think.The whole film is subtle and soft, and yet by the end you care for every character in it. No one is demeaned and everyone seems vital to the films progression, until you find you just don't want it to end. You want to move there and become part of it.I truly truly love this film and I'm not altogether sure why. I just know that I'm always pleased to have watched it, and frequently do.If you try it, I can't promise that it will strike a chord with you, and if it doesn't, I suspect you'll find it boring and dull, but if it does I suspect just as strongly that it will live on with you as one of your 'A' list movies and possibly your number 1 'A' list at that.
