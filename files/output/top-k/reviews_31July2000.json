I had planned to see it, but for some reason never got around to it.  One year and five Academy awards later the movie everyone was talking about is out on video, so I decided to see what all the whoopla was about. I'm one of those people who is really picky when it comes to enjoying certain movies.  Because I'm sick of all the Hollywood clichés and the ooooh, ahhh, special FX without a plot routine.  Well...American Beauty seems to be a remedy for all the crap that is Hollywood these days.Returning home from Blockbuster I popped in the video, turned the lights down and for some reason felt I would be disappointed once again. Needless to say, 123 minutes later as the last part of the credits rolled up and the screen turned blue I was still staring at the TV, completely enriched within my thoughts and contemplation's of American Beauty, the movie `everyone' was talking about.  I mean, to put it briefly, this is one of the best movies of the 90's, one of the BEST MOVIES EVER!! Just in my humble opinion. Never, since Schindler's List or the original Star Wars has a movie been able to engross me in such a story. I mean WOW!! I have so many positives for this film. Basically the movie focuses on Lester Burnham(Kevin Spacey) who is having kind of a mid-life crisis going on.  Since the movie is narrated from his point of view, we can better understand what he's going through and what his thoughts are.  In the beginning of the movie he comes to the rationalization that he's trapped in a meaningless and depressing marriage. His wife (Annette Bening) shows more admiration in her career and affair with her boss than him and his daughter (Thora Birch) who basically hates them both because...well because she's a teenager.  While attending a basketball half-time show to see his daughter cheerlead, Lester goes into a trance when he catches the eye of his daughter's friend Angela(Mena Suvari). The 42-year-old man immediately falls for this 18? 17? year old girl. That seemed to be the catalyst to Lester's transformation.  He dreams about this girl day and night and for that reason turns into a completely different person.  He stops worrying, and just starts living life to its fullest. His new goal is to get into the pants of his daughter's friend and start acting like he was when he was a teenager.  While his new personality may make him happy, it's making the rest of his family miserable, which builds up to the great climax. This movie just isn't about the life of Lester though; it also digs deep into the emotions of the people living around him and next door, with everything coming together at the end.  This is one of those films that is hard to review, one of those films that you can't really describe in words why you like it, only in words why you dislike it.  Many of my friends didn't like this movie because they couldn't accept  the protagonist as a pedophile.  But the girl isn't exactly a youngin' or anything, and I think the majority of people could relate to Lester's hardships.  This movie has just a little bit of nudity and probably one short sex scene.  I don't see how it can really offend anybody THESE days unless you work for the Christian Science Monitor or something like that.  Or maybe it's just the fact that Scary Movie has given me so much shock value that I've become immune.

I'm 17 years old and I am the biggest Kubrick fan I know.  Now that I got that out of the way I can tell you that this film was very good without you saying I should grow up and see real movies. I enjoyed Titan A.E. not only for its animation(which was fantastic) but because the plot that many others picked apart piece by piece was great.

These are, quite honestly, the stupidest aliens I have ever seen on film, and that includes the hapless Stormtroopers as well as those Independence Day dolts.

The short was both sad and terrifying--Karl  Childers is shown as being both a traumatized individual whose childhood horrifies us and someone who terrifies us with the thought that he might be walking among us. However, in the film, the character is changed to a  Charly-type slightly mentally slow (although at times very bright and insightful which didn't seem to trouble Billy Bob Thornton as writer or directer at all) but a good hearted and kind person.   The characters are all unbelievable.   The main part of the story, Karl's friendship with a young boy, is the most unbelievable part of the story--the boy is not presented as enough of  a loser to explain  why he would form a  friendship with someone like Karl.  Ever seen this happen in real life?  In real life, he would try to raise his standing among his friends by making fun of someone like Karl. Then, we are to believe that, somehow, the mental  hospital\/prison Karl was in provided nothing in the way of transition living, but somehow he learned small engine repair there well enough to be given a job by (an  unbelievably good) person.  Despite being institutionalized most of his life and living in a hole the rest of it, Karl somehow has obtained job skills that would be the envy of many employers.  That's believable? Then, after knowing him for only a few days, Karl informs the boy's mother that he was in prison for murdering two people--including his mother.  The boy's mother reacts as if Karl just told her he was in jail for writing a bad check.  I don't care how nice a person you are, you would be  concerned about this and would certainly limit your child's time with someone like this--wouldn't you?  That's  believable? Then there is the mother's boyfriend who, in contrast to everybody else in the movie who seems to be a refugee  from the set of the Andy Griffith Show, makes Hannibal Lector look like someone who you'd like to see your  daughter dating.  He is so one-dimensionally bad that he, too, isn't believable.  You know what is going to happen in the film after about 2 minutes of seeing him.  All you do is wait to see how it happens.  No surprises there! Want another example of how unbelievable the story is?   The little hole that Karl dug to sleep in is still nicely preserved in the back shed--even has all the junk  conveniently piled around it when he goes back to see it 25 years later.  25 years later?  Junk everywhere, but the little hole is still the way it was? The directing is terrible--just once it would have been nice to see a close-up shot of the actors--just to see if they can really act.  Thorton's acting, powerful in the short film, becomes downright silly as the mannerisms which made  him sad and terrifying in the short, seem to occur only sporadically in the movie version.

I have rarely been as impacted by the SECOND viewing of a movie.  It is very encouraging to see liberal Hollywood come out with a big budget, major star picture that treats the American Revolutionary War as something that we should be proud of.  Not only that, but this movie also upholds family, praying, repenting of sins, saving sex for marriage, personal sacrifice, fighting for freedom and what is morally right, and actually gives a positive and admirable portrayal of a pastor\/minister! Wow!The one thing I would warn parents with young children of is that there are a number of very realistic battle scenes.  Even here, though, it is not gratuitous violence, but shows the horror of war.  The realism both detracts from war, and hilights even further the heroism, courage, and selflessness of the heroes (similar to Saving Private Ryan).The cinematography is stunning in this movie, with spectacular scenes and settings.  Gibson gives probably his best acting performance yet.  Also, newcomer Heath Ledger may be the latest teen heart throb to come down the pike, but this one can actually act!I hope this movie is nominated for oscars in cinematography, costume design, best actor (for Gibson), supporting acting (for any number of people), and of course, best picture.- MINOR SPOILER COMING UP -My only complaint with The Patriot is a minor, but confusing, one.  There are two different British officers who look remarkably alike, and both I and the people I've seen this with did not realize that they were different characters until a scene near the end that they are both in.  Honestly, if someone involved in the making of the film were to reveal that it is the same actor, made to appear as two separate ones in this climactic scene, either as a practical joke or for some symbolic reason, I would not be surprised.  However, this does not detract from the gripping storyline nor the enjoyment of the film.Thank you, Mel Gibson, for this freedom-championing, character-celebrating, family-friendly masterpiece!

Bad Creek Power Station is awesome and the tunnel though the mountain to the power station is really impressive. So what's this have to do with a really bad movie. The tunnel entrance is a featured set in the movie and of course I had to see this. Well I saw the tunnel in the movie and Dewey Johnson, the station manager that gave us the tour is credited. But CF is so bad, it hurt sitting there watching the movie. I could comment on the acting, directing, script etc, but needless to say they all contribute to a 0* rating from me. But the really, really worst thing about CF is the geographical incongruity. The movie takes place in Montana. The on-location scenes flip back and forth between Utah and North\/South Carolina. Are the moviegoers of America so geographically challenged that scene changes between Utah and the Carolinas go unnoticed? (Please don't tell me the answer. I just want to assume that the director is extra stupid.) Do everything possible to avoid this movie. CF was near the top (bottom) of my 1999 worst movie list.

Only at a superficial level is this a war movie.

Especially Jim Caviezel's performance is also proof to how some directors like Terrence Malick are considerate for their actors and are willing to take risks allowing them to have important roles.-A movie is ofcourse not complete without a soundtrack. Hans Zimmer has created fantastic music, which sticks to your mind. Especially the scene in the smoke covered forest where the two enemies fight it out. The sensation created was a tragedy.-Finally I would like to finish this review by stating that Terrence Malick has opened a complete new dimension with additional characters (The most striking private Witt), scenes and offcourse message and theme. Too bad that people do not want to realize that theme and originality and the influence of the director is starting to re-shape the classic definition of Hollywood.-As Hollywood as well as America continues to open itself up to the world I am sure that this type of movie will be given more consideration. So cheerfully people speak about Globalisation but we sometimes have to realize that even the people who we consider to be our enemies are not purely evil.
