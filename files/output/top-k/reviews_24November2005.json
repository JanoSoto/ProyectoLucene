In the scene where she finds him and their son digging in the garden, he doesn't explain a thing to her. He just gets mad and acts like a jerk instead of just telling her whats going on. And as a viewer I got mad at him for not explaining a thing to his poor wife. And whats the point of his wife being pregnant when its never talked about during the rest of the film???? And again, the way Tom reacts when he hears his wife is pregnant. This guy got a serious attitude problem!!!!! His wife accepts his reaction just like all the other abuse he subjects her to for the rest of the movie. And whats up with the stupid idea that every time Tom has another vision he gets thirsty and drinks lots of orange-juice?????? Completely stupid and pointless!!!! And the ending *spoiler* is so dumb, that its offending. The father of a kid that shot himself, is told that his son and a friend murdered a girl that they tried to rape. He orders Tom out of the basement and you hear a gunshot. But the guy is not dead. Because when the badgers tries to kill Tom and his wife to cover up the murder of the girl, the guy in the basement pops up out of nowhere and shoots the badgers. And another thing that doesn't make sense. How the hell were the badgers able to bury the dead girl in Toms basement without Tom knowing about it????? This piece of crap is so bad, that I must warn anyone to ever watch this. Not even if you can watch it on cable.And one more thing. Would you people please stop saying this movie is better than The sixth sense!!!! The sixth sense is a good movie. The only thing these two movies has in common is the plot. Only The sixth sense has a good plot. This movie just stinks!!!! Plain and simple!!!!!

It hardly seems worth the fuss. It's a contrived potboiler with tiny shades of David Lynch, the Coen brothers and Tarantino, and even Hitchcock. In fact, the film appears to be mostly a redneck version of Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train.' It also has an interesting cast, although in the end it is the characters that matter and no casting can save what isn't written or directed well. Vaughn's part is the showiest and he has the looks and zest to make it work, but his Lester Long character is played too loudly. There's no undercurrent of madness or menace, no dropping down of voice or personality to reveal the evil behind the mask of charming bravado. And such a flamboyant persona on a traveling mass murderer would make him stand out a mile during an investigation. Indeed, this film's own lack of subtlety is a big part of its problem. It sets up Phoenix's 'Clay' character's dilemma early on, but strains credibility by adding on another murder and then shoehorning in, by utter coincidence, a serial killer (Vaughn's 'Lester Long') to pile up the body count. In fact, even the set-up suicide at the beginning is forced the humiliated husband would simply kill Phoenix then himself, maybe even the wife, too. He wouldn't go through all the trouble to set things up just so he'll be dead with the idea that Phoenix will be accused of murder. In the history of sexual affair crimes when has that scenario ever been seen? And then we follow with another killing by another character (Georgina Cates as the widow) to be followed by Vaughn's 'Lester' popping up to do so more killing. C'mon, now, this is silly. Then there is a pair of federal agents showing up to investigate and we get Janeane Garofalo and John Morris. Now, I think Garofalo is adorable with a low-key presence that is just right for the film (and an antidote to the histrionics of Vaughn) but I can't buy her as a long-time cop. Not for a second. She's slumming as a guest star here (Special Fun Appearance by Ms. Janeane Garofalo) and her partner Morris is something out of an Esquire magazine fashion ad (Special Non-Speaking Performance by Male Model) About the only on-the-money characters are Sheriff Mooney and the slutty widow. Scott Wilson is perfect as the Sheriff and quite believable. Unlike his deputy (named 'Barney' - oh, brother!) the character is not played as a yokel who is in over his head. Then there is the evil widow, played by Georgina Cates, who is letter perfect in the role. Not only that, but Cates is an English actress, yet you can't detect even a hint of her natural accent. And on the pulchritude scale, she and Nikki Arlyn (as the waitress-victim) rate highly. And as for Phoenix, he tries... but it's hard to get behind a character low enough to have an affair with his best friend's wife, and who also can't seem to summon the intelligence to deal with the psychotic personalities of Cates and Vaughn. I also agree with many others who feel that the ending is a sloppy cop-out. It's an attempt at adding one more trick but it seems as contrived as everything else more about cleverness than common sense.

You can either deal with that, or complain as if action is all that matters.This story is essentially about the characters (normal people in extraordinary circumstances).

If you're looking for The Longest Day setup, why don't you check out 'Cliches R' Us'? Anyhow, this is why we don't see the other allied nations in this movie. Spielburg wasn't saying American's did all the work. The story is about soldiers who happened to be Americans. Case closed.Some argue the story is too one sided, portraying all Germans as Dirty Animals. However, there are many segments that suggest this isn't the case. The Americans act cruel in some scenes, and Germans do the same in others. It was fair to both sides. There was nothing enthusiastic in the scene where the two German prisoners are executed. Ultimately we must remember this movie is in the American POV. When Wade and Kaparzo died, we lost two of the films main characters. Of course their death scenes were to be more emotional than that of some 'extra' playing a German.As far as flaws go, there are only two worthy of mention.In the scene where Tom Hanks takes out three men with his Thompson (a minute before he meets Ryan), the very last German dies long after the tommy gun's sound effect expires.In the scene where Jackson is in the church tower (making his final kills before he dies), he fires seven to eight shots with the Springfield WITHOUT RELOADING.

The dark-haired chick reminds me a lot of my sister, who, you see, had different voices for different occasions. And she could switch between them in seconds... really scary stuff. But the kinda voices the girls have just scream of pretentiousness. It also happens to be the tragedy befalling the dark-haired chick is kinda hard to grasp when she doesn't have abusive parents - and isn't getting a job. Still, one might feel for the tragedy which is not having a real mother, if not for it being EMPHASIZED that she really doesn't wanna get a job (she's given opportunity after opportunity - and like the conceited teen she is, they are directly rejected - which she then later on, to up the tragedy-factor, tries to get back and fail).Woo, anger! Still, the geek collector guy is cool, and the chicks DO say memorable stuff.American Beauty has been described as a Fight Club lite, well, Ghost World is an American Beauty lite. So with all its shortcomings I can't condemn other reviews of the film - I can understand if you that turn it off halfway, or get angry you ever wasted a minute on it, or even throw popcorn at the screen. My suggestion would be to see the 2 other movies mentioned, and when you get tired of them, maybe give Ghost World a chance.Now then, we should figure out the ever-important scoring.* Expressed emotion null, annoying. (-3 points) * The pain of being a geek awesome. (5 points) * Social commentary good. (3 points) * Title cool, about the most quotable part...

His plans change to marry his childhood sweetheart Isabel Bradley played by Catharine Hicks, and he goes off to spend some time in France working and ruffling about, forgoing a promised job as a stock broker. When the two meet again, Larry informs his fiancé that he is not ready for marriage just yet, he says he needs some more time to understand it all and his place in the world. His materialistic girlfriend can't wait, and decides to marry his friend instead and live a normal life. Larry doesn't flinch, but keeps going this time to India where he serves as a cook in a temple. He looks at the mountains, contemplates existence and heads back to France.It is perhaps time to say that by this point the director has already showed his strengths as well as many notable weaknesses. His strengths being the choosing the material and casting Bill Murray. Teresa Russell was great as Sophie and would have been even better in the leading female role. As often is the case in this film, the script is too on the nose in order to illustrate a point, and the dialog is too. John Byrum moves too fast to cover all the material, and the film quickly looses its temporal integrity and turns into a guided tour of pretty places and plot points somehow circumventing real drama. Another great weakness is the performance of Catharine Hicks. This movie might have been close to a classic, yet still, if it weren't for it's often abrupt characterizations, and for word MELODRAMA written across Catharine Hick's forehead. Exactly half of the lines that she says ring false in this film. It would have been nice if the director had noticed and reeled her acting in.Robert McKee seems to think that the problem of melodrama is that it stems from lack of motivation. To elaborate for myself, I would perhaps add after watching The Razor's edge that if one were to draw out characters more fully, that would be an effective path to avoiding it. What is melodrama, after all, if not the attainment of tears that have not been earned? The definition of melodrama, or when we say something is melodramatic, is that the dialog, events, characterizations, etc., rely too much on sentiment or emotion, without the sufficient amount of reason for it thrown into the formula. That reason could be anything from events taking shape, the events preceding those events, or a character's performance. It goes to say then, that if there is enough reason or motivation in the characters, dialog, events, etc., then the problem of melodrama can be avoided and true feeling reached.Back in France, Larry continues to work in labor related occupations clearly more content with himself than any of his friends. There is a subplot playing out which is more a necessary event for the plot to take shape than a subplot in that Teresa Russell's character, Sophie MacDonald, losses a husband and a child and turns to drugs, liquor and prostitution. Isabel still loves Larry, and when he brings Sophie back from the precipice of self-destruction, can't leave well enough alone. Her shallowness and jealousy destroy this woman in one or two scenes, and like everything else in this film that Hicks does, nearly destroys it with her performance. Luckily, it is time for Bill Murray to save the day.There is an extraordinary sequence when Larry meets Sophie in Paris. After what seems like eons of space time the film finally hits a triumphant note. Bringing back Sophie from self-destruction in two or three scenes Murray is amazing. He pulls the film back from the precipice and finally gives the story meaning. The last scene is truly spectacular in which his character says almost nothing, and rounds out the film like a great bird that finally comes to a resting place. It is his journey, and luckily the material that has seen to the film's final success.Again, I am reminded that it is almost irrelevant how mishandled a film can be through on to its final stages and still turn out a success if the third act climax works, if the material is set up to work in closing minutes. When I first saw this happen right before my eyes in Pieces of April, I was very much surprised by this as well. The film ran its course through every cliché imaginable, sub-par acting, and script-direction, only to deliver in the closing minutes an emotional satisfying experience; something that a huge majority of other films, with better acting and direction are unable to do.Hemingwayesque in its scope and feeling, this is wonderful movie.

film like a few others about computing software and the internet provide the landscape and little else to guide us threw its scenes.Though many of the scenes are perhaps what makes this film worth watching,in particular there is circa 1930's which combined with a concept of the Big Band Era provide Flappers,Great Sound and a picturesque illusion that is excellent.The illusion however we are reminded is only an illusion(computer generated)and that is one of theflints as to the firewhen one of the illusions learns that there existence is defined by a computer simulated program.The Bartender named Ashton having acted improperly and opened a letter given to him to hold and deliver to a Douglas Hall.The Bartender is part of the cyber landscape that this prototype simulation has created and though he is part of the entertainment scenario located at the Wilshire Grand he shares an error that seems to be occurring with the simulation and that is they haven't ironed out all the kinks.This is part of the problem as the characters begin to share memory amongst those of real persons,coincidently who there lives are modeled after and an error unfolds into a confusing game of mistaken identity and murder.It is very early on in the film it is uncovered that Fuller,who is the creator of the simulation was itching to try the simulation and without following his rules used the program.The untried landscape,though largely complete, needed as prior suggested some work.It is perhaps why Fuller was murdered when upon returning to the starting point he is murdered by a person initially thought to be his partner.If you see in the credits that Douglas Hall is also John Furgason and as well only Doug and here is where the characters and the error in the simulation and if you will reality get mixed up.The inability to properly identify whose who or whats what is a clever attempt at an illusion.It is worth noting that the underpinning to the adventure is that Fuller may be credited with being a very successful computer engineer and as well it can be said of both Ashton and Douglas Hall they as well provide the appearance of acumen and a direct involvement with the computing company in whose building all this seems to occur.Part of the limit if you will is made by the film in that nothing leaves the machines in which they are created in and indeed this and much of the film occurs within the framework of the simulation.It is difficult to make something out of nothing or virtually nothing but this is what the premise to this film is all about.It is very difficult to believe that such would be the case however what makes reality the ultimate beneficiary of this who done it is that the medium needs to be believed and what better way to pin a murder on somebody than through a deadly game of cat and mouse.The unfolding storyline is that Fuller it is thought was using the machine to go back in time and using the simulation to solicit young women,who were more eager than he knew or perhaps ever knew because this is done mostly through suggestion and appearances.The Bartender plays the devils advocate in this suggestive idea however it is Douglass Hall who provides assistance to Fuller to regain his sense of identity with a walk through his experience.Though it is not ever entirely clear a love interest seems to be what is suggested as part of the unfolding storyline and in particular it requires a bit of a stretch as most of this film does in believing what is actually occurring.If there is another conceit that is disguised in this film it is in fact that though we are asked to consider the cyber space adventure as real it is not so much cyber space that is being sold but an idea about an alter ego and the alter ego wins.The cyber space simulation actually fails to hold and the characters come to life right in the very bedrooms of the characters that they were modeled after,which is a bit eerie but it is the conceit of a alter-ego that wins not the computer or in fact computing in general.This is not such an original script but a storyline that is not well developed indeed it would be well to suggest that the errors in the storyline are the errors in the simulation.The detective who guns down a dangerous John Furguson tells gretchen-mol to go back where ever you came from and this is as difficult to fathom as the film is to believe.The appearance of gretchen-mol,fullers daughter was not known to anyone even fullers partner and caught every-one a little bit off guard when she appears and from that point on provides a pivotal ability to unravel who is who.This as stated provides an interesting and even attractive illusion as to appearances and even further it does not so much excite the senses but ultimately fails to deliver the goods.Those goods are based on the premise that this motion picture is in fact nothing but a motion picture and not having anything to do with computing or computing software it merely provides a vehicle for an attractive look-see.The final scene is worthy of indeed success however it like the story line is merely a cardboard illusion providing only that two of the three people suppose to be dead now are very much alive and they have earned a future as indeed the are happy and secure with a scene that though imaginative in now suppose to be June 2024.A final thought and a recommendation.Attractive,colorful(I think those greens are beautiful) even somewhat intelligent.A worthwhile investment that I have watched more than once and with just as much interest as if I was watching it for the first time.A interesting film with of course possibilities.

","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"24 November 2005","score":"","review":" The thirteenth floor is an interesting motion picture that is not able to be honest.What exactly does that mean?This film like a few others about computing software and the internet provide the landscape and little else to guide us threw its scenes.Though many of the scenes are perhaps what makes this film worth watching,in particular there is circa 1930's which combined with a concept of the Big Band Era provide Flappers,Great Sound and a picturesque illusion that is excellent.The illusion however we are reminded is only an illusion(computer generated)and that is one of theflints as to the firewhen one of the illusions learns that there existence is defined by a computer simulated program.The Bartender named Ashton having acted improperly and opened a letter given to him to hold and deliver to a Douglas Hall.The Bartender is part of the cyber landscape that this prototype simulation has created and though he is part of the entertainment scenario located at the Wilshire Grand he shares an error that seems to be occurring with the simulation and that is they haven't ironed out all the kinks.This is part of the problem as the characters begin to share memory amongst those of real persons,coincidently who there lives are modeled after and an error unfolds into a confusing game of mistaken identity and murder.It is very early on in the film it is uncovered that Fuller,who is the creator of the simulation was itching to try the simulation and without following his rules used the program.The untried landscape,though largely complete, needed as prior suggested some work.It is perhaps why Fuller was murdered when upon returning to the starting point he is murdered by a person initially thought to be his partner.If you see in the credits that Douglas Hall is also John Furgason and as well only Doug and here is where the characters and the error in the simulation and if you will reality get mixed up.The inability to properly identify whose who or whats what is a clever attempt at an illusion.It is worth noting that the underpinning to the adventure is that Fuller may be credited with being a very successful computer engineer and as well it can be said of both Ashton and Douglas Hall they as well provide the appearance of acumen and a direct involvement with the computing company in whose building all this seems to occur.Part of the limit if you will is made by the film in that nothing leaves the machines in which they are created in and indeed this and much of the film occurs within the framework of the simulation.It is difficult to make something out of nothing or virtually nothing but this is what the premise to this film is all about.It is very difficult to believe that such would be the case however what makes reality the ultimate beneficiary of this who done it is that the medium needs to be believed and what better way to pin a murder on somebody than through a deadly game of cat and mouse.The unfolding storyline is that Fuller it is thought was using the machine to go back in time and using the simulation to solicit young women,who were more eager than he knew or perhaps ever knew because this is done mostly through suggestion and appearances.The Bartender plays the devils advocate in this suggestive idea however it is Douglass Hall who provides assistance to Fuller to regain his sense of identity with a walk through his experience.Though it is not ever entirely clear a love interest seems to be what is suggested as part of the unfolding storyline and in particular it requires a bit of a stretch as most of this film does in believing what is actually occurring.If there is another conceit that is disguised in this film it is in fact that though we are asked to consider the cyber space adventure as real it is not so much cyber space that is being sold but an idea about an alter ego and the alter ego wins.The cyber space simulation actually fails to hold and the characters come to life right in the very bedrooms of the characters that they were modeled after,which is a bit eerie but it is the conceit of a alter-ego that wins not the computer or in fact computing in general.This is not such an original script but a storyline that is not well developed indeed it would be well to suggest that the errors in the storyline are the errors in the simulation.The detective who guns down a dangerous John Furguson tells gretchen-mol to go back where ever you came from and this is as difficult to fathom as the film is to believe.The appearance of gretchen-mol,fullers daughter was not known to anyone even fullers partner and caught every-one a little bit off guard when she appears and from that point on provides a pivotal ability to unravel who is who.This as stated provides an interesting and even attractive illusion as to appearances and even further it does not so much excite the senses but ultimately fails to deliver the goods.Those goods are based on the premise that this motion picture is in fact nothing but a motion picture and not having anything to do with computing or computing software it merely provides a vehicle for an attractive look-see.The final scene is worthy of indeed success however it like the story line is merely a cardboard illusion providing only that two of the three people suppose to be dead now are very much alive and they have earned a future as indeed the are happy and secure with a scene that though imaginative in now suppose to be June 2024.A final thought and a recommendation.Attractive,colorful(I think those greens are beautiful) even somewhat intelligent.A worthwhile investment that I have watched more than once and with just as much interest as if I

It doesn't dwell too much on the big picture, but focuses on a smaller details which might stir your interest to read up more on that part of history.Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin, a retired soldier, now farmer, who has a war reputation of being a brutal, efficient man of war. He tends to his land and brings up seven children, of whom the eldest, Gabriel Martin (Heath Ledger), goes against his father's wish and enlists in the Continental army to pursue his ideal of freedom and just cause.As Benjamin warned, this war will be fought not on some faraway place, but at their doorsteps. And true enough, he finds British soldiers on his land, who finds fault with him, murders one of his sons in cold blood, and taking away an injured Gabriel. Enraged, Benjamin massacres an entire platoon of soldiers, and earns himself the nickname The Ghost, in one of the more intense battle scenes in this movie. It's satisfying to watch how one man (and his two other children) plan an ambush and take on their enemies, while showing no mercy in their quest for revenge.Drawn reluctantly into the war by his personal unfortunate episode, Benjamin volunteers for service and links up with Gabriel to recruit a band of militia Patriots to take on the well organized British soldiers, using guerrilla tactics to ambush and contain the British in the south, stalling their plans to move up North to crush Washington's troops.It's interesting to note that the British general Lord Charles Cornwallis (played by Tom Wilkinson) was portrayed as a gentleman who fights fairly in his own opinion, and prides himself in doing so. But when the desperation for success creeps in, he sanctions guerrilla tactics against the civilian townfolk in order to get to the Patriots (sounds like modern day terrorism?). You can't help but laugh at his naivety when being conned by Benjamin in one prisoner exchange scene.As with most war movies after Saving Private Ryan, blood and gore get a fair bit of air time, and back in the 18th century, war is fought almost face to face. There is the musket, which fires only one shot, then requires a reload, and a long bayonet affixed at the tip for that bayonet fighting in close quarters. But what really is terrifying is the artillery's predecessor - the cannon. Many scenes in this movie show how a simple cannonball can decapitate human limbs, and even rip a human head off the torso. Pretty gruesome stuff.Running close to three hours long, this movie doesn't bore you with its many subplots about family and relationships, but rather, these elements enhance and bring forth the horrors of war, that everyone out there is a brother, father, son, and highlights that not every war is meant to be for a honourable cause.

This, or rather the lack of this, is the primary flaw in Crash. The characters are wooden; they do not seem attached to their motives or to have any sort of life or personality outside being a vehicle for their motives. After the first 20 or 30 minutes, I just didn't really care what happened to any of them.I also tend to agree with the other reviewers who felt that this movie wasn't the shocker it's often portrayed as. Cronernberg has given us some mighty visceral imagery over the years, but fails to serve up anything really gut-wrenching in Crash. That isn't to say Crash doesn't have its share of sex, violence, and violent sex; it certainly does. But such scenes don't have the impact they should; like the characters, they come off as wooden and fail to engage the viewer's emotions.

Twin Peaks is the prime example of this weakness...the series invoked so many enigmas, mysteries, and disturbing questions in its opening episodes and in its 'middle acts' that the audience was agog to find out how it all 'ended'...only to discover that Lynch didn't really know how to end it, and so the whole thing trailed off with an unconvincing fizzle. However, in his recent films, Lynch and his collaborators seem to have overcome this problem by presenting their stories as an objectification of a disturbed mind's subjective fears and desires. In other words, SOMETHING in the real world has happened to affect the protagonist, but what that something is almost impossible to say...and in fact it is often almost impossible to tell who the protagonist is. Someone is crazy here, but who? So the brilliance of Lost Highway is in the way that this approach plays to Lynch's strengths as a story teller. The themes of alienation in the relationship or the marriage, of sexual discontent and longing, of infidelity, of threatened violence and actual murder...they keep recurring in both of the main characters' lives. But the viewer knows something is wrong, because the majority of events in the plot range from odd and disturbing - to highly improbable - to simply impossible in the 'normal' physical world. So it becomes obvious that the plot is following horrid dream logic, but the question is, whose dream is it, and why this particular dream? By building the story this way, by refusing to explicitly answer that question, and by never actually explicitly mentioning that denial, illusion, mental illness, hallucination or false memories could be a factor (unlike the recent Hellraiser sequels, Jacob's Ladder or Sixth Sense) Lost Highway takes the story into the nightmare realm of the most glumly mystical Kafka stories such as Metamorphosis or The Trial. In this mode of story telling, Lynch doesn't HAVE to resolve the story, he just has to be clever and sensitive enough to immerse the viewer in the circular logic and magical thinking of a disturbed mind in a fugue state. And he does that here with all his usual panache. The actual execution of the film is just what fans have come to expect and love about Lynch's work. You could even call it pure golden Lynch. Robert Loggia and Robert Blake are superb in their roles, embodying menace and creepiness in ways few actors can hope to equal. Bill Pullman also gives the performance of his career here (too bad it didn't do his career more good). The soundtrack, the costumes, the sets (especially Pullman\/Fred's apartment), the photography...everything comes together to pull the viewer into a narcoleptic fog of smoldering desire, hopelessness, muted fear and alienation. I assume that's what viewers of Lynch's films are after, anyway. I have to admit, this one turned me into a fan. But I should qualify that admission in one way. I saw Mullholland Drive before I saw this ,and MH may have helped condition my perceptions and taste for this kind of story. Lynch fans will love it. Polanski, Fellini, and Kurasawa fans will probably love it too. Movie goers who think that the sun rises and sets on Micheal Bay...maybe not so much.

Both documentary styles allow a degree of narrative freedom not permitted by the conventional Hollywood-style of a chronologically ordered series of dramatic scenes.The unique feature of To Die For is the use of both the Cinema Verite and the conventional narrative styles in the same film. Van Sant inter-cuts a traditional dramatic storyline with simulated documentary style commentaries by the principal characters. The commentaries are not just retrospective, they jump around in time and it is not entirely clear the order in which the interviews took place. Four years later Drop Dead Gorgeous would be made entirely out of simulated interviews.The interplay of the two narrative styles in To Die For is critical to the advancement of its theme about the contrasting public and private faces each of us constructs. The irony is that the faces presented in the documentary interviews are much more human and revealing than their counterparts in the dramatic scenes. Perhaps not surprising given our camera whore compulsion, these characters are guarded and private when interacting with each other but liberated, open, and out-there when being interviewed.The most interesting aspect of all this is the plausibility of Kidman's character. At times Suzanne comes across as narcissistic, manipulative, complex, and sophisticated; at other times shallow and naive-dumb. This contrast is because to Suzanne every waking moment is an on-camera moment, yet she is only vulnerably human during her actual on-camera moments. She embodies, to an extreme degree, feelings we have all had in smaller and more subtle ways. She simply lacks the skill and\/or desire to conceal them. Almost everyone has encountered someone who, while a skilled manipulator, is utterly clueless as to the transparency of their motives to everyone but the person being manipulated.Kidman's performance is inspired. Her clothes, her speech, her makeup, her hair, and the way she carries herself all make for a unity of complete self-absorbed superficiality. Suzanne pities us mere mortals &#150; not because we are mortal but because we are not her.The producers seem to have gotten a little confused about just who was their target audience, which would account for the film's poor performance at the box office. Although not exactly high-brow, the movie is obviously geared to a relatively sophisticated audience who can relate to black comedy, parody, and its psychological message. But instead of giving their film a unified style (which consistently connects to that audience), they throw in a lot of crude humor and gross cartoonish behavior more appropriate to a teen comedy. Their target audience and even the type of teens who might enjoy this movie are more put off than amused by this stuff.Which gets into the issue of trimming. The pace of the film is a little slow and the scenes where Suzanne seduces James are embarrassingly moronic and unconvincing; although the seduction dance is exceptional. If they trimmed 10-15 minutes from the middle of the film it would have better unity and would move along faster. The seduction angle would work better if kept off screen, there is enough explanation of these events in the various retrospective on-camera interviews. And they should lose some of the Buck Henry crazy teacher stuff-it works once but then becomes repetitive and unfunny.Illeana Douglas is wonderful as Suzanne's disgusted sister-in-law, who closes the film skating on the frozen lake containing Suzanne's body as the credits roll and Donovan's Season of the Witch plays.
