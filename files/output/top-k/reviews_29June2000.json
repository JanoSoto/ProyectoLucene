This version of the classic story is thoroughly watchable. Gibson is perfect as Hamlet the Prince of Denmark, and he is well supported by Glenn Close (Gertrude), Alan Bates (Claudius), Ian Holm (Polonius) and Helena Bonham Carter (Ophelia). However, after already seeing Kenneth Branagh's 4-hour long version, I was left a little let down. Although this version was only 2 hours 20 minutes approximately, it was more boring in parts than Branagh's was. And no one can beat Kate Winslet as Ophelia, though Bonham Carter performed the lunatic scenes extremely well.The acting, as is aboveforementioned, is the highlight of this version. You can see the emotions boiling over on Gibson's face, and Close gives Gertrude's nature a remarkable realism as both a worried mother and a lustful lover. Bates is the best Claudius I have ever seen, and Holm displays in Polonius what makes him such a great actor.This Hamlet has an extremely good set design that complements the mood of each scene perfectly. The castle has a great look to it, both inside and outside.The costumes, particularly those worn by Close, are excellent. They really highlight the mood and temprament of her character perfectly. On top of this, all of the costumes worn by the players (actors in Hamlet's play) in colour and shape symbolise the message that Hamlet was trying to get across.Technically, this film is very well put together. The shots are each able to complement the action in that shot. Sound effects, especially in the ghost apparitions, as well as the lighting and juxtapositioning, set the moody feel of the film.Of course, one cannot escape comparing this to Branagh's masterpiece, though in its own right is is a great version of Shakespeare's play that, through its star power and easier-to-follow storyline, should attract the younger audiences that saw Baz Lurmann's 'Romeo + Juliet', '10 Things I Hate About You' and will possibly see the upcoming 'O'. ***1\/2 out of *****.

It had a hot and talented young cast, all of whom gave good to great performances.  It had wonderful locations, costumes, props and music.  It had an intriguing plot.  And yet by the end all I felt was ennui.This was a case of a director who couldn't induce the full potential out of his various resources.  Anthony Minghella does a fine job on the cinematography and choice of beautiful locations in Italy, but his crafting of the story left it predictable and flaccid.  This was supposed to be both a character study and a thriller.  It was inadequate on both counts.In a well made character study the viewer will come to understand the motivations of the characters.  This film never delivers in this regard.  The only character that was well developed was Dickie (Jude Law).  Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) was a mystery, just a hanger on.  Meredith (Cate Blanchett) was nothing more than a plot device.  But the biggest reason it came up short was because the motivation of Ripley (Matt Damon) was left too ambiguous.  Was Ripley a cunning con man orchestrating a grand caper, an inept interloper who bungled his way through a propitious opportunity, a victim of circumstances, an unrequited gay lover who committed a crime of passion and then needed to cover his trail?  Take your pick.  Minghella doesn't tell the story in a way that makes this clear.As a thriller, it lacked surprise.  Every murder was telegraphed.  The private investigator gives Ripley a pass at the end, obviating the need for Ripley to provide some clever explanation for all the inconsistencies.  There was not a single twist in the entire film.    It had all the intrigue of playing open handed bridge.For all the raves I've read about Matt Damon's performance, I found it rather uneven.  Sometimes he came across as a clever mastermind and at others a wounded puppy.  It seemed like he wasn't really sure how to play the character.  Again, I put the responsibility for this on Minghella.  I'd call it a generally good performance of a difficult character, but not even close to his dynamism in &#145;Good Will Hunting'. This was a shining moment for Jude Law who gave a career performance as Dickie.  He basically stole the show out from under Damon's nose.  He endowed his character with exuberance, and a cavalier live-for-today attitude that made him charismatic despite his callousness and irresponsibility.  I enjoyed his performance in the unheralded &#145;Music From Another Room' but this one was even better.  If he keeps improving like this, he will be a force to be reckoned with.I rated this film a 6\/10 on the strength of Law's performance and the cinematography.

To wit, what all can go wrong with conspiracies. A flaw that I have seen in too many conspiracy theories I've heard is the suggestion that everything went according to the grand design of the plan. There is always one vital element missing in such theories as this human error.So MANY things go wrong with the great Communist takeover portrayed here. For starters, there's the nightmares that haunt Sinatra's sleep, clueing him into the conspiracy to begin with. The tryout killing of Raymond's boss, unnecessarily taking a risk that raises the profile of the conspirators. Someone at a bar suggesting Raymond play solitaire and then mentions offhand (with Raymond on the Red Queen, of course) for the guy he's talking to to go jump in a lake (which Raymond promptly does). Raymond's would-be girlfriend wearing the Red Queen card the night Raymond is under orders, breaking the spell. Sinatra figuring out Raymond's trigger circuit for the brainwashing program. Finally, there's Raymond himself, full of pain and self-loathing so intense that when he finally finds an outlet for it, he dives in...headfirst. When he loaded his final three bullets, there was no question in my mind who the targets would be.

For starters, there's the nightmares that haunt Sinatra's sleep, clueing him into the conspiracy to begin with. The tryout killing of Raymond's boss, unnecessarily taking a risk that raises the profile of the conspirators. Someone at a bar suggesting Raymond play solitaire and then mentions offhand (with Raymond on the Red Queen, of course) for the guy he's talking to to go jump in a lake (which Raymond promptly does). Raymond's would-be girlfriend wearing the Red Queen card the night Raymond is under orders, breaking the spell. Sinatra figuring out Raymond's trigger circuit for the brainwashing program. Finally, there's Raymond himself, full of pain and self-loathing so intense that when he finally finds an outlet for it, he dives in...headfirst. When he loaded his final three bullets, there was no question in my mind who the targets would be. Pay attention to the whole film from beginning to end and I doubt one would fail to realize what they are.Now, on the subject of Janet Leigh's admittedly nothing role, I believe that her purpose is to be what is called in mysteries a red herring. What that is is something that looks like it's important enough to be a clue, but actually isn't. By the time she's introduced, my paranoia level was running sky-high. It's one thing to know who the bad guys are; it's another to not know who's working for them and who isn't. Therefore, you wondering if she has anything to do with what's going down. I can certainly think of no other reason why Leigh was in there.In conclusion, while The Manchurian Candidate does anticipate the paranoia of the '90s, one of it's more important lessons lies in realizing the pitfalls of all grand conspiracies.

More than any other self-reflexive moment I can remember, Bess's greeting, a sweet salutation really, cuts right through me. Directed by the Dane Lars Von Trier (The Kingdom 1 and 2) and photographed by Robby Muller (Beyond the Clouds, Dead Man), the film's outward appearance is pretentious Euro-trash--seasickly handheld camera movement, long dramatic pauses, direct addresses to God, and panoramic shots of surrealistic landmasses in between acts, backed up by Elton John pop tunes.These precise elements, though, are what make the experience so unforgettable. It is a cruel classic, one that requires a dedicated, corn-fed viewer to properly absorb all of its emotion. Telling the ostensible story of a simple woman who is shattered by the paralysis of her husband, it's much more literate than it might seem. Love, it illustrates, is a very mighty power.The performances of Stellan Skarsgard, as Jan, Bess's starry-eyed husband, and Katrin Cartlidge, as her down to earth sister-in-law, permeate every quiet moment with unspeakable compassion.But in the lead role, Emily Watson delivers what is doubtlessly one of the three or four greatest screen performances of all time, a haunting, meditative, lurid, and astoundingly courageous job in which is she conveys supposedly misbehaved emotions that other actors would need a lifetime to draw out, if ever at all. A first-time actress, almost every scene of the film could have easily been screwed up by her, particularly a number of moments which require Bess to talk to directly to God, playing both parts. (Her literal interpretation of religion must be rationalized properly if we are to understand this film--especially its highly contested final shot, which I won't even get started on.) Watson, who hasn't been half as good in anything since, makes every exquisite second of the film, indeed every little smile, though-provoking and multi-meaningful. More than any other film of the 1990s, and despite (or maybe because of) some truly disturbing subject matter, Breaking the Waves is the kind of movie to watch with someone you love.

On the other hand, I have never seen such an amazing commentary on the motivations of Great Men. The film is really a contrast between two types the internally and the externally motivated man.  On the one hand is Harold Abrahams, a man who has never been beaten in a race, coming up against his own limitations. He is the externally motivated man--he runs to fight the racism he finds in England because he is Jewish--he feels compelled, driven to race to prove that he is better than the non-Jews around him. ON the other hand, there is Eric Liddell, his polar opposite. A man who feels compelled to run because of his Scottish Presbyterian religion  When I run, I feel God's pleasure. He has hurdles to overcome, himself, in the form of his family who feels that his life is better devoted to missionary work.The real crux of the matter is which one is the greater man--a question that is not resolved when they race against each other.

As an American, I realize that the winners of the wars almost always skew the facts and figures in their favor (this includes the English, the French, the Germans...it is not merely an American fault). I'm not going to say that if you hate this film you're in the wrong because you're not patriotic, or un-American, but please have some respect for both sides of this great conflict. The British were by no means villains (perhaps King George was a bit of a jerk) but soldiers are by and large innocents in any war, fighting for causes that sometimes they don't even understand. It's strange that some of the viewers (at least I think they actually saw the movie) say the British were depicted as villains. Wrong. The scriptwriter, if anything, went out of his way to show that nearly every English soldier in the film were honorable and unwilling to commit atrocities...there was ONE villain, and he was viewed by his own allies as unstable and cruel. One final thought...there can be no accurate telling of any war in the end, and least not one with emotion. Both sides will always feel they were in the right, both sides will always want to tell their tale and deny all others. If England (or Canada, for that matter) wants to take a shot at filming the Revolutionary War in a realistic fashion (bearing in mind that they could not simply turn the tables and depict English soldiers as heroes and the colonists as monsters), they're welcome to try. I think that the English are just extremely bitter souls right now...think of everything they lost over the last 400 years...I'd probably be bitter too.

It would be a thinking catalyst. For people who never cared the movie would be boring. For big-brained true believers who know for sure that god is male, Jesus was white (jewish, whatever) and the exact number of apostles was twelve it would be outrageous. Decide what fits you.As to technicalities, the movie is not as perfect as it is perceived by some. Yes, talky script by master Kevin Smith is quite good, there are some truly hilarious one-liners. Yes, overall filming quality is good. Special effects, although cheesy, are well done given the film budget. But the acting is bad at times. Although Linda Fiorentino delivers solid performance, but Ben Affleck sometimes overdoes it and looks fake .If you read some comments about this film you'd see a bunch of smart people rushing to tell you that Jesus was not black, or that angels cannot become humans when angels' wings are cut off, or that there was no thirteenth apostle, contrary to what is stated in this movie.This is not a documentary movie, so we cannot expect from it to follow exactly canonic christian texts, can we? It interprets many issues loosely which makes it quite thought provoking. Did Jesus have brother and sisters? Is working in an abortion clinic a crime against God? is God almighty and omnipotent in the sense we impart in these words?Obviously, some big-brained Catholics (or Christians) did not realize that the movie was a comedy and became its targets. Just as funny as a professor trying to prove he's a smart guy to a court jester who called him an idiot. Who on earth can prove that God is not a woman or that Jesus was not black?This movie teaches one to look at things, the bible included, critically. Not to say the bible said so but think critically and creatively about faith. It gives an inspiration to keep it, but to distinguish true faith from religious dogma.

This is the tale of an unprejudiced heart, pronounces the sonorous narrator, and how it changed life in our valley forever. Now come on, has any movie ever had a pitch as emotionally loaded, as uncynical, and as singularly immaculate as that? Culled from an original fable, but reminiscent of the most fanciful writings of Aesop, Potter, and Orwell, Babe is indeed a talking-pig movie, but only in the most superficial terms. Seen through the eyes of a small white piglet who embodies the purest of existential ambitions, the film is a perfect metaphor for societal prejudice, individual aspiration to achieve, and the grim realities of animal life. And although it has its cheerless, manufactured moments, it is never preachy (saying more with two words--That'll do--than most movies say altogether), and extends its message of love and harmony without a drop of sentimentalism. Won by a Farmer (James Cromwell) at a state fair for use as a future Christmas ham, Babe the pig is taken in by his surrogate mother Fly, a sheepdog. Immediately the pig wants to be a sheepdog as well, and--being completely unaware of the rigid social dynamic of the farm--sees no viable reason why he shouldn't be one.One of the most lovable aspects of little Babe is that oftentimes we do doubt his intelligence--pigs are indicated as being the stupidest creatures on the farm, and there are occasions when Babe's bumbling disposition suggests exactly that. But what saves Babe is his sincerely good heart. The tenderness and benevolence in his sweet voice manages to affect every living thing on the farm--including the Farmer. While special credit goes to the combination of computer animation, live animals, and puppets that make up the expressionistic barnyard posse, a very unique mention should go to Cromwell too, so humbly transcendent and human as the Farmer, and making for one-half of the most memorable screen friendship of the decade. The role is almost speechless throughout, but it climaxes with his singing of the lullaby If I Had Words to Make a Day For You to the frail and gloomy Babe, a scene that might be second to none in terms of its emotional punch. Babe and his friends were seen again in a sequel, Babe Pig in the City, which was a terrible financial disappointment but actually equals its predecessor in many respects, tackling even darker issues. Both movies exist as if the medium was invented exactly for this--to tell the tale of an unprejudiced heart.
