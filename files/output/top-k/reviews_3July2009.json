[{"date":"3 July 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" With this film taking place in the 1930's in Britain, it is obvious that the film is trying to convey the distinction of people in a social status. The whole household is filled with many problems, for all the different people. The upstairs people are terrifically unhappy because they are so worried about their wealth. But, the serving staff is also a mess because there's so much gossip and duties that they don't have time to just relax and enjoy themselves. Upstairs, Sir William and his younger wife, Lady Sylvia, engage in a very relaxed lifestyle of shooting, dinners and parties, and downstairs, while the servants are downstairs and they work endlessly under the command of the butler Mr. Jennings, and the house keeper Mrs. Wilson. The poor and less fortunate are treated horribly in this film, and the motto seems to be, If you're rich you can do whatever the hell you want, but if you're poor you need to slave all day for the rich. This is an unjust way to live and treat the poor, and this movie was made to challenge our society to give them the respect they deserve. There is definitely a hierarchy in the household, especially with the cooks and those who work in the kitchen. There are many times when characters ask each other what job they held previously, and at one time one of the cooks took offense to being called a factory worker. Also, in another part of the film a servant walks through the room where all of the rich are chatting, but when he walks through everyone goes silent. This shows how poorly treated and disrespected they are in culture. A few more examples of the unjust hierarchy in this estate are that the servants' quarters have no windows, everyone sits at the dining table in order of their employers' social rank, and the maids are referred to by their masters' and mistresses' names instead of their own. The wealthiest characters in Gosford Park all have an extremely bias view on the world where they look down upon those who are less wealthy. They aren't respected as well, or treated with as much dignity. It's like the poor in our society today, because we don't value them at all. In the movie, Freddie and Isabelle are interrupted by a footman while in a conversation, and Freddie says, It's nobody. This is just another example of the dehumanizing and unjust treatment of the poor.The only concern that the wealthy characters in the film had was how to obtain more wealth. One main example in the film where money is aggressively sought after is the time when Freddie Nesbitt had finished going through his wife's money, and started an affair with McCordle's daughter, Isabelle, in an attempt to blackmail her and getting her father to find a position for him. He uses the girl because he wants more money, and like every other character in the film he's all about greed. Another example where wealth is the only focus is the time when Sir William and Lady Sylvia cut cards with one of Lady Sylvia's sisters to see who would have the money from the wealthy businessman.In the end of the movie, Sir William is murdered. The 'blame game' goes on inside the estate for quite awhile, until Robert Parks fesses up to Mary that he killed Sir William. But Mary is Parks' mother, and she knew that Parks was eventually going to kill Sir William because he had abandoned Parks at an orphanage as a child, and he abused his workers. The message Gosford Park is getting across is you can be the wealthiest man in the world, but that will not buy you happiness. Sir William was extremely wealthy, but he abused almost everyone that worked for him, and he even abused his son by leaving him to grow up at an orphanage. It all came back to get him in the end, and what we need to take away from this film is that every human being, no matter how rich or poor you are, deserves the same respect and dignity as everyone else in order to achieve a just world.HOW MANY STARS (out of 4)? 1.5 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 July 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" With this film taking place in the 1930's in Britain, it is obvious that the film is trying to convey the distinction of people in a social status.

I do not look down on Americans. I know lots of people that are intelligent people from the USA. But this Movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it.First of all...Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Lots of scene's are so incredibly false. For example the departure of the 2 space ships. You see them drop off the full tanks in space. Just a small distance from each other. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? Just a tinsy winsy part that came off. In here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. What idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? Second of it is that the Russian station is a piece of (s)crap. I hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to Russia. Since their equipment is much more reliable then NASA's. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it just to pay off the bills. And there is no better alternative for it. And the list of whoppers goes on and on. This is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. And i know half as much as these guys do. But the most annoying part ( read the whole movie ) is the Propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. MY GOD !!!! I thought i was looking at a CNN business commercial for like an hour. The actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? Maybe i lack the feeling of being a true Patriot, that can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. Whilst riding with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me too handle. And when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. I do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. But i pity them. This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as Uncle Sam thinks you are a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares.

Linklater through his filmography has shown a fascination for conversations, for opinions and he sets a fairly high benchmark for his characters in that regard. Waking life is simply the concoction of different conversation, different view points of people from different strands of life and their take on meaning of life and purpose of life as they see it.Why are we here? What is it that makes us human? Is this a reality or a dream? Questions that Linklater has pondered over through his filmography. As one of the reviews put it, it is a film for passionate thinkers. It can come of as pretentious for some, but for me the movie struck all the right chords. It was released few weeks after 9\/11 when there was a sense of disorientation with world for me. This movie was exactly what I needed just to put things into perspective.What is the story? As one of the character says, there is no story just people, gesture, moments, bits of rapture, fleet of emotions. In short, the greatest stories ever told. The protagonist floats and flies from one dream to the next, from one conversation to the next. Ther is no coherent screenplay, just ideas bouncing off the characters in an urge to find new meanings to our existence and purpose. The protagonist clearly is an intelligent person as can be assessed from the grade of the discussions in his dreams. Life understood is life lived.Waking Life is philosophical and playful at the same time. It's an extravagantly inventive film that begins with actual footage of real actors and then translates them into animated images; it's called motion-capture, and you can see it in Beowulf and 300, but it was startling when Linklater made his film in 2001, and showed it didn't need to cost millions. A founding member of the Austin, Texas, film-making crowd, he collaborated with a software genius named Bob Sabiston, who did it all on Macs. It's visually bright and alive -- a joy to regard. The animated nature of the film also gives Linklater the license and technique to create a dream like quality to the film, of course it looks absolutely stunning.It is a film that requires patience from its audience, but also need them to submit.

But I'll tell you what I've accepted just sort of glide along. You want to keep things on an even key, this is what I'm saying. You want to go with the flow. The sea refuses no river.

This high-tech action thriller, based on a very good novel by Roderick Thorp, is a classic in its own way on account of the fact that it has revolutionized and influenced generations of action-buddy movies and is still mimicked and studied to this day. Apart from spawning three sequels, Die Hard is also a source of the most memorable lines in movie history, it introduced the great Alan Rickman to the screen, and unlike say Commando (1985), is a believable action movie with only a handful of moments were disbelief needs to be suspended.Bruce Willis stars as a New York police officer visiting his alienated wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and his children for Christmas. When he arrives at a party held in his wife's company's towering skyscraper and the building is overrun by what appears to be a West German terrorist attack, Willis evades capture and begins a one-man war with the enemies all the while trying to rescue his wife and communicating with the LA police through Reginald Veljohnson on the ground.Now, right from the start, this is a classic idea. What kind of action movie-lover is not attracted to the concept of not only a one-man war against terrorists, but also this battle being held in a claustrophobic skyscraper? But Die Hard is so much more than just an original action thriller. It's equipped with eye-popping special effects, truly riveting action scenes, and what's more, it's populated by well-realized, thoroughly developed characters with problems and goals, and full of very classic and original lines of dialogue.The main thing I really liked about Die Hard was the Bruce Willis character, who does not become Arnold Schwarzenegger or Rambo once pitted against these terrorists. Rather, Willis is rather cowardly, spending most of his time running away from the terrorists as opposed to charging them head on in that same campy style that we've seen frankly too many times. And the great human touch is how Willis plays a troubled character, who before being caught up the battle, was trying to rekindle his relationship with his family, and ultimately proving to us that he's not very happy with his life or himself. He oftentimes talks to himself, sarcastically commenting on his mistakes and errors, and overall, you get a very sympathetic person with a good heart, but a poor way to expressing himself, and yet fights at his fullest to survive to end of the day.But arguably the greatest performance in the film goes to Alan Rickman at the lead 'terrorist' in the film. Before this, Rickman had only been seen on the stage as an actor until the producers of Die Hard saw him perform and knew that he would be perfect casting as Hans Gruber. Rickman is very adept at playing devilish and frightening characters, finding just the right note every time to generate fear and suspense, such as this great scene where he gives a hostage three seconds to provide him with what he wants or else.So we have a great hero and a great villain. As for the rest of the cast, they don't stand out as far, but with witty dialogue and realistic performances, they also aid in the film's entertainment. There is one weak point to the film, one that Roger Ebert noted in his shockingly negative review, at that relates to the Paul Gleason character, an LA deputy chief unwilling to believe that Willis is not a terrorist. Gleason did, I think, as fine a performance as he as an actor could have done with the material, but some of his dialogue, meant to produce laughs, turned out as rather unnecessary and annoying and it may have been better to ultimately eliminate the character from the script. But eventually, he tones down, and does not stop the film cold in its tracks.And of course, we cannot leave out the action sequences. Director John McTiernan utilized the loudest blank cartridges Hollywood could produce to great what he called exaggerated realism and worked many months with the sound department to create boomingly loud shots. And the pyrotechnics crew is due enormous credit for creating the feeling that bullets really are clattering about the walls of the skyscraper or tearing through human bodies. Many times in films, we see blood spurt, but it doesn't generate the feeling that bullets are striking. In Die Hard, the violence is choreographed so well that it simply cannot be put down as unrealistic. There are also some incredible stunt sequences with only a handful of moments that require us to suspend our disbelief.And ultimately, that's the genius of the film. It's a story that we can believe. It's not Rambo with nothing but the improbable taking place. It's a sly, witty, realistic and sometimes dramatic action-thriller that is just as intense and riveting today as it was in 1988 and better than most or all of the big-class mimickers that have been released since.

Like a great piece literature, painting, poetry, speech it has the capacity to change the way you feel and think. It is the biggest compliment I can pay to a film. I rank Groundhog Day with Seventh Seal, Wild Strawberries, Waking Life, Synecdoche New York, Tokyo Story, Ikiru as one of the moves that has the capacity to change.It is anything but a preachy film as the intro to the review might suggest.

The plot revolves around a weather man (Bill Murray) is reluctantly sent to cover a story about a weather forecasting rat (as he calls it). This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realization that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.The challenge here for the makers was in terms of screenplay, editing and performances. Bear in mind that, the loops Bill Murray's character goes through, might become redundant for the audience after a while. This is where the genius of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray comes into play, who seem to introduce a novelty factor with every shot of the same sequence. I couldn't think of any actor other than Murray who could have pulled this one off.It is a movie likely to deceive you in its effortless narrative and casual comic tone. Yes, it is funny, but make no mistake about it, it is a film with a strong philosophical undertone. This is a quality that separates Groundhog from rest of the movies with similar intent.

Posters, dolls, and even squirt guns hit store shelves, and the Elm Street franchise became more about marketing blitz than horror. Scary scenes gave way to scary amounts of merchandising money, and a character who once lurked in the shadows of our subconscious nightmares was soon just as at home as a blurry bit of pixelation on your NES console.Though memory is a bit fuzzy as to which Freddy products came out before, during, and after A Nightmare On Elm Street 4, the film was regardless the first in the series produced under the umbrella of Freddy as a viable mainstream property (looking back, it's actually quite amazing there was never an Elm Street Saturday morning cartoon). With more money in the production budget, and a clearer sense of who the core demographic for Freddy's nocturnal mayhem was, The Dream Master looks immediately different than any entry in the series up to that point. This film is Freddy as tailored for the MTV generation (there is even a commercial for the channel in the film... which repeats twice, no less). Somehow, the idea of a maniacal night-stalker being given a high-gloss makeover simply doesn't sound frightening, which would lead many to anticipate this film to be a new low in the already fading franchise.Shockingly, when you remove any expectations of watching a horror movie from this experience, Elm Street 4 actually ends up being one of the best outings in the series, loaded with enough unique ideas to fill several films, and enough special effects to fill a hundred.Tellingly, the opening credits list more FX personnel than actors, as the real star of this show is the visual effects. Our young cast embodies characters who are so one-dimensional that we only learn enough about them to set up their eventual demise (Rick does kung-fu and is killed in a dream dojo, Debbie hates cockroaches and meets her fate in the bizarro Roach Motel sequence, etc.).So, we've clearly shifted gears from a horror franchise to a series of fantasy-based films. But once you adjust to this change, it's hard not to be impressed by how fantastic the fantasy elements are. Freddy's blades are all but retired here, replaced by a new ability to insert our characters into a funhouse designed especially for their singular traits. But the film-makers weave such a rich and clever tapestry of dreamland dementia, it's nearly impossible not to get sucked into it with our doomed teens.The film, admittedly, also has weaknesses galore. Our previous heroine Kristen returns, but instead of the strong and multi-layered character essayed by Patricia Arquette in Dream Warriors, we get a neurotic and generally annoying turn by reliever Tuesday Knight. The MTV elements come to the forefront thanks to a loaded soundtrack (admission I paid 39 dollars for a CD copy of it on eBay) that combines the awesome with the awful, so the film has aged poorly because of its dated tunes. (It's also worth noting that the producers were far too literal in their song selection The film opens with a song with the chorus refrain running from this nightmare and closes with a number that repeats the mantra don't be afraid of your dreams). More disturbingly, Freddy's tendencies toward lame humor, only hinted at in previous outings, now dominate his character, and the cackling antagonist is unable to be on screen for 10 seconds without delivering a groaning zinger.But, dude, those effects! The smörgåsbord on display here runs like a textbook, and almost no area of special effects is left undiscovered by the film's end. The film-makers also enlisted several different teams to produce all of these wonders, so each nightmare sequence has a unique stamp that fits with the individualized nature of each death.Problematic? Yes. But this entry is far better in terms of simple entertainment than most give it credit for. Taken on its own, it holds up remarkably well, even if as part of a franchise that once generated genuine scares, it doesn't quite live up to expectations.We're removed from the media blitz now (at least until the re-imagining of the original Elm Street comes out), so it's a good time to take another look at an outing that sets a high bar for imagination and ingenuity that would never be matched again in a Nightmare film.

There is no whodunit because we know from the start but there is knife-cutting suspense as the viewer waits for the outcome. The young men giving the party are John Dall as Brandon and Farley Granger as Philip.The awkward attempt at a cover-up pushes the limits of risk-taking, particularly as the younger man played by Farley Granger becomes more and more unhinged by the suspicions and questions of an academic named Rupert Cadell, played by James Stewart. Cadell gives a rationale for certain murders during the party conversation; however, Cadell is not about to condone a senseless and ruthless crime. Cadell is not a man of great virtue or the common touch and has possibly contributed to the twisted thinking of the two Ivy League young men who are hosting the party. This movie gives us a sense of Hitchcock's sympathy for the average person, as opposed to the highly intelligent, refined characters who are often portrayed as traitors and murderers. Hitchcock often shows his dislike of those who see themselves as superior and elitist in movies like Saboteur, Notorious, North by Northwest. Aside from the fine performances by Stewart, Granger and Dall, the cast is generally good, particularly Cedric Hardwicke as the doting and worrying father, Mr. Kently, and Edith Evanson as the maid who natters on and carries on, blissfully unaware of the crime. Constance Collier seems to fit the bill as the party's gabbing-machine. The movie is a series of long takes that give the viewer a feeling of being there. This is a trademark of Hitchcock. There is one take that focuses on the maid as she goes back and forth from room to hall with the conversation clearly in the background. It is almost as if the audience is a fly on the wall, listening to the conversation and watching the maid at the same time. We also wonder how long it will take her to see the truth that the viewer already knows. There is a tension in the room that the viewer feels throughout, as if we are there but cannot say anything. Cedric Hardwicke becomes more and more uneasy about his son not showing up. James Stewart becomes more and more suspicious. John Dall and Farley Granger fight an overpowering fear. Others seem to wish they were not there at all. After the suspense and wondering that seems to titillate us for so long, the ending is understated. There is no gotcha or summing up from any of the actors as the action slowly winds down. I felt great admiration for this well crafted thriller so heavy with fear and foreboding. While the movie is loosely adapted from a play, it seems fit Hitchcock's wish to deliver a lesson to those who place themselves above the law.

What he's hot about is selling used cars and bedding floosies. He scans the small town scene to see what's available. He's a hunk with a gift of the macho and an ability to move clunkers off the lot. What he finds is the used car lot of George Harshaw (Jerry Hardin) in need of a salesman. George has a bad heart and a young and sexy wife, the aforementioned Dolly Harshaw (Virginia Madsen, who once played in a movie called Zombie High or The High School that Ate My Brain). She's a woman who always gets what she wants, and once she sets her rapacious eyes on Harry, Harry is what she wants.Harry has other plans however. There's this bank in town that he just happens into as there's a fire going down the street. The bank is wide open and there's nobody there but this blind old black guy and the bank manager. Seems that the surveillance system isn't working and what's more all the tellers are off fighting the fire because they all belong to the volunteer fire department. This gives Harry ideas.One more complication. Doing the books for George is Gloria Harper (Jennifer Connelly at 19) looking about as tasty as pie a la mode and as ripe as a peach about to fall off the tree. Harry soon discovers that she is as sweet as Tupelo honey and nearly as innocent as a small town girl can be with one strange problem. It seems that a country degenerate named Frank Sutton (William Sadler) has got some kind of hold on her.So what we have here is a setting for film noir circa 1990 done up in color with a lot of upper body and tail end nudity and plenty of steamy sex. Will Harry pull off the bank job and retire to the Caribbean? Or will he put on George's shoes and service the very serviceable Mrs. H? Or will he succumb to the charms of Gloria? Or will he end up afoul of the local law or meet foul play at the hands of Frank Sutton? Stay tuned. I know I did even though this is not exactly a masterpiece.Top three reasons to see this diversion are (1) Virginia Madsen, who is as hot as the barrel of an AK-47 as it unloads with a mind devious enough to delight the devil himself.(2) Jennifer Connelly, who is pretty enough to awaken the libido of the dead.(3) The nice twist at the end in which we learn that life has a certain perverse logic to it, proving that the hero may not get what he wants, but hey, things could be worse.I guess I should also mention the direction of Dennis Hopper who has garnered over 200 film credits in a career going back to the fifties. Can you believe he played in the classic teen angst film Rebel Without a Cause from 1955? Here he just panders shamelessly to the prurient interest of the audience while moving the action along at a spritely pace.One problem for today's sophisticated viewer beware of being overcome with a constant stream of cigarette smoke.

I know I did even though this is not exactly a masterpiece.Top three reasons to see this diversion are (1) Virginia Madsen, who is as hot as the barrel of an AK-47 as it unloads with a mind devious enough to delight the devil himself.(2) Jennifer Connelly, who is pretty enough to awaken the libido of the dead.(3) The nice twist at the end in which we learn that life has a certain perverse logic to it, proving that the hero may not get what he wants, but hey, things could be worse.I guess I should also mention the direction of Dennis Hopper who has garnered over 200 film credits in a career going back to the fifties. Can you believe he played in the classic teen angst film Rebel Without a Cause from 1955? Here he just panders shamelessly to the prurient interest of the audience while moving the action along at a spritely pace.One problem for today's sophisticated viewer beware of being overcome with a constant stream of cigarette smoke. I mean, did the tobacco industry front the cash for this?(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Story starts when a man named Franky Four Fingers smuggles an 84 carat diamond to London to sell to a jeweler on behalf of his boss. And then a lot of crooks and biggies get involved. And everyone is trying to snatch something from others; hence the name Snatch. Now this storyline may seem very familiar to you; and in a sense it shares some flavor with The Departed and Babel, but the real killer is the way story is told. I have got to give to Guy Ritchie. I mean what a comedy! The criminals in the movie are not white collar ones, they are the bums for whom crime, violence, theft, debauchery is a way of life. And each of them has his own idiosyncrasies; which ultimately screw him up at some point or another. And still all of them continue so nonchalantly through all the mess.

This is perhaps well-warranted; Nolan not only captures the essence of the Dark Knight as his world, he also reinterprets it for a new generation. Does the success of the Nolan films Batman Begins and The Dark Knight mean that we should forget about this 1989 film by Tim Burton? Not at all.This film still holds up after twenty years. There's no wonder why we still watch The Wizard of Oz or Star Wars; some films are just timeless. And while this film may start becoming outdated (in terms of special effects, etc.), it shouldn't be forgotten that when it was first released, it was simply revolutionary. Before this film's release, the general public's view of Batman was Adam West -- he's fun, he's adventures, but he's still goofy. This was a far cry from the comic books of Frank Miller and Denny O'Neal, who sought to return the Caped Crusader to his dark roots. But Tim Burton's Batman changed all this by introducing to the general public the idea of a Darker Knight. And boy is this film influential! This started the trend of making dark Batman films. A popular cartoon (Batman The Animated Series) was created because of this. This movie also introduced the all-black, rubber suit (instead of using gray and blue\/black tights), something used by prospective films, and is still used today with The Dark Knight. Burton added darkness into Batman cinema; Nolan took it a step further. Without Burton, there'd be no Batman films today.Burton has an interesting vision of Gotham. While not as realistic as Nolan's, Burton's Gotham is still gritty. Here you have street gangs, corrupt cops, and lowly street thugs. There's even some profanity here. Adding to this is a mixture of 1980s clothing and technology with 40s\/50s fashions lifestyles. The Art Deco buildings blend well with the Gothic architecture. Here you have an atmospheric feel, a dark, brooding mood, a mixture of realism and surrealism. It's like you're in a comic book brought to life...yet at the same time, you're in real-life.Michael Keaton is still great as Batman. He has presence, capturing the brooding nature and elegant style of the Dark Knight. While I'm not a big fan of his socially awkward Bruce Wayne, Keaton truly makes you believe he's Batman. He uses two distinct voice for Batman and Bruce Wayne, and he still delivers shivers at the I'm Batman scene in the beginning with the quiet, raspy, and simply haunting voice of his.Some may have complained that Batman is underdeveloped as a character in this film, and not much attention is focused on him. While this may be true, the film actually benefits from this. Batman is mysterious, lurking in the shadows, the way he should be, and the decision to limit his scenes perfectly captures this. And besides, this is supposed to be Batman's first appearance, and the mysteriosity works very well. I especially loved portrayal of Batman as a urban legend -- a great introduction indeed!Jack Nicholson is still a great Joker. While not as frightening as Heath Ledger, Nicholson's Joker was very evil and very twisted for that time. Here's somebody who turns his assistant into a living work of art, causing her to commit suicide later on, shoots his boss fanatically while enjoying every minute of it, and tries to kills everyone is Gotham; this is something that no pre-Nicholson Joker would ever do! And boy does Jack steal the show. His tone of speaking and mannerism and a joy to watch, and he has some of the best lines in the movie -- just as delightful to listen to as Ledger's.And who can forget that iconic score by Danny Elfman? It is simply beautiful. It was nice to listen during that scene with Batman and Vicky Vale on the Batmobile as he drives through the night, and the finale in the end is an even greater joy to listen to, with Batman perched on a rooftop with the Bat signal in the sky. That is a scene that gets stuck in your head, and there are perhaps many more in this film.

Does the success of the Nolan films Batman Begins and The Dark Knight mean that we should forget about this 1989 film by Tim Burton? Not at all.This film still holds up after twenty years. There's no wonder why we still watch The Wizard of Oz or Star Wars; some films are just timeless. And while this film may start becoming outdated (in terms of special effects, etc.), it shouldn't be forgotten that when it was first released, it was simply revolutionary. Before this film's release, the general public's view of Batman was Adam West -- he's fun, he's adventures, but he's still goofy. This was a far cry from the comic books of Frank Miller and Denny O'Neal, who sought to return the Caped Crusader to his dark roots. But Tim Burton's Batman changed all this by introducing to the general public the idea of a Darker Knight. And boy is this film influential! This started the trend of making dark Batman films. A popular cartoon (Batman The Animated Series) was created because of this. This movie also introduced the all-black, rubber suit (instead of using gray and blue\/black tights), something used by prospective films, and is still used today with The Dark Knight. Burton added darkness into Batman cinema; Nolan took it a step further. Without Burton, there'd be no Batman films today.Burton has an interesting vision of Gotham. While not as realistic as Nolan's, Burton's Gotham is still gritty. Here you have street gangs, corrupt cops, and lowly street thugs. There's even some profanity here. Adding to this is a mixture of 1980s clothing and technology with 40s\/50s fashions lifestyles. The Art Deco buildings blend well with the Gothic architecture.

Naturally, the two came together for Total Recall, a unique sci-fi\/action-hero story that finds everybody's favorite Austrian on the red planet, battling mutants, struggling with his identity and crusading on behalf of those in need of some clean, breathable and &#x96; most importantly &#x96; free air.Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick (whose work has made it to the big screen also in the form of Minority Report and Blade Runner, to name a few), Total Recall is a landmark both for its stunning visual effects as well as its non-stop pace and over-the-top action. Arnie is in top form as the everyday man who exchanges routine and security for confusion and paranoia when a vacation company toys with his mind. Rekall, the company in question, will implant a memory &#x96; for a price &#x96; that will make you think you had an incredible vacation (or in this case, an action-packed adventure that will satisfy all your wildest cravings) when it was all just a pricey dream. Unfortunately, things go very wrong very quickly for our hero. His wife (Sharon Stone) turns against him, as it turns out she is a secret agent who has been spying on him throughout their marriage. In turn, he finds himself being chased by a gang of cronies -- led by Michael Ironside -- to what appears to be his home planet, where he hooks up with an ex-lover (Rachel Ticotin) and makes acquaintances with a three-breasted prostitute, a cab-driver with bad teeth and a really grotesque and unappealing mutant (who can also be seen in the Aspen episode of South Park). Is it real, is it a dream? What makes this film truly genius and leaves room for many a repeat viewing is that, in the end, it's totally up to the viewer.Verhoeven throws everything AND the kitchen sink at his film. Total Recall is as chock-full of mind-games as it is action, and is possibly the man's finest film to date. Even today, 19 years (!) later, it still holds up, both in its story and in its visuals. Those seeking some escapism but with a film that carries as much brain as it does brawn, can do no wrong with Total Recall. One of the finest from one of the greatest action heroes of our time and one of the most under-rated directors in his time.
