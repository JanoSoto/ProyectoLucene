Just a note..Lynch sucks! His movies are ludicrous and serve one point- to be pointless.  Anyhow...this movie should not be compared to that at all.  It is amazing.  I rarely say that about a movie, especially a movie in spanish where I'm forced to read the subtitles, but this movie just blew me away.  The story is very original, some compare it to total recall, etc, but I think it is totally unique, and I like the fact that it's spanish, aka in no way, shape, or form made by hollywood.  Bad thing is-Tom Cruise bought the rights, and is remaking it, starring who?  Yep. To Cruise.  I think it's sad, because people will forget the original and go for the remake, and you know how Hollywood can screw up a good movie...I bet they do it here too.  One of the things that made this movie so good was the fact that I had never before seen the actors, beside Cruz, who is stunning.  The remake has Cameron annoying, no talent diaz in it, so I'd stay away.  Check this movie out.  It draws you in, and you cannot stop watching.  It is beautifully shot in Spain, I think, and the cinematography is spectacular, if you ask me.  This is a great movie, one of my favorites.  10\/10 definitely.

I've been playing this game since 1974, and had figured that, ok, it's probably going to be a good bit of an insider's movie; ya know, where you have to be familiar with the game in order to fully appreciate the thing. No dice. The best thing I can say about this intellectual insult is that, had it been someone's game that I just started playing, I'd've walked out and put the ref on my doofus list. Do not, repeat, do NOT see this film. Run in fear from it. Run far, run fast, scream in fear at the very suggestion of seeing this tripe.Here are some pet peeves (spoilers included); 1)  Where'd the beholders go to after the idjit thief tossed a rock to distract them? Were these things from the monster reject pile? Some guards. 2)  Here we had two thieves breaking onto some sort of wizards school making all sorts of noise while climbing down the rope. Yet, once they have tumbled into a noisy pile on the floor, then the brighter of the two cautions to be silent. 3)  When Ridley derides Marina, he actually comments that she is `low level.' C'mon, people, level is an abstract in the game and not a quantity that you wear around your neck on a sign. 4)  The show culminates in some sort of dragon war that Profion and Savina get into. Well, I don't know about you, but any city subjected to that much dragon power should be nothing but rubble. Anyway, this dragon war is between Red Dragons and Gold Dragons. Taking a quick gander at my copy of D&D, I see that the Gold Dragons should have pulverized the Reds without even breaking a sweat. 5)  Thieves Guild Maze. Snort. Three room, one corridor `maze.' Need I say more? 6)  The two thief characters seemed to be taken straight from some inner city in the US. Nothing like hearing colloquial American slang in a medieval fantasy environment.Hopefully, LoTR will cure me of my fantasy film malaise. As Tolkien was the basis for D&D in the first place, I guess there's no better film idea than LoTR to be a D&D environment.

I am not going to waste time on discussing the script, the acting, the camera angles,  etc. All this stuff has been addressed well  enough in other people's comments, and I  basically agree with them despite all their  diversity, because the only important thing  about such purely subjective matters as  comments is the integrity of a person's  opinion. From this  viewpoint, there is nothing much left to say.  Instead, I would like to take a look at the  movie form a different perspective, which in  itself is not original, either, but is still  worth a little more attention, necessary to  emphasize the basic difference in people's  perceptions of this piece of cinematography.  I will speak in rather general terms, for  the most part without specific reference  to Kubrick's film. It is hardly arguable that an essential  element of horror is the incongruous. Hence,  the effect of a good horror flick must be of  hypnotic nature, so that you should believe  in what shows on the screen in almost the  same way as you believe in the absurdities  of your own dreams. The essence of hypnosis lies in turning on your subconscious. Hence  what you see before your eyes isn't so  important as what's going on before your  mind's eye at the same moment. It stands to  reason that for its full effect an act of  hypnosis doesn't have to look like a  superstar performance. The same with a horror movie, which doesn't  have to be a masterpiece, or something,  simply to produce a profound sense of fear.  Reversely, no artistic merits whatsoever can  help if the movie fails to convey this  subliminal message. I guess, there is hardly anybody who would  measure the psychological effect of his or  her own nightmares by their artistic merits.  Nightmares are scary not because they have a  convincing plot, or anything of that sort,  but simply because the person is asleep, i.e. in a special state of mind that submerges part of the conscious deep into the subconscious,  thus bringing the rational into close contact  with the irrational, which is exactly what is  responsible for the worst human fears. People are susceptible to hypnosis in a  different measure. Hence different reactions  of various parts of the audience. Some people  are not hypnotic enough, and the mesmerizing  passes are lost on them. The eyes of these  persons are not turned inward, but only outward as they keep counting the swings of the pendulum, as it were, instead of going to sleep. These  individuals are evidently terribly bored, and  are consequently at leisure to catalogue a lot  of annoying details about the hypnotist the  tones of his voice are not convincing enough,  the passes he makes are not impressive, and,  for God's sake, his shoes don't hardly Shine  as they should. If you don't like Kubrick's film, there is  nothing I can do to talk you into believing  that it's great, and if you do like it, there  is nothing I need to say further. But if you  haven't seen it yet, well, that makes a  difference. Chances are you just might like  it, but the problem is, this might be a little  more than what you bargained for, because the  subliminal effect of this horror flick, unlike that of tons and tons of others, seems to be  virtually never-ending. It's almost as if the  hypnotist is gone without waking you up, and  you seem to be stuck forever in your mental  Overlook, just like Jack in the end. Of course,  it's all mighty personal, but who knows? Anyway, if you happen to be the suggestive type, be advised that an excellent relief for the  anxiety of your white nights resulting from  inadvertently watching this movie could be easily  afforded by reading the numerous negative comments, which, luckily, never fail to appear, so you will  always be quite comfortably provided in this  respect.

Of course,  it's all mighty personal, but who knows? Anyway, if you happen to be the suggestive type, be advised that an excellent relief for the  anxiety of your white nights resulting from  inadvertently watching this movie could be easily  afforded by reading the numerous negative comments, which, luckily, never fail to appear, so you will  always be quite comfortably provided in this  respect. For a better therapeutic effect, you might even feel like writing some such comment of your  own. A ready-made summary Who's afraid of the Dull  Boy Jack? would suit the material just fine.

It is hard to believe that Newman is 75.  He is fitter and more energetic than most men who are fifteen years his junior.  He single-handedly elevates this film from mediocrity.The story is nothing unique.  Henry (Newman) is a bank robber who is delivered to a nursing home after a debilitating stroke.  His nurse (Linda Fiorentino) suspects he is not the vegetable he appears to be.  After she gets him to admit his ruse, she exhorts him to knock off an armored truck with her.Director Marek Kanievska and writer Max Frye leave numerous gaps in the story.  We never discover what tips off Carol that Henry is faking.  They didn't do enough character development of Carol and Wayne (Dermot Mulroney) to make it believable that they would want to become criminals, no less hatch the scheme.  The idea that Carol was pretending to be the dispatcher for the armored car company from a cell phone in the truck is a flimsy concoction.  Even with digital technology, most cell phones in moving vehicles sound like cell phones, and you can hear road noises and the engine running.Still, despite a lackluster script, the film is enjoyable because of Paul Newman.  Newman gives a fantastic rendition of a stroke victim, and his hardened and cantankerous portrayal was marvelous.  Linda Fiorentino plays the scheming sex-kitten nurse in one of her better performances.  The screen chemistry between Fiorentino and Newman is excellent with undercurrents of sexual desire constantly flaring up between them.  Dermot Mulroney is relegated to a role that was essentially a fifth wheel and is adequate as Carol's loser of a husband.I rated this film a 7\/10.  It is good entertainment and an opportunity to see a master at work.  Newman hasn't lost a beat in a movie career that spans almost a half a century.  It is worth seeing for him alone.

It IS snickeringly silly - the soon-to-be-immortal champagne\/urn scene; the cat-milking discussion; the skimpy swimming trunks; the volleyball bloodbath; the flushing cat; the wooden altar conflagration; the septic tank spray etc.; all good, healthy, daft, slapstick, prurient, scatalogical stuff.  And while I in no way condone Greg's vile rage directed at the air-stewardess, it is very funny.But, 'Meet the Parents' has the emotional truths that turn it from being merely a funny film into a comedy classic.  Anyone who has ever been married or about to will recognise the horrible accuracy of this film.  My own father-in-law is remarkably like Jack Byrnes here; not that he is an ex-CIA spycatcher (at least, I don't think so); but in his ability to intimidate, humiliate, terrorise, impose his power.My point is that Jack's profession is only a comic exaggeration of what all fathers- or mothers-in-law are like, figures terrified of losing their children, defending them like animals in the wild, convinced that a prospective so-and-so will never be good enough for our baby, not even thinking that neither might they have been; refusing to admit they are getting old, that they are losing power and control.It's only logical that the monster in-law from hell should be obsessive about power and control.  His domestic panopticon is a superb metaphor for extended family life, the idea of being judged, marked on 'success' or 'suitability' ratings, your every personal, financial, health etc. problem a matter for family investigation.  Bitter, moi?  Greg should be lucky Jack isn't married to Monica Geller's mom.But the film doesn't simplistically pit Capraesque good guy Greg against shady CIA man Jack.  If Jack is all about control, then so is Greg.  The film has one of the best musical openings in recent memory ('if you're gentle and sweet, you're an idiot...'), but the opening montage is more sinister, as a faceless cameraman takes home movies of a pretty blonde. Pam is the true victim of this film, the prize in a macho battle of wits, the female bystander in the great masculine generational conflict, as Jack proves he's not past it, and Greg proves he's not a loser.  Those voyeuristic home movies echo Jack's surveillance cameras and perform the same function, to watch, to control, to limit (just as Kevin remembers Pam by his photographs and his erotic memories).One is heartened by the ironies of the ending, not just Jack breaking his word, determined to keep up his power games as he watches his CCTV's filming the most private places, where people are at their most vulnerable and exposed (revealing, truthfully, that the in-law struggle never ends)The film also has some cutting things to say about the lingering anti-semitism in WASPish society; nothing much has changed since 'Auntie Mame'.It is wonderful to see Robert de Niro finally getting a decent comedy.  He has always been hilarious in 'straight' roles ('Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver', 'Raging Bull' etc.), but his comic vehicles have spluttered to a halt.  He is genius here, his menace, his gestures, facial contortions, way of throwing out a line like he's garrotting it - bliss.  If 'Parents' finally lacks the pull of a film like 'There's Something About Mary', then it's probably the nature of the plot.  'Mary' had an active plot, it was a quest, necessitating narrative and character development, and thus more audience commitment.  'Parents' is purely destructive, as Jack tries to destroy a love that's already been built up.  Sadly, this scenario is much truer.

While the costume may be the only star, Christopher Reeve gives the Man of Steel a certain dimension and boy scout personality as the hero takes on the mantle of protection too huge for even his shoulders. Margot Kidder is the first actress to give Lois a sexy but aggressive edge never before seen in the old TV series. Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, however, is no more than a sinister comic relief who could have been portrayed closer to a prime underworld figure than an evil comedian. Most of the best lines are his.

His  third film, 'The Thin Red Line', was vigorously discussed-and inevitably compared- to Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'.  Malick was robbed on Oscar night.  Contentions fall where they may, that matters little.  (Scorsese and Kubrick were never favored at the Academy either.)    The existential philosophy presented in 'Line' places it far above the likes of 'Ryan'.  Think of Spielberg's war film as pyrite, and Malick's as a cultured pearl.  Therefore, I will not devote another word to comparing that hack (Reese's Pieces, anyone?) to a traveled thinker like Malick.    Fade in on men wandering in the depths of the Japanese jungle, trembling, armed, ready.  Cut to a bird, watching over the men.  There's a war going on all right, and it's much bigger than Guadocanal.  Malick underscores man's purpose and place in life, showing war as an evil deviation from nature that poisons the soul.  Malick's work here, a meditative study on man's essence to wage war on opposition, reverberates to truly great directors of the past.  Such films as Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood' or Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' lend their contemplative breath to this film.  Beneath the layers of bloodshed and gun smoke rests a callous and withdrawn observation on humanity-- almost as if this film was made by an extraterrestrial documentarian.    It is this level of callous thought and impersonal narrative that defines this film and defies the rigid company it is placed with.  Unlike any war film before it- with the possible exception of 'Apocalypse Now', 'Line' delivers a stunning journey into the collective spirit of the human race.  Profound cinematography, brilliant and truthful acting, and a broad palette of emotional paint weave a tapestry of storytelling that should be studied for decades to come.Tolka's Bottom Line  Take a really deep breath, hit 'play', and don't look away until you've redefined your understanding of spiritual conflict.
