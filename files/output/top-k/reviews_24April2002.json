People who try to get inside his head in order to scour it out with steel wool wind up kind of sympathizing with a guy who was one of our most disliked recent presidents. It would be so easy to chop him into bits.  Here he is, scowling, peering out from under his eyebrows  -- but no.  Nobody seems able to finish him off.  Lane Smith gave us the sad portrait of a man with a subtle sense of humor on TV years ago.  The historian Steven Ambrose started out to do a hatchet job on him in his biography.  Ambrose was an anti-war activist during the 1960s and early 70s, no Nixon lover, but has admitted in interviews that the more he looked into Nixon's life, the more empathy he had with him, not that he ever liked him -- Hell, Nixon didn't want to be loved; he wanted to be feared.  Stone's picture of Nixon is also rather sympathetic to the man, if not to the president.  It's a rather decent movie.  Stone's direction and editing militates against its being a very good movie, though.  I do wish he would dump some of his directorial excesses in works like this where they don't belong.  The result of all those lightning flashes and negative shots and one-second newsreel clips and multiple voiceovers is not insight or surprised pleasure, just vertigo. There must be some better way to show us Nixon's hardscrabble background. The cast is uniformly professional and competent, although I daresay that if you're not familiar with the story already you may get lost somewhere along the way in the multitude of supporting players.  Sir Anthony Hopkins' Nixon isn't the public Nixon we know.  He's Sir Anthony Hopkins playing a rather nicely put-together character with only a superficial resemblance to the historical personage.  It's still Nixon, of course, with his arid, sweaty grin, but the voice is quite different.  It's no longer English, but it's certainly not Nixon either.  Let's say that if you relax and close your eyes you begin to get intimations of John Huston in his speech.  He's got Nixon's hubris down pretty well, as in the Saturday night massacre when he wants to fire everybody in the Justic Department right down to the janitors. But ninety percent of the time, Hopkins' Nixon is a tortured human being.  What he's tortured by is never made clear.  Several portentous epigrams pop up to explain what's driving him -- He had greatness in his grasp, or whatever. Joan Allen as his wife asks, When are we going to stop paying your debts. (Try, If I hadn't been rich, I could have been a really great man.)  Was it his distant, stern religious father?  His cold, distant, religious mother?  (Nixon was raised a Quaker and his mother was devout.  Quakers don't get down on their knees and pray, as the real Nixon pointed out in an interview with David Frost.)  Maybe there is no big secret and no clinical archaeology is required.  Nixon simply might have thought he was ugly -- what with that nose and all.  It was good enough for Richard III.  The real Nixon, by the way, as far as we could get to know him through his public appearance and through one-on-one TV interviews, was capable of making quick and decisive decisions and emanated an air of self confidence.  This quality is lacking in the Nixon we see here.  And if he did get drunk and start mumbling to presidential portraits in the White House and if he wept and prayed, well, so what?  A lot of people would have handled his disgrace with less class.  (By the way, who squealed on him about that final scene?  Der treue Heinrich?)  Now, as much as I hate to admit the extent of my insensitivity and ignorance, after having watched the original TV spectacle of the Watergate Hearings, at least with one eye, and watching this film, I'm still not clear on exactly what he did that was so terribly wrong. Aside from the good things, like softening relations with China (which we called Red China), he seems to have suggested that the FBI cut off its investigation of that ridiculous burglary and at least hinted that an audit of his enemy's income taxes might reward the scrutiny of the IRS.  Man, were we naive in 1973.  After his fit of weeping, Nixon wanders the White House with a few aides and bemoans the fact that social institutions are no longer respected, the press has become an enemy, people have become cynical about politicians and so forth.  Right on the button, Dick!  He complains to his wife that the press and the public are not after him just because of any crimes he may have committed but because they hate him, yes, Richard M. Nixon.  I suppose this scene is supposed to be evidence of his paranoia. (How easily we sling these terms around.)  In retrospect, he seems to have been about half right.  He was elected president twice because he seemed the lesser of two evils each time.  Hubert Humphrey in 1968 was seen as a representative of the administration that had brought us Vietnam, whereas Nixon had a secret plan, which he refused to discuss.  In 1972, his opponent was George McGovern who made wild promises while trying desperately to prove that the party which had torn itself apart on very public TV four years earlier was now ready to roll again.  (He gave up, long before the election took place.)  I expect only a minority of people voted for Nixon because they actually liked him as a person.  I recall one of the reasons some people claimed to hate him.  Nixon had admitted in an interview, perhaps in Playboy, that his favorite food was cottage cheese with ketchup poured on it.  I may vote for that man for president but cannot bring myself to like him, I say to myself as I sit down to my dinner of escallope de veau chanticleer.  All the rest of Oliver Stone's film, meaning the hints and allusions to something going on during the missing 18 minutes, something about a Bay of Pigs deal with the Mafia that was somehow, some way, linked up with assassinations, and so forth, is nothing more than implausible and distracting conjecture.  Nixon's fall from office, his evidently unethical and perhaps illegal behavior while occupying that office (he was never convicted of anything), came as a shocking surprise to a public who found suddenly, to their fathomless dismay, that a president was actually capable of using the word expletive deleted in what he thought was a private conversation.  We've learned a lot since then.  Nowadays we hound our nominees and elected officials until we discover that, like all the rest of us, they did something naughty -- then we hang them.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"24 April 2002","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  Nixon must have been an interesting private figure.  People who try to get inside his head in order to scour it out with steel wool wind up kind of sympathizing with a guy who was one of our most disliked recent presidents. It would be so easy to chop him into bits.  Here he is, scowling, peering out from under his eyebrows  -- but no.  Nobody seems able to finish him off.  Lane Smith gave us the sad portrait of a man with a subtle sense of humor on TV years ago.  The historian Steven Ambrose started out to do a hatchet job on him in his biography.  Ambrose was an anti-war activist during the 1960s and early 70s, no Nixon lover, but has admitted in interviews that the more he looked into Nixon's life, the more empathy he had with him, not that he ever liked him -- Hell, Nixon didn't want to be loved; he wanted to be feared.  Stone's picture of Nixon is also rather sympathetic to the man, if not to the president.  It's a rather decent movie.  Stone's direction and editing militates against its being a very good movie, though.  I do wish he would dump some of his directorial excesses in works like this where they don't belong.  The result of all those lightning flashes and negative shots and one-second newsreel clips and multiple voiceovers is not insight or surprised pleasure, just vertigo. There must be some better way to show us Nixon's hardscrabble background. The cast is uniformly professional and competent, although I daresay that if you're not familiar with the story already you may get lost somewhere along the way in the multitude of supporting players.  Sir Anthony Hopkins' Nixon isn't the public Nixon we know.  He's Sir Anthony Hopkins playing a rather nicely put-together character with only a superficial resemblance to the historical personage.  It's still Nixon, of course, with his arid, sweaty grin, but the voice is quite different.  It's no longer English, but it's certainly not Nixon either.  Let's say that if you relax and close your eyes you begin to get intimations of John Huston in his speech.  He's got Nixon's hubris down pretty well, as in the Saturday night massacre when he wants to fire everybody in the Justic Department right down to the janitors. But ninety percent of the time, Hopkins' Nixon is a tortured human being.  What he's tortured by is never made clear.  Several portentous epigrams pop up to explain what's driving him -- He had greatness in his grasp, or whatever. Joan Allen as his wife asks, When are we going to stop paying your debts. (Try, If I hadn't been rich, I could have been a really great man.)  Was it his distant, stern religious father?  His cold, distant, religious mother?  (Nixon was raised a Quaker and his mother was devout.  Quakers don't get down on their knees and pray, as the real Nixon pointed out in an interview with David Frost.)  Maybe there is no big secret and no clinical archaeology is required.  Nixon simply might have thought he was ugly -- what with that nose and all.  It was good enough for Richard III.  The real Nixon, by the way, as far as we could get to know him through his public appearance and through one-on-one TV interviews, was capable of making quick and decisive decisions and emanated an air of self confidence.  This quality is lacking in the Nixon we see here.  And if he did get drunk and start mumbling to presidential portraits in the White House and if he wept and prayed, well, so what?  A lot of people would have handled his disgrace with less class.  (By the way, who squealed on him about that final scene?  Der treue Heinrich?)  Now, as much as I hate to admit the extent of my insensitivity and ignorance, after having watched the original TV spectacle of the Watergate Hearings, at least with one eye, and watching this film, I'm still not clear on exactly what he did that was so terribly wrong. Aside from the good things, like softening relations with China (which we called Red China), he seems to have suggested that the FBI cut off its investigation of that ridiculous burglary and at least hinted that an audit of his enemy's income taxes might reward the scrutiny of the IRS.  Man, were we naive in 1973.  After his fit of weeping, Nixon wanders the White House with a few aides and bemoans the fact that social institutions are no longer respected, the press has become an enemy, people have become cynical about politicians and so forth.  Right on the button, Dick!  He complains to his wife that the press and the public are not after him just because of any crimes he may have committed but because they hate him, yes, Richard M. Nixon.  I suppose this scene is supposed to be evidence of his paranoia. (How easily we sling these terms around.)  In retrospect, he seems to have been about half right.  He was elected president twice because he seemed the lesser of two evils each time.  Hubert Humphrey in 1968 was seen as a representative of the administration that had brought us Vietnam, whereas Nixon had a secret plan, which he refused to discuss.  In 1972, his opponent was George McGovern who made wild promises while trying desperately to prove that the party which had torn itself apart on very public TV four years earlier was now ready to roll again.  (He gave up, long before the election took place.)  I expect only a minority of people voted for Nixon because they actually liked him as a person.  I recall one of the reasons some people claimed to hate him.  Nixon had admitted in an interview, perhaps in Playboy, that his favorite food was cottage cheese with ketchup poured on it.  I may vote for that man for president but cannot bring myself to like him, I say to myself as I sit down to my dinner of escallope de veau chanticleer.  All the rest of Oliver Stone's film, meaning the hints and allusions to something going on during the missing 18 minutes, something about a Bay of Pigs deal with the Mafia that was somehow, some way, linked up with assassinations, and so forth, is nothing more than implausible and distracting conjecture.  Nixon's fall from office, his evidently unethical and perhaps illegal behavior while occupying that office (he was never convicted of anything), came as a shocking surprise to a public who found suddenly, to their fathomless dismay, that a president was actually capable of using the word expletive deleted in what he thought was a private conversation.

Curtis and Lancaster are in top form. The supporting cast is superb. Harrison's debut in the role of JJ's sister is a revelation...pity she appears not to have done much thereafter.

It had been a long while since I'd last seen Sweet Smell and I had only a vague recollection of it. My reaction can only be summed up in one word WOW! - amazing to see Time Square in all its original film noir glory (now sadly lost). Times Square and other iconic locations (21, Toots Shore's, 23rd & Fifth Ave.) that figure prominently are today either gone or hardly recognizable...and it wasn't all that long ago! The cars jamming those mean streets and the way people dress and behave are long gone too. But the riveting thing sitting in the audience is that you aren't witnessing some clinically researched painstaking Hollywood recreation of late 50s New York - this is the real deal...there's a documentary quality to Sweet Smell from that standpoint. Watching the film you realize we may live in New York now, but it's not the same place - not anywhere near.

They tend to be overdramatic and display an acute sense of melancholy that I do not find myself partial to. &#145;Triumph of Love' is a period piece that at times can be quite enchanting, and at other moments may seem like a droopy, overdramatic and mundane film.       Director Clare Peploe adapts a Marivaux play first performed in 1732 co-written by Marilyn Goldin and Bernardo Bertellucci into a fairytale.  Mira Sorvino stars as a Princess fixated on returning her homeland's throne to its' rightful heir who happens to be a prince under the protective custody of a deliciously uncovered Ben Kingsley who portrays a famous philosophist. Kingsely excels as a solitary intellect that outshines the rest of the cast as a man urged to follow his sexual thriving for the female flesh that he has come to loathe.  Hermocrates (Kingsley) despises the opposite sex and preaches these values to his subject Agis. Little does Agis know that he is the rightful heir to the throne and the film's momentum slowly builds upon this tiny aspect.       Reminiscent of &#145;Shakespeare in Love', Sorvino plays a Princess who must disguise herself as a gentleman caller in order to penetrate the grounds Agis inhabits. The film directly starts with the resolute transformation from Princess to Man in the Princess' chariot and before the opening credits are over, we are straight into the story. The film structures itself through a triangle of deceit, manipulation and false love as the Princess must first gain access into the grounds and then find a way of being welcomed as a guest.      Seduction of the sexes is a primary factor as the Princess eyes both man and woman in hopes of luring the young Agis who she is ultimately in love with. Director Clare Peploe crafts a witty period piece that will appeal mostly to its' intended audience who appreciate and understand the manner in which these films unravel themselves. Peploe's first attempt at differentiating the film from the theatre production in which it based upon is to give the film a unique cinematic style different to the conventional &#145;movie based on play' productions. Peploe uses her camera wisely and enjoys tracking the actors in their scenes as the play is removed from the film. Yet, we are candidly reminded that this was indeed a play when we see the whole cast within a matter of moments and notice the same areas being used for principal photography.       Credit must be given where credit is due, Peploe conveys the artistic integrity of the film beautifully but in my opinion, a play is a play. No matter how much exquisite beauty one can frame within a film, or no matter how many times you use clever camera work to make your actors appear as true thespians, the film seems to sporadically quicken in pace and then slow itself down into a paste at times that ruins the overall enjoyment of the film. Furthermore, watch for an interesting musical finale lifted from the play that explains why throughout the film we see audience members dressed in current day clothing within a period piece.       While it is a clever and crafty little film, the film will not appeal beyond its' intended audience due to the fact that while it is an interesting piece at times, it tends to get bogged down in semantically torrid and comedic sequences that deter the picture. Its' subtle yet profound theme of sexuality is best served under a different pretext and while it has some truly great dialogue, it still cannot save the film from a mediocre exercise from a playwright's mind.

It is the first of these BATMAN films not to have Tim Burton in the director's chair, and also the first not to have Michael Keaton playing Bruce Wayne\/Batman. Although the film is a Tim Burton production, it is directed by Joel Schumacher (THE LOST BOYS), and Val Kilmer (TOP GUN, WILLOW) wears the cape for this installment. Other new characters include Chase Meridian, a criminal psychologist, played by Nicole Kidman (DEAD CALM); Dick Grayson\/Robin, a young man who has fallen under circumstances similar to young Bruce Wayne's own, played by Chris O'Donnell (SCENT OF A WOMAN); the villains, Harvey Two-Face Dent and The Riddler, a.k.a. Edward Nygma, played, respectively, by Tommy Lee Jones (THE FUGITIVE) and Jim Carrey (THE MASK). Veteran character actor Pat Hingle returns to the cast as Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon, and Michael Gough also returns as Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred Pennyworth.This movie is difficult to place in terms of how I would rate it among the four pre-BATMAN BEGINS BATMAN movies. It is not the best, certainly; the original BATMAN wins hands down, for reasons that factor into my review of FOREVER and which are explained below. But whereas the second movie became obsessed with Burtonesque cinematic vision and a dark, gruesome mood that was definitely not for the children the advertising was targeting, BATMAN FOREVER told a story that, although more acceptable for young viewers, failed, in my opinion, to be a convincing part of Burton's BATMAN mythos at all.First, this is a very fast action movie. I had trouble following some of the action scenes, they went by so rapidly. This was accompanied by a dizzying way of moving the cameras that shot these scenes. It was disconcerting and dizzying, and a great many times I lost track of what was going on visually altogether.Speed was also a damaging factor in character development, especially that of the villains. I was annoyed to find that certain scenes crucial to the establishment of Two-Face's character were cut out somewhere between the publication of the publicity comic and poster books and the release of the film. Two-Face is suddenly dropped on us as a villain Batman is fighting without even a polite explanation of how the actor had changed from Billy Dee Williams to Tommy Lee Jones.I also had a problem with how Jim Carrey played his role. He played The Riddler\/Ed Nygma in a way that made him scarcely discernible in voice or mannerisms, to my observation, from Ace Ventura or The Mask. I noticed something strange I was remembering a very funny line Carrey had delivered (he is quite comical and had me laughing numerous times), but I could not remember for the life of me whether the character who spoke the line was The Riddler or Ace Ventura. And the worst part was, it really did not matter. I had no reason whatever to be interested in the villains, other than for the fact that they were endangering Batman and Gotham City. This was a far cry from Nicholson's Joker, and also from DeVito's Penguin and Pfeiffer's Catwoman.I was also disappointed in the FOREVER music. I listened to the orchestral music that underpinned most of the movie and found myself wishing profoundly for Danny Elfman's work. That was another difference I did not like.But it's time to say a bit about what I did like about the movie. Not all the film was too fast. The scenes where Dick Grayson is taken in by Bruce at Wayne Manor and he discovers himself and decides he wants to help Batman after his parents are killed under circumstances similar to Wayne's own loss are done well and paced just about right. Also, the scenes where Chase Meridian wants to unlock Bruce Wayne's bad memories about his parents' deaths are slowed down to a point that they are believable, despite the fact that Val Kilmer is no Michael Keaton, and Nicole Kidman is no Kim Basinger, in terms of acting skill with such scenes. Schumacher pulled those scenes off well.The stunts themselves were pleasing and plentiful. One such stunt involved the Batmobile using a grappling hook to ascend the side of a building with as much ease as its driver normally would. This stunt was needed, in my opinion, because for all the look of the new Batmobile's design, it did not seem as functional or stylish to me as the models in the previous movies. But it was used rather well, as was Batman's silken cord, which he used in an amazing rescue where its strength was used to support a bank vault. When the aforementioned pace and camera technique did not leave me totally lost or with a dizzy headache, the stunts and the special effects were quite a bit of fun to watch. At times they seemed to take over, but usually this was again the fault of the film's pacing.BATMAN Forever was not terrible. In some ways, it was quite good. It succeeded as a suspense-filled modern action film, and it has a decent amount of kid appeal. I would have no qualms about taking a child to see this movie; the youngster would have a ball. To me, ultimately, its failure was that it was not much more than that. It made me miss Burton's touch. Unfortunately, the franchise would not learn from this lesson, and we got another movie's worth of dreck afterward. I sometimes wonder if this film was the beginning of the end.

What do I do now, Ma?  It's easy to visualize Eastwood sitting down alone and frowning, because he's really thinking hard, you know?  And kind of doing thought experiments.  And ruminating somewhat along these lines  The Western is headed toward the graveyard.  Not much future there.  The main battle in the early 1970s is in modern society, corrupt as it is, what with Watergate and whatnot.  Dirty Harry Redux?  No -- not yet.  Not again.  How can I remold this image in which I've been cast.  Sergio Leone said that Michelangelo could look at a block of marble and see the man inside, but that he, Leone, could look at me and see the block of marble inside.  Not very nice.  A good thing he didn't speak English and I couldn't speak Italian.  Wait!  I think I've got it!  We'll take Dirty Harry, give him a new name and location, and turn him upside down!  Well -- sideways anyhow.  We'll suggest that he's a drunk, but drop it pretty soon.  There's a limit to how dirty we want this guy to be.  And this time we'll -- that's it! -- we'll give him a girl!   Ben Shockley isn't the brightest cop on the planet, but despite that initial pint of booze falling out of his car, and his day-long stubble, he gets the job done.  The job is picking up an informer in Las Vegas, Gus Malley, and getting him to Phoenix so he can testify.  The Phoenix police force however is corrupt at the top and the betting in Vegas is against Shockley and Malley reaching Phoenix.

The plot is an examination of a walking appetite trying to fulfill itself by subjugating and controlling what it wants.  Buñuel brings this to life with Fernando Rey playing an older man who has every need and luxury covered, but cares nothing for it if he can't have an enigmatic young woman named Conchita.  Played alternately by an austere beauty, Carole Bouquet, and an impish vixen, Angela Molina, Conchita literally morphs away from him every time Rey's character comes close to having sex with her.  Until the very end, she confounds and frustrates him because she is what he can never have.This is one of those movies that irritate people for several reasons.  As a number of other reviews point out, Rey's Mathieu and Conchita are pretty repugnant people.  Simply put, the kind of person that expects movies to provide characters who are morally good people to identify with will be as disappointed with Obscure Object as with any Altman or Kubrick film.  It isn't that kind of movie.  The theme is a dark examination of desire, asking - is it inseparable from a lust for control?  Mathieu spends most of the movie trying to buy Conchita.  Initially, he tries to coax her with food like an animal.  When he learns she's a virgin, he tries to buy her off her own mother in a weirdly inverted dowry scene.  Once he feels he's got exclusive rights to her in his country house, he immediately tries to set her up in his late wife's room - as though she's a new acquisition to replace an old spot left empty.  And finally, in the Seville scenes where we see Conchita behind bars several times, he tries to set her up as his private stripper\/whore.  Conchita feints and rebuffs him at every turn, always stringing him along with a promise to love him on a condition he will never be able to meet.  Namely, to respect her freedom as a person.But she is the `object' in the title and the story is mostly retold by Mathieu himself, so it's almost impossible for Conchita to be a human even to the audience.  What anyone can make out by the end is that Conchita is not only coming out ahead in her scam game with Mathieu, but that she is locked into a pattern of sadistic control herself.  This quest leads, inevitably, to a kind of consummation where Mathieu beats the snot out of Conchita.  Buñuel films the blows carefully and the scene is uncomfortably long.  Is this the control that Mathieu bought?  As he relates the scene to the people in the train car (a wonderful device for the retelling of an amoral story) he grins ecstatically as he relates how richly she deserved his attack.  Then, just like every other time he's felt like he was getting somewhere with Conchita, she turns the tables on him and he finds himself pursuing her.  It seems pretty obvious that violence will continue to escalate and the stakes will be higher the next time Conchita winds Mathieu up.  But before we have to see this, Buñuel blows them up in a terrorist attack.  Terror and crime exist as background noise during the whole movie.  Sometimes seeming to reflect the Mathieu\/Conchita plot in news reports and it reinforces the theme of people getting what they desire through violence.  A terrorist bomb kills indiscriminately to achieve some desired end (and Buñuel peppers the film with references to ever more absurd terror groups that could have no rational interest in common).  A mugger by necessity takes what he wants from strangers.  The plot of the movie is almost a literal redistribution of Mathieu's abundant wealth to the squalid Paris suburbs that Conchita lives in and the young drifters she travels with through her elaborate scheme.  And the ultimate act of terror is Mathieu finally getting his hands on the protean woman he's been chasing and beating her into submission.

This story of a mother's attempt to cover up a manslaughter which implicates her child stays, apparently, evergreen.  The house by the water has been relocated to Lake Tahoe from the Pacific Coast, with the nearby urban sump being no longer Los Angeles but nearby  Reno &#150; Biggest Little City in The World. The means of death and disposal of the body are unaltered, and even the team of blackmailers &#150; one young, appealing and conflicted, the other older and ruthless &#150; hasn't changed (though it's a step or two down from James Mason to Goran Visnjic).What has changed is the nature of the liaison leading to all the trouble.  The earlier film has Joan Bennett trying to clean up the mess brought about when her high-maintenance Veda Pierce of a daughter gets involved with a mercenary gigolo some years her senior.  Here, Tilda Swinton discovers that her teenage son (Jonathan Tucker ) has been frequenting a gay club &#150; the eponymous The Deep End &#150; and seeing, well, a mercenary gigolo some years his senior (Josh Lucas), who, during a struggle, ends up dead.  The means of blackmail are more blatant as well.  In lieu of a beribboned packet of billets-doux, we, along with Swinton, watch a hard-core videotape of Tucker, prone, the passive receptacle of his partner's lust.The fact that the sex is gay and vicariously witnessed by the boy's mother accounts for the chief change in the story &#150; one, alas, that the film fails to engage.  Swinton reverts to a kind of catatonia, and the wall of silence between her and her son grows higher and thicker.  Whatever emotions she's feeling &#150; beyond an instinctive impulse to protect her son &#150; can only be inferred. In many ways that structure of denial is the theme of the movie, as it was of Ophuls', who, however, kept it behind a scrim (though a fairly translucent one).  In The Reckless Moment, the obligatory `restoration of normality' expected by the conventions of the noir cycle takes place, if only perfunctorily.  The businessman father ultimately returns from the East coast to preside over the hollow rituals of family life once more.  It's as though nothing had occurred &#150; nothing has changed &#150; because in his absence and absent his approval, life goes into suspension.In The Deep End, the patriarch is even more remote, on an aircraft carrier somewhere on the bounding main.  This nebulous figure can't even be reached by telephone when crisis comes.  And, as the screen finally fades to black, he finally calls.  It's left to us to speculate whether or not Swinton decides to pick up.

There's no deciding whether something is bad or good, it's in the eye of the beholder. This mass of people saying that this movie is the best zombie movie ever though, I mean c'mon people! First off, the Evil Dead Trilogy is scarier than this film, and I just saw those 3 movies for the first time last week. Those films were't even supposed to be scary, and had really small budgets, but were 10 times more fun.In response to everyone saying you get to see Milla Jovovich naked...(Sarcasm begins now) OH WOW! I got to see half of Milla's nipple! OH MY GOD! The promised land does exist! Oh please God, just let me see a full nipple one day, and I promise I'll never sin again! (End Sarcasm) Anyway, if I want to see Milla naked, I'm sure she's posed for Playboy or something, and you saw more in the Fifth Element anyway. Plus she was younger and looked a lot better in that film.I hate Michelle Rodriguez. She's not hot in my opinion and she's played pretty much the same role in every movie she's been in. At least most actors who get typecast try to break away. Granted, they usually suck at whatever they try different, but that's not the point. Jim Carrey is a perfect example.By the way, was Milla's character ever mentioned by name in the movie? Or do we all know she was named Alice from this site and the credits. My friends and I could all swear we never heard her name or the black guy who looks like Laurence Fishburne's name. What a sucky script, we can't even get names for the people....Anyways, I think this film sucked, if you think it was cool, then go rent a real zombie movie, or at least find something that's not a Matrix wannabe ( Jump kicking Dog scene, bullet time licker scene)...
