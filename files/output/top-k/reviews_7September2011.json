It is one of those rare moments in cinema where everything just doesn't seem to mater anymore and all you can actually care about is the visual treat that you are being subject to. The arresting visuals, the theme, the sinister plot, that arty look all round and the question the movie finally dares to ask you just make it so much more than any ordinary movie you would catch on an ordinary Friday evening. There is so much more to the movie than meets the eye and it is not for the squeamish for sure. Yes, scene after scene and scream after scream will disturb you more and more and if you really focus on the movie it will make you think more and more and more. There are many many questions asked about a lot of ethical concerns. What those concerns are you will find out as you watch the movie yourself. But you will not be let out without a feeling in your gut that wont leave you for a few days for sure.Malcolm McDowell has to carry the whole movie on his shoulders and her does it seamlessly. The weird clothes, the eye liner, that sick accent, the narrating and his antics combined provide a treat to never forget and which none can mimic. Being the sole character who is present throughout the film, he pushes himself to a really really high level of acting where Alex turns out to be a menace to everyone including himself. You can see a vivid range of emotions and character development painstakingly etched onto his face and in his eyes especially in the iconic Ludovico technique scene. The supporting cast all round him does a great job in showing the menace of his character and at times showing how menacing they can be as well.Much need not be said about Stanley Kubrick. Those who know has work know how good things can get when he gets stuff right. He always gets his stuff right as well. It still bothers me to know that such a great director did not win a directing Oscar. He truly deserved 3 Oscars for the top three honors of film, direction and screenplay. He doesn't hold back on anything and you can never see him pulling punches. He comes flat out and smacks you in your face and you will not a much better smack than this, believe me. For the beautifully created sets, the director, the sick screenplay, the magnificently menacing Alex and for the down right disturbing amount of brilliance shown I have to give it a 10\/10.

Plus MANY other fun floutings.I completed a 5+ year psychoanalysis (as did many of my colleagues in Topeka in that era--it helped our advancements as well as our psyches) and this film pokes gentle fun at analysis, analysts, and clichés of that therapeutic process. One of my colleagues who viewed it with us, a close friend and an analyst, rated it 8\/10 while I give it a 10\/10. All the non-shrink others viewing it averaged in the 7-8\/10 range. (FWIW, in IMDb's demographic ratings (q.v.), males consistently rate it slightly higher than females, regardless of age.)Woody, in a brief prequel, speaks to us (as the comedian, Alvy Singer, his film character, but really consistent with and little different than almost every neurotic character Woody's played). In this, he repeats Groucho Marx's famous retort on being offered membership in the very exclusive Friars' Club 'I refuse to belong to any club that would have a person like me as a member.'Similarly (in my therapy experience), people who've never experienced (or never experienced enough of) things vitally important to them--such as acceptance, loving and being loved in return--often continually seek it out but then, just when it's in reach or, somewhat soon after it's grasped, manage to push it away.

The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails.You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training.The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them.Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army.

And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails.You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training.The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them.Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten.

It's impossible to describe Sergio Leone's creation without evoking the crucial contribution of Ennio Morricone, probably one of the few cases where the work of the film-maker and the composer are equally significant. And not to diminish Leone's directorial merits, but what immediately pleases our senses the first minutes we're plunged into the film, is definitely the music. Morricone has an extraordinary ability to absorb each of your perceptions and tactfully plug them into the right emotions, and not without creative innovations on a technical level.Morricone's music enriches the wordless content of the film with so many whip sounds, gunshots, chorus, and of course the whistle, over and over again, indicating a threatening presence, or a Chinese-like violin sound the brutal manifestation of something stranger, even creepier. The music pulls the strings of a wide range of emotions from the harmonica's melancholic slowness to the flute's solemnity, from the trumpets' inspirational melody to the heart-pounding vibrancy of the suspenseful drums. And the subtle touch of genius resonates through the sound of the electric guitar, every once in a while, as to underline the inner modernity governing Leone's reinvention of the Western genre. As you may have noticed, A Fistful of Dollars is one of my all-time favorite scores.But the music is only one of the paintbrushes with which Leone's painted an incredibly iconoclast piece of art. The music literally influenced the direction because it was made before the film's release, so the scenes had to fit the length and the pacing of the melodies. That's why we can't reasonably dissociate the score with the direction. Actually, even the many aspects from the direction serve the purpose of the story, Leone's films are made with such a masterful artistry that there's no way to analyze every cinematic element separately. It's a harmonious and perfectly symbiotic creation that doesn't lie about its roots, A Fistful of Dollars is a Western and a damn good one, but that also loudly and proudly shouts This is no Ford or Hawks! This is the roaring Leone!Leone revolutionized the Western by emphasizing the vastness of the landscapes through extended views and through close-ups, the Goya-like ugliness of his characters, with creepy looks, bushy beards and the unforgettably sweaty and fearsome face of Gian Maria Volonte, magnetic in his antagonistic role. From his two trademarks, Leone underlines two important elements of the story  it takes place in a small town far from the civilized world and populated by men who carry on their face the nastiness inherited from a long absence of God and Law. The place is hopeless, with no chances of survival for the weak, the unarmed, women, children ... Leone aesthetically depicts the savagery of a world that has been too exaggeratedly celebrated through the conquest of the West,the good old pioneers, the Marshall or lone ranger protecting the innocent civilians &#x85; Leone's film visits the antipodes of the Western genre providing the perfect alibi for the glorious and almost operatic amount of bloody and spectacular violence displayed all through the film. And if it wasn't for the last element of the Holy trinity, there would have been absolutely no redeeming qualities. Leone, Morricone were relatively unknown names when the movie was made, but this was nothing compared to Clint Eastwood, who was anything but the first choice to play the role, a former TV star who acted in some B-Western movies But never would the cinematic Gods have deprived the audience from such a face, such a character. A supposedly good guy who, in a thought-provoking approach from the script, doesn't even help a brutalized man in the opening scene, the cynical and anti-heroic tone is set.In a way, his classic good looks makes him almost archetypal, but like many Leone's main character, he's only good because he's less bad than the other, and carries one or two principles in his pocket. The Man with No Name is stingy on words, but his eyes say everything, his body language is austere and restrained, all he needs to build an attitude is one look, a way to handle a cigar, to wear his hat or not. The Man embodies the menacing climate where any word, any action out of place would lead to a disaster. The whole plot is indeed a poker and chess game where the only heroism is inspired by a detached and opportunistic cynicism, it's about one man who'll take advantage of a situation where two rival families confront each other in an endless war, where the only prospect of richness come from the 'undertaking' department. The movie is not without its ounces of black comedy where the undertaker with his hyena-like giggle reminds of the futility of death as to better repress its gravity.The story of A Fistful of Dollars is adapted from Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo , probably superior for the purists, but as much as I love and respect Kurosawa, I prefer his Sanjuro as a more fitting Samurai story while I'm sure Yojinbo was begging to be adapted in a Western, and I'm most thankful for Master Kurosawa for having contributed to the resurrection of a genre his movies unconsciously belonged to. And -again- the music was also an extraordinary homage to these epic Japanese films where the actions, the looks, the environment spoke more eloquently than words.

The story is essentially a remake of the original with the action transplanted to the city of San Francisco. Our heroes go through a number of mildly diverting adventures before making their way home. There's a pair of dastardly dog catchers &#x96; has, I wonder, any film been made in the history of cinema that featured a non-dastardly dog-catcher? I don't know, perhaps in a country where rabies is rife. The dog-catchers give the kids someone to hiss at, but there's nothing particularly threatening about them. Each of the animals involved has a voice, although this being the olden days of the mid-1990s, the cheap technology required to give the illusion that their mouths are actually moving obviously didn't exist, so we have to assume all animals are telepathic, I suppose. The voices, other than Ralph Waite as the older dog, don't really suit. Had I been in charge of the voices I'd have given each the voice of a famous old movie star. It would have kept me entertained.

Not the greatest decision I have ever made but far from the worst. Also my beautiful wife had seen this back in 1993 and lied to me saying it was good. I had several problems with the film as I will detail below.The plot consists of Jeff (Sutherland) looking for his missing girlfriend Diane (Bullock) who vanished on a vacation trip three years prior. Barney (Bridges) plays the creepy villain in this tale with Rita (Travis) as Jeff's new girlfriend rounding out the cast. We are introduced to a dedicated and obsessive Jeff who has not stopped searching for his missing girlfriend for 3 years. His obsession\/dedication to Diane is hurting his relationship with his current live in girlfriend Rita. Rita's attempts to make Jeff give up his search spurs Barney back into action. There were some slightly suspenseful moments in this film and it had some moments of mild tension. Sutherland played a mildly entertaining obsessive compulsive and Travis's portrayal of a tough as nails diner waitress was something straight out of a Mel's Diner episode. Strangely the actor I had the most problems with was Bridges and his depiction of the weirdo Barney. I thought the mannerisms and accent that he used were hackneyed at best. I was expecting a lot more from the Dude. Also thought that the plot was pretty lame and overdone in some sections. Overall, this film was just barely watchable. I have heard it was a remake of the film Spoorloss (1988) that was very well received. This film has the same director so I am not sure how they managed to screw the pooch on this remake. Unless, I lay all the blame on the addition of screen writer Todd Graff who was not involved with the first project and was just added in to ruin the movie and make it more Hollywood. There are a few points in the film that caused me to laugh out loud but I don't think they were shooting to make a comedy. If you never watched this film I don't think your life would be any less complete.

I like even more that it got up the nose of draft-dodger American hero John Wayne, even if the film which he starred in under fellow-sympathiser Howard Hawks' direction Rio Brava is actually just as good a movie. But turning away from the allegorical politics, High Noon still stands as a classic film, examining traits of self-respect, heroism and on the converse side cowardice, along the way delivering a gripping, suspenseful 85 minutes of high tension and excitement. Shot in realistic black and white, the camera seems to show every line on the ageing Gary Cooper's face, the lines drawn deeper by fear itself. Even in his physical movements, Cooper's Marshal seems hesitant and wary, running on adrenalin and counter to the sometimes well-meaning but often self-serving advice that he should leave own before the revenge-seeking gang come after him when they've rendezvoused with leader arriving on the high noon train. Every man in town finds an excuse to opt out of helping Coop in his hour of need so that it's only fit and proper, after he completes his task, with the unexpected help of young wife Grace Kelly, that he wordlessly tosses away his badge and leaves town. Certainly by then, he knew who his so-called friends were. Cooper is superb in the lead role and dominates to the extent of carrying the whole film in his wake. The direction is taut and sure, a clock never far away to keep the tense countdown to the forefront of the action. My only criticisms are that Grace Kelly does seem much too young to be Cooper's wife, the relative ease with which he disposes of the supposedly unstoppable desperadoes and that pesky omnipresent theme song which just never goes away and ends up being, to these ears at least, extremely tiresome. Otherwise a brave and outstanding movie on just about every level.

Those clothes, incidentally, should definitely not fit the much massive man, but that's merely one of a goodly figure of plot cavities that I only ever note after it's over Like several ambitious thriller directors before him, Cameron reveals an exceptional skill at sustaining the action so summarily that this or that inconsistent detail doesn't matter. The second nude, Michael Biehn, doesn't have the same massive figure or imperviousness, but he has the vigilance and taut physique of an animal, stealing clothes too, managing to pinch a gun.By this stage we're beginning to note that this smaller man may not entirely be so formidable like the other, as he's conspicuously not killed anyone yet, but we still don't understand how any of it relates to the opening title card describing a war between humans and machines, or why both men have such a concern with the three Sarah Conners in the metro area phone book. It swiftly becomes clear to us which of the three is the one who counts, as we meet her in the form of Linda Hamilton. We see how tedious her life is, with her co-worker observing, in what we don't yet recognize is irony, that in 100 years, nobody will care. Then Sarah finds on the news that someone with precisely her name has been viciously murdered. Thinking little about it, she arranges for a night out with her roommate Ginger while the LAPD, led by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen, have to manage the second execution-style killing of a Sarah Connor in one day.We still don't know what's happening, theoretically at least We saw the giant man murder the initial Sarah, we're not familiar with the second, and neither man has yet verified himself as trustworthy the slightest bit. So when the smaller man manages to begin stalking our Sarah, we've every cause to presume that he's trouble, and so does she, having by now gathered the murders lead straight to her. She dodges into an ascetically '80s club to call the police and disappear. Two presumably deadly, anonymous, wordless men hunt the same woman in the packed nightspot. At least one now has a substantial arsenal. Eventually, half hour in, one says his very first line of dialogue Come with me if you want to live. With hero and villain now conclusively determined, the movie's remainder is utterly a chase, Schwarzenegger pursuing the two humans through LA, slaughter and nothing else on his agenda. I remain unendingly stunned by how superbly Cameron sustains the tension Unquestionably in that first half hour, there's not one second that's missing heart and soul, when even the essential exposition of Sarah's life is managed with utmost effectiveness. Even in the enormous info-dumps that Biehn is burdened with, we have no sense of the film slumping under the load of it all. When he bothers to tell Sarah, and us, the plot in essence, it comes directly after a climactic point, when we're viscerally prepared for the film to let us decompress.There's the cost-conscious way that Cameron shares information about Biehn and Schwarzenegger, ensuring that we'll be engrossed in deciphering who they are. The sharp-witted strokes characterizing Sarah, making her so authentic that we viscerally crave her survival until he can bother to show us just why we should be particularly concerned. Sarah as a convincing, appealing person is much due to Hamilton playing a young woman of no seeming significance pushed into a nightmare and never permitted to find her balance. This is usually the part that feels like just a bookmark, but Hamilton emphasizes her uncommonly distinctive sense of a woman in an '80s killer-stalking-girl flick.Biehn, never my favorite actor, nevertheless seems a sinewy, astute beast as much as a human. It evokes the frantic anguish of his future life, and makes us pity this tattered endurer. Meanwhile, the epically iconic rogue of the film It takes authority, and in Schwarzenegger's case, a grand succession of close-mouthed expressions, tweaks of the head. He may be a machine, but he's a convincing one. It's a categorically star-making performance.Cinematographer Adam Greenberg encapsulates a grimy, murky world, scattered by overpowering fluorescents. Stan Winston's Terminator endoskeleton is the stuff of legend, even if some of the animatronics in certain shots are charmingly old-fashioned. Of all the collaborators, still, it's composer Brad Fiedel that merits the most affection His throbbing, techno-flavored theme leads one of the finest film scores throughout all the 1980s, and it's maybe the best instrument Cameron has to use in maintaining the film's propulsion. It's exciting, dissonant and harsh, that unremitting bass line keeping the movie seeming like it'll never brake, not unless the menace is quelled. Cameron's assurance in his material brings his debut far beyond the standard of all the other films where the screenplay is merely a cause for explosions and car chases It's a plot with import and desperate interests.

Dollar$ to Donut$ the script was written (and re-written, and re-written) some time in the 1990's....don't ask me why I think that. I could watch Eliza Dushku impersonate Richard Nixon, and DJ Qualls should probably spend some time in a gym (so the ladies could have some eye-candy). The Cheer Leader squad was amazing to look at. I liked the idea of the transformation via jail cell, and the homage to Dr. H. Lecter was amusing too.

It ain't for nothing that Fleischer is still so highly regarded. So let us try, for our readers' sake, to give a balanced account of the accomplishments and faults of this flick. This schmaltzy cartoon made by the Fleischer team (well, produced by one and directed by the other) 72 yrs ago is very loosely based on Lemuel Gulliver's storyline; we're plunged directly into schmaltz and dire triteness&#x97;a dwarf from Snow&#x97;White and a marriage&#x97;the hallmark of nicety and prettiness, plus a lot of harmless romance, the epitome of blandness, a Gulliver operetta&#x97;which is fine, if that's what you wish to settle for. Otherwise, yeah, the kitsch is thick enough to be enjoyable&#x97;to be more than palatable. The craftsmanship is impressive. This might be&#x97;what&#x97;the 4th cartoon I'm reviewing for IMDb (a Japanese one&#x97;a parable&#x97;a Hänsel &#x85;--you see, not all of it was garbage, not all of it &#x85;--that parable looked a tiny bit under&#x97;populated and even under&#x97;drawn &#x85;); what can I say, Fleischer as a cartoonist is kitsch enough, is schmaltz enough&#x97;even the gist of schmaltz. Basically, the same bland, tame buffoonery, because here the team has to supply for everything and, though done with undeniable, commendable craftsmanship, 'Gulliver' amounts to a roller-coaster of gags and niceties&#x97;which is way less than the required. The nuisance is, even apart from the couple of singing lovers, Gulliver himself, cast here as a simpleton and a soft-head. Lemuel Gulliver cast as the blandest, amidst the colorful dwarfs. So, yeah, a bit of a 'Snow&#x97;White' rip&#x97;off, instead of the cunning midgets of the original. Despite the prettiness and the dreadfully unlikable arias bellowed by the characters, Fleischer's Gulliver looks like an ancestor of the Spielberg\/ Lucas flicks&#x97;it's all an American fashion&#x97;a clownish roller-coaster, as already described by the underwritten reviewer. Anyway, I took a little, unexceptionable pleasure in charming and lulling you with my prose &#x85;. (2) But then again, 'Gulliver' as retold by the Fleischers is an eminently likable yarn. So, it is simultaneously lurid, enjoyable, and bland, tame, schmaltzy, derisory, petty. Bland schmaltz. But then again&#x97;concomitantly lurid and tame, quite disconcerting; it will be enjoyed presumably more by the kiddies, which is only well, given that the adults' craze for cartoons is rather uncanny. Almost no relations whatsoever to the womanizing (or, possibly just repressed) Irish clergyman's original writings&#x97;yeah, but what a fairy tale!

Oh don't get me wrong, Down Under's pretty good. But, to me, The Rescuers is the best.Since I was a little kid, I have had a short attention span so movies with more action generally held my attention. The Rescuers and the Pooh films were the two exceptions for me. This isn't a very fast moving film, at times it's quite slow. But that's when the tension builds. You feel a certain warmth watching it, similar to the warm fuzzies you would get from a Pooh film. It's sweet. It's fun. The characters are lovable and the villains are detestable (I mean Madame Medusa kidnaps an innocent little girl and then forces her to go into a dangerous pirate cave, if that isn't evil, I don't know what is). Even the supporting cast is awesome, if not entirely memorable. I think there were too many critters at Devil's Bayou, had they cut the cast down a bit, perhaps I could remember them all. But that's literally my only complaint.The film is slow but it doesn't feel slow. It doesn't lag at all. It keeps you completely focused on the characters. By the way, the acting is superb, particularly Michelle Stacy as Penny. Usually child actors are hit and miss but she does an excellent job, she really makes you feel for Penny and that's the most important part. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor as Bernard and Bianca. They really bring the characters to life.The animation is beautiful as well. It all seems like a painting come to life. I am particularly impressed with Bernard and Bianca's animation because they look a lot like their voice actors. So you can't imagine a better voice for them. You often forget that they're mice. And that's really impressive.So, all in all, this is one of Disney's best. Ever. It's proof that the animation studio was still going strong after Walt Disney's death. And it's still one of my all time favorite movies. I say, check it out. There's something for everyone in it.
