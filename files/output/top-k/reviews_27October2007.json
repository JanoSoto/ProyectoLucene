First and foremost, one of Spielberg's worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing. The two children aren't precocious and charming, they're little brats, no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise. The character of John Hammond, in the book, was as I recall a rather devious, unscrupulous man; here, he is portrayed as a cheerful, slightly ditsy, misguided Santa Claus. And Laura Dern manages to almost single-handedly sink this movie. Her perpetual I don't know whether to laugh or cry expression is probably the single most irritating element in a film full of them. And everyone smiles WAY too much.Spielberg, for all his supposed genius, also delivers some of the most excruciating action and danger scenes on record. Whenever one of the human characters is in a spot, it is inevitably his or her own stupid fault. They can't lock the door, they won't turn the flashlight off, they're too scared to jump off the fence, they can't run fast enough... every damn scene is like this, to where you want to reach into the screen and slap the hell out of them.Sam Neill comes off best, in what is really a thankless role as the straight man for all this nonsense. But he's dragged down by the same sappy script.Well, what about those special effects, you might ask? Yes, the dinosaurs are spectacular and very believable (much more so than the humans really) and they are the only reason I'm giving this four stars out of ten. In 1993, we were still being blown away by filmmakers constantly upping the ante when it came to mind-blowing effects and sure enough, Jurassic Park was state-of-the-art when it came out. Since then, I daresay people have become more blase about such things as they have become more routine.To be fair, there are some wonderful sequences in Jurassic Park and it's certainly worth seeing at least once. I suppose ultimately that is the most maddening thing about it; it could have been so much better, not just another summer blockbuster, but a truly great motion picture.

As the morally redundant TV exec Frank Cross, Murray gets far and away the most screen time and his straight faced, dry humour is just perfect for this type of character.The film is a modern update of 'A Christmas Carol' for anyone who doesn't already know with the aforementioned Murray character Frank Cross replacing the role of Ebeneezer Scrooge. After being initially visited by his now deceased ex-boss(represented rather shockingly as an old decaying, mouse infested corpse still wearing the golf uniform he suffered his life ending heart attack in on the fairway) and on whom he had based his own career (though Frank has gone on to become even more selfish and concerned with the bottom line than even he was) Cross simply dismisses the episode as the result of high level executive pressure. In particular Frank is stressing out about his network's live Christmas eve broadcast which is surprise, surprise a big budget live version of 'A Christmas Carol'. However he is in turn visited by 3 very different versions of the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to the one's represented in the Dicken's tale , with the possible exception of the final ghost who is much more traditional in representation than the others. The role of Tiny Tim and Bob Cratchet are represented by Cross's long suffering secretary and her young son who is a mute as a result of the trauma of seeing his father murdered several years before. There is a couple of interesting side stories involving Murray rekindling the only real relationship he has ever had with his first love Clare who he decides to recontact amongst all of the madness as well as a confident young new executive who has been brought on board and tries to act as Frank's friend but is clearly planning to usurp him. This attempt is aided by everyone's perception that Frank appears to be suffering some kind of breakdown as he tries to deal with the bizarre impingement on his life by the aforementioned ghosts. Possibly the most entertaining of the story lines not relating directly to the main one involves a naive young board member played by the usually larger than life, but here toned down, Bobcat Goldthwaite who has been fired as a result of innocently questioning a violent promo for the live show which Cross has commissioned. As Frank is dealing with his ghost's Bobcat's character descends into a rather pathetic depression and desperate alcoholism , in the space of a few days, as he tries to come to terms with his unemployment.I really enjoyed John Glover as the slimy Californian exec who is obviously after Cross's job. It kind of underlines the point that though Cross is nasty at least what you see is what you get. Glover's character is completely 2-faced. The character obviously made an impact on the makers of Gremlins 2 because they cast Glover in an almost identical role in that movie a mere two years later.Karen Allen as Carol is convincingly sweet and warm as possibly the only person who can truly help redeem Frank but both her and Robert Mitchum as Frank's boss are somewhat underused and in the case of a legendary talent like Mitchum's you almost wonder why he is in it.Anyway in summation if you like Murray you'll love this. If you don't your enjoyment may suffer but there are still laughs to be had at the send ups of Christmas Network programming ie-. 'Bob Goulet's Cajun Christmas' , 'The Night the Reindeer Died' with Lee Majors and 'Dad Loves Chasing Beaver.' The soundtrack, special effects and make-up are also first rate. However be warned, it is very dark and at times a little sad, particularly in one scene in which Frank re-encounters one of the homeless people he had met earlier at Claire's shelter in a disused boiler room on a typically freezing New York winters night.

Then we can appreciate that this is a beautifully crafted film!

The astonishing way the Monster is first shown-- Frankenstein lowers the lights, the door opens, and the Monster BACKS into the room (heightening the suspense) and then he slowly turns around, and then we see him in three increasingly closer shots! Wow! You'll never see this subtlety in any other Frankenstein film! The prologue by Edward Van Sloan, and the unseen face of the Monster when he comes to life really sets you up for the screams that must have ensued when the cavernous face of Karloff was first shown! From then on, it must have been pure blasphemous shock for audiences of the time! But what about us? This movie passed my Test of Time test -- I watched it with my 8 and 10 year old grandchildren! They were hypnotized throughout the whole movie (not getting bored to play with their toys) with the 10 year old having a nightmare and waking up at 430 a.m. this morning (I can't sleep!). (Of course, I've raised them on 'Betty Boop,' and 'Popeye' so they were no strangers to black and white films.)To continue with the pluses first, Boris Karloff's impressive, compassionate and intelligent performance. The close up of his hands in which he skillfully expressed emotion-- yearning for friendship and connections with others. Of course, it was not unusual in the days of silent films for pathos, feeling and emotion to be expressed with the body; one thinks of, for example, of how Conrad Veidt's hands get scarier and scarier in 'Orlac's Hands' (1925), or of the amazing Lillian Gish, and the use of her eyes to express fear in 'Broken Blossoms' (1919). We still have this great use of silent technique in 1931. Second, the photography. The black outs that allow a brief 'whew' between contrasting macabre scenes with normal movie scenes; the innovative camera angles to show off the off-kilter 'Caligari' sets; the cutaways during lateral shots; the great high and low angle shots in all of the watchtower scenes. Third, the use of James Whale's 'stable' of British actors previously used by him, who did so well in the film. Colin Clive, the precursor of Peter Cushing as the quintessential British scientist, has been immortalized for his manic, hysterical yet justified (as an experimental scientist) cry of It's Alive!

","genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"27 October 2007","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Only fifteen or so years after the classic film noir cycle had run its course, and not really that long since film theorists began to universally recognise it as a genre, the film noir was back as a subject for stylish nostalgic homage. But Chinatown is no lazy bundle of clichés &#150; it draws together everything that was great about film noir, and was put in the hands of one of the most talented directors and some of the greatest actors of the day.Story-wise this is very much the archetypal film noir, reminiscent of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, Vertigo, Touch of Evil and many others, and with a plot equally as complex and skilfully woven as those classics. You have the political corruption, the cynical private eye hero and the femme fatale, not to mention the atmosphere of absolute despair, regret and the terrifying power of evil people. But Chinatown has much more than that &#150; it was made in an era when cinema was shorn of many of its conventions and the burdens of censorship and is therefore more daring and more grown up. The characters are at once stylised references to film noir figures and at the same fully rounded and believable individuals. The dialogue is both memorable and realistic. Robert Towne's screenplay also had some invaluable modifications from director Roman Polanski, most notably a change to the ending, although I won't spoil that here.Two things really stand out about Polanski's direction of Chinatown. First is his use of colour. The bulk of the film is composed in drab browns and greys, which evoke the era, as well as the theme of drought. Polanski had a great talent for being incredibly restrained when it came to colour, and really it's not so much about putting the right colours in, it's about keeping the wrong colours &#150; the bold ones &#150; out. He doesn't let so much as a brightly coloured button sneak into the shot, the exception to this being when he wants to draw attention to something or create a shift in mood. For example the blaring neon lights of the final sequence are a counterpoint to the rest of the film, and really help to ratchet up the power of the finale.The second thing that stands out is Polanski's use of space. Just like Alfred Hitchcock could create suspense out of nothing, Polanski creates a sense of confinement out of nothing. A lot of Chinatown takes place outdoors and in wide open spaces, but by this point Polanski's skill and confidence was such that he didn't need cramped apartments or castles to create claustrophobic spaces. Here he creates the same feeling with shots through car windscreens, Venetian blinds or even just a few carefully chosen items in the foreground. Chinatown is bizarrely shot in scope ratio, but whereas normally the ratio is used to open out the shot widthways, in Polanski's hands it is almost as if it is compressing the image height-wise.Also crucial to the mix is the spot-on casting. These were great roles for Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. This is perhaps Nicholson's career best &#150; a deep, restrained performance in contrast to his comfort zone of playing energetic lunatics. The real masterstroke though was casting John Huston as Noah Cross. Obviously he was a major figure in classic film noir, but he also really gets his teeth into this role. It's also a nice touch to have someone who can make Jack Nicholson look small.Chinatown comes from the beginning of the age in which cinema became more and more retrospective and nostalgic, but nostalgia rarely comes better than this.

But Chinatown is no lazy bundle of clichés &#150; it draws together everything that was great about film noir, and was put in the hands of one of the most talented directors and some of the greatest actors of the day.Story-wise this is very much the archetypal film noir, reminiscent of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, Vertigo, Touch of Evil and many others, and with a plot equally as complex and skilfully woven as those classics. You have the political corruption, the cynical private eye hero and the femme fatale, not to mention the atmosphere of absolute despair, regret and the terrifying power of evil people. But Chinatown has much more than that &#150; it was made in an era when cinema was shorn of many of its conventions and the burdens of censorship and is therefore more daring and more grown up. The characters are at once stylised references to film noir figures and at the same fully rounded and believable individuals. The dialogue is both memorable and realistic. Robert Towne's screenplay also had some invaluable modifications from director Roman Polanski, most notably a change to the ending, although I won't spoil that here.Two things really stand out about Polanski's direction of Chinatown. First is his use of colour. The bulk of the film is composed in drab browns and greys, which evoke the era, as well as the theme of drought. Polanski had a great talent for being incredibly restrained when it came to colour, and really it's not so much about putting the right colours in, it's about keeping the wrong colours &#150; the bold ones &#150; out. He doesn't let so much as a brightly coloured button sneak into the shot, the exception to this being when he wants to draw attention to something or create a shift in mood. For example the blaring neon lights of the final sequence are a counterpoint to the rest of the film, and really help to ratchet up the power of the finale.The second thing that stands out is Polanski's use of space. Just like Alfred Hitchcock could create suspense out of nothing, Polanski creates a sense of confinement out of nothing. A lot of Chinatown takes place outdoors and in wide open spaces, but by this point Polanski's skill and confidence was such that he didn't need cramped apartments or castles to create claustrophobic spaces. Here he creates the same feeling with shots through car windscreens, Venetian blinds or even just a few carefully chosen items in the foreground. Chinatown is bizarrely shot in scope ratio, but whereas normally the ratio is used to open out the shot widthways, in Polanski's hands it is almost as if it is compressing the image height-wise.Also crucial to the mix is the spot-on casting. These were great roles for Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. This is perhaps Nicholson's career best &#150; a deep, restrained performance in contrast to his comfort zone of playing energetic lunatics. The real masterstroke though was casting John Huston as Noah Cross. Obviously he was a major figure in classic film noir, but he also really gets his teeth into this role.

High Fidelity transcends this rarity. Within mere seconds, my eyes were glued and my jaw was dropped by how incredibly in love with it I became. Everything from the wild performances to the wonderful moral to the flawless soundtrack was absolutely perfect. It's a film about maturing and realizing that nothing is the way you want it to be, so you need to learn how to settle. It also happens to be one of the most enjoyable films of all time.This modern tale of growing up takes place under the story of a breakup and one man's desperate need to discover why his partners always go right from him to someone else. Over the first thirty or so minutes, Rob Gordon (John Cusack) goes through his all-time, top-five most memorable breakups and we see that each one of them ended because the girl chose someone else over him (except for the one that he broke up with due to her lack of sexual promiscuity; immediately after their split she slept with a guy). The film begins with the newest breakup, Laura (Iben Hjejle) who we soon find out is now bedding Ian (Tim Robbins), more commonly referred to as Ray. This sends him into a reassessment of his own life and he decides to find these other four women and figure out why they chose someone else over him.In doing this, he discovers that these women weren't what he remembered them to be. They are extremely flawed individuals whom he wouldn't want to take back, even if they wanted him back. This sparks his realization that all of his fantasies of what his dream life should be and how perfect everything is in his mind is never really the truth. He slowly accepts that in the real world he has to settle constantly and nothing can be completely perfect. No matter what, every element of life has it's flaws and every relationship has bumps to get past. He had been putting all of these ex-girlfriends up on a pedestal and it took this revelation in order to bring them down. Due to this realization, he was finally able to move on with his life and actually mature instead of remaining in the constant void of unrequited fantasies he had trapped himself in.I'm not one for spoiling endings, but I have to say that High Fidelity features one of the most satisfying finales as far as I'm concerned. Rob's newfound maturity and ability to move on with his life, along with a wonderful decision from a certain someone, does nothing but bring an enormous smile to my face. A lot of this enjoyment comes from the satisfaction achieved by one of the most relatable characters in film history. Rob is easily a character that very closely resembles my own self in so many ways. It goes beyond his excellent taste in music and the fact that he builds up fantasies that are far more perfect than any thing could realistically become to the smallest elements of his life like his trivial tendency to make 'Top 5' lists on the most insignificant things. I can find so much in myself that is similar to Rob, so watching him succeed in life almost gives me a sense that I can eventually succeed as well.Something I've always said when it comes to film is that my favorite elements belong to the story and the characters. High Fidelity excels in both of these categories by an immense proportion. The story is inspirational and highly engaging with deep characters who entrance you and keep you glued to the screen. Rob's riffs to the audience are brilliant and range from being absolutely heart-shattering to side-splitting hilarity. Speaking of hilarity, comic relief has never tasted as sweet as the combination of Dick and Barry, the two employees at the record store Rob owns played impeccably by Todd Louiso and Jack Black respectively. The three of them bounce off one another seamlessly and give a pure sense of authenticity and keep the laughs coming in this wonderful tale. All of the performances are just as strong as the rest of the film, but the highlight is clearly from the anchor John Cusack. He's also been an actor I felt I could relate to and in becoming this character that relatability only increases massively. He hits such a range of emotion and becomes this character so flawlessly that it seems as if Stephen Frears just put a camera on him and told him to say whatever he wants.

Overcome with curiosity, he pursues Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber at his quirky best), inadvertently into the year 2001. Stuart's sudden disappearance from his apartment brings his downstairs neighbor, Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), into Leopold's life and helps him adjust to this jolt into the future.Hugh Jackman is brilliant and commanding. Meg Ryan, at 39, who has just wasted the best years of her life to Stuart, her ex-boyfriend, has given up on love. Her acting brother, Charlie (Breckin Myer) arrives to visit and adds another dash of comedic flavor to the mix.Without giving away any part of the story, I will leave you with some of the most poignant moments that I found very appealing.There is an huge container of pens in front of Leopold, but he has no idea what they are. He finds a feather among a container of craft items, makes some ink in a glass, and sits down to compose a letter. He lightly blows air on the completely letter, slowly blinks his eyes and re-reads the letter.Although I am dismayed at Meg Ryan's choice to alter her lips and cheeks cosmetically, I applaud her decision to forgo an abundance of makeup. As Kate, she looks tired and overworked, true to the character of a marketing executive who works long hours and has no personal life. Kate's reaction to a line in French, when it's full meaning was interpreted to her, and the expression on her face at a surprise meal, was adorable. And that's the reason audiences respond to Meg Ryan so well. She has an inner beauty and glow that needs no cosmetic enhancements.Liev Schreiber exhaustingly tries to explain his theory of the space\/time continuum to a young lady. His facial expressions and gestures as Stuart are absolutely hysterical but the young lady finally gets what he's saying. Just thinking about this witty big of dialog makes me smile. I can see a little bit of Charlie Chaplin incorporated into Schreiber's physical portrayal so I wonder if Schreiber was an admiring fan of Chaplin's? A sweet homage.Guys if you're looking for science fiction, go to the search box at IMDb.com and look for something else.

Her acting brother, Charlie (Breckin Myer) arrives to visit and adds another dash of comedic flavor to the mix.Without giving away any part of the story, I will leave you with some of the most poignant moments that I found very appealing.There is an huge container of pens in front of Leopold, but he has no idea what they are. He finds a feather among a container of craft items, makes some ink in a glass, and sits down to compose a letter. He lightly blows air on the completely letter, slowly blinks his eyes and re-reads the letter.Although I am dismayed at Meg Ryan's choice to alter her lips and cheeks cosmetically, I applaud her decision to forgo an abundance of makeup. As Kate, she looks tired and overworked, true to the character of a marketing executive who works long hours and has no personal life. Kate's reaction to a line in French, when it's full meaning was interpreted to her, and the expression on her face at a surprise meal, was adorable. And that's the reason audiences respond to Meg Ryan so well. She has an inner beauty and glow that needs no cosmetic enhancements.Liev Schreiber exhaustingly tries to explain his theory of the space\/time continuum to a young lady. His facial expressions and gestures as Stuart are absolutely hysterical but the young lady finally gets what he's saying. Just thinking about this witty big of dialog makes me smile. I can see a little bit of Charlie Chaplin incorporated into Schreiber's physical portrayal so I wonder if Schreiber was an admiring fan of Chaplin's? A sweet homage.Guys if you're looking for science fiction, go to the search box at IMDb.com and look for something else. If you want to curl up with your girl, put the popcorn in the microwave and put the DVD or videotape of Kate & Leopold in the machine! Enjoy.

Very good questions, and Spielberg ham-handedly beats a response out of us in each film. He employs two story-telling techniques, both to the utmost extreme visceral sensationalism and morbid sentimentality.To turn the focus on the movie being reviewed - Schindler's List uses a horror film approach to movie-making to keep us properly frightened and cowering in the corner. At some point it stops being about somber remembrance and turns into a gruesome series of predictions he'll be shot - he's too overly sympathetic; he'll make it - he had too much screen time to be executed; she'll die - the violin telegraphs it... and so on.Spielberg's greatest sin is that he underestimates his audience. We don't need to be bludgeoned into three minutes of silence. The atrocity was great, and sixty years later the wounds are still painful. All we need is to be simply ushered into a fresh realization of the holocaust - and Schindler's story is a particularly poignant way to accomplish this.At some point during the movie Schindler speaks of true power - the ability to pardon. Yet Spielberg drags this movie past the three hour mark, emotionally executing each and every viewer. My edit of this movie would have excised the sloppy and insincere sentimentality, and spared (pardoned) the audience so many streams of blood that the scenes lost any impact the victims' deaths might have contained. (not to mention, my edit wouldn't try so hard to convince that all women in WWII slept topless!)I also fault the movie for setting Schindler up as Jesus Christ (we're bought with a price!). I'm still trying to decide if Spielberg wants to insult or convert the Jews he is sympathizing with. After Schindler dropped his cross... er, ring in the sand I half expected him to be crucified for war crimes.I give the film credit for a tremendously impacting ending. We see, and can truly honor for enduring hell, the Jews whom Schindler saved.

There aren't lot actors on this world who would accept this role in 1980. and I dare to say that maybe Pacino is the only one. He showed his class once again because his character transforms through the movie, just like his acting.The plot is about young police officer Steve Burns who is sent undercover to discover a serial killer who is brutally killing gay men in New York. After job well done he would become detective, at least he was promised that from Capt. Edelson. As he goes undercover he must stay apart from his girlfriend Nancy (she doesn't know what is he doing). She understands that Steve is starting to change and that the job he does affects him.Friedkin's directing of this movie is in some scenes very disturbing (mostly scenes in gay bars). I don't have nothing against gay people but some really sick scenes where shown in this movie. The whole movie is painted in dark colors and this thriller is very well made on area of suspense. It is very interesting and controversial. Remember the year this was made is 1980. and even today we cannot watch it without any comments. That is why this movie will be remembered as movie for all time. The year you watch it isn't really important.

David Cronenberg, who is most notably known for accumulating horror, directed this masterful reworking of the Vincent Price classic. I scientist (Jeff Goldblum) creates a teleporter but accidentally gets his molecules rearranged when he AND a fly get teleported together. What took this film beyond the cheesy and funny film of the 50's was the visual of Goldblum's skin decaying and falling off., the transformation of the fly, the chemistry between the fly and Geena Davis's character and the internal conflict in each one of them. It was truly a love story gone horribly, horribly wrong. I would first like to make note of the excellent performances by Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis and John Getz. They made this story come alive; they gave The Fly and the characters life and never let up.To see the transformation of Professor Brundle made the horror come true in this movie. There are 6 transformations and each has its own thematic element of your body failing you. You are no longer in control of your body and it just displays all the horrors of bodily hygiene. The make up effects of each stage was, simply put, a gander. Cronenberg imagined each stage beautifully, for example when state 2 hits, you know that it's going to get worse but you don't know how worse and by stage 6, it becomes mind-blowing. Rather than keeping your human body and having a fly head in the old version, this version actually seems like a mutation of man and insect. I think the best example of hygiene gone wrong would be the Prof. Brundle documenting and saving each piece of his body that falls off.One of the greater aspects of this movie would be the romanticism of this movie. This element alone made the movie hard to watch for a number of reasons. Veronica (Davis) had a love affair with Brundle but when it seems like she is falling for another guy Brundle kind of goes crazy. She loves Brundle but not what he has become and at the end when he completely transforms into a fly-thing with a huge piece of machinery fused to his back, Brundles looses all humanity and Veronica knows that deep down, he is human. That relationship was so hard to watch unravel and it made me cry. It builds per stage and to watch Veronica caught between two men is heart wrenching.As for the gore effect in this movie, there wasn't that much blood and guts, in fact, there was no guts just puke and blood. This movie doesn't need that much blood because it would steer away from the elements, listed above, that made this movie terrific. Granted, when you see Brundlefly eat, it's pretty disgusting, when Davis gives birth to a maggot, that's pretty bloody, but there are no guts. I like that in this kind of movie, there doesn't need to be gore to make this movie scary, all you need is creature effects, some blood and a tear jerking understory.Overall, I probably milked the excellence out of this movie and gave away more than enough spoilers but I was just astounded by the impact that this movie had. It was Terms of Endernment meets a Troma film. It's probably one of the best horror movies made and one of the better Cronenberg film next to Scanners and Shivers. There were scares, cries, humor, blood, not guts and just a great underpaying story of true compassion in the most extreme situations. If you have not seen this movie, I strongly recommend you put this on your Netflix. All in all, it was a masterpiece.

With that said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone else, because the good in this movie far outweighs anything objectionable. If you love kids and enjoy seeing people learning good values and responsibility, you'll probably enjoy this movie.

My older sister had told me it was pretty good, and being a fan of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, I thought I'd enjoy seeing the boys when they were little.

After The Swarm was met with worldwide ridicule and disastrous box-office, a lesser man might have cut his losses, but being a man who doesn't have the words 'no' or 'quality control' in his vocabulary, Caine went ahead and made Beyond the Poseidon Adventure anyway. Still, it could have been worse. He could have stuck around for Allen's career-killing volcano flick When Time Ran Out as well.Lured away from his old stamping ground 20th Century Fox to Warner Bros with the promise of less studio interference (read quality control), bigger budgets and the chance to direct his films as well, even Spielberg would envy the kind of absolute unquestioned power 'master of disaster' Allen enjoyed on the lot in the late Seventies, but the blank check resulted in three massive and much-ridiculed flops in a row. This was number two. Allen's belated and quickly forgotten sequel to his 1972 blockbuster has a bigger budget than its predecessor and an even sillier plot, yet as a guilty pleasure it's a surprisingly enjoyable brain-off time-filler. Discarding the plot of Gallico's novel, itself written as a direct sequel to the film rather than his original novel, the film sees Michael Caine's tough tugboat captain (yes, it's a stretch) and his crew of two, Karl Malden and Sally Field, seeing a way out of impending bankruptcy by staking claim to the salvage rights to the capsized liner but having more luck saving another handful of survivors than holding onto their loot while finding themselves in competition with a rival group of 'rescuers.' Of course, we know they're really baddies &#150; they're wearing white, they're polite and they're lead by Telly Savalas in Ernst Stavro Blofeld mode, posing as a doctor but really in search of the Poseidon's cargo of plutonium. No, really. How else could you include gun battles and an axe-killing in a disaster movie? Not that Gallico's novel wasn't sillier still &#150; that featured a tiger on the loose below decks! The characters are all of the stock variety &#150; Malden plays the Walter Brennan role as the terminally-ill sidekick, Sally Field the Jean Arthuresque tomboy, Jack Warden the gruff blind writer and Shirley Knight his protective wife, Slim Pickens and his priceless bottle of vintage wine the hearty comic relief, Peter Boyle's 'Sarge' the over-protective father (a character drawn from Gallico's first Poseidon novel that didn't make it into the original film), Veronica Hamel the bad girl in a good dress, Shirley Jones the kind-hearted nurse and a young Mark Harmon, looking like Tom Cruise's not-too-bright and less talented older brother, sharing the juvenile romantic lead with Lost in Space veteran Angela Cartwright. Yet while no-one troubled the Oscar nominations, the performances aren't particularly bad even if Caine wouldn't top anybody's list as a ruthless old seadog, and there's nothing quite as camp as Shelley Winters and her aquatic escapades in the original rather than an unintentional laugh-riot, for the most part this is professionally well-made nonsense.The lousy back-projection and hosed on water in the opening storm sequence do bode ill, but once it's shipboard the production values visibly improve (it's well photographed by Joseph Biroc and nicely designed by Preston Ames), though the film makes surprisingly little of the upside down sets and, unlike the original, there's no sense of the rising water cutting off their way back to up the tension.
