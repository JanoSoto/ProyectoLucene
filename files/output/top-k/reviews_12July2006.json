In no way are Jurassic Park & Carnosaur comparable in terms of size, scale, scope or entertainment value although I thought Carnosaur was at least quite fun to watch. It moves along at a nice pace & never became boring & it was pretty funny at times. All the usual Dinosaur & mad scientist clichés are here but what the hell sometimes you just manage to enjoy a film for what it is, for me Carnosaur is one of those films. It's by no means a good film, it's very silly, it's tries to do far too much considering it's meagre budget & you can't help but keep thinking about Jurassic Park as you watch it. Basically Carnosaur is a cheap & gory Jurassic Park imitator which I found quite watchable, it's far from the best film ever made but I also think it's far from the worst.Director Simon was working with a low budget & it shows, there's no real style & the Dinosaur effects are plain embarrassing. They are truly some of the worst special effects you will ever see, most of the Dinosaur shots are out of scale & use poor rubber puppet effects while the climactic fight between a T-Rex & Doc in a Bulldozer looks like a hand puppet fighting a toy truck, the special effects are a million miles behind those that Spielberg had at his disposal that were so impressive over a decade ago. One surprising thing about Carnosaur is how gory it is, there is footage from inside a Chicken slaughter house, people have limbs bitten off, guts & bodily organs are torn out, people have their faces ripped off, people are impaled & there's even time for a messy Dinosaur birth that rips-off Alien (1979). Carnosaur doesn't shy away from showing the red stuff, which helps.With a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 I sort of feel sorry for Simon who had literally no chance whatsoever to compete with Spielberg's millions. The special effects are among the worst I've seen, the sets cheap, it's not that well made or put together & the acting could have been better but at least he tried to get as much money as possible on screen even if the film falls short on several occasions.Carnosaur is a terrible film if you look at it from a normal film-goers perspective, however never let it be said that I'm not an individual because, crazy as it may sound, I actually quite liked Carnosaur.

I thought Day-Lewis' character was the let down of the whole movie, just irritating he was, Stowe was solid without being brilliant, but the best performance goes to Wes Studi who played the fearsome Huron war captain.I don't know if its in the league of Braveheart for most people, but in comparing the 2 movies i think that LOTM at times soared above the heights of Braveheart, whereas Braveheart has a well developed story and is really solid entertainment, Mohicans is much looser and gives the actors more room to move, i didn't really feel anything for Mel Gibson when he was put to death in braveheart, however the last 10 minutes of Mohicans was some of the most moving i've ever seen. Its a no contest between Jodhi May's final scene and M.Gibson's death in Braveheart, whereas one was genuine the other was less convincing because it wasn't William Wallace suffering it was Mel Gibson. Most of the big name actors have this problem as well they can't seem to become their character instead they bring their real life personality into the film.

The reason I perceived it to be good is because that is the age level that Lucas was aiming for. It is obvious that Lucas was going to make a fortune off the next three prequels and it appears that he decided to screw the fans of star wars and cash in on a mediocre piece of garbage. Now that I am somewhat older, there is no hiding just how utterly awful this and the next two films are.The acting in this movie can be compared to the power rangers who have over dosed on Ritalin. No life, no enthusiasm, no sense of the actors really even tiring to put any effort onto the screen. They just seem to be going through the motions all in a monotone voice, and those are the non-CGI characters (the jokes sucked to say the least). Also, with the introduction of Jar Jar, Lucas apparently wanted to make episode 1 as big of a disappointment as possible; how could someone in their right mind insert such mindless character? The only comic relief that Jar Jar will bring is to those under 10 years of age &#150; a real slap in the face to Star Wars fans. On another note, the droids in this movie didn't have any kind of evil, dangerous feel to them like the storm troopers had.The plot&#133; humm. Lucas has gone with the flow of most action films lately, in that there is practically no plot. Since this is the first star wars film in the series, there should have taken it easy for us to introduce all the characters and let us learn more about their personalities. Everything is rushed; we get no breaks at all in this movie, just constant action. The Pod race scene wasn't even necessary; it provided nothing for the story and was only inserted for filler, 20 minutes of filler.The only this that was remotely positive about this film were the special effects which were still somewhat of a let down, not in it's authenticity of realism, but everything looked super high tech and clean. Lucas should have tried to keep the 1970 grungy technology feel to everything like the original star wars, which would have helped it really feel like a prequel I am harsh on this movie because of just how well made the original three Star Wars turned out and the high standards they accomplished. Although a somewhat entertaining popcorn flick, I can not enjoy it because of the injustice it does to the original three. It doesn't deserve to belong to the Star Wars legacy.

Shoe-string, of course, refers mostly to the budget, and this possibly ranks above others like Clerks, Slacker, Night of the Living Dead and Blair Witch in order to put it together so quickly. And yet for all of its little slip-ups and deranged moments of comedy, it does work for what its worth. Not that it doesn't show that the film was made in two days, but on those terms of extremely low-budget, go-for-broke B-movie-making, Roger Corman as a director has quite a nifty effort here. The story is similar to a fairy-tale (a darkly comic one to be sure, like one of the Fractures Fairy tales from the old Rocky & Bullwinkle show), in how Seymour (Jonathan Haze, perfect as an awkward, easily shockable little guy) tries to nurture a plant to earn the affections of Audrey (Jackie Joseph). But then the plant turns into a meat-eater, to put it that way, and from there Charles Griffith's script goes into wild comic turns where he now has to figure out how to take care of the plant before it 'takes care' of him. Some scenes are less notable than others, and sometimes the cheesiness of it all (just look at the plant itself for proof enough) can be wearisome. But Corman keeps the atmosphere with a giddy amount of late 50s 'shlock', and some scenes stand the test of time as the best of their B-movie status. Tops go to the 2nd film appearance from Nicholson as the most psychotic of the bunch, as a 'chipper' fetishist who gets off on getting his wretched teeth worked on- it's a masterpiece of a scene with cartoonish action, innuendo and crazy looks from a 23 year old Nicholson. Worth checking out, maybe more than once, and you're likely to find it (appropriately) in the cheapest lot of DVDs and videos at your local store.

The music, songs and dancing were out of this world. It took hundreds of talented people to put this play into a script and onto the screen. It was directed in the United Kingdom by Carol Reed. Mr. Reed proved that the UK could put forth top-notch musicals. Lionel Bart was in charge of the music.The first heart breaking scene came when the boys were marched to the tables for their gruel. Their clothes were rags and there were no shoes on their feet. First Mr. Bumble said the grace. Then, when they were allowed to eat, they quickly inhale what was before them, gruel (yuck). And then came the choosing of the straws. The short straw was to go forward and ask for more food. Poor Oliver Twist (sweet-looking Mark Lester) got the short straw. Things didn't go well for him but that's the kind of life the poor child's been living.The scenery for the Workhouse for Orphans and Working Poor was very stark and dark. The dining hall gave an idea of what the area the youngsters slept in must have been like.Second heart breaking scene was Mr. Bumble taking Oliver out into the cold and snow to be sold. Sold as property just because he was hungry. The Undertaker offered to take him on a trial basis. Oliver did OK for awhile. Then the older apprentice made some nasty cracks. The youngster tried to beat in the older boy's head. Poor Oliver was knocked down and trapped in a coffin. There he stayed until Bumble got there. The adults decided to toss Oliver down the stairs, into the cold basement. There the boy was trapped in a cold, dark room filled with coffins. Where is Love? he asked in song.Then came an interesting turn of events. Oliver went to the basement window and by accident discovered it was not locked. Next, he was out, about and his adventures began. The youngster sat off to London. But you'll have get the movie to find out more...and believe me there's much more! The scenery was well staged for all of the areas; the orphanage, undertaker's shop and basement, the town marketplace. We must not forget the carriages\/wagons and view from the road to London. The entrance to London makes you wonder when you arrived there.The people Oliver meets fit the parts they play very well. Harry Secombe (Mr. Bumble) was mean, as was his wife (Peggy Mount). Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) was a scamp. Fagin (Ron Fagin) was good-hearted (?) trouble. Nancy (Shani Wallis) was warm, caring and too loyal for her own good. Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) definitely evil trouble. Hugh Griffith, great English character actor, played the drunken magistrate. Joseph O'Connor was Mr. Brownlow, Oliver Twist's protector-to-be.The rest of the music (ex 'Consider Yourself at Home', 'As Long As He Needs Me', 'Who Will Buy?', 'I've Been Reviewing the Situation', 'Ompapa, Ompapa', etc.), costumes, hair and make-up, for all the classes of people was well done.

This movie comes together with acting, editing, and music that are very well done and fit the mood and atmosphere of the story. It is difficult to think of something I didn't like in this film since I don't have the book to compare it to. Also, in comparison to most films that are found in theaters, this movie is an outlier.

But i have to say to the by-the-book historians to shut up and enjoy the greatest film ever made! Braveheart is obviously about William Wallace's tale against the English in the medieval days. Mel Gibson's direction is beautifully done, with countless aerial views of the fair land of Scotland, which pulls the viewer into the film's romantic vision of a wonderful land and gives them all the background information you need to know about the land, with the help of the cinematography by John Toll. The music composed the famous James Horner fits the vision with a powerful flow that deepens the story into something amazing. Now, Mel Gibson plays the legendary role of Wallace in such a believable performance that is up there with Russel Crowe's for Gladiator. The accents may jump around with his tone when he speaks, but his voice is firm and strong for the role, as is the rest of the cast which were all excellent. Patrick McGoohan portrayed Longshanks very viciously and as a hateful villain. Sophie Marceau is the stunningly attractive, but naive lady who is drawn between country and what she truly believes in.The best part about the whole film though, is the two epic battle sequences that are not choppy, nor has the shaky camera like so many other films nowadays do, avoiding all the blood and gore a battle really contains. This movie surely rubs it in your face, and is needed to make what these men believed in, for what they were fighting for...freedom! it had to be as realistic as possible, and not to mention the slow-motion images again by John Toll, the sound mixing, and the uplifting score of James Horner, which makes them all the more intense and moving.And last but not least, the film, despite all the art it values, it has a great story that is powerful and stands strong alone. it is easily my favorite film, and is the best one ever made. I am incredulous that IMDb holds it at #93 on the top 250. It should be at least on the top ten. If only more epics were made this way, Hollywood would not be in the mess they are in.

Love is only ever romantic in films when it is unexpected or in some way unpredictable.However, the way Kevin Costner handled his character deserves a great deal of credit. Costner is very fitting as the mysterious, brooding widow Garret Blake--the author of the love letter--and he just exudes loneliness throughout the film. He is a difficult character but the epitome of a man that women and girls alike feel that they can change and this is what makes Garret so appealing. He is a walking invitation for change, in fact. Without this little emotional device, he would simply be regarded as a moody, antisocial guy who does not care about anyone but himself. But now every woman can relate to this film and secretly swoon for its romantic lead in hopes of changing him.Characters and romance aside, Message in a Bottle is a very contrived film and fails, with the exception of Costner's character, in capturing the audience on an emotional level.

Close - The Star is much closer, because it takes the story of an aging actress - who even sells her Oscar for booze and pocket-change, and -again - is saved by a man. The Star shows how desperate losers audition for roles far beneath them, just to be in the public eye, yet wanting that public to see them as they were - not as they would've-gotten-the-role, present time. I can't even place just when it was released or where it falls in the 100 films Davis made, nor if it is in black-and-white. It is far more convincingly directed to tell the story of has-beens. Younger people most likely have never heard of it......even I have not heard anything about it in a long time, but everyone needs to look for it, as a comparison to the brilliance of All About Eve. Whatever studio produced it should look through their vaults and re-release this film. It's every bit as theatrical as All About Eve.Many users have written brilliantly about this movie. Jkingel is one of the few who mentions Applause was adapted from it, although how it could successfully become a musical about such a stellar cast of personalities is beyond me. Even Lauren Bacall, who played the Broadway-lead in Applause admits that when La Davis attended one of her performances, it was not known she was in the theater, and La Davis was not amused. Maybe it could have been turned into one of our modern operas, but a musical??? The brilliance of Mankiewicz's script was, no doubt, the loser.Because Davis wasn't the original lead in All About Eve, she came to the set with a lot of baggage. Can't you feel the dread all of the other performers must have felt upon hearing the set-eater is coming in? HER ?? Thelma Ritter and George Saunders were the only two really seasoned actors\/actresses in the already-hired cast. Celeste Holm was established, but not the caliber of actress Davis was - is there any wonder La Davis was bitchy on-set, knowing EVERYONE knew everything there was to know about her, all hoping she would fall on her face? I took it for granted that Holm was pretty-much like the role she played. Correct me if I'm wrong, but she was always a supporter - that she won the award for All About Eve proves that.

Just like The Little Foxes, All About Eve is a perfect example that movies used to be about acting, rather than action.....both starring Bette Davis.

It can also teach modern-day people a lot of what life is about, no matter which profession they are in - be on the look-out for the younger folk coming in. They are career-driven and greedy...... Anne Baxter lost an Oscar because she refused to be cast as supporting, but Holm may have beaten her out. In all of the script-writing schools, there has to be a writer who can produce dialog as sharp as this movie contains. If not, then we are in for a lot of dull movies without good performances. I agree with one other user - All About Eve should be rated much higher than 10, and definitely higher than 45 on IMDb's list of best movies.

Obviously there are people that try to stop him including Dr. Van Helsing (Hopkins), Dr. Seward (Richard E.

The film is only about 50%-60% faithful to the narrative of the original which I found insulting. The whole Dracula-Mina love story is extremely over portrayed and frankly serves no purpose to the story apart from providing a little annoying distraction. Furthermore, there wasn't enough Van. Helsing at all. In the book he is integral at finding out that it is in fact a supernatural creature-the vampire- that is wreaking havoc on innocent victims and not purely a scientific or medical means. He doesn't appear nearly enough in the film-in fact his role seems quite minor and I found this absolutely appalling.I have another complaint as well. This film seems to turn the chilling suspense of the novel into some kind of soft porn flick with Ryder and Frost kissing in the rain as well as what seems to be a forlorn gang-bang with Reeves and the Brides of Dracula.

Also , throughout the film, Ryder falls in love with Dracula. Why?! She doesn't in the book, why does she have to do it in the film! Her role in the book is intricate, clever and positive. She is deemed as a faithful wife to Jonathan and a devoted friend to Lucy. In the film her character is drastically altered to someone who is unfaithful and seemingly uncaring to the fact that her friend has died! Why did they do this? There seems no logical reason! Finally, and this is what I find ultimately insulting, the film is entitled Bram Stoker's Dracula. Yes, I understand that because of copyright reasons they had to rename it but is is so far from Bram Stoker's Dracula it might as well have been written by your next door neighbour.I apologise to the fans of the film for my continuous rant at its awfulness but I have yet to see a decent and faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.

He doesn't appear nearly enough in the film-in fact his role seems quite minor and I found this absolutely appalling.I have another complaint as well. This film seems to turn the chilling suspense of the novel into some kind of soft porn flick with Ryder and Frost kissing in the rain as well as what seems to be a forlorn gang-bang with Reeves and the Brides of Dracula. This is absolutely absurd as in the book, the three brides merely seduce Jonanthan on a chair (a chair!) and not on a bed so they can slink onto him! Also , throughout the film, Ryder falls in love with Dracula. Why?! She doesn't in the book, why does she have to do it in the film! Her role in the book is intricate, clever and positive. She is deemed as a faithful wife to Jonathan and a devoted friend to Lucy. In the film her character is drastically altered to someone who is unfaithful and seemingly uncaring to the fact that her friend has died! Why did they do this? There seems no logical reason! Finally, and this is what I find ultimately insulting, the film is entitled Bram Stoker's Dracula. Yes, I understand that because of copyright reasons they had to rename it but is is so far from Bram Stoker's Dracula it might as well have been written by your next door neighbour.I apologise to the fans of the film for my continuous rant at its awfulness but I have yet to see a decent and faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Who knows, we might get one soon. And please, if we do STICK TO THE BOOK!

The movie is about Helen Lyle, a woman who is investigating urban legends and mythology. While doing research, she comes across the tale of the Candyman, an African-American artist who had his arm sawed off, and was attacked by a swarm of bees hundreds of years ago after having an affair with a white woman. Supposedly, if you say Candyman in the mirror five times, the Candyman will appear to you, with his big hook-hand, and brutally murder you. While investigating unsolved murders within the city that are suspected to be caused by the Candyman, Helen herself becomes entangled in the legend, and the Candyman begins appearing to her. Soon, Helen's life goes into a downward spiral as she is accused of murder, while the Candyman tries to make her one of his new victims.Clive Barker must have a pretty good imagination, because this is quite a unique horror story. I don't think I've ever heard of a story like this, so the movie is definitely original. The plot is woven very neatly, with plenty of scary moments and artistic touches, making it a beautiful horror film. Virginia Madsen was excellent and convincing in this movie, the audience really sympathizes with her as her life is turned upside down by the Candyman, and in the end, she still turns out to be a hero. Tony Todd was seriously scary in his role of the Candyman himself, with his creepy stare and his low-key voice. There are some genuinely gruesome death scenes in this movie, and the sequences where the Candyman appears to Helen were extremely well-done and scary. Tony Todd was the perfect Candyman, his dead-serious facial expressions and low, menacing voice adds to the overall creepy effect of his character. The film takes place in the inner-city area of Chicago, and the film includes undertones of racial issues that play in well with the setting and the characters in the movie, without going over-the-top. The music in this film is one of the most memorable things about it though. It's an eerie, haunting score that is used in the scenes very appropriately and makes things much more unsettling and spooky, as if things aren't creepy enough.Overall, Candyman is a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. It's imaginative, it's morbid, it's artistic, and it's an all around good horror movie. If you are a fan of scary films or have the slightest interest in the genre, I highly recommend this. Candyman is undoubtedly one of the best horror films of the decade. 10\/10.

A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.Secondly though, I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach. He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. His parents tightly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like Dudley Moore does. The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. But that's the other half of the equation. My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. He spent his life being a perfect party guest. The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.And that's what Dudley Moore is, a wastrel. Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him. That's a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur. My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli, a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay. Still Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.Arthur, 20th century wastrel, is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry. Since he won't work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to. We should all have such troubles.John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time. The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime. That man was amazing, still at his craft almost to the end.So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss, a genuine real life Arthur, I dedicate this review.

It is a plain simple romantic story with slight suspense and with lots of kisses. It was so boring that I even though to stop watching it after 30 mins(This never happened to me for any Hitchcock movie). Only because it was a Hitchcock movie I watched it full, but was very much disappointed. The ending was grossly abrupt and I never expected it was the end and I was thinking my media player was showing something wrong and there must be some 10 to 15 mins still left to solve the puzzle and get the details of what happened to mystery of the Uranium powder, etc.Cary Grant was impressive as usual, other than that there was nothing in the movie. It may be attractive for college goers who like to watch kisses on the screen, but is having no good story line with suspense.I don't know how other reviewers said it was the best Hitchcock movie. If I didn't knew that it was a Hitchcock movie I could never have realised that it was a Hitchcock Film!To me the Best Hitchcock film, which I have seen, is North By Northwest.
