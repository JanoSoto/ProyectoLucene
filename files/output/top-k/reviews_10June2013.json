I never know how to judge the acting skill of an actor but Al Pacino's Tony Montana left a deep impression on me -- a guy who exists in order to gloriously be himself. Tony did not believe any governmental or cultural propaganda. What he truly relied on were his intuition and guts, which unfortunately, messed him up when things went beyond control. Came out of the prison of C** Cuba, Tony did not trust Capitalist neither. There is no supreme rightness in the world from his understanding. In Tony's life, people cheat when they are doing business; people used money to kill others; people bought election and so forth. The world is so bleak that Tony just let himself go. He believed he lived more honestly than others. He commented on other people like this You are not good. You just know how to hide; how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I am always telling the truth even when I am lying. That is really cocky, which explains his disdain of the world. They suit up in public and f×ck around in private out of primitive nature. They show courtesy like well-educated citizens but also spare no time to play tricks trying to fool others. Tony hated all of these but at the same time, indulged in them. I guess he had a strong sense of self-hatred. Tony sticked to his own standard of right and wrong cuz people who made the rules are corrupted. It's kind of a self- defense system combined with the cynical attitude towards the society. That's exactly what is happening now though people displayed in different ways. The man who burned the school bus expressed his anger in an extreme way. He got confused of the standard to be a good citizen. Well, you know, when the broadly recognized social justice broke down in his heart he was in a sphere of limitless The so-called social justice is not right so the it is highly possible that the whole society was misconstructed in the moral sense. Then I could have the right to decide what is right or wrong. He could justify his behavior in this way. I don't know why I connect these two totally different things together cuz the imaginary Tony never tried to believe, at least not showed in the movie while the real man might collapse after years of struggle. It is not a deep movie but I resonated with my confusion on how to define a good person and a bad one. Like the poster of the film, we don't know how to differentiate black and white. Who decides? Anyway, it is a classic gangster movie made in 1983 and Al Pacino's haunting performance made it different. I hate bloody scenes but I love violence in a proper way. The primitive anger and lust twisted people and destroyed them. People, as human beings, have limit and we will never have absolute right or wrong. We walk on a fine line to make sense of the whole social system.

But at the same time it was a great movie watching experience as we examine the more lower depths of how inhumane we can really be as a society and yet still somehow manage to get with doing our actions. The strange irony is that this film runs at very unreasonable levels. The two leading male characters are couple of hateful humans that it in-spite of their wicked demeanour, I still seemed quite intrigued as what will transpire between these characters. Neil LaBute who wrote and directed this film gave freedom to the movie to just let things flow and avoids it from being preachy or overly moralizing. To me it makes this comedy all the more darker and at the same time more effective too.This tale focuses on a businessman named Chard (Aaron Eckhart), who without hesitation brutally confesses to his friend Howard (Matt Malloy) how much he despises all that is female. So then Chard persuades Howard into a scheming plot in which they're lead on a vulnerable woman and eventually when all is said and done, he will dump her. Chad's reason is a vicious plot at revenge due to the ways women have treated men. Chad assumes that their six-week hiatus to a satellite office is the perfect facility to carry this cruel scheme and while at that take the time to make a mockery on this poor victim at her expense. Howard himself goes along with the scheme feeling that this master-plan will backfire and through self-obligation, sides with Chad to see what will transpire. The plan starts to materialize as the lab rat for this scheme is a naive, shy secretary named Christine (Stacy Edwards) who works at the satellite office who is also deaf. The whole film, Chad and Howard take turns charming Christine, while that's progressing, their scheme starts to get out of control and takes its turns in expected turn of events.The manipulative schemes the men have on poor Christine are very deceitful that it's hard to watch at times. In the case of Chad, the plot is an attempt to emerge victorious as a ploy to further express his disdain to the female gender. Howard feels this scheme is unlawful, it more like to be aware of what's inside looking out instead of vice-versa. The audience and even Hoawrd himself know this plot will not work out. In most movies and T.V. shows they never do. But it's still intriguing in how this plan will come crashing down on them. And we hope that there might be a small fragment of humanity between Chad and Howard. Sure the outcome is predictable, but it's still fun to watch how it will backfire. The reason for dark comedy isn't the jokes or the action by the leading stars, but the laughter rests in the vicinity of what lengths people will go to to express how hateful we as human race truly are.The character-driven film scores high points in terms of depth. In addition to that it makes us reconsider our actions by what we say and do I'm glad that Mr. LaBute ended the film with a moral lesson or a perfectly wrapped happy ending. In the end in this case, the antagonist comes out the winner. And in the real world, bad people usually end up victorious in many situations. Granted Chad is a handsome individual and can wow the ladies with his charm quite easily. But at the same time time he's hypocritical, obnoxious and quite the condescending person who looks a nice person you want to punch in the mouth with. But he is still easy to identify with. There are a lot of Chad's out there And yet you feel sick to your stomach because you understand the psyche of this character so in the end I'm the jerk that has the egg on his face. The whole Chad, Howard and Christine love factor has some noteworthy things of interest here. You have two to put it loosely gentlemen of contrasting backgrounds. You have Chad, the handsome, suave ladies man, and then you have Howard who comes across as socially awkward who like most people of his kind in society are the one's who never come out on top (me included). And it's obvious Christine chooses the suave one over the awkward one. Matt Malloy was excellent portraying Howard. At fist he come across as an introverted individual. However, in the pivotal scenes in the end, it's a breath of fresh air when he lashes out when his buttons are pushed.Once the dust settles, we find these two jerks madly in love with Christine being the unlucky victim due to her being deaf. Both fall victim to the metaphoric love potion. Chad is at a loss of words to admit he loves her while Howard feels short that lost in a situation where he should have won.

Basically ten years have passed since the events of The Dream Child, and there is only one child of a parent involved with the burning of child murderer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) left alive, that being unnamed John Doe (Shon Greenblatt), but he manages to escape death by crossing the city limits and barrier that the killer cannot cross. Meanwhile there are troubled young people planning to run away from their shelter, Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) was made deaf in one ear by abuse from his parents, Tracy (Lezlie Deane) had her father sexually abusing her, and Spencer (Breckin Meyer) just doesn't want to have anything to do with his father's lifestyle. John becomes a resident at the shelter and is cared for by Dr. Maggie Burroughs (Lisa Zane), he has amnesia and she suggests, finding a newspaper clipping on him, using it to jog his memory and return to where he came from, with Carlos, Tracy and Spencer as stowaways. Visiting Springwood Orphanage it is revealed that Freddy Krueger had a child of his own, John is sure he is that child because he has been allowed to live in his dreams, but of course this turns out to be false when he is killed, and the child is revealed to actually be a daughter. Maggie does some more investigating on who could be the missing child, while one by one Freddy is killing those from the shelter in their dreams, and he is shocked to discover, on fer found adoption papers, that she is the daughter of the killer. Doc (Yaphet Kotto) is a man who can control his dreams, and he discovers that Freddy can kill people in their dreams because he was given powers by the dream demons, and this also explains how he comes back to life, so he can only be stopped by being brought into the real world and killed by someone close to him. Maggie knows that she will have to enter the dream world to confront and bring out Freddy into the real world, and there she sees the past life of Freddy's mind, where he was teased as a child, abused by his foster father, self harmed himself as a teenager, and murdered his own wife. Maggie manages to pull Freddy from the dream realm during a struggle, they fight vigorously until she takes off his glove of razors, and she stabs him in the chest with it, and then a bomb is put in his chest and away from them he explodes, and the demons are seen flying away, Maggie smiles and says Freddy's Dead. Also starring Roseanne Barr as Childless Woman, Tom Arnold as Childless Man, A Nightmare on Elm Street's Johnny Depp as the Guy on TV (as Oprah Noodlemantra) and Alice Cooper as Freddy's Father. Englund is only slightly back on form for what could have been his final time playing the part of the iconic psycho, the deaths are not all that great, even what is meant to be the final death of Freddy is terrible, the 3D element that was put in at the time is useless, and the story is only a little bit interesting, I thank goodness the Wes Craven film three years later improved things because this is almost a waste of time, it is a big let down and a silly horror sequel.

Englund is only slightly back on form for what could have been his final time playing the part of the iconic psycho, the deaths are not all that great, even what is meant to be the final death of Freddy is terrible, the 3D element that was put in at the time is useless, and the story is only a little bit interesting, I thank goodness the Wes Craven film three years later improved things because this is almost a waste of time, it is a big let down and a silly horror sequel.

Basically the story is a reworking of the William Shakespeare tragedy King Lear, and it begins with the Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) stepping aside as leader of his people and giving control of the empire to his three sons Taro Takatora (Akira Terao), Jiro Masatora (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo Naotora (Daisuke Ryû). The three songs are all have youth on their side to rule the kingdom, the eldest Taro is given the prestigious First Castle, while Jiro and Saburo settle for Second and Third Castles, and the Lord only wishes to be an honoured guest in these three castles for the continuing years of his life. The two older sons make their father happy, but the youngest may want to cause arguments by warning his father that the uniting of the three brothers to have control will not remain united after some time. Enraged by this the father banishes the young son for pointing out this potential danger, however the warning does come to pass when the oldest son plots with his remaining brother to take everything from their father. With all this going on a war is declared and battles are fought, the formerly powerful Lord Ichimonji is stripped of his former glory to the point where he may die, murders are committed within the closest family and friends, and in the end is only a bad ending for the particular characters. Also starring Mieko Harada as Lady Kaede, Hisashi Igawa as Shuri Kurogane, Masayuki Yui as Tango Hirayama and Yoshiko Miyazaki as Lady Sue. The story was just about easy to understand, I admit the first half an hour or so was the most interesting, but the rest had some interesting moments, the costumes were absolutely deserving of an award, and the battle sequences are great to watch, although I drifted in tiny moments I know overall it is a great epic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography, it won the BAFTAs for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.

Basically the story continues from the previous film, where the bones of Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) were buried, and dream warriors Kristen Parker (Tuesday Knight), Joey Crusel (Rodney Eastman) and Roland Kincaid (Ken Sagoes) have been released from the Westin Hills Asylum and are living normal lives and attending high school. Kristen has made new friends with frequent daydreamer Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox), brainy and black Sheila Kopecky (Toy Newkirk) who suffers asthma and bug hating tall girl Debbie Stevens (Brooke Theiss), as well as martial arts enthusiast boyfriend Rick Johnson (Andras Jones). It is Kincaid's dog who entering his dream innocently digs around the junk yard where Freddy's bones were buried, and he unearths them, resurrecting the killer, who kills Kincaid, and in his dream and drowned in his water bed Joey is also killed. Knowing that Freddy is back from the dead to haunt their nightmares, Kristen warns them to try and stay awake so that they will not be killed, but also she tells them of her gift to enter the dreams of others and also control the surroundings of a dream, i.e. make it a good dream rather than bad. She however does not avoid falling asleep herself and Freddy manages to creep his way into a nightmare and she is killed, so Alice is the one trying to pull everyone together and stop them from falling victim to the psycho with the razor hands, but of course they cannot control their sleeping habits, including under sedation. Alice however does research dream stuff, and comes across a nursery rhyme entitled The Dream Master and uses it to her advantage, she gets Freddy is a room of mirrors so he can see his evil reflection, this makes the souls he collected turn against him and leave his body, and he evaporates, but of course the nightmares may not be over on Elm Street. Also starring Danny Hassle as Dan Jordan, Brooke Bundy as Elaine Parker, Nicholas Mele as Mr. Dennis Johnson and Jacquelyn Masche as Mrs. Crusel. Englund still does well being devilishly amusing and sinister with his kills, and by the time of this film became part of popular culture, the story is a little too similar to the previous, obviously the best things about this sequel are the main antagonist and the inventive murders in the dreams, overall it is not a bad horror film.

Buster Keaton's career reached its creative apex here, but since it fail, Keaton lost his independence as a film-maker. In later years, the movie gain such a cult following, that it became one of the best silent films of that era. Buster Keaton stars as Southern railroad engineer Johnny Gray during the Civil War. Not. He is a man with only two loves the sweet Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack) and his trustworthy engine, the confederate train 'The General'. The film was made during the height of Southern Renaissance of 1920's, but the film can also be a bit disturbing when you think about it. With a name like Johnny Gray, his character represent the Southern every man, while his two loves interested represent the antebellum south. Let's remember, 1915's Birth of a Nation, was only filmed a decade earlier and the racism was at its height in 1920's. Keaton's best works are somewhat ruined by his patent endorsement of the racist conventions of the time when he isn't a racist. No wonder why this movie got mixed reviews at the time. Some people in the North, though it portray the South too heroically and made the North seem like the villains for trying to reunited the country. While people in the South, love the movie because of its historical romance about the Lost Cause of the Confederate States of America. This movie doesn't feed or show anything racism, but can make some viewers feel disturb in what the movie's message is trying to put out there. Anyways, the war office rejects him as he's too valuable as a trained engineer. His sweetie rejects him thinking he is a coward. Only when union soldiers stole his steal his engine, and inadvertently kidnap Annabelle to plans to use the train to supply its soldiers in a sneak attack against the Confederates does Johnny has the opportunity to prove his bravery. Buster Keaton is great in the role, as he was a fan of trains in real life. He nails the humor with inimitably deadpan takes. I would have love more facial expressions than sad stone-faced, but it wasn't needed. Marion Mack was spunky, and fun to have around in the adventure. I love the scene, where Johnny ask her to get more firewood for the train. The General is based on a real incident during the American Civil War when Andrew's Raiders, a posse of northern soldiers hijacked a confederate train and a lone southern engineer found himself fighting the lot of them alone. It became known as Great Locomotive Chase. Since this film is from the silent era, and most films had little or no record of the original music. There are only three scores that work for this film. The first one is music arranged and directed by Robert Israel. The second one is the Theatre organ score by Lee Erwin. In my opinion, the best one is the one composed by Carl Davis. I wish he could have done the same for all of Buster's films. Buster was one of the best, so he deserves the best! I think it fits, the epic scale and dramatic tone of the film. The film is more than a just a comedy and deserves more than just a comedy score. It's a matter of interpretation I guess. Besides, Carl Davis is one of the best silent film score composers and his work for Thames Silents was instrumental in the resurgance of interest in silent cinema. Since Buster did his own stunts; one of the most dangerous stunts happen when Johnny sits on one of the side rods, which connect the drivers of the locomotive. The train starts gently and gradually picks up speed as it enters a shed. The visual effect of the forlorn Buster as the motion of the side rod moves him gently up and down is very poignant. But in real life, it is nearly impossible for any engineer to start any train moving this precisely. If he had not accelerated by exactly the correct amount, the rods would have moved so fast as to send Buster flying, certainly injuring or killing him. Some people think this is the movie that the actor broke his neck in, no it was another movie Sherlock Holmes Jr. (1924) that it happen. Yes and he broke his neck in the film, without knowing it, doing an railroad scene. The water tower broke while he was standing underneath it. The water came out with such force, it broke Keaton's neck. He didn't even know it. It wasn't this film. This film does hold the most expensive scene in the history of silent movies. The famous scene in question is when a bridge collapses and the train Texas falls into a river. In 1956, the film entered the public domain due to the claimant's failure to renew its copyright registration so you can pretty much find this movie anywhere. There are two copies to know of. There is the original full length film at 105 minutes long very rare to find. Then there is the copy abridged around 80 minutes long. Some people have attempted to explain the difference is the speed as the cameraman's decision to run the reels faster or slower. I found out that in a side by side comparison, there are over 200 differences where I could find cuts in footage. So there has to be missing footage. I like the 80 minutes version more. The Allied Artist version has no score, so it's nearly unwatchable. The Kino version isn't that great as well. Depending on what version you get, you might have great restoration or really bad restoration. Overall must watch.

Some people have attempted to explain the difference is the speed as the cameraman's decision to run the reels faster or slower. I found out that in a side by side comparison, there are over 200 differences where I could find cuts in footage. So there has to be missing footage. I like the 80 minutes version more. The Allied Artist version has no score, so it's nearly unwatchable. The Kino version isn't that great as well. Depending on what version you get, you might have great restoration or really bad restoration. Overall must watch.

It does not fit into any specific genre as it combines romance, mystery, drama, comedy and yes, horror into a strange film you cannot turn off. I have watched it multiple times and with each viewing find something new I did not catch before. There is nothing I would change about this film. Don't let the reviews that tout this as soft-core porn or a movie about BDSM or twisted sex games gone wrong unduly influence you. The BDSM scenes are indeed integral to the story, as the story is about excess, extremes, and coping. Yes, there are some kinky sex scenes and descriptive narrations, but at its root it is a story about power (the power of love, infatuation, hate, obsession, cruelty, revenge) and how dangerous that power can be when employed by a selfish person and not tempered with compassion or empathy. How that power can be used to destroy a life, even if seemingly unintentional. Oscar is a selfish, older man obsessed with pursuing his sexual needs. He thinks he falls in love with a beautiful young woman (Mimi), only to grow bored with her after the infatuation stage is over. She is naïve, somewhat innocent (open to debate), and truly loves him. He is only interested in the wild, sensual sex and how far he can ratchet up the sensations.Ironically, it is the older Oscar who mistakes infatuation\/sex for true love while the younger Mimi merely uses it as an expression of her love. For those with a basic understanding of SM relationships (Dom and sub), we see that Mimi first plays the role of the Dom within the bedroom, pleasing Oscar to his delight through various physical acts.When these roles are reversed, however, we find that Oscar is a terrible dominant &#x96; disregarding the nurturing aspect of D\/s and taking it too far with emotional and psychological cruelty. Instead of using this role reversal to show love, he instead uses it in an attempt to drive her away from him as he becomes completely indifferent to her. Basically, he is a terrible, selfish person and ultimately abandons her so he can purse random sex with other women. At this point Mimi is poisoned (as Oscar's narrative references movie title). The once naïve and innocent Mimi re-enters his life after an accident, only now she is cold, hateful, lost, and seeking a type of revenge, perhaps to show she is worthy of his love after all (yeah, it is screwed up). Oscar has basically ruined her life (watch and you will see how in gruesome detail), depriving her of any future normal relationship due to his extremes For this reason, she becomes just as cruel (if not more so) than him &#x96; in a perverse effort to become like the man she loves. Even as she matures, she still only exists to others as he defined her from their relationship &#x96; that of a sexual object. Oscar stays the same creepy, narcissistic bastard to the bitter end; it is really only Mimi whose personality evolves at all &#x96; even if it is in the wrong direction. There is MUCH more to the movie than be summarized here, and for fear of spoilers I will not go into any detail. But is a film you cannot forget and will want to watch several times. It is dark, brooding and tragic, with complex psychological elements &#x96; definitely leaves an impression. Every guy needs to see this film, if for no other reason than to see the horrors that such selfishness can produce. Sure, not all every woman used and discarded will turn into Mimi, but this movie makes you examine yourself and realize that damage is still being done even if not to such an extreme. Unless you are just simply not paying attention, you cannot walk away the same person as the story does stick with you. Yes, it is ultimately a love story (Mimi's love story &#x96; not Oscar's), but one unlike any you have ever seen before. The movie is deep, thought-provoking, and gruesome. I think you have to be 35+ or emotionally mature to really appreciate or understand its dark beauty and savagery.

Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well.In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they nuke the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared.This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening.This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film.Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this.

It's ugly scenery, beautifully captured and perfect for the movie's context.This is a dialog heavy, character-driven movie that many moviegoers will reject for slow pace and lack of action.

Basically a year has passed since the events of The Dream Master on Elm Street, and survivors Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox) and Dan Jordan (Danny Hassle) are dating with no sign of child murderer Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund), but then she has dreams of a nun wearing name tag Amanda Krueger (Beatrice Boepple) locked in an asylum full of maniacs. While she plans a getaway to Europe with Dan, Alice has made new friends, training supermodel Greta Gibson (Erika Anderson), future Olympic diver Yvonne (Kelly Jo Minter) and comic book loving geek Mark Gray (Joe Seely). Alice has another dream about this Amanda in the asylum being raped by the various inmates and quickly gives birth, this is obviously the explanation for Freddy being the Son of 100 Maniacs, and rapidly growing from baby to adult he tries to kill her until she wakes up. A meeting is arranged between the friends, but Dan falls asleep and is the next victim to Freddy in his nightmare world, and worse comes when Alice finds out that she is pregnant with her boyfriend's child, and of course the friends she has made are being killed one by one in their dreams and real life combined. Recovering in hospital she met a young boy named Jacob (Whit Hertford), and she later realises this boy is her unborn child in the flesh, and in the dream world Yvonne goes to release the soul of Amanda, while Alice tries to free Jacob. In the last scenes Jacob has somehow been given powers from Freddy, he reverts the killer to turning into a baby, and he is thrown into a church or something and goes within himself, okay, I didn't get it, but he was defeated, and obviously comes back for more, so who cares? Englund was not nearly as amusing or nasty as with the previous films, some of the deaths are certainly inventive within the dreams, such as someone eating themselves death, someone dying jumping from a swimming pool diving board, and someone dying in a comic book being torn apart like paper, but the story is dreadful, the attempt to make a clever plot doesn't work, and the special effects, no matter how not bad, don't help things, it is just a silly horror sequel.

With his brother\/ringman Kurt by his side, he feels he cannot lose. That is, until he faces off against the most fearsome fighter in Thailand, if not the world the dreaded Tong Po (himself...actually Qissi) Despite Kurt warning him to not get in the ring with him, Eric pridefully ignores his brother and fights Tong Po. The evil Po mercilessly beats Eric so badly he paralyzes him for life. Seeking revenge for his brother's crippling, Kurt sets out to learn Muay Thai and beat Tong Po in the ring. No school will accept him, so, working on a tip from ex-Special Forces Vietnam vet Winston (Anderson), Kurt goes to the Thai countryside to receive lessons from master Xian Chow (Chan). Chow puts him through his paces, but ends up falling in love with Mylee (Ashana) in the meantime. Gangster Freddy Li (Lee) has bet millions on the upcoming fight, AND Tong Po assaulted Mylee, AND he wants to get revenge, so with all the pressure building, will Kurt defeat Tong Po? Here's another Van Damme classic from the golden year of 1989. Most people, even if they're not action fans, are at least aware of Kickboxer. Even a David Letterman Top Ten List of the day featured the topic top ten things overheard while waiting in line for Kickboxer. Underground fighting movies had hit the mainstream and had their brief moment in the spotlight. And Van Damme was spearheading the trend, thereby becoming one of the faces of the action movie movement of the late 80's\/early 90's. While Kickboxer falls squarely in the middle in terms of the quality of his Punchfighting era (the best being Bloodsport, 1988 and the weakest being The Quest, 1996 - as always it's open for debate but that's our opinion), it has a much imitated, never equaled kind of feel to it and even though it's a little on the long side, it never really gets boring.It may be a bit of a stretch to believe Alexio and Van Damme are brothers, but, that aside, in the movie, Eric disregards Kurt's advice to not fight Tong Po, thus reinforcing the old saying always listen to your Van Damme. But the brothers in Bangkok do share a genetic sense for fashion, as stonewashed denim vests and half-shirts seem to be the order of the day. But Van Damme steals the show in the wardrobe department when he unleashes what can only be described as a tanktop with suspenders for straps. And for no explained reason, for the final face-off with Tong Po, they are BOTH wearing silly loincloths that leave criminally little to the imagination. How did they both know wear a freakin' loincloth to this particular battle? Presumably they didn't talk beforehand and arrange it - it's surprising they both weren't embarrassed, like two women who wear the same outfit to a party.There are some excellent and picturesque Thai locations, there's a great song at every turn which smartly keeps the energy going (most of which are by AOR artist Stan Bush), and at one point one character says to Van Damme, I'm not signing your death warrant. Seeing as the movie of that name came out the next year, could this line be an inspiration? Also in 1990 came a similarly-themed movie to Kickboxer, The King of the Kickboxers (1990), where Keith Cooke takes over the rural Thai trainer role. But one thing that movie does not have, nor any of the myriad training sequence movies that followed in its wake has, is one very important element the Van Damme dance. Yes, part of Kurt's training is to go to a roadside cafe, get drunk, then bust a move with some local ladies. The movie pretty much stops - as it should - so we can see Van Damme get funky on the dance floor. Not since Breakin' (1984) where he claps along to the beat in his wrestling singlet have we seen his expertise with rhythm. Definitely a movie - nay - a career highlight for JCVD. He should have danced more in his movies.One other note like how in Best of the Best 2 (1990), the name Brakus is constantly and continuously said throughout the movie, here the name Tong Po is the constantly-said name. These writers were sure proud of their bad-guy names. While the popularity of this movie led to the inevitable flood of sequels (where Sasha Mitchell replaces Van Damme), this original is truly a video store classic and a worthy movie in its own right.

And you probably have heard them hundreds of times because people just love quoting this movie. As well they should. Of course a great script is nothing without great performers who can turn what is written on the page into movie magic. And Swingers is blessed with a pair of performers who are absolutely perfect. One is Favreau himself and the other is of course the loud, boisterous, ultra-cool Vince Vaughn. There are a few other important performers, Ron Livingston and Heather Graham most notably having key roles to play. But the movie by and large belongs to Favreau and Vaughn. What a pairing. The back and forth dialogue between the pair absolutely sparkles and the two actors embody their characters so wonderfully. The result is a movie that is so money.Favreau plays Mike, a struggling comedian who recently moved across the country to Los Angeles. He broke up with his long-term girlfriend and to say he is having trouble letting go would be putting it mildly. His confidence is shattered, he has no success with the ladies. Vaughn plays Mike's friend Trent. This guy has no trouble with the ladies and he takes it upon himself to get Mike back in the game. With the rest of their group of friends Mike and Trent do all the things twenty-something guys do. They play video games, go to parties and bars, chase the honey babies. The contrast between Mike and Trent is always at the heart of the movie. And it is always hilarious. When looking for women Mike does everything wrong. Meanwhile Trent has women fall into his lap. You always sympathize with Mike. Who can't relate to this poor schlub? Meanwhile you always laugh with Trent. Every time the character opens his mouth comic gold spews forth. It is a very simple movie. In this case simplicity is a very good thing. The movie breezes by in a tight, fast-paced hour and a half. There are no lulls.

I honestly didn't know what to expect since I hadn't read the comic book. Watching the film, I was amazed to see many familiar faces such as Tobey Maguire, who plays the protagonist of the movie- Peter Parker.Surprisingly, this movie turned out to be one of the best action films I've watched so far.

Depressed, and looking to commit suicide, Cage pumps his entire life's savings into one last Las Vegas trip. Here he will consume copious amounts of alcohol and then die. At least that's the plan.Much of the film watches as Cage strikes up an impromptu relationship with a local prostitute (Elisabeth Shue). They form a bond of understanding, mutual acceptance and perhaps unconditional love. Figgis then clashes many moments of romanticised self-pity with Las Vegan grime and sleaze. This is Neil Jordan, Abel Ferrara territory, the director trying to paint a darkly glamorous fairy tale against a sordid backdrop.It works, but this is still an overly sentimental, overly piteous tale, and none of Figgis' characters or relationships are psychological plausible. People don't behave quite this way, Shue plays the hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold cliché, and Cage paradoxically plays a suicidal depressive who's charming and in love with life. It's all a giant writer's fantasy.Bizarrely, what Shue's character sees in Cage is never brought up. And the way Figgis mirrors Shue's life to Cage's sets up weird implications. If Cage's alcoholism defines his self-destruction, then so too Shue's prostitution, including a last act sequence in which she is sexual assaulted, implying that she too is self-destructive and so was asking for rape.Nicholas Cage would win an Oscar, Golden Globe and several best actor accolades for his role. Like most best actor winners, it's a showy role, all noise and outer surfaces, though he does convince in some scenes, with his sad, hollow eyes and agitated tics. Shue is given a number of good lines &#x96; she speaks of her loneliness, recalls coming home from work to nothing but a bottle of mouthwash and the taste of semen on her lips &#x96; but they're all relayed to a psychologist during several flashback sequences; a lazy, implausible device used to get characters to confess their souls.The film seems to use Lara's Theme from Doctor Zhivago. Elsewhere Figgis composes his own bluesy score, which perfectly compliments his moody visuals. He turns Las Vegas into a world of permanent after-hours. A morass of bulbs and billboards, in which skid rowers and barflies suckle booze and dice-roll their way to slow oblivion. The film was shot in Super-16.7.9\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing. See The Cooler and In a Lonely Place.

Some people may call this movie a psychological thriller. I would like to assert that calling this movie a psychological thriller would be like calling Debbie Does Dallas a sex film or Star Wars a science fiction film. Without any special effects or gratuitous violence, they create an environment of fear like I've rarely seen in movies. It seems a little bit as if Carl Boehm as this beautiful young man trapped in a horrific state sort of precedes Mia Farrow's role in Rosemary's Baby (although this one induces much more fear).So just watch Peeping Tom and you'll see what a horror movie can really be.

Ryan is Danny Balint, a former yeshiva student that turned into a neo-Nazi. Directly based on the true story of Daniel Burros, this psychological struggle mastered by the intense performance of Ryan Gosling will pin you to your seat. Henry Bean managed to capture the raw emotions of his main character authentically played by Gosling. There is definitely more than abs to the former Disney child star. I was struck by Gosling's performance as a clever but psychologically-troubled mind. His intensity is captivating and the tension he builds within himself is somewhat close to insanity. In The Believer, I witnessed the brutality of Danny's words and actions but I couldn't help but feel bad for the poor guy and the deep struggle he has to face. At first, I obviously hated the character for being such an inhuman monster but when I discovered his demons and his love\/hate relationship with his own God and religion, I had trouble being that resolute about his fate. The monologues made me clench my jaw and the constant violence of his deranged self challenged me as a passive viewer. This movie treats a topic not necessarily well-known by everyone self-hatred in the Jewish community.
