Although some have commented that these were the first reality shows, I would argue that nothing has changed in the human psyche from thousands of years earlier, when the Roman Colosseum was the outlet for the dark side of the human imagination, where food and gore was served up as a circus of demented and tasteless pastimes, where for a set period of time you could forget your own travails and feast your senses on the pains of someone else.This disturbing film begins and ends on the same coda, that of how a broken animal is shot out of sympathy, to put it out of any more misery. You have to see the film to understand what this means and the final scene completes the thought. The tensions that exist for all contestants is underscored by personal anxieties and humiliation. I suspect that you would not appear on the dance floor of a marathon unless you were down on your luck, probably very hungry and desperate to feed a family. This is what afflicts most of the contestants. Consider other layers of tension that make your skin crawl. At first when the character Robert appears, he denies that he is interested in dancing with anyone and without any chance to give an alternative to why he is there, we are left wondering if he really was too embarrassed to admit his needs or was just drifting aimlessly, waiting to be drawn into the vortex freak show that was just about ready to start. And drawn into it and his fate he unexpectedly gets pushed. He is matched up as Gloria's dance partner and in her you get a woman whose veins are filled to the brim with acid. A partner like that makes you prefer to sit in the electric chair first. Their most unlikely partnership hinges almost entirely on the smoldering rage that Fonda's character holds on to, with Sarrazin's character just about as malleable as silly putty. If his character is portrayed that way in the novel then fine, I guess the director had little choice. I found his passivity more confusing and after a while I was hoping that he would show some backbone (sorry for the terrible pun).The movie is deeply layered with enough time taken to show how the contestants slowly but surely burn down like candles on their last lights. Especially difficult to watch are the emotionally explosive mental breakdowns of several characters, one who looses her mind and screams that she is covered with insects crawling on her. Just as disturbing is the final break down of Alice LeBlanc, who, now jilted by her long time partner and having had her clothing and makeup taken from her by someone, having lost all her props (again, sorry for the pun) imploded and ended up breaking apart in a shower scene. Her painful scream followed by a soft voiced recognition that someone had screamed is almost too much to bear watching. Susanna York was outstanding in her role. Red Buttons is very good as a Sailor from World War one (again, we wonder why he would have entered such a crazy contest - except that perhaps he was there to show off his strength, now past his prime, or else because he too was down on his luck).I quite agree the fast walking timed sprinting scenes (both of them) are hideously played out and in our minds we are wondering who will drop dead first? Will it be the pregnant lady (Bonny Bedelia) or the sailor or anyone else? This is truly where the humans are turned into horses panting and pushed to their limits in a small scale chariot race and the full crowds cheer them on. It is utterly sickening and it goes on and on.(Spoiler major)....When Gig Young's character spills the beans about how little the winner will actually get (my mouth popped open when he said the words) you just look at Jane Fonda's face and you can see her think and do the simple calculation and you realize that she is totally manipulated and demolished and destroyed by the ruthless rules. The utterly soulless Rocky just explains to her that it is just business and he's not out to rip anyone off and he's got all the receipts to prove it. I think of the way the banks foreclosed on thousands of homeowners who could not pay their mortgages during the depression because of a massive economic contraction and huge unemployment and how the bankers would say the same thing it was just business and they have the receipts.If ever there was a more heartless depiction of the dark side of humanity I do not know of a more painful collection of images. The actors are all outstanding in their roles, some more developed or limited as the director and script saw fit. I felt that Jane Fonda nailed her role with perfection and she showed that the Fonda family had only outstanding acting talent. The great Al Lewis (you will remember him from his hilarious stint on the Munster television show) is all understated with hardly a scene he is in where he does not have a small cigar chomped between his teeth. This is not a film that needs to be re-done as I think that Pollack has captured what needed to be said and shown. It is truly a horror show but not the type we normally associate with that emotion. The mirror it holds up to our dark side is supposed to make you squirm. Very unsettling but important film.

The story became more and more relevant but none of this applies really to The Bank Dick.The Bank Dick is a completely old fashioned comedy, done in the same style as for instance a Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Laurel & Hardy movie. The movie features lots of great slapstick moments and a main character that is totally carrying the movie to some great heights. The Bank Dick features some truly hilarious moments, making this a real great and effective genre movie to watch.W.C.

The Bank Dick was one of his last movies, which most likely also had to do with the fact that the '40's were coming and the genre- and the movie world in general began changing rapidly. What I like about him is that he's really acting. For instance a Charlie Chaplin or a Buster Keaton is always more relying on the movie its psychical aspects. W.C. Fields paid way more attention to the delivery of lines and how he should act, move and look in a scene. You can tell that everything got planned out but it still feels all very natural when you see Fields acting out the movie its comical and especially slapstick-style moments.I love that this movie is deliberately old fashioned. It hasn't got a story you have to think about too much and the movie overall has a childish naivety over it, mostly due to the way W.C. Fields is portraying his character.

With a nickname of Naughty Panther, Fei-hung is in constant trouble with people and, no matter his intentions to help out just makes things worse for himself. When his father has had enough he sends Fei-hung away to be trained by a wine-guzzling master Su who is not only famed for his 8-Drunken Genii style but also for crippling many of his students. Fei-hung tries to get away from this fate but it is not long till his drunken teacher tracks him down and teaches him, whether he likes it or not. However, when he is humbled by the mighty killer Thunderleg, he decides to train to be better no matter what it takes.I've not given up on modern releases totally but a real death-march of uninspiring films of late has seen me using my DVD rental subscription to get in touch with older films and also genres that do not often show up on my basic TV package. Recently this has seen me getting some old-school martial arts films and of course Drunken Master had to be one of the first to be seen. When watching it, it is important that you keep your genre frame of reference because as a film (with no riders or expectations) it could be dismissed as having no substance to speak of - an accusation that I myself level at many blockbusters that offer me nothing to engage with. In this case though one does have to wonder if it matters because in terms of pure entertainment value there is just about sufficient story to pull a basic frame together for an amusing and exciting film.I say this because the plot doesn't do much other than set up the many fight sequences that the film has and really these are the reason why we are all here. Without exception, these are technically and visually impressive. The physical strength and control of the actors is just as impressive as the choreography and, unlike modern films, the camera sits back so we can see and doesn't get into the close and frantic editing which reveal the actor perhaps could only do one short movement at a time and needed lots of help from the camera. Speaking of camera movement, one of the joys of the film is to see what has now become the genre-defining zooms in on faces and other such clichés.Speaking of which, the acting also fits this mould as it is the wonderful OTT style of acting, with big hair and exaggerated performances that owe a debt to silent cinema. Chan is not at his funniest here (partly because his character necessitates a degree of arrogance that takes away a little) but he is still very comic and self-effacing in his comedy. He is well supported by Yuen, who is also very skilled and able to do comedy, while Hwang's villain is wonderfully 1970's martial arts and full of camp menace. The support cast features some familiar faces who bring stuff to the table such as the high-kicking Linda Lin and the amusing Dean Shek.Drunken Master is very much a genre film and those who do not like the conventions of the genre should not be too shocked to find that they don't like it here. However for martial arts fans and the casual viewer, this is a great film with plenty of brilliant action blended with a genial and comic tone that allows it to be solid good fun.

However, when he is humbled by the mighty killer Thunderleg, he decides to train to be better no matter what it takes.I've not given up on modern releases totally but a real death-march of uninspiring films of late has seen me using my DVD rental subscription to get in touch with older films and also genres that do not often show up on my basic TV package. Recently this has seen me getting some old-school martial arts films and of course Drunken Master had to be one of the first to be seen. When watching it, it is important that you keep your genre frame of reference because as a film (with no riders or expectations) it could be dismissed as having no substance to speak of - an accusation that I myself level at many blockbusters that offer me nothing to engage with. In this case though one does have to wonder if it matters because in terms of pure entertainment value there is just about sufficient story to pull a basic frame together for an amusing and exciting film.I say this because the plot doesn't do much other than set up the many fight sequences that the film has and really these are the reason why we are all here. Without exception, these are technically and visually impressive. The physical strength and control of the actors is just as impressive as the choreography and, unlike modern films, the camera sits back so we can see and doesn't get into the close and frantic editing which reveal the actor perhaps could only do one short movement at a time and needed lots of help from the camera. Speaking of camera movement, one of the joys of the film is to see what has now become the genre-defining zooms in on faces and other such clichés.Speaking of which, the acting also fits this mould as it is the wonderful OTT style of acting, with big hair and exaggerated performances that owe a debt to silent cinema. Chan is not at his funniest here (partly because his character necessitates a degree of arrogance that takes away a little) but he is still very comic and self-effacing in his comedy. He is well supported by Yuen, who is also very skilled and able to do comedy, while Hwang's villain is wonderfully 1970's martial arts and full of camp menace. The support cast features some familiar faces who bring stuff to the table such as the high-kicking Linda Lin and the amusing Dean Shek.Drunken Master is very much a genre film and those who do not like the conventions of the genre should not be too shocked to find that they don't like it here. However for martial arts fans and the casual viewer, this is a great film with plenty of brilliant action blended with a genial and comic tone that allows it to be solid good fun.

I must have missed seeing it at least half a dozen times and probably more; it used to turn up regularly at CND events to be shown to audiences of the faithful, but at that age films just didn't interest me and the very ubiquity of this one was in itself off-putting.When it turned up on the big screen at the National Film Theatre, I felt I really ought to take the opportunity to see it for once, but having heard it lauded more or less throughout my entire life my hopes were frankly pretty low; I was expecting another Citizen Kane disappointment. (It is very hard for a film to live up to its reputation when the reputation is sky-high and everybody knows 'the best bits' before they've even seen it...) But on the contrary, I was very impressed. Dr Strangelove himself is a bit too broad for me, but the balance of paranoia and lunacy is otherwise perfect, and there is a lot of genuine tension as well. When the film starts off we have no means of knowing what is actually going on -- the significance of Plan R, the General's state of mind. It is only gradually that it even becomes apparent what is happening, which make the impact all the greater.I suspect those who say that this is not a comedy but a satire are largely correct; there was laughter in the auditorium, but it was often laughter of shock\/disbelief (Did he *really* just say that?) rather than a straight comic response. And the film ended in a stunned silence (with nervous giggles, again, at the bald caption THE END) rather than in laughter or applause, although I think the audience had appreciated it. For a film that has been criticized as consisting almost entirely of dialogue -- not that there is anything wrong with that -- it contains a lot of subtle visual gags to pick up that are never mentioned by the characters, from the barely-visible nameplate captioning the General on his first appearance as Jack D.

Dutch, already a fan of his music, is appreciative of the extra service and brings Dwyer into his circle, which brings him into contact with Dutch's girl Vera (Diane Lane).If I didn't like you, you'd be dead, is Dutch's way of expressing friendship.It's nice to be liked, Dixie replies.The film is centered around the nightclub of the title, a fashionable Harlem nightspot where blacks are welcome only on stage, entertaining the white customers. Owney Madden (Bob Hoskins) runs things with an eye for keeping order, especially where the volatile Dutchman is concerned. Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines) just wants to dance into the arms of Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who is torn between the chance for true love versus the chance to pass for white in a white man's world.The stacked cast even includes Nicolas Cage as Dixie's mad-dog gangster brother and Laurence Fishburne in one of his first signature tough-guy roles. The white man has left me nothing but the underworld, and that is where I dance, he tells Sandman. Where do you dance? All this crammed into just over two hours leaves very little room to breathe, for a director who mastered movies which do exactly that. But with little useful dialogue except of the expository kind, characters coming and going all the time, left-field plot twists (Dixie goes to Hollywood and becomes an instant star), and a central romance between Gere and Lane that is long on open-mouth kissing but short on story, you need spectacle to keep your attention.Remar makes the film worthwhile for me. His bug-eyed tantrums as Dutch are what stay with me when the film is over, yet he shows range, too, shy with Vera, henpecked with his wife, and amiable with Dixie in his guarded way. It's hard not to worry what will happen when he learns about Dixie and Vera, not only for the lovebirds but for Dutch, too. I only wish Remar could have played Dutch in the latter film set in the same milieu, Billy Bathgate; Dustin Hoffman is a great actor but was wrong for that part. Remar here fits into it like a cement overshoe.The film also boasts great music, including singing from McKee and tapping from Hines and his brother Maurice that raise the roof and recall the famous baptism scene in Coppola's first Godfather. Larry Marshall does a great Cab Calloway, conked locks whipping across his forehead.Nothing is really wrong with Cotton Club. But what's right doesn't stay right for long, and the rest doesn't hold together. It's a fun show, so long as you don't mind being a bit confused when the curtain comes down.

A decade later, disguised as an modern Egyptian in 1930s Cairo, he discovers in the eyes of governor's daughter Helen Grosvenor (Zita Johann) the soul of the woman he lived and died for in ancient Thebes. Imhotep seeks to bring her to share his undead life, as soon as he gets that scroll.A few moments of horror for an eternity of love is all he asks for, and the achievement of The Mummy is half-making you believe the idea a reasonable one, no matter how many dead museum guards Imhotep leaves in his path.This could well be regarded as Karloff's sound debut. As several posters here have already pointed out (reptilicus, bensonmum2, Fudoh-101), while Karloff had made his mark already in Frankenstein, it was in The Mummy we got to hear him speak for the first time. And what a voice! Sibilant, ethereal, polite, the voice of a London undertaker with a slightly distracting lisp, it curls around the corners of the screen like incense smoke as he leads Johann and her British friends to serve his dark ends. It's one of cinema's unforgettable voices, and it is used here for the first time to its full effect.You cannot harm me, he tells his pursuers when cornered, with the slightest of smiles. You must return that scroll to me or die.Karloff is ably helped by director Karl Freund's deliberate pacing, by set designs that accentuate the spookiness of the living-and-undead framework, and by a riveting score that gives us plenty of mournful bassoon when Imhotep contemplates his lost love. Jack Pierce's famous make-up is of the less-is-more school, leaving the bandages off except for a couple of brief instances, letting the natural hollowness of Karloff's eyes and jowls do the work with the help of a myriad of web-like lines that cross his face at every juncture, suggesting the desiccation underneath.Another plus for Karloff here is Johann as the one woman in distress in these kinds of movies that actually adds to the overall equation. Unlike others, I'm not surprised that Johann didn't have a big movie career after this; she had an exotic look and an otherworldly aura that seems ill-suited for conventional material (even Garbo had to work to find parts). But watching her in a gold-lame gown, all curves and no underwear, resembling a figure of Isis in a charm bracelet seen later on, you get a feeling for why Imhotep aches so. She sells the spooky hold Imhotep has over her character, yet at the same time manages to surprise you with some well-grounded humor.The weaknesses of the film for me are the rest of the cast, ranging from silly-smug (Edward Van Sloan) to wooden (David Manners) to flat-out wrong (Arthur Byron), with only Bramwell Fletcher's short, sharp turn as the archaeologist who frees Imhotep standing out in any interesting way. There are too many Dracula parallels, though you do have to be looking for them.As a showcase for Karloff, though, you can't ask for better, a tight, gripping tale that leaves no opportunity wasted to set off Karloff's eyes like Roman candles and leave you cringing in anticipation for what he will do next. It was a good introduction to a Karloff who could do more than just shamble and moan.

However, the film does take certain liberties in its portrayal of Marine culture and military justice. As a civilian myself, I am certainly not an authority on the subject. However, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out that no Judge Advocates General attorney speaks to their superiors the way Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) does and gets away with it. While I realize that Cruise aimed for a comic approach to his boy entering manhood trademark role, I was disappointed to see the rest of the cast seeming to play along with his irreverence. Nevertheless, his cavalier attitude towards authority figures sets up a few stellar rebukes from his costars, notably Lt. Com. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and of course, the crowd favorite Lt. Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson). While Cruise probably had the best performance of his career (along with a strong supporting cast in Moore, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, and Keifer Sutherland), Nicholson steals the show. His you can't handle the truth! monologue alone is worth the price of admission. The cinematography of this film is absolutely mind blowing, except for one matte shot of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that looks very fake. The Windward Division barracks reminds me of a base I saw in Key West, Florida. The courtroom is shown from all angles, almost like being there yourself, and you feel a real sense of history in the place. Pay attention to the lighting. Reiner mentions the lighting in his director commentary, and yes, it does make a difference in how you experience the film. The widescreen special edition of A Few Good Men has the obligatory extras. Reiner is not very talkative in the director commentary, which is disappointing. However, there are a few bonuses, such as a special documentary made for the DVD, production notes, spoken language selections for French, Portuguese, Spanish, and plenty of chapter selections (for those who prefer to skip to their favorite parts). All in all, a great movie.

There is a glaring reality to his work, even The Man With the Golden Arm, which seems to unravel from the perspective of Sinatra's intoxicated character in a sort of surreal way but still feels like the most honest depiction of life itself. Perhaps Anatomy of a Murder is the same sort of aesthetic, a world depicted from the perspective of its protagonist, Jimmy Stewart, who unlike Sinatra's Frankie Machine is a clear-headed, seasoned and taurine realist.Lee Remick plays the flirtatious wife of a very young Ben Gazzara, who is charged with murder for shooting a barkeeper who allegedly raped her.

With the three remaining survivors of the third flick returning (Patricia Arquette is replaced by a blatantly different Tuesday Knight) and a new batch of likable (a rarity in the 80's) characters introduced simultaneously, we are given a story that finally feels like it is going somewhere.

Like the characters in Dream Warriors, Alice finds her true strength in the dream world and becomes a formidable obstacle for Krueger. Unfortunately for the other children of Elm Street, Freddy is getting stronger and is getting better at exploiting their weaknesses, resulting is some rather gruesome scenarios.Truth be told, the fourth installment in the series is a real crowd pleaser.

Mike Hammer, the protagonist, is a sleazy P.I. who specializes in divorce cases. This changes one night when he gives a ride to a hysterical woman with a deadly secret. Hammer and the woman are captured by some mysterious men, and, after getting tortured, they are put back in his car and rolled over a cliff. The woman dies in a ball of flame and Hammer miraculously survives. Similar to Spillane's other novels, this violent episode serves as the catalyst to a relentless story of revenge.The difference, though, between the movie and the book, lies in the secret that the woman holds. This important difference is the reason why Spillane's book is merely entertaining, while the film version of it is a trenchant critique on 1950s America. (Don't worry, Hammer's knuckle sandwiches and nymphomaniac girlfriends are still in practically every scene).Spillane's Mike Hammer stories are fueled by relentless pacing, over-the-top dialog, and raw, sadistic violence. Although they have a sordid appeal, it's hard to take them seriously because most of the time his written pyrotechnics seem like a ruse to get a rise out of the reader - and nothing much beyond that. Spillane's books are visceral and entertaining, but they lack profoundness. A writer like Dashiell Hammet, for example, was able to do both, in books like Red Harvest, which is about a private detective taking on an entire town of corrupt politicos and businessmen. He was a writer who could entertain you and make you think.Before I get into it, it would be helpful to mention a little film trivia which I gleaned off of IMDb and Wikipedia after watching the movie. For one, the movie was named by the Kefauver Commission, a federal unit investigating corrupting influences, as 1955's most corrupting influence on American youth. This came out at the height of cold war hysteria, when McCarthy was leading the nation on a witch hunt for commie pinkos collaborating with the evil Soviet empire. Also interesting, is that the movie was adapted for the screen by A. I. Bezzerides, a writer with purported leftist sympathies. Supposedly Spillane ran into Bezzerides in a restaurant around the time of the movie's release, and the two had an immediate dislike for each other - mainly because Spillane didn't like what was done with his book. It is also said that Bezzerides hated Spillane's book and rushed through the adaptation because he had contempt for it. You'd think that two such clashing personalities would be a formula for disaster, but strangely Kiss Me Deadly the movie takes the best comic overtones of Spillane's work, and adds that something extra which makes it a film noir classic.The movie, directed by Robert Aldrich, left in the sadistic, womanizing Mike Hammer, and took out the clichéd mafia conspiracy at the heart of the book version of Kiss Me Deadly. In Spillane's book the investigation eventually centers on a missing narcotics shipment, but, in Bezzerides' screenplay, the narcotics shipment becomes contraband radionuclide - a glowing Pandora's box that when opened unleashes atomic hell fires.Bezzerides may not have been intentionally injecting leftist interpretations into the script, but he was a witness to the times, and anyone working in Hollywood surely was affected by McCarthyism and the threat of nuclear annihilation. What happens in Kiss Me Deadly is interesting because Bezzerides turned it from a cartoonish detective story into a topical story that captured the paranoid atmosphere of the times. Mike Hammer is still hilariously macho, but the essence of the story now centers on a mysterious box containing atomic destruction.What's more striking than that is the movie's climax. True to Spillane's go out on a bang formula, the movie ends with the atomic box being opened, an exploding house, and Hammer limping away with radiation burns and a bullet lodged in his gut. The movie ends on this climactic note, but it's obvious that this is one scrape Hammer won't survive. When reading about the making of this film, I couldn't help but think this was a subconscious change ideated by Bezzerides, to kill off Mike Hammer. Hammer is an egotistical bully whose modus operandi is blind rage, revenge, and the hope of a big pay off. His fiery demise is his nemesis. Spillane for obvious reasons, would never have done that.If I have any gripe with this film noir classic, it would be that Hammer could have been more loyal to Spillane's vision. For one, Spillane's Mike Hammer is an unabashed bedroom dick, a sleazy P.I. who makes a living doing divorce cases in which he gets his girlfriend to seduce wayward husbands. He's supposed to drive a heap, not a hot rod like in the movie, and he certainly doesn't have all the latest modern accoutrements in his apartment - like the new-fangled answering machine which is highlighted a couple of times in the movie. The book also has Hammer in his native New York, but the movie takes place in Los Angeles. However, these are just a minor complaints, because, much more importantly, Hammer's insanely sadistic side is perfectly evoked, and the stark black and white of the movie make it suitably noir. Robert Aldrich's direction and Ernest Laszlo's great cinematography perfectly render the shadowy American underbelly of the 1950s.By taking Spillane's run-of-the-mill story and adding the element of atomic hysteria, Bezzerides and Aldrich turned this into a film with a deeper message. Mike Hammer is still a sleazy detective, he is still an entertaining anti-hero, but he can now be seen as a symbol for man's insatiable curiosity and greed, whose blind fury ultimately unleashes unknown powers on the world.

This important difference is the reason why Spillane's book is merely entertaining, while the film version of it is a trenchant critique on 1950s America. (Don't worry, Hammer's knuckle sandwiches and nymphomaniac girlfriends are still in practically every scene).Spillane's Mike Hammer stories are fueled by relentless pacing, over-the-top dialog, and raw, sadistic violence. Although they have a sordid appeal, it's hard to take them seriously because most of the time his written pyrotechnics seem like a ruse to get a rise out of the reader - and nothing much beyond that. Spillane's books are visceral and entertaining, but they lack profoundness. A writer like Dashiell Hammet, for example, was able to do both, in books like Red Harvest, which is about a private detective taking on an entire town of corrupt politicos and businessmen. He was a writer who could entertain you and make you think.Before I get into it, it would be helpful to mention a little film trivia which I gleaned off of IMDb and Wikipedia after watching the movie. For one, the movie was named by the Kefauver Commission, a federal unit investigating corrupting influences, as 1955's most corrupting influence on American youth. This came out at the height of cold war hysteria, when McCarthy was leading the nation on a witch hunt for commie pinkos collaborating with the evil Soviet empire. Also interesting, is that the movie was adapted for the screen by A. I. Bezzerides, a writer with purported leftist sympathies. Supposedly Spillane ran into Bezzerides in a restaurant around the time of the movie's release, and the two had an immediate dislike for each other - mainly because Spillane didn't like what was done with his book. It is also said that Bezzerides hated Spillane's book and rushed through the adaptation because he had contempt for it. You'd think that two such clashing personalities would be a formula for disaster, but strangely Kiss Me Deadly the movie takes the best comic overtones of Spillane's work, and adds that something extra which makes it a film noir classic.The movie, directed by Robert Aldrich, left in the sadistic, womanizing Mike Hammer, and took out the clichéd mafia conspiracy at the heart of the book version of Kiss Me Deadly. In Spillane's book the investigation eventually centers on a missing narcotics shipment, but, in Bezzerides' screenplay, the narcotics shipment becomes contraband radionuclide - a glowing Pandora's box that when opened unleashes atomic hell fires.Bezzerides may not have been intentionally injecting leftist interpretations into the script, but he was a witness to the times, and anyone working in Hollywood surely was affected by McCarthyism and the threat of nuclear annihilation. What happens in Kiss Me Deadly is interesting because Bezzerides turned it from a cartoonish detective story into a topical story that captured the paranoid atmosphere of the times. Mike Hammer is still hilariously macho, but the essence of the story now centers on a mysterious box containing atomic destruction.What's more striking than that is the movie's climax. True to Spillane's go out on a bang formula, the movie ends with the atomic box being opened, an exploding house, and Hammer limping away with radiation burns and a bullet lodged in his gut. The movie ends on this climactic note, but it's obvious that this is one scrape Hammer won't survive. When reading about the making of this film, I couldn't help but think this was a subconscious change ideated by Bezzerides, to kill off Mike Hammer. Hammer is an egotistical bully whose modus operandi is blind rage, revenge, and the hope of a big pay off. His fiery demise is his nemesis. Spillane for obvious reasons, would never have done that.If I have any gripe with this film noir classic, it would be that Hammer could have been more loyal to Spillane's vision. For one, Spillane's Mike Hammer is an unabashed bedroom dick, a sleazy P.I. who makes a living doing divorce cases in which he gets his girlfriend to seduce wayward husbands. He's supposed to drive a heap, not a hot rod like in the movie, and he certainly doesn't have all the latest modern accoutrements in his apartment - like the new-fangled answering machine which is highlighted a couple of times in the movie. The book also has Hammer in his native New York, but the movie takes place in Los Angeles. However, these are just a minor complaints, because, much more importantly, Hammer's insanely sadistic side is perfectly evoked, and the stark black and white of the movie make it suitably noir. Robert Aldrich's direction and Ernest Laszlo's great cinematography perfectly render the shadowy American underbelly of the 1950s.By taking Spillane's run-of-the-mill story and adding the element of atomic hysteria, Bezzerides and Aldrich turned this into a film with a deeper message. Mike Hammer is still a sleazy detective, he is still an entertaining anti-hero, but he can now be seen as a symbol for man's insatiable curiosity and greed, whose blind fury ultimately unleashes unknown powers on the world.

Just like many others out there, I realize that seeking the truth and the huge answer to the why does this madness still exist? is exhausting. So nobody wants to really do it, instead we go on with our lives, not caring for the truth.Furthermore, we would be insulted by the public What kind of a monster are you to doubt the credibility of the Government. We think it is better not to even think about what could be the truth behind the superficiality of assassinations and terror strikes.We need more movies like this one because since it's mass media which is deceiving our beliefs, it shall be mass media to enlighten the facts and doubt the official stories. In 2038 the national archives have to open the files of the JFK Assassination but until then the U.S.A has to be ready to discover the truth because if it is not, we even might never see those important proofs; they will go missing.I admire Oliver Stone for his commitment to produce a film about what still is a conspiracy. Doubting the official story with solid counter facts is the best wake up call to the people of the world, to stop thinking about our Governments as Guardians of social values, democracy and liberty. They are not, and realizing that fact is shocking and hard to believe, harder to prove.I want somebody to produce a decent movie about 9\/11, not in Michael Moore style, but in Oliver Stone JFK style, and if it has to be in the year 2039, so 20 years after the actual incident (JFK is released 28 Years after the events of the Kennedy Assassination). Someone has to dare.Too bad it can't be Oliver Stone again, who has already made his early statement with his apparently neutral, but not so neutral WTC movie, which did not question any of the 9\/11 facts. Watch Loose change SE for a start if you're interested in what the U.S Government is capable of. It will shock you just like this movie might have shocked you, too.P.S. From a cinematic and rhetorical point of view this movie is very very enjoyable, really sucks you in, that's what I personally love about it.P.P.S Many people do not agree with my opinion, review, which again proves that this topic is still up-to-date and debatable.
