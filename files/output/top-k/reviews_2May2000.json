Neither had I seen any of Jarmusch's other quite prominent films - Down by Law, Mystery Train, Night on Earth and Dead Man. And yet I left feeling I had witnessed a film which had found a rare blend between action, comedy, drama and the provocation of some deep philosophical stirrings about life and how to live it nobly.Through the great camera work of Robbie Muller, we are introduced to a bleak urban landscape that could be anywhere (but which turns out to be New York), and the even bleaker folk who inhabit it. Making his way through this is Ghost Dog (Whitaker), a modern Samurai, living by the ancient ways in a world that has forgotten such. Working as a 'casual' hitman for Louie (Tormey), he suddenly finds himself at the other end of twisted mafia logic and honour when he rubs out one of the small town mafiosa (at the request of other members of 'la famiglia') and thus must be similarly rubbed out. As they systematically attempt to destroy his code of life, he reacts strictly in accordance with Hagakure, or The Way of the Samurai.Whitaker is a strong presence in the film as the dark knight and street wise hitman and yet somehow ancient avenger. The dexterity with which he performs various samurai action and technique is excellent and it is refreshing to have a 'non-action hero' actor playing this role as he also brings depth and humanity to the character. Gorman and Tormey are both convincing as the 'old school' mafiosa who are clinging to the vestiges of what they perceive their own code to be, in an environment where their kind are on the verge of extinction. De Bankole as the french speaking illegal immigrant (and Ghost Dog's best friend), Raymond, is fun and the youngest of the cast, Camille Winbush also does well in the role of Pearline, the potential 'young apprentice' for Ghost Dog.Jarmusch has done a smooth job with the writing. His use of two other languages (and the accompanying subtitles) is an interesting device to highlight the nature of communication across worlds, the chunks of text taken from The Way of the Samurai and reference to cartoons such as 'Felix the Cat' and 'Betty Boop' act as nice sign posts for the forthcoming sequences of action, and the humour that ocassionally bubbles up in certain scenes offsets the easy violence that permeates others.Probably the only real hole in the movie is the lack of explanation as to how Ghost Dog became the modern urban samurai that he is...although maybe it is better left as a mystery?All in all, a film that most should find interesting, amusing and with a nice twist of samurai philosophy by which to live life.

Occasional dream-scenes with rose petals are only adding to this depressing contrast between the real life and the dream.

The script writers have interwoven moments from Rubin's past with the mid 80's when most of the film's action takes place. A young black man, Lazurus, or Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) stumbles upon the autobiography of Rubin Hurricane Carter, and with his three Canadian 'home tutors', Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (John Hannah), decides to fight for Rubin's release from prison. Attempting to constantly foil any attempts at justice is the 'bad' cop, Della Pesca, (Dan Hedaya), who has been hounding Rubin since childhood and seems determined to keep him behind bars.Denzel Washington does well in the title role and applies himself with his usual commitment to creating a whole and believable character, especially important in such a movie that is based on real events and people. Watch out for the prison scene with Mae, his wife and the scene where he meets Lesra for the first time. This latter especially I found very powerful - it was well shot, the dialogue was tight and their relationship is beautifully established. And not to forget the prison scene with Myron (David Paymer) and Leon (Harris Yulin) his lawyers - this may just snare Denzel the Oscar. His supporting cast also do a fine job -Vicellour Reon Shannon, although a little wooden at first, seems to grow into his role (which I guess fits the character quite well) and Unger, Schreiber and Hannah as the three Canadians do a solid job also. Rod Steiger's cameo as Judge Sarokin is noteworthy as is Mitchell Taylor Jnr's role as young Rubin.The screenplay itself is possibly a little long.

A young black man, Lazurus, or Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) stumbles upon the autobiography of Rubin Hurricane Carter, and with his three Canadian 'home tutors', Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (John Hannah), decides to fight for Rubin's release from prison. Attempting to constantly foil any attempts at justice is the 'bad' cop, Della Pesca, (Dan Hedaya), who has been hounding Rubin since childhood and seems determined to keep him behind bars.Denzel Washington does well in the title role and applies himself with his usual commitment to creating a whole and believable character, especially important in such a movie that is based on real events and people. Watch out for the prison scene with Mae, his wife and the scene where he meets Lesra for the first time. This latter especially I found very powerful - it was well shot, the dialogue was tight and their relationship is beautifully established. And not to forget the prison scene with Myron (David Paymer) and Leon (Harris Yulin) his lawyers - this may just snare Denzel the Oscar. His supporting cast also do a fine job -Vicellour Reon Shannon, although a little wooden at first, seems to grow into his role (which I guess fits the character quite well) and Unger, Schreiber and Hannah as the three Canadians do a solid job also.

They'll think, Well, that wasn't so great.  What's HER deal??But, you won't do that, right? I can tell you how I really feel about High Fidelity, right? I LOVED it! I laughed so loudly and for so long, that I was afraid I was going to be disruptive, so I held my hands over my mouth and had to stomp my foot on the floor to release some of that energy of mirth. At various times in my life, I've known every character who populated High Fidelity, and it was fun to spend time with them again. There was so much truth in the film and slice of life irreverence, there were moments when it hurt to watch.Director Stephen Frears likes to put surprises in his films, and there are some fun twists here. But mostly, this is John Cusack's world.  And welcome to it. In the beginning of High Fidelity, Rob Gordon (Cusack) gets dumped by his girlfriend (Iben Hjejle). This prompts a period of soul searching and direct eye contact with the camera, during which Rob recounts his top five worst break ups. In between his introspective and revealing monologues, we get to see Rob's friends, family, fantasies and former loves. There are so many fun cameo appearances here. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and Sara Gilbert all have small parts. I wondered what in the heck prompted them to do the movie and hope it was Cusack's influence or that they just don't mind spending a few days on a fun flick. There are surprises from an actress playing a rock star and even a real rock star who gives Rob some good advice. But, my favorite characters are the two guys who work for Rob at his vintage record store. Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) provide a sort of Greek chorus for this modern male tragic comedy.  And many of the scenes that cracked me up were the three guys marking time at work debating lists of The Top Five... whatever.The previews for High Fidelity made it look to me like mostly a chick flick, sort of a Say Anything for twenty somethings. But the truth is, this is a guy baring his soul and confessing to the guy flaws that make him unable to remain faithful and commit to a girl he loves. Fidelity isn't just the way a song is reproduced on vinyl, it's also the test of a relationship. The film High Fidelity remains faithful to the book by Nick Hornby. And it all rings true to me.

They'll think, Well, that wasn't so great.  What's HER deal??But, you won't do that, right? I can tell you how I really feel about High Fidelity, right? I LOVED it! I laughed so loudly and for so long, that I was afraid I was going to be disruptive, so I held my hands over my mouth and had to stomp my foot on the floor to release some of that energy of mirth. At various times in my life, I've known every character who populated High Fidelity, and it was fun to spend time with them again. There was so much truth in the film and slice of life irreverence, there were moments when it hurt to watch.Director Stephen Frears likes to put surprises in his films, and there are some fun twists here. But mostly, this is John Cusack's world.  And welcome to it. In the beginning of High Fidelity, Rob Gordon (Cusack) gets dumped by his girlfriend (Iben Hjejle). This prompts a period of soul searching and direct eye contact with the camera, during which Rob recounts his top five worst break ups. In between his introspective and revealing monologues, we get to see Rob's friends, family, fantasies and former loves. There are so many fun cameo appearances here. Catherine Zeta-Jones, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor and Sara Gilbert all have small parts. I wondered what in the heck prompted them to do the movie and hope it was Cusack's influence or that they just don't mind spending a few days on a fun flick. There are surprises from an actress playing a rock star and even a real rock star who gives Rob some good advice. But, my favorite characters are the two guys who work for Rob at his vintage record store. Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) provide a sort of Greek chorus for this modern male tragic comedy.  And many of the scenes that cracked me up were the three guys marking time at work debating lists of The Top Five... whatever.The previews for High Fidelity made it look to me like mostly a chick flick, sort of a Say Anything for twenty somethings. But the truth is, this is a guy baring his soul and confessing to the guy flaws that make him unable to remain faithful and commit to a girl he loves. Fidelity isn't just the way a song is reproduced on vinyl, it's also the test of a relationship. The film High Fidelity remains faithful to the book by Nick Hornby. And it all rings true to me.

It's funnier than `You can't fight in here, it's the war room,' but I suspect the humour was unintentional.

These clunky lines eat away at the script's solid foundation like acid.  It's particularly bad to watch how keen the film seems to be to undermine its two main characters, Mason and Goodspeed.  Sean Connery (Mason), and to an even greater extent, Nicholas Cage (Goodspeed) are frequently called upon to drop out of character in order to deliver some tough-guy sarcastic comment; it's never worth it.  The most jarring moment comes when Connery says, `Your BEST?  Losers always whine about doing their best.  Winners go home and hump the prom queen.'  (Actually, he used a different verb; but - and I strongly disapprove of this censorship regulation - the IMDb won't permit me to reproduce it here.)  Not only is this not the kind of thing Mason would say; nobody from outside the United States would ever, in any context, utter the phrase `prom queen'.But these departures from character at least show us that Mason and Goodspeed had characters to depart FROM.  This is something, surely.  In fact it's a good deal.  The characters actually survive the corrosive process the writers have put them through.  There are a lot of ideas - plot and character ideas, I mean - in `The Rock', and they're mostly rather good ideas.

The story is well built and it feels satisfying however much the fascist military sentimentalism sours the palate, however many of Michael Bay's damned music video montages we have to sit through, however the rapid cutting tends to confuse rather than enlighten us as to exactly what's going on during the action sequences.  A good story triumphs - at least to some degree - over poor execution.NB  Not once but twice a character sticks a syringe into his own heart.

Different rules for angels and demons are mentioned whenever it's convenient for the plot, without really making them seem plausible.The acting, especially Fiorentino and Rickman, who both look like they were going to fire their agents afterward, is pretty poor.

Will and Kevin ham it up but hold the salt and pepper, Dean and Sammy had writers who were at least funny.  As for Salma ... sigh ... Salma ... what's a raspberry truffle doing in this dried up cheeseburger of a movie?But on the other hand, with a few beers on hand and some friends to help with peanut gallery duty, this movie's pretty enough and stupid enough to make for a good rental.(Did I use enough food metaphors?)
