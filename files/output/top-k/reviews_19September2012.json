It had some weird effects, some strange characters and Sean Connery (which is fantastic to begin with), but much like Batman and Robin, when I grew up, I couldn't help but think that this film is just a clumsy mess, attempting to portray the British as a bunch of 'Tea before Scones' types yet again, almost as if it were a propaganda movie. The acting is incredibly half-baked, showing that the actors really didn't put much effort into this film, the special effects aren't that special, the story is your basic 'hold the world for ransom' ploy and the rest I don't care to mention.It's obvious they were trying to make their own version's of the Bond films by making things overly complicated in terms of devices and usage. For example, when Emma Peel is given a package by a secret mailman telling her to answer the phone in order to receive her orders. My question there is, why? Why not just phone her as she would just answer the telephone instinctively like any other person would, she doesn't need to be told how to do basic things by letter unless she suffers from learning difficulties. The instructions they give her are to meet her Secret Agent accomplice John Steed at a Gentleman's Club, a place where no women can go. How stupid is that? Also, when she get's there, John comments on how she doesn't play by the rules. Where the hell was that coming from? They were stupid enough to order her to go to this place where no women can go.Next problem, Peel has video evidence incriminating her for sabotaging her own project and yet this secret Ministy allows her the chance to solve her own crime!!!

Chances are if she was a real villain she'd head off with Steed before killing him in some dark alley and jumping the country within the first 12 minutes, and this Ministry, which seems to have a thing about giving Male Agents Female titles and Female Agents Male titles, wouldn't have a clue where she's gone. There's also a Clone of Emma Peel, which seems to hark back to the Double Man, and there's an Invisible Man!

Live people cannot see them because they ignore the strange and unusual...and she is by definition strange and unusual.The movie is full of really fun moments as well as scary moments, including some brilliant special effects - no CGI required at all, in fact this is pre-cgi.This includes when Adam and Barbara pull their faces to make them into their Scary\/Creature forms, the sandworms, and not to mention Beetlejuice himself.Which brings me to the title character Beetlejuice, who is played by Michael Keaton - and he is fantastic in the role, bringing the right amount of ghoulish grossness and mischief to the role.He is a blast to watch on screen and his pranks are ingenious, including what does at the end when he turns into a carousell (with might I add....a very early prototype for Jack Skellington on it).And it's still funny seeing what he did to poor old Otho, changing his outfit to a blue suit. There's nothing scarier to this guy than clothes that are out of style. Am I the only one who feels sorry for poor Otho? Surely i'm not the only one.This movie was really entertaining when I was little and it still is to this day, and it spawned a theme park attraction and an animated cartoon series. There was also a planned sequel in the works but it didn't come to fruitition.There were also two action figure lines, one by Kenner based off the movie and another line based off the cartoon. As well as some figures by Neca including Stretch-Faced Adam and Stretched Faced Barbara and Beetlejuice with spikes coming out of his body.The Kenner line had some interesting figures in it with their action figures, why they even had one of Otho! Imagine that...Otho getting an action figure. (note to self Search on ebay for Otho action figure to go with my Mayor of Halloweentown plush).The cast is all wonderful, I already mentioned how great Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were along with Michael Keaton but it's time to mention the other wonderful cast members.Catharine O Hara (who also starred in SCTV, Canada's answer to SNL alongside my favorite comedian John Candy, as well as being in Home Alone, and the voice of the villainess in Bartok the Magnificent), Jeffrey Jones (who plays Delia's husband, and the year after this movie came out was in Who's Harry Crumb, one of my favorite John Candy movies), Winona Ryder as the lovely Lydia Deetz and of course the late great Glenn Shadix as Otho Fenlock.I love Shadix's performance in this and I know it's weird but I still tend to quote Otho's lines once and a while (I can actually do a sort of impression of him as well).The score is beautiful and also very spooky with my favorite piece being the theme tune as well as the Harry Belafonte songs Bananana Boat song and Jump In The Line (okay, I believe you!).Speaking of the theme tune, I heard it in an episode of the 2002 revival of the Basil Brush show, it was in the episode where Basil and Stephen become mad scientists.Providing you with laughs from here to the Neitherworld, Beetlejuice is sure to make you scream and laugh at the same time all at once.

Oh hold on, perhaps it's a black comedy, so we are not supposed to laugh?....hmmm....the back of the video case says hilarious storyFrankly, I wonder if this film really needed to be made. ;and if it had been decided that it was integral to the plot that the two male leads of the racial and physical types depicted, then the producers might have been better off with people more used to making comedies, like Eddie Murphy and Danny De Vito.The only scene that was at all well done was near the start when Jack Mooney's superior officer was chewing out for using the N-word. I've seen a similar scene in another film with Nick Nolte I think and it was done better there. The plot had several glaring continuity errors, some of which are already on this site. But here are some more all of which occur in the same 5 minute segment. When Jack Mooney nearly rejects Denzil Washinton's heart, Denzil is on the bed and suggests that they could play video games together. But surely not, as he would not be able to handle the controls, as earlier on in the film, Denzil revealed that he was unable to shut a door, as he could only touch Jack Mooney. Then when Jack Mooney discharges himself from hospital, he gets into a police car. Where on earth did the keys for that suddenly materialise from? And when the receptionist at the hospital makes a phone call, ALL the heart monitors she is supposed to be watching are either switched off or are flat lining. Early on in the film Jack Mooney is swigging from a bottle, which he has apparently just bought hence the bag it is in, but one swig later the bottle is 3\/4 empty. The 5 kilogram cat seemingly has what appears to be a lethal dose of whisk bourbon as well, but apparently without any ill effect.The plot, even once we accept the premise of a ghost coming back, is frankly unbelievable. Early on in the film we learn that Napoleon Stone, Denzil Washington's lawyer character has been killed just in case his hooker clients him told him anything - yet the hookers themselves are kept alive, seemingly with attempts only being made to kill them many months later, towards the end of the film. As for the final scene, the gunfight has to be one of the most unbelievable ever seen. It is somewhat unbelievable that the bad guys didn't seem to have a look out watching for his arrival and gun him down from the front windows as he walked towards the building. However Jack manages to enter the building without any opposition. He then decides that the ideal strategy is to use the wizard's Eye strategy send the ghost on ahead to scout the place out. A good idea surely. The ghost does this and reports a bad guy with a big gun waiting in the next room. So without further ado, avoids him and heads up the stairs....without getting the ghost to check the upstairs areas first. No matter, as none of the bad guys seem to be waiting for that possibility. By contrast, later on when a bad guy is coming cautiously up the stairs, Jack blows him away in an instant.Later on in the same gunfight, Jack is trying to escape with his girl, who is severely drugged and thus unable to walk unassisted. This causes problems as Jack Mooney is barely able to stand himself. The ghost is unable to help her, but it does not seem to occur to either him or Jack, that the solution is for Jack to lean on the ghost and thus for the ghost to take the weight in that way. This solution had already been used when Jack discharged himself from the hospital and was leaning on the ghost.Anyway despite Jack Mooney still suffering from his heart condition, being severely wounded in the chest during the early stages of the gunfight, and barely able to stand he is revealed as a supreme gunfighter and marksman. It seems that even the tear gas canister that he threw himself and then ran straight into the area of effect of, didn't have any adverse affect his stamina, eyesight or lightening quick reflexes as he killed all 5 of the baddies with just 5 shots including shots as he dived to the floor, span round to kill the guy behind him and fired one handed.Denzil Washington was right to fire his agent after this turkey.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 September 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Pump action comedy says the front of the video case. Yes, I get it, pump action as in shotguns (which the video case shows on the back cover) and heart beats - however anyone thinking it is going to be a comedy...i.e that they might laugh much, is going to be very disappointed. Oh hold on, perhaps it's a black comedy, so we are not supposed to laugh?....hmmm....the back of the video case says hilarious storyFrankly, I wonder if this film really needed to be made. ;and if it had been decided that it was integral to the plot that the two male leads of the racial and physical types depicted, then the producers might have been better off with people more used to making comedies, like Eddie Murphy and Danny De Vito.The only scene that was at all well done was near the start when Jack Mooney's superior officer was chewing out for using the N-word. I've seen a similar scene in another film with Nick Nolte I think and it was done better there. The plot had several glaring continuity errors, some of which are already on this site. But here are some more all of which occur in the same 5 minute segment. When Jack Mooney nearly rejects Denzil Washinton's heart, Denzil is on the bed and suggests that they could play video games together. But surely not, as he would not be able to handle the controls, as earlier on in the film, Denzil revealed that he was unable to shut a door, as he could only touch Jack Mooney. Then when Jack Mooney discharges himself from hospital, he gets into a police car. Where on earth did the keys for that suddenly materialise from? And when the receptionist at the hospital makes a phone call, ALL the heart monitors she is supposed to be watching are either switched off or are flat lining. Early on in the film Jack Mooney is swigging from a bottle, which he has apparently just bought hence the bag it is in, but one swig later the bottle is 3\/4 empty. The 5 kilogram cat seemingly has what appears to be a lethal dose of whisk bourbon as well, but apparently without any ill effect.The plot, even once we accept the premise of a ghost coming back, is frankly unbelievable. Early on in the film we learn that Napoleon Stone, Denzil Washington's lawyer character has been killed just in case his hooker clients him told him anything - yet the hookers themselves are kept alive, seemingly with attempts only being made to kill them many months later, towards the end of the film. As for the final scene, the gunfight has to be one of the most unbelievable ever seen. It is somewhat unbelievable that the bad guys didn't seem to have a look out watching for his arrival and gun him down from the front windows as he walked towards the building. However Jack manages to enter the building without any opposition. He then decides that the ideal strategy is to use the wizard's Eye strategy send the ghost on ahead to scout the place out. A good idea surely. The ghost does this and reports a bad guy with a big gun waiting in the next room. So without further ado, avoids him and heads up the stairs....without getting the ghost to check the upstairs areas first. No matter, as none of the bad guys seem to be waiting for that possibility. By contrast, later on when a bad guy is coming cautiously up the stairs, Jack blows him away in an instant.Later on in the same gunfight, Jack is trying to escape with his girl, who is severely drugged and thus unable to walk unassisted. This causes problems as Jack Mooney is barely able to stand himself. The ghost is unable to help her, but it does not seem to occur to either him or Jack, that the solution is for Jack to lean on the ghost and thus for the ghost to take the weight in that way. This solution had already been used when Jack discharged himself from the hospital and was leaning on the ghost.Anyway despite Jack Mooney still suffering from his heart condition, being severely wounded in the chest during the early stages of the gunfight, and barely able to stand he is revealed as a supreme gunfighter and marksman.

The deception in Chinatown related to a client's identity whereas in this case, it's hidden motives that lead to big problems for Jake. The subsequent investigations in both movies soon mushroom into something far larger than originally anticipated and eventually uncover serious corruption involving California's valuable resources.The similarities between the two plots are not untypical of what's normally seen where a successful movie is followed by a sequel, but in order to establish its own value convincingly, a sequel needs to provide something different or better than the original. In this case, something different is attempted as, due to the passage of time since the original film, Jake has evolved significantly as a character and his preoccupation with past events fills him with sadness and regret as well as a profound sense of loss.The events in The Two Jakes take place in Los Angeles in 1948. Eleven years have elapsed since Evelyn Mulwray was shot in Chinatown and Jake is now considerably more prosperous. His business has expanded and been relocated to an impressive new building and despite the often sleazy nature of his work, he's gained a certain degree of respectability as well as some extra weight.A property developer, who's convinced that his wife is having an affair, approaches Jake with what appears to be a routine job to gather evidence against her. Jake supplies the recording equipment and cameras to record what transpires when he and his client, Jake Berman (Harvey Keitel) go to the motel where Mrs Berman (Meg Tilly) is expected to be with her lover.On the night when their plan is put into action, Berman breaks into the motel room and on finding his wife with another man, simply shoots him dead. Jake is shocked to discover that the dead man is Berman's business partner and his wife, Lillian Bodine (Madeleine Stowe) thinks that what transpired was a planned murder. Furthermore, Lillian's attorney Chuck Newty (Frederic Forrest) tells Jake that it appears that he was an accessory to murder and that unless he can prove that Berman planned to kill his partner, he will see to it that Jake is sued and financially ruined in the process.Mysteriously, the recording made at the motel included a couple of mentions of Katherine Mulwray's name and Jake decides to find out their significance as well as pursuing his investigation into what lay behind the killing of Mark Bodine (John Hackett). He discovers that Berman and Bodine were involved in selling houses in a subdivision of the San Fernando Valley and that, in the event of Bodine's death, Berman and his wife would inherit the whole business. As it seemed possible that there may be oil deposits on the land, the business could, in fact, be more valuable than first realised and in that case, whoever held the mineral rights could potentially become very rich. Jake pursues the various strands of his investigation with limited success until he eventually finds the answers to all his questions from someone who, like him, is haunted by the past.An important prerequisite for fully understanding and enjoying The Two Jakes is an ability to recall the complicated plot of Chinatown and the names of its various characters. As this sequel was released 16 years after the original film, it's obvious that a high proportion of cinema-goers at that time would not have been able to appreciate it sufficiently to enjoy it themselves or to recommend it to their friends and consequently it's also not surprising that it wasn't a box office success.In a very empathetic performance which is both measured and subtle, Jack Nicholson conveys just how jaded, world weary and cynical Jake has become since his experiences in Chinatown and also how deeply he's haunted by the past. The remainder of the cast also contribute strong performances with Keitel, Stowe and Tilly being particularly good.The Two Jakes falls short of the brilliance of its classic predecessor but there's still much to commend it. Its story of adultery, greed, blackmail and murder is intriguing throughout and extremely well written. The inclusion of Peggy Lee's song Don't Smoke In Bed, some eye-catching art deco surroundings and Vilmos Zsigmond's stunning cinematography also contribute immensely to the wonderful atmosphere of the piece which seems to evoke late-1940s L.A. so convincingly. The only caveat, however, is to make sure to see Chinatown before watching this movie.

Whatever Jimmy Stewart sees in his neighborhood the audience sees because the movie makes us voyeurs just like he is. Most of the camera work and cinematography involves panning and tilting inside the neighborhood without ever entering any of the other apartments hence the theme of voyeurism. When its not looking outside it stays in the one apartment that Jimmy Stewart always stays in. In most movies this idea would be boring because not much would happen but with Hitchcock at the helm and great writing by both John Michael Hayes and Cornell Woolrich, you get a fantastic suspenseful film.Performance wise, everyones great all around.

Through the story he gets the help of his beautiful girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) and his nurse (played by Thelma Ritter) to solve the mystery.They don't call him Master of Suspense for nothing. Hitchcock takes his audience on a journey of voyeurism through a tiny neighborhood that was built on one set. Whatever Jimmy Stewart sees in his neighborhood the audience sees because the movie makes us voyeurs just like he is. Most of the camera work and cinematography involves panning and tilting inside the neighborhood without ever entering any of the other apartments hence the theme of voyeurism. When its not looking outside it stays in the one apartment that Jimmy Stewart always stays in. In most movies this idea would be boring because not much would happen but with Hitchcock at the helm and great writing by both John Michael Hayes and Cornell Woolrich, you get a fantastic suspenseful film.Performance wise, everyones great all around. Jimmy Stewart is great as Jefferies (the wheel chair bound photographer). Grace Kelly is great as Jefferies girlfriend who uses her intuition to help solve the mystery. Thelma Ritter is great as the down to earth nurse and Raymond Burr is great as the mysterious neighbor Thorwald.For a movie thats nearly 60 years old it has that timeless quality to it making it all the more better as a classic and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. 10 out of 10 stars.

As soon as Karl Childers, the central character played by Billy Bob Thornton, starts talking, we know we're unto something new, original and unique.We meet Karl on the day he leaves a mental hospital; he doesn't talk first, forcing himself to listen to one of the inmate's disgusting anecdotes while he stares at the widow. His turn to speak comes when he describes to a young interviewer how he killed his mother and her lover with a Kaiser blade (some call it a sling blade). He was a child then and spent a long period trying to socially readjusting himself, mostly through reading Bible, not that he understands a great deal of it, but enough to reckon that people shouldn't kill each other. He talks in the dark, uninterrupted, striking by his raspy voice, colossal jaw and strange rubbing-hands habit highlighting a social unease. His words are punctuated by a weird sound, a Mm-hmm growl. Karl easily reminds of Forrest Gump, another mentally challenged character with specific mimics and mannerisms, but he never feels like an imitation, he IS an original and quite memorable creation.And after ten minutes, positive expectations started to invade my thoughts, a movie opening with such an original character and gripping monologue could only lead to cinematic greatness and nothing in the film ever belied my expectations. Thornton didn't just tell a story, he delivered a performance of hypnotic weirdness, enjoyable on a primary level. I loved watching the film again, just to see Karl ordering French fries in a burger restaurant I reckon I likes me some French fried potaters, mm-hmm. Some people would call it a 'guilty pleasure', it is but it never distracts from the core of the film, which starts with the rediscovery of freedom by a man of limited intelligence and ends with a poignant sacrifice. In between, Sling Blade takes us in a small word of bleak simplicity, nothing much happens, people mind their own business, work to pay the bills, and even a man like Karl can find his place if he has, for instance, a certain ability to fix lawnmowers and whatnot.There's a very smoothly handled straightforwardness in Thornton's script, allowing each important character to touch us directly as if it was an old acquaintance. Karl befriends a little boy named Frank and their fondness is as mutual as immediate. It's the kind of genuine friendships that don't need long set-ups, Frank simply 'loves the way Karl talks', and which child wouldn't? He asks his mother if Karl can live in the garage, she accepts. It feels realistic precisely because Linda is the kind of woman who sees good in everyone, and proves it through her boyfriend, an abusive loser played by Dwight Yoakam, and as others mentioned, the second best performance in the film, Oscar-worthy in every level. Doyle is the kind of wannabe rock-star who never got his break and vents his angry frustration on Frank by pretending to be a fatherly figure on the authority department. Otherwise, he spends most of his time lounging on the sofa, drinking beer, bullying Frank and challenging Linda's patience... he doesn't fool anyone.And within this world, Karl acts as a quiet observant. His passiveness mirrors the attitude of the fifth important character in the film, Linda's friend Vaughan, a homosexual forced to live in the town for easily guessable reasons. As a potential victim of intolerance, Vaughan is able to read through Karl's deadpan expression the hints of some inconsolable wounds, and no matter how tough they were, they certainly built an inner goodness in his heart. But Vaughan isn't a guy guy and can't fight a man like Doyle, but Karl can help him to take care of Linda and Frank, both would be like guardian angels. John Ritter delivers a magnificent performance in all nuance and subtlety as a man with great humanistic intuition. And indeed, the storyline concurs with Vaughan and we get more insights about Karl's tormented childhood. Karl is a man of good heart who learned to find the good in anyone because he could see the evil in some, including himself.The ensemble cast is so perfect that it's a wonder that the film didn't get more recognition. Yet the pillar of Sling Blade is Billy Bob Thornton. He doesn't perform acting, he's literally inhabited by the painful soul of Karl Childers, and he's so absorbing that we're always in the same wavelength. In one of the film's most significant moments, there is a violent argument between Doyle, Linda and Frank while Karl, almost comically, sits there and doesn't move. But look closely at his eyes, his mimics, his reactions when each object thrown by Frank hits Doyle or the wall. Karl is obviously disturbed as if he was witnessing the reminiscence of painful memories. And somewhat he looks determined to accomplish an act of existential gravity, something foreshadowed by the powerful moment when he grabs Doyle's arm and warns him to never lay a finger on little Frank. This very moment starts the countdown of Karl's freedom days.Although predictable, the conclusion doesn't diminish the film's emotional impact. Karl's actions are less eloquent than the last exchanges he had with each protagonist (including Doyle). They all say Karl! and keep silent while he leaves as if they resigned to a deadly omen. The film ends as it started, as if nothing changed. Karl sits in the same place, with the same expression; but this time, he refuses to listen to the pervert inmate and tells him straight in the eyes. Although he played a one-note character, Karl did change and for best. Once in his life, he did well by preventing a little child to endure the same hellish childhood. And I can't see but satisfaction in his eyes in the final, haunting shot.

They learn that she's a writer and the murder coincidentally occurs in her recent novel. Nick starts to get involved with Catherine and begins questioning her motives when she plans on using him as a character in her next book. Tripplehorn plays Nick's ex-girlfriend, Beth Garner who is a psychiatrist and Sarelle plays Catherine's friend and lover, Roxy. Michael and Sharon have great chemistry and Jerry Goldsmith's score is excellent as usual. I recommend this good, seductive thriller featuring Stone's famous leg-crossing scene.

Was so impressed by the realism that afterward I wrote to a friend It makes Star Wars look like a Porky Pig cartoon! But seriously, the U-boats were a major danger to allied shipping, and American and British sailors cursed at them. Das Boot shows the German side of the story with the crewmen cursing in German (with English subtitles) at the destroyers overhead. The German sailors were shown as regular people bravely doing their best in very difficult situations, not as mindless, fanatical Nazis like a cheesy American film might portray them. The cinematography was excellent, really made me feel like was in sub with them. Thankfully it wasn't in smellovision.

Despite a wonderful cast, the writing certainly does this ridiculous film in. Chemist Cary Grant is married to economics major Ginger Rogers.While experimenting with a formula, Grant takes some of it and the supposed hilarity begins. Ditto for Rogers taking it as well and the couple revert to silliness, talking about past men and ladies they knew and all other sorts of nonsense.The best part is probably where Grant, under the influence of the chemical, takes Charles Coburn's secretary for a whirlwind ride. It was said that both director Howard Hawkes and Grant saw no talent in Monroe. Of course they didn't. There was no picture here to speak of.The ending sequence with the baby is even more ridiculous and the only part that was also good was when The End appeared on the screen. Hopeless.
