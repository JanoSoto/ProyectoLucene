The movie is actually quite different from what you might expect. It's a strong drama that gives an insight view of the Hollywood business behind the camera's.Movie buffs will be surely able to recognize some situations, characters and movies feature within this movie. A lot of this movie seems to be based on actual persons and events, although it of course gets all so mixed in with each other a lot, so it all still works out as original as it can get.It besides gives us a great inside view of how movie-making in the '40's\/'50's was done. The movie can be seen as one that goes behind the scenes, that shows how actors, producers, writer, directors and studio bosses all interact and quarrel with each other and how eventually a movie gets established.But what foremost makes The Bad and the Beautiful such a fine and original movie is its story-telling. Basically the movie has 4 different story-lines, which each featuring a different character. What they all have in common is that they once got cheated on by movie producer Jonathan Shields, played by Kirk Douglas. The stories are being told in flashback mode and in between it cuts to the 'present' time, in which the three cheated on persons are being asked to revive the career of the tough Jonathan Shields. So you could say that this movie is four for the price of one! Each storyline is one on its own, featuring new events and characters. Nevertheless the movie never starts to feel messy or overfilled. This is of course due to the presence of the Kirk Douglas character but also really thanks to its well balanced writing.The movie also won an Oscar for its screenplay. It won four more Oscar's and it also was nominated for another one. Strangely enough the movie did not receive a nomination in the best picture of best director category. It's the movie that still holds the record for most Academy Awards won by a film not nominated for best picture.The movie is really being carried by Kirk Douglas, who gives away a fine performance. In all fairness, he is a guy that mostly has done some great stuff in the '50's and early '60's, which however just weren't exactly the 'golden age' of cinema. After that he hasn't starred in any real memorable movies and he now days is better known as the father of the successful actor Michael Douglas (although his career is also already declining in these recent years). So he himself never have really been a that great star, which I think has more to do with the fact that he began rather late with acting in movies. Had he begun his career in the '30's and early '40's, he would had played surely much more great roles during his career and he himself would be better known and appreciated as an actor now days. In this movie he might very well play the best role out of his career. He plays a tough and rotten character but at the same time with a real charming touch to it.Also the other actors within this movie know to impress. The movie has a great cast, with Lana Turner, Walter Pidgeon and Dick Powell, among others. But in my opinion also a lot of credit need to go to director Vincente Minnelli for the acting performances within this movie.The movie feels old fashioned and modern at the same time. It's a movie that is mostly done in '40's style and this is also probably the reason why it got shot in black & white. It on the other hand is also really modern with its story, which must also had been quite daring for its time. What happens behind the scenes stays behind the scenes, would had most likely been the general thought of Hollywood at the time. This movie simply ignores this and gives an original and nice look from the other side of the cameras.A great movie, worth watching!8\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For a movie with such a lame and sappy title, this is surely a great one.

In fact I'd say I enjoyed it even more than I did when I first saw it, now that I've viewed a huge amount of Eighties horror of every conceivable variation of quality. Also, I've seen far more zombie films now and this stands out in my opinion as one of the all time classics. The problem for any humorous zombie film, and indeed horror comedy in general is that the balance of scares and laughs is a tricky thing indeed and can often lead to a film coming across simply stupid, or muddled or just plain weak. Zombies in particular are not the best subject for humour because the idea of the deceased emerging, rotten and gnarly from the ground to feast upon the living is far more disturbing than comical. Also, killing zombies is, if you think about it not that good a source of humour because it is basically just the slaughter of people who are still human but through no fault of their own are now grisly fiends. Return of the Living Dead scores by having the zombie menace and the various attacks played frightening and having the humour arise from the characters and their reactions. Rather than just trying to be funny like say, the OK but grossly overrated Shaun of the Dead, Return of the Living Dead draws humour from deadpan absurdism, whilst never neglecting the nightmarish aspect of the situation. The performances help make this film great and a number deserve mention. Thom Matthews and James Karen are convincing in their terror and sympathetic in their plight as the luckless souls who unleash the dead raising chemical and their part in the film is rounded out by Clu Gallagher as Karen's boss and Don Calfa as a weird morgue owner. The partying youngsters who unwisely choose a graveyard to party in are all pretty ace, with Linnea Quigley standing out (and getting naked) in perhaps her best known role as the wild, death obsessed Trash. Mark Venturini also stands out as the foul mouthed but thoughtful punk, Suicide. I was a little surprised by the relatively minor gore, but then more grue would have probably tipped this into splatter comedy territory and a lot of those films offer mere spectacle as opposed to actual humour. Anyways, with the great writing, a lack of gore really doesn't matter too much. From reading these boards there are clearly a few people who hate this film, but I would highly recommend it. It is neither sick or tasteless, not if you enjoy dark humour or Eighties cult films and it certainly can't be described as merely childish for it actually has a lot of wit, pathos and cool ideas. Altogether, one of the greatest horror comedy picture of all time and a wondrous experience that I cannot recommend enough.

After I finished watching the movie I was not in the least bit entertained, in fact numerous times I found myself peeping at my watch and pausing the DVD to get something to eat. The main problem with The Relic is it fails to really captivate the audience; the people I watched it with really were not focusing the least bit, even when the creature was rampaging around killing people in rather surprising ways.Now The Relic essentially concerns a strange monster that has appeared in the Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The creature then roams around the premise after night killing people and eating their brains (in particular there pituitary glands and their hypothalamus). Initially the museum staff and the local police force assume the creature originated from crates in South America that contained some unusual fungus loaded with animal hormones. What happens is anything that eats the fungus receives massive doses of the hormones, and it rebounds along the evolutionary tree and creates a monster, which is what we see in the movie. Sounds good- but be surprised, the film contains no elements that even make a creature feature worthy of viewing, just for fun.The flaws of the film begin with the science. What I have noticed that is becoming more and more common in movies, is for film makers to attempt to make a rather unintelligent film seem smart; by loading it with scientific terms and theories. Most people will actually sit back and admire this, as is science lover I simply can't. Now we are lead to believe that overdoses of hormones generate changes in an organism. Sounds OK but no it's actually quite flawed. First of all the film claims through the plot that ingesting large amounts of hormones can physically change a persons DNA, and turn them into another creature, this could not be further from the truth. For example; say if a creature like a human drinks some dog hormones; he\\she will feel quite sick but will not mutate in anyway into a dog, no matter after how long. This is because at a cellular level the human lacks mechanisms to respond to it. This not so obvious flaw makes the film to me, seem really unintelligent. All right enough with the science.Now the science is really not the biggest problem, the film also suffers from quite bad CGI. Now one thing that bugs me with horror movies is; computer generated monsters. The problem with this is CGI often in these cases is poor, and it often distracts from any horror the director is trying to express. Think Jaws and Alien they had no CGI (yes I know it was not available at the time, but this is still a valid point) yet they were scary. You know why? Because everything happened on the set when they were filming, hence the actors could respond to the creature, and the creatures looked farm more real then CGI counterparts of a modern day era in film-making. Like most modern day horror films The Relic fits this new age perspective, for the worst. What we are left with an un-scary creature that looks laughable.Perhaps the most striking flaw of The Relic is its non-coherent structure. The film lacks a distinct narrative ark, this makes the film seem awkward and uncoordinated to watch. The film starts of well all the important characters are introduced adequately, and so is the creature. But suddenly, almost randomly the creature appears in mass about say an hour in and the conclusion happens. The flaw is the fact that it really lacks the suspense to build up to the finale. This assists the film in really achieving nothing more than annoying viewers, especially very critical individuals. After all perhaps the easiest way to make a film flow and seem authentic is to have this narrative ark. A film which has the negative ark enables the audience to look forward to a conclusion of the film, and not as I have said before become frustrated and bored.One final striking flaw of The Relic is the creature design. The creature looks rather awful. It seems as if someone just cut pictures out of National Geographic, glued them together and computerized it. Now the creature appears to be a large lizard, with a horses mane down its back, claws from a bird and finally a face that looks distinctly similar to a Predator (from the Predator franchise) and to top it of; an extendable snake tongue. Yikes, yeah that's pretty creative isn't it; gluing some animals together and attempting to pass it off as a visual treat.Overall The Relic will definitely go down in history literally as a relic, and not as a good film, nor a good creature-feature. Poor creature design, and incoherent story disguised by poor science make the film fail on many levels with the only slightly redeemable characteristic being the occasionally striking deaths and gore- if that fancy's your taste. The Relic scores a 2.9\/10 in my books. While the film does posses some gore, it never becomes overly disturbing so any children 13 and over should be fine viewing it.

But suddenly, almost randomly the creature appears in mass about say an hour in and the conclusion happens. The flaw is the fact that it really lacks the suspense to build up to the finale. This assists the film in really achieving nothing more than annoying viewers, especially very critical individuals. After all perhaps the easiest way to make a film flow and seem authentic is to have this narrative ark. A film which has the negative ark enables the audience to look forward to a conclusion of the film, and not as I have said before become frustrated and bored.One final striking flaw of The Relic is the creature design. The creature looks rather awful. It seems as if someone just cut pictures out of National Geographic, glued them together and computerized it. Now the creature appears to be a large lizard, with a horses mane down its back, claws from a bird and finally a face that looks distinctly similar to a Predator (from the Predator franchise) and to top it of; an extendable snake tongue. Yikes, yeah that's pretty creative isn't it; gluing some animals together and attempting to pass it off as a visual treat.Overall The Relic will definitely go down in history literally as a relic, and not as a good film, nor a good creature-feature. Poor creature design, and incoherent story disguised by poor science make the film fail on many levels with the only slightly redeemable characteristic being the occasionally striking deaths and gore- if that fancy's your taste. The Relic scores a 2.9\/10 in my books. While the film does posses some gore, it never becomes overly disturbing so any children 13 and over should be fine viewing it.

The whole film is peppered with propaganda newsreels, telling everyone how wonderful military service is. It certainly sets the nationalist mood.There are also a few plot holes. For example, the Arachnids live in a system on the other side of the Milky Way, and fire asteroids at Earth. That's about 30,000 parsecs away. Which means that the asteroids would take several million years to reach Earth. So how does that work? Have the bugs been firing asteroids at Earth for the past 20,000,000 years (so we've got another 20,000,000 years of bombardment to look forward to), or do the Arachnids fire the asteroids through a wormhole or something? It's never explained.So, 'Starship Troopers' is crap, plain and simple. But it's such wonderful crap. It's an enjoyable romp that won't challenge you in any way. So if you're after a deep, thought-provoking film, look elsewhere. However, if you're still in touch with your inner 14-year-old, or if you are a 14-year-old, it's a blast.

Remember the 'worst toilet in Scotland' scene in Trainspotting? The Acid House sees its characters pretty much inhabit locations akin to this one 80% of the time and the characters get up to all sorts of equally repulsive activities like unknowingly eating food covered with essence of dog faeces and being buggered by a woman complete with strap on. But Trainspotting wasn't all gross out and allowed us outside into public parks and streets; it allowed us daylight and, to a degree, relief from its content. The Acid House grants us outdoor scenes but has the characters spinning round uncontrollably and presents a lot of its shots in close up format complete with odd angles and fast edits - you could be forgiven for feeling sick.The Acid House was penned by Trainspotting writer Irvin Welsh and follows a similarly dank and downbeat style of storytelling and setting. This time the film is split up into three shorts rather than one continuous narrative alá Trainspotting which some others might tell you felt like two stories given the path involving the drug deal the film decides to go down right nearer the end. Visually, The Acid House is very similar to Trainspotting but it also blurs the boundary between realism and surrealism in the same fashion Trainspotting did. If there's one thing I enjoyed Trainspotting for, it was the use of the everyday; of the mundane in locales and dialogue as people spouted Sean Connery trivia and made reference to famous goals in World Cups gone by.But Trainspotting also incorporated a fair amount of surrealism or of the impossible in real life. The Acid House adopts this combined approach and Welsh often uses drugs as a catalyst once again to get across the odd content. A lot of the ambiguity is missing in The Acid House; whereas when Renton went down the toilet and came home soaking wet, there's no obvious link that he literally went down the toilet in order to get wet whereas when the character of Coco (Bremner) is struck by lightening, he has transformed into someone else's body and that's a clear cut reason for the story to even happen. It's not so much a criticism as it is a perspective; the ambiguity worked well in Trainspotting and added to the overall tone of the humour whereas The Acid House crosses the line and tells us that this sort of thing is possible in the film's universe. I have to say that I preffered it when it was ambiguous.The Acid House's first story provides good ammunition for Claire Monk's theory about the British male in crisis in the 1990s. Boab (McCole) is a young, British male whose life systematically falls apart within an hour or so &#150; he is a man in crisis. He is humiliated and dumped by his partner down the phone for being unable to 'satisfy' her thus rendered inadequate and unfit to adopt the role of a male partner in a relationship. He also looses his job thus becoming unemployed, another ingredient to Monk's theory to do with a male 'panic' in contemporary British cinema. But a meeting with God (Roëves) in a pub, again giving the film a clear cut surrealistic feel rather than ambiguously so, sees him changed into a fly to wreck revenge. This seems to have sparked some controversy given it presents 'God' in a less than flattering manner and has him swear a lot. But more so from my perspective, God is a character that gives certain individuals the powers to maim and harm, something Boab takes full advantage of. The first story whilst beginning interestingly, minutely fails dramatically with its close ups of half eaten food, dog excrement and fat, sweaty men being penetrated with a dildo in their living room. The second story is easier to identify with in the sense there is a clear source for antagonism and its lead character is put in a position we may feel sorry for. Johnny (McKidd) gets a new neighbour in Larry (McCormack) who doesn't take long to become the crazed individual we sense upon the first meeting. The story is more realistic in the sense it focuses on a lower class part of society as they live in cramped and downbeat living conditions with frequent long shots of other buildings and people looking out of their windows as one. The situation and the manner in which it plays out with people at stake and a distressed baby making itself known at certain times keeps the story routed and somewhat humbling.The third story is the most outlandish and sees football obsessed Coco struck by lightening thus switching mindsets with an unborn baby. The idea is interesting in the sense it's an adult in a baby's body and vice-versa. But the scenario is played for laughs disappointingly so; Coco can't wait for the next breast feeding session and watches his newly adopted parents go at it in the bedroom with perverted glee. The Freudian elements begin to crop up here to do with a babies mapping on and attraction to its mother but it's a little weak. On the flipside, the film takes a good actor like Bremner and has him lie in a bed screaming for most of the time.

At some point after this interaction, the samurai is dead and his body is found by a woodcutter passing through. Of this much we can be sure. The bandit is arrested for the murder but, at the trial, he, the wife and the spirit of the dead man (via a medium) tell different version of events.Rashômon is the subject of my favourite Simpsons' joke and is also one of those films that it is polite to mention in conversation when discussing anything that uses different points of view on events as the basis for its narrative &#150; whether it be Hero, Boomtown, Vantage Point or whatever. So, with these things in mind I thought I should probably at least watch it for myself. Having watched a few longer films from Kurosawa, I was surprised to find this so short and brisk but I suppose this comes from the fact that there is not a lot of material within the film. As others have said, the scenario is the same with each telling and effectively the film is nothing more than several different ways of events playing out to the same outcome. Then it is over and you never really know the truth. I can understand why those unwilling to get into the film, just dismiss it. It is dull I suppose by some standards and the ending is open in regards the events that had gone before and also seems to come from nowhere (not unlike the baby, which is a rather lazy device in my opinion).These are flaws within the film perhaps and I do recognise that the film is not perfect &#150; in particular with the conclusion to the film &#150; Kurosawa may be highly regarded but he is not free from criticism. What the film does do very well is to tell the versions of events in a way that is true to the character and in a way that tells us a lot about the characters. Some have had the lack of shame to come on this site complaining that it is the same story again and again but they are missing the point badly. Each twist on the truth is done for personal reasons, whether they be major changes or just minor embellishments. It is a tad disappointing that the differences are so extreme though and I would have liked to see events a lot tighter but with just as telling, but more subtle differences. It still works though and it does provide some material for thought about the nature of truth and how hard it is to get to one version of any event that can be agreed on.The cast do well to vary their characters between the telling to reflect how they are presented in the version that suits the teller of the tale. The three main actors of Mifune, Kyô and Mori work well together &#150; with Mifune and Kyô in particular delivering the most as their material allows. The framing scenes with the woodcutter etc are also good and I think the only weaknesses with their performances come from how they have to present this story as the worst thing ever, which is not an impression I ever shared. For the court scenes we are added Honman as a medium; she throws herself into the performance and it is only a shame that I struggle to buy her character as a narrative device in the first place. The direction is low-key but still impressive &#150; mainly due to shooting in heavy rain, and in the woods &#150; neither appear affected by the challenges as the lighting and shot framing is always excellent.Rashômon will disappoint people because almost everyone will have been told what a classic it is and will expect to be blown away second by second.

At some point after this interaction, the samurai is dead and his body is found by a woodcutter passing through. Of this much we can be sure. The bandit is arrested for the murder but, at the trial, he, the wife and the spirit of the dead man (via a medium) tell different version of events.Rashômon is the subject of my favourite Simpsons' joke and is also one of those films that it is polite to mention in conversation when discussing anything that uses different points of view on events as the basis for its narrative &#150; whether it be Hero, Boomtown, Vantage Point or whatever. So, with these things in mind I thought I should probably at least watch it for myself. Having watched a few longer films from Kurosawa, I was surprised to find this so short and brisk but I suppose this comes from the fact that there is not a lot of material within the film. As others have said, the scenario is the same with each telling and effectively the film is nothing more than several different ways of events playing out to the same outcome. Then it is over and you never really know the truth. I can understand why those unwilling to get into the film, just dismiss it. It is dull I suppose by some standards and the ending is open in regards the events that had gone before and also seems to come from nowhere (not unlike the baby, which is a rather lazy device in my opinion).These are flaws within the film perhaps and I do recognise that the film is not perfect &#150; in particular with the conclusion to the film &#150; Kurosawa may be highly regarded but he is not free from criticism. What the film does do very well is to tell the versions of events in a way that is true to the character and in a way that tells us a lot about the characters. Some have had the lack of shame to come on this site complaining that it is the same story again and again but they are missing the point badly. Each twist on the truth is done for personal reasons, whether they be major changes or just minor embellishments. It is a tad disappointing that the differences are so extreme though and I would have liked to see events a lot tighter but with just as telling, but more subtle differences. It still works though and it does provide some material for thought about the nature of truth and how hard it is to get to one version of any event that can be agreed on.The cast do well to vary their characters between the telling to reflect how they are presented in the version that suits the teller of the tale. The three main actors of Mifune, Kyô and Mori work well together &#150; with Mifune and Kyô in particular delivering the most as their material allows. The framing scenes with the woodcutter etc are also good and I think the only weaknesses with their performances come from how they have to present this story as the worst thing ever, which is not an impression I ever shared. For the court scenes we are added Honman as a medium; she throws herself into the performance and it is only a shame that I struggle to buy her character as a narrative device in the first place. The direction is low-key but still impressive &#150; mainly due to shooting in heavy rain, and in the woods &#150; neither appear affected by the challenges as the lighting and shot framing is always excellent.Rashômon will disappoint people because almost everyone will have been told what a classic it is and will expect to be blown away second by second.

However it is still a well constructed, interesting and thought-provoking piece that is punchy and engaging with strong performances and direction.

These are some of the movie's finer qualities. If you didn't like the main duo to begin with then this will do nothing to convince you otherwise. But why should it?Mike Judge has managed to fill out the 75 or so minutes well without making it drag, and he's done it with style. Since he cannot change the simplistic, constantly sniggering leads he has done the most logical thing he could by surrounding them with a plethora of multi-faceted characters tied together with a conspiracy plot that takes them into other locations where their simple-but-effective double-entendre humour can flourish. Previous characters make a return and are given some development where relevant to the plot.It all starts inauspiciously enough - the hard rock obsessed teenagers awake one day, still on their couch, to find their beloved television is missing. Not smart enough to put the pieces of the puzzle together to catch the thieves in the act, they try and steal one from their school. Wandering around town ever more desperate, they somehow manage to usurp the television thieves, but not in the way you might expect. This lands them right in the thick of it, and the unassuming pair make their way through. Hilarity ensues on a regular basis.In my opinion as a would-be critic, we need more films like these. Certainly there are plenty of gross-out movies, some of them also animated (as a side note the animation here is a nice balance between the original show and something more polished) but there are few that can take simple toilet humour and dress it up so well, making it more than just a guilty pleasure to enjoy after a few beers and\/or a joint. This is right up there with the finer moments of South Park for such an achievement, and can easily be considered Beavis and Butt-Head's crowning moment of funny and\/or awesome.Overall this is a fun, feelgood comedy which doesn't require all your brainpower to enjoy to the fullest, though an extra watch or two might throw up a few sight gags or subplot references that you missed the first time around for whatever reason(!) The plot seems somehow relevant too, considering that it also deals with an issue that has been a headline grabber in post-9\/11 society. But not without a couple of sniggers along the way, of course.7 stars out of 10 very, very good.

The president's daughter has joined in with a criminal from LA, which is somehow an island now and a maximum security prison just like New York.

Add to that the fact other countries wish to invade the US and are using what the president's daughter has to try and make their plans work. What does she have you ask? Some sort of device that controls satellites that can cut power off to all machines and such. It can do this to any region or even the entire earth. Well once again Snake has been captured and once again he is duped into going into LA and retrieving the data, but not the president's daughter. So off he goes with a cool new outfit and some nice weapons and gadgets and just like the first one things almost immediately. He gets caught a couple of times in this movie, once by a strange bunch of people addicted to plastic surgery. He also has to play a deadly game of basketball and fly off with his allies in a strange helicopter. Hell, there is even a crazy surfboard scene with Peter Fonda. The movie is a bit goofy compared to New York, but I rather like the over the top way this movie is done. The effects are hit and miss, the actors are hit and miss and so is the action, but overall I think this movie is rather cool. Of course, I may think that only because Snake is back.

By the time the film had reached the finale of its 67 minute runtime, I was ready for it to carry on and keep on going giving us more and more. Alas, what happens next on the train journey away from it all is never revealed but isn't that the sign of greatness when a director can leave the audience wanting more even when they've rounded the film off in a satisfactory manner anyway? Over the coming decades, Kubrick would go on to cover a range of genres such as war, comedy, horror, science fiction and so forth, all with tremendous results, but this seems to be his only divulge into noir and it goes without saying that it is a damn shame. In true noir fashion, Killer's Kiss begins in the present and goes back into the past as an anxious and somewhat lonely man regresses on what's happened. Needless to say it isn't good, it usually isn't in the genre of noir. The man is Davy Gordon (Smith), not a disgruntled P.I. or someone else connected to anything legal or illegal whom teeters on both sides of the law but a boxer, plain a simple, perhaps a boxer due to Kubrick's 1951 short Day of the Fight given its boxing content.Following Davy's fight, he is awoken in the middle of the night by Gloria Price's (Kane) screaming and it turns out she's having a bit of trouble with her employer Vincent Rapallo (Silvera) who is helplessly in love with her as it is and thus, the obsession inspired behaviour does not bode well with a woman unafraid to use her voice and loose enough as it is anyway. Naturally, Davy gets involved but ultimately it won't be for the good. The film carries a fair amount of chemistry between the two leads and the scenes they share work to a degree but Kubrick would never become one of those sorts of directors and it's no surprise that the graphic content and element of antagonism are the key things here. There is a feeling of power struggle between two sides and we get a feeling there's something at stake once Davy has meddled with the affairs of criminal boss Vincent.What follows is the alleyway killing of a certain character by hoods employed by Vincent and you do get the feeling that although he isn't allowed, Kubrick really wants to show us the beating to add to the danger these gangsters pose as well as well before that the expression of love between both Davy and Gloria. But he can't due to the censorship rules although it doesn't detract from the film's quality &#150; later on, Kubrick would confront global fears such as nuclear war and make a black comedy out of it and with A Clockwork Orange, he would pull the film from cinemas himself due to all the content many people were unhappy with; examples of taboo subjects and lack of compassion towards censorship that were trying or wanting to break out in Killer's Kiss.The film continues down its unpredictable route of noir and crime, using bizarre street locations full of towering chimney's and bizarre desolate buildings as the finale nears. The location work echoes A Clockwork Orange, for example the opening underpass\/tramp beating scene as well as the great use of the grand hotel in The Shining as a close and claustrophobic area, almost threatening in its presentation. But what follows the scenes of chase in this film is a finale fight that should be mentioned within the same breath as the hall of mirrors fight in Welles' The Lady From Shanghai, itself a noir from a legendary director. That is when the final fight occurs in a mannequin doll factory. As the fight goes on, the dolls become increasingly eerie; the audience almost distracted by them as they watch on in a human-like manner.

But he can't due to the censorship rules although it doesn't detract from the film's quality &#150; later on, Kubrick would confront global fears such as nuclear war and make a black comedy out of it and with A Clockwork Orange, he would pull the film from cinemas himself due to all the content many people were unhappy with; examples of taboo subjects and lack of compassion towards censorship that were trying or wanting to break out in Killer's Kiss.The film continues down its unpredictable route of noir and crime, using bizarre street locations full of towering chimney's and bizarre desolate buildings as the finale nears. The location work echoes A Clockwork Orange, for example the opening underpass\/tramp beating scene as well as the great use of the grand hotel in The Shining as a close and claustrophobic area, almost threatening in its presentation. But what follows the scenes of chase in this film is a finale fight that should be mentioned within the same breath as the hall of mirrors fight in Welles' The Lady From Shanghai, itself a noir from a legendary director. That is when the final fight occurs in a mannequin doll factory. As the fight goes on, the dolls become increasingly eerie; the audience almost distracted by them as they watch on in a human-like manner. Killer's Kiss is a fascinating and really nicely unfolded film that ranks up with some of Kubrick's best in my opinion and should be seen by as many of his fans as possible.

Either way, it's not as good as the original film, but I'm sorry to say that this is better than the average Steven Seagal movie.Seagal is right on the money for most of the movie, except for any part where he's trying to be a good uncle and have a normal relationship with his niece, played by Katherine Heigl. No matter how much I love him, Seagal absolutely can not be a normal guy, and he can NOT do romance. Holy crap, I saw him do a sex scene in one of his movies, I can't remember which one, but it was like watching a beautiful woman in bed with a rhinoceros.Seagal reprises his role of Casey Ryback, now retired from the Navy and working as a chef at the charmingly named Mile High Café in Denver, Colorado. He has long since lost contact with his brother, but now that he has been tragically killed, Casey wants to come back into his niece Sarah's life. Sarah is unimpressed with his long absence, and they do not start their vacation off on a good note.As they are traveling by train from Denver to Los Angeles, a madman named Travis Dane (a clownish performance by Eric Bogosian) takes control of the train and uses it as his control center for a wild plan to take control of a top-secret government outer-space super- weapon.OK, so get this. Some Middle Eastern terrorists offer him $1 billion to destroy not New York City, not the White House, but nothing less than the entire eastern seaboard! Now THIS is a bad guy! Say what you will about the rest of the movie, but the plot has all of the villainous ambitiousness of a 1980s 007 film. Dane takes it all in stride, though, even agreeing (for an extra $100 million) to use the satellite to destroy a passenger jet in mid-flight to get rid of one particular man's hated ex-wife. Personally I'm willing to bet that they could have found some crackhead to off the poor wife for like, you know, maybe $20 million (or another of his henchmen to just do it for free), but no matter, we get the point of that little addendum to the deal. The accuracy on this thing is astonishing.Early in the film, soon after taking over control of the satellite (which he is able to do because, of course, he designed it but was fired by the government before it was deployed), he demonstrates his control by destroying an alleged chemical weapons plant in China.

It's not an obscure place!OK, so we certainly know by now what to expect from a Steven Seagal movie, so I had no problem with the outlandish villain and his nutty scheme.

What I found was a film that stays so focused on the principles of Disney live-action films of the time that it manages to summon up nostalgia even in those who did not specifically see this film. This is evident across the film as we have children more able than the adults around them, who have powers\/gifts\/knowledge that adults do not, love animals and get into wonderful adventures which involve danger but never a serious threat. The specifics are not that important but the plot is quite good as it allows the characters to have mini-episodes across the film.Being over 30 years old, it is no surprise that the film is dated in terms of looks, presentation, effects and content but those with a nostalgia for a period when kids films didn't have to come preloaded with cynicism and sassy kids will easily forgive this. For the majority of us though it will still feel limited by how dated it is, while at the same time providing a sort of cheesy entertainment value that comes from old-school pleasures.

Obviously catching onto this scheme, Tia and Tony flee their new guardians and run away, with only a secret map a clue as to their home and destination.Ahead of a remake next year, I watched this old-school Disney film recently, interested to see what I would make of it without having the memories of seeing it as a child (nostalgia being a common thread among those reviews that seem to love the film). What I found was a film that stays so focused on the principles of Disney live-action films of the time that it manages to summon up nostalgia even in those who did not specifically see this film. This is evident across the film as we have children more able than the adults around them, who have powers\/gifts\/knowledge that adults do not, love animals and get into wonderful adventures which involve danger but never a serious threat. The specifics are not that important but the plot is quite good as it allows the characters to have mini-episodes across the film.Being over 30 years old, it is no surprise that the film is dated in terms of looks, presentation, effects and content but those with a nostalgia for a period when kids films didn't have to come preloaded with cynicism and sassy kids will easily forgive this. For the majority of us though it will still feel limited by how dated it is, while at the same time providing a sort of cheesy entertainment value that comes from old-school pleasures. That said, it still a pretty wooden affair, with the child actors not having a mean bone in their body but plenty of acting and clunky explanatory dialogue to work with. I understand why Eisenmann and Richards are sort of cult figures off the back of this but they are pretty wooden and without a lot of character to speak of. They do the job but their basic turns are part of dating the film. I was a bit disappointed by Pleasance as I was looking for more in the way of menace from him, although Milland got the mix of comedy bumbling and being a baddie just right for this type of vehicle. Albert is good and works well with the two kids.The effects are also dated &#150; but in terms of what was possible but also (sort of connected) what was thought up to be done and how quite innocent it all was. So we get spinning coats, a friendly bear, flying flour bags, dancing puppets etc, all of which are of course quite cheap in terms of modern effects but at the same time are refreshingly free of menace or ill-will. Essentially the same can be said about the whole film because, despite feeling dated and a bit basic, it is good natured and nostalgic fun. The downside of this is that modern children will probably be roundly unimpressed by it in the face of the CGI-generated, self-aware and smart films that they have been served over the last decade or so. A nostalgic pleasure despite this though.

It's about a supervillain named Karl Stromberg who has isolated himself from society in a massive underwater lair that reminds me of the Nautilus from Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Like Captain Nemo, Stromberg prefers an ocean life because of the peace and tranquility of the underwater world. When he meets Bond, he asks him, Why do we seek to conquer space when seven tenths of our universe remains to be explored?But even his lofty his goal of creating an underground city is not his master plan. He has also built a super-tanker large enough to open up the jaws of its bow and swallow entire nuclear submarines and use them for his own ends. When the British and the Russians each find that they're missing a nuclear submarine, a massive hunt is started to find out what happened to them. The concern, needless to say, is understandable.I am curious as to why the subs didn't have ANY kind of tracking system installed in them. I mean, I realize this was before the time of LoJack, but these are not old Hondas, they're nuclear freaking submarines! Maybe the most amazing thing in the movie is that both the British and Soviets somehow overcame the embarrassment of having lost one of the most powerful and expensive pieces of military technology in their mutual arsenals long enough to realize that the other had the same problem!I'm just imagining the conversation &#150; Yeah, London? This is Moscow. We seem to have misplaced a nuclear sub, so if you run into one, could you give us a holler?....What? You're missing one, TOO?! Oh, thank God! We thought we were the only ones!Bond is obliged to team up with Russian agent XXX, a beautiful woman who's fiancé he killed in the movie's opening sequence. It's a tense relationship, as she tells him that as soon as their mission is accomplished, she will kill him too. Also notable about this movie is that it is a bit more violent than most of the Bond films, especially the more recent ones. Bond kills a surprising number of people, some of them almost in cold blood. The Spy Who Loved Me is the movie that introduced the unstoppable henchman Jaws, a steel-toothed giant played by Richard Kiel. Jaws was so popular that he was brought back for the next Bond film, Moonraker, although he never once utters a word. I'm guess it's because it would be so hard for Kiel to get anything out around those alloy dentures. I loved the wild villanousness of the bad guy in The Spy Who Loved Me. No simple murder mystery or enormous embezzlement scheme, this Stromberg wanted to start a war between Britain and the Soviet Union, knowing that global destruction would follow, paving the way for him to, as Homer Simpson once put it, start a new life under the sea.Of all the outlandishly nutty schemes! This is the kind of thing that could only ever exist in a James Bond movie, and it makes for one of the more entertaining entries in the series.

Hats off to musical director\/composer, Bernard Hermann for crafting a music score that compliments the film nicely (as does his other musical scores for not just Hitchcock,but other films he wrote & arranged music for). The film is also a treat for the eye,filmed in the original Technicolor process & shot in the sadly now defunct 'Vistavision' process (another special wide screen process that Paramont seemed to have the copyright for,but allowed M-G-M to implement for this one film,only).
