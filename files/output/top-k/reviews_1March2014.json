I happened to be on the Sky Disney Channel and this popped on, I hadn't seen it so I figured I would watch it. As soon as I saw the intro, I knew it was going to involve a kid who was either going to be really likable or really annoying...this kid was really annoying.In the first half of the film I felt that his old bodyguard was right to lose it at the shopping centre (or as you Americans call it the mall) since he was misbehaving and seemed to not gain that much punishment apart from a calm You're grounded from his parents. I was also on the side of the kid bullies and felt myself nodding when they said I don't think you're better than anyone and clapped when The First Kid got punched in the face, because all I saw was a bratty spoilt brat that didn't know when to stop and needed to learn a lesson. This was a major problem for me when watching this film and it still bugs me today as I have experienced kids like this before. However, on a more positive note, he was more likable in the second half of the film when he was learning how to be normal and such, though that's not saying much, I still find him one of the most annoying kids in movies.The best thing about this movie was the performance from Sinbad, as the newly hired bodyguard. His character made me giggle at every joke and none of them fell flat, could be because he's a comedian but still. He saved the movie for me because if he hadn't been a major character then I would have straight away changed the channel.Storywise, it was OK I suppose I mean the concept of the kid being lonely is believable enough, though I personally don't think acting bad would help him receive positive attention. Also, it would be only natural for him to want to make a friend online and meet up with them. I have to say that I was NOT expecting the old bodyguard to be the online friend at all, I thought it would have been a brand new villain that would have kidnapped him and held him for ransom or some generic thing like that.Overall, this movie is OK, if you can tolerate an extremely annoying brat for about 85% - 90% of the film then I would recommend giving it a look. If you can't then definitely skip it, it's not a total loss if you don't I'm just saying that you would be missing out on a great performance from Sinbad which is why this movie gets a 5\/10 from me.

She is supposed to believe in Santa (while arch-nemesis Jane Withers does not); and you can tell that Little Miss Moppet does believe in Santa the way she says her lines. This is 'true' acting. And the scene where she kisses the old man in the wheelchair and says she likes him is brimming with truth, too. You can sense that this child performer does like adults who treat her kindly. And the moment when she puts her head on his lap is predictably sweet but no less effective-- gently reminding adults how to properly treat children.Yet despite all these charming aspects of David Butler's script (he also directed the picture), we know we are being manipulated for some serious drama ahead. Shirley starts out fatherless (except for surrogate daddy figure James Dunn) and by the 37th or 38th minute of the story, she is completely orphaned when her mother is killed on the street one day.Signal the tears. Lots and lots of tears. The scene where James Dunn learns about the mother's death while Shirley waves from inside the plane is tough to watch. Then, there's the sequence where he takes her up in the plane and while floating over some clouds, he tells her about heaven and her mother joining her father in heaven. She breaks down while he flies the aircraft and it is devastating. I can only imagine how audiences responded to this the first time it was seen in the 1930s. How can there be a dry eye left in the house after that tender, truthful display of emotion?And this is where Mr. Butler and Fox pull out all the stops. Shirley has lost both her parents now, on Christmas Day of all days. And miraculously, she still believes in Santa. The old man in the wheelchair plays Santa for her, James Dunn and all his buddies play Santa for her. Even the cook (Jane Darwell) and the butler are up to the task of playing Santa for her and providing her with a home if necessary.We are surrounded by a gift of love in this film.

Only someone as hopelessly childlike as Arthur could glean a smile from such a comment but his fiancé seems oblivious to his insults. For this is the best he can do as he sits opposite a woman he is forced to marry or be cut off without a cent (US$750million to be exact). Susan adores everything about him (what woman wouldn't?) and come to think of it, most of the people he meets in the film adore him except his family. I certainly would fall at his feet if Arthur Bach were a real character. He has warmth, style and dare I reveal my shallowness - he has pots and pots and pots of money. So what's not to like? This film is utterly charming and hasn't lost any of its appeal even though it's now more than 30 years old. It is a really romantic film at its heart and it is very satisfying watching the helpless manchild fall in love with a charismatic and striking actress, Linda Marolla (played by a quirky Liza Minnelli). Unfortunately this all happens at the same time as he is being manipulated by his powerful family into marrying the beautiful, elegant and how can I put this - a square cardboard cut out of a woman, Susan Johnson. She is beautiful, no question but Arthur, although from old money, acts like a parvenu; he's always drunk and appears to connect with real people and so the vivacious Linda, who's always got a story at the ready to get herself out of trouble, really appeals to him.Arthur's character is a charming playboy whose life revolves around drinking and laughing, and little else. He likes to live it up, a bit like the hellraisers of the eighties but with none of their artistic bent. Arthur is no Ollie Reed or Peter O'Toole, he is a bored multimillionaire which does make him quite a tragic figure. Some people drink because they are not poets. This is who I am. He desperately tries to explain to the gloriously vacuous Susan. But boy does he come alive when he's on the sauce! Dudley Moore who plays Arthur is very convincing as a drunk and plays it so beautifully. He is certainly the life and soul of the party and the best one liner for me is when he says to his betrothed's butler Are you sure you want to be a nightclub comic? when said butler displays all the personality of a walking corpse. Arthur's own butler, Hobson (Sir John Gielgud) needs no introduction and deserved the Oscar he received for his dry and biting wit. If you and your undergarment could move two paces backwards, I could enter this dwelling. he snorts to Linda's bewildered father as he enters their humble abode. Hobson is an innate snob and even though every utterance is an insult he's such an original that you readily forgive him.As we see the dilemmas that Arthur faces throughout the film, we do see him develop and mature (just a bit). His slightly deranged and eccentric grandmother, Martha is hilarious and I thought she would be a great match for Hobson as they are both inveterate snobs but that would be a totally wild and unbelievable storyline - what was I thinking! If you are still an old romantic at heart (even though thirty years have passed since you may have seen it) watch it again. Arthur and Martha truly lit up my heart as did all the other characters.

He brings chaos in his wake that stirs the other patients. We have had similar themed films done since then and even parodied in film and TV on numerous occasions, so there is a lot of familiarity to the story even if you have never seen the film before.McMurphy's behaviour brings him into conflict with Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher.) Nurse Ratched as noted by others is a cold, icy character who lacks empathy. As McMurphy mentions she is not playing a straight game.

It is not an epic dealing with a grandiose story yet it still won the Gland Slam of Oscars with Best actor, actress, screenplay, director and film.The film has aged because we now see some famous faces when they were younger and similar stories have been told since then but if you have not seen the film before or its been some years since your last viewing, then give it a try.

Because beneath the hip '60's trappings, lies a deeply humane message, valid for any time or place.The movie has its faults, mostly those endemic to any stage play adapted to the screen. There's basically only one set, and lots of talk, talk, talk. But fortunately the dialog is crisp, witty, and often highly intelligent, particularly Don's perceptive nuanced distinctions, e.g. 'want to' vs. 'have to'.

Her raspy voice and domineering manner inject needed drama and comedy into what has been a mounting one-note love fest. Right away Mom seems ripe for audience dislike, but that's part of the movie's overall moral, which I take to be about overcoming internal barriers to happiness.Anyway, the movie's a tad over-long in the first part.

It works best when our heroine is still trying to make sense of macabre events and is not sure what the truth is. The writing is silly at times, but there are also fun moments. Some of the special effects are bad, yet at the same time there's some hilarious over the top gore. Making it entertaining enough to watch are some great lines and a number of amusing, attention-getting performances.The movie stars Nightmare on Elm Street 3 Dream Warriors cast member Jennifer Rubin as Cynthia, who as a child had survived a suicide pact engineered by ultra creepy cult leader Harris (Richard Lynch at his best). Now she's a 20 something adult who's just awakened from a coma, and she's put into group therapy run by kindly Alex Karmen (Bruce Abbott of Re- Animator fame). Soon the people in this group start to die horrible deaths and Cynthia is convinced that Harris's spirit (which sometimes appears to her as a nastily charred corpse) is the one killing them.Rubin is appealing if not that good as an actress; at least she conveys a sense of naivety and innocence. Abbott is good, as is the excellent character actor Harris Yulin - a man who's always excelled at playing unbelievably smug and pompous jerks - as Karmens' colleague. Dean Cameron (Summer School) supplies a lot of the comedy, improvising most of his best lines (you have to pay attention to catch one of them). Susan Barnes and Sy Richardson (both from Repo Man), Louis Giambalvo (Weekend at Bernie's), ever adorable actress \/ singer \/ voice over artist Elizabeth Daily, Susan Ruttan ('L.A. Law'), and Charles voice of Roger Rabbit Fleischer all put in appearances as well.Co-written and directed by Andrew Fleming (The Craft), this is intriguing for a while - with a memorable revenge \/ black comedy sequence near the end - but ultimately comes to a humdrum conclusion. It does show off Rubins' beauty to great effect and can boast some good visual tricks and scene transitions. Oscar winner Michele Burke does the nicely grisly makeup effects.Overall, not bad; it may be worth viewing for devotees of 80s genre fare.Six out of 10.

Wow I'm speechless. It's a lot more than just a movie. It's like a spiritual experience and a great epic as well. Every moment in it is meaningful and moving. And the masterpiece musical score makes every moment moving and soulful as well. I've never seen such a musical score complement a film so well.What's special and unique about this film is that when the protagonist character John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) slowly transforms into a Native American soul, you (the viewer) feel like you are going through the transformation process along with him. That's what makes it like an experience, rather than just a film.What's more, if you are a white American guy with a deep observant genuine soul and personality, you will relate to John Dunbar's character - his alienation from his white culture, as well as his connection with the Sioux tribe. (Thus this film has a Happier Abroad theme to it as well) Dunbar is the only deep observation genuine white character in the film, along with his lover, because the rest of the white characters in this epic seem so degenerate and hollow, or robotic, in comparison.I would try to see this on a big screen though, so you can appreciate the scenery, which most of this film focuses on, even more than the characters. Set aside four hours and dim the lights to see it. Then you will understand what I mean. I think it's one of the top ten best films of all time. And it's Costner's best role as well. On IMDb, almost everyone gave it a 10 out of 10. Also, on Amazon.com nearly every reviewer gave it 5 stars out of 5 as well.You can get the DVD version on Amazon.com for 5 dollars or download it from Amazon.com for a few dollars.I think it's a Happier Abroad film (referring to the movement I started at HappierAbroad.com) too because in the story, John Dunbar (Kevin Costner) experiences social connection, harmony and genuineness with the Sioux tribe, and then realizes how hollow and empty his white culture is. His soul slowly becomes Sioux, to the point where he doesn't fit in anymore with American life. The soldiers at the end who capture and persecute him look so degenerate, soulless and depraved compared to the Sioux tribe he joined. Only then do you realize the comparison.Anyway, this is a must see film. It reflects the spirit and feeling of our movement at HappierAbroad.com.

For those who watched it I'm sure they've watched at least a thousand times. If I must say a few words for the acting I might say that I am not among the big fans of Marlon Brando but his role in this movie is the role of his life! What can I say about Al Pacino? Genius! Only one man could have played the role of Michael Corleone and that is him! I even thing that Brian De Palma didn't think twice when he had to pick the actor for Scarface 10 years later. All the rest are on the same level and whenever we see them in other pictures we think about The Godfather. Lets just point them out - James Caan, Richard S.

A whole book can be written for one of the greatest pictures of all time and we could not be even close to explaning how good actually it was! For those who haven't watched it yet it's a must! For those who watched it I'm sure they've watched at least a thousand times. If I must say a few words for the acting I might say that I am not among the big fans of Marlon Brando but his role in this movie is the role of his life! What can I say about Al Pacino? Genius! Only one man could have played the role of Michael Corleone and that is him! I even thing that Brian De Palma didn't think twice when he had to pick the actor for Scarface 10 years later. All the rest are on the same level and whenever we see them in other pictures we think about The Godfather. Lets just point them out - James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale and much much more!

When I first saw this movie it really put the hook on me. The story follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy New York investment banking executive. He seems pretty much like any other person, but there is something very special about him. A dark curse lies over this man, forcing him to deal with his needs in a most unpleasant way, he is secretly addicted to killing. Patrick does everything he can to hide his true self and fit in. But eventually his mask of sanity is about to slip. Will he be exposed?One of the best things about American Psycho is it's clear criticism against todays society. It describes an empty, superficial and inhuman world and is also a magnificent contemporary portrayal of a world where fashion replaces morality and people are valued as trademarks.Whats best though is how you keep following the main character through the picture. You hear him narrating, you see the world from his perspective, and you really feel his desperation, his addiction and the struggle in his mind between sanity and madness.

The ever-excellent Jack Nicholson adopts the role of J. J. Gittes, a man who finds himself investigating a conspiracy surrounding Los Angeles's water supply, no less.In the hands of auteur Roman Polanski, CHINATOWN is a great movie. Although it's slow moving for the most part, it's also ultra stylish and the director keeps your attention throughout. There are also nice performances from the whole cast, not least Faye Dunaway's alluring femme fatale and John Huston as the elderly patriarch.Despite its laidback appeal, CHINATOWN contains some shocking material, most of which seems quite tame these days but which must have packed a punch when it first came out; I'm thinking the final twist in particular. Nevertheless, bolstered by strong performances and good direction, this is a minor classic of its genre.

Just really poor screen writing, directing (Quaid never even bothers to feign an English accent) and casting (Sean Connery should never have been cast as the dragon's voice). Too many past Hollywood associations with Connery and his voice. This movie makes Robin Hood Prince of Thieves look like prime stuff (choke). I gave this terrible movie five out of ten.

First, there was a reason why the Astaire\/Rogers movies were so successful--the chemistry between the two. I have seen most of their movies and, in terms of personality, think Rogers is always more fun to watch than her costar (dancing, of course, is another issue). Thus, although Joan Fontaine was attractive in this movie, she had no sense of comic timing, and compared to Rogers had the personality of tree bark. And all throughout Fontaine's dance number with Astaire, I kept asking myself why did they feel the need to have a dance number between the two of them at all? It was fun to see Burns and Allen dance, but I have to say Gracie's bread-and-butter ditsy routine got a little old by the end of the film. The fun house dance routine is being hailed by so many as a film highlight. While it had some fun moments, it was interminably long and had some inexplicably crass scenes, especially one where Gracie is mindlessly running around in a circle atop a spinning disk for several inexplicable minutes while in some kind of trance. A more compact treatment would have been preferable. I was also irritated at the end of the film when the upbeat conclusion was interrupted by a long, illogical number by Astaire, where he was dancing and kicking drums. Sure, it showcased a fine talent, but it greatly disrupted the flow of the film. And finally, I might have given a month's salary for the right to whack that obnoxious brat of a young servant over the head for his intolerable overacting.
