The computer graphics (which, according to one IMDB reviewer, require no talent to create) are astounding.  Certain shots (close-ups of lights, for example, or the entire scene in the snow) are both incredibly real-looking while simultaneously artificial.  The main character's fur is worth the price of admission in itself it is a marvellous feat of the graphic arts.  So real that you want to reach out and touch its wispy, floaty, dreamy depths.  The climax, involving millions of doors to the real world, is simply fantastic - both in its imaginative qualities and its emotional impact.  Of course, this being the fourth instalment in Pixar's travels in hyper-reality, the novelty has worn off slightly.  Never again will we feel that virginal buzz (geddit?) of Toy Story with its remarkable, shiny, tactile, other-worldly glow.  No computer-animated (a misnomer, by the way these films are animated by humans not computers) movie after that can ever have the same effect.  Which does not mean that MI is a disappointment.  Far from it after the - yes - disappointing Bug's Life and the strangely forgettable TS2 this is a definite return to form.  MI tells the story of Sully and his pal who work for Monsters Inc, scaring kids to use their screams as a source of power for their world.  Which is a pretty cool idea, really.  There are no prizes for originality when it comes to the rest of the story, I'm afraid, but it doesn't matter, because the movie is so gag-packed, so enjoyable, so light and refreshing and entertaining and innocent and clever and spectacular that if it doesn't win the Osc*r for best animated feature then there ain't no justice.  Oh, and if Shrek wins, then there will be serious trouble.  It's interesting to compare the two, in fact Shrek is a clever-clever, movie-references-packed, up-to-the-minute gag-fest that, in a few years' time, will appear hopelessly dated.  MI is a simple, beautiful, intelligent, witty and fast-paced kids' adventure that will look fresh and inventive when it appears on TV every Christmas for ever.  And there, my friends, you have it. In an age where Hollywood usually means crass ineptitude, it's heart-warming indeed to see that someone out there is still making great movies for kids of all ages.  If Monsters Inc. were a live-action or traditionally animated movie it would be just as good.  And that is its real strength it relies not on great visuals (though they are great) but such unfashionable qualities as intelligence, wit, economy, imagination and inventiveness.

Some of the negative things about the filmwhen Solondz tried to shock the audience,Paul Giamatti,and some of the dialogue. In Happiness and Welcome to the Dollhouse,the taboos just didn't seem as forced,even though you knew you were being provoked.   The cinematography was delicious and colorful, like most Solondz films. The idea was clever, but there were still things missing. The spoof on American Beauty was especially low. I've seen a couple other spoofs on that film and it's just outdated. Furthermore, Solondz must be extremely sensitive, because he also used the American Movie director to film American Scooby. Ugh, how incredibly lame! Unless the insults (or nods) are subtle like Shrek(ok bad example) or 8 1\/2 Women by Greenaway, then it shouldn't be done. I definitely lost some respect for Solondz for adding those pathetic attacks on American Beauty.   The thing that gets me about Solondz, that makes him so different from a lot of other directors, is the way the movie is so black that it's incredibly serious. The humor comes out of the seriousness. He knows how to capture 'real' moments and it's the craziest and most powerful thing I've seen in a long time. I love watching films that capture real emotions, like reading a D.H. Lawrence novel. In Happiness moment of truth with father and son, argument between the parents about divorce, and when lara flynn boyle admits of feeling shallow. These are just a couple moments, but in Storytelling, the most beautiful moment captured (in my opinion) was Brady talking to Scooby in the bathroom. That's why I watch Solondz films. It's so amazingly real.On the other hand, I was less impressed with some of the characters. I didn't think the joke about cp was funny and it reminded me of scenes in Gummo, which I wasn't impressed with either. There's a very fine line between showing what's 'real' and exploiting people or trying to shock audiences and it seems to be slightly crossed in both films. I just don't think it's shocking about Blair's desire to date Marcus because of his disorder. It makes Blair a shallow character, and thus renders her uninteresting. Furthermore, it makes her later situations less impactful because it's hard to feel emotion for or against her. Although, maybe that isn't his 'point'. I tend to like films that evoke emotions though.     I don't think length of movie can be equated with 'good' film. I've wasted a lot of time watching horrible films that have lasted way longer than they should have. Further, most Egoyan films average 90 minutes.     I must note that the particular instance with Blair and her professor is not something 'real' to me. I was so caught up with Solondz forcing this taboo, that I couldn't believe it. It seemed too scripted.     I think while, Storytelling was funny in some parts, it was also very sad.      Could someone please explain the hypnotism that went on? It was almost like magical realism. I couldn't quite tell whether Goodman was trying to please his son because his other two were long gone, or if Goodman was really 'hypnotized' and it was a subtle critique of his character?
