I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I imagined it would be great because it was made by the same person who did The royal... I was right. This is not a bright and colorful movie. It's extremely subtle, and the characters have many sides to their personalities. I think this great subtlety is what makes the charm of this movie, but this aspect might repulse many viewers who expect something different. Is this a drama or a comedy? I certainly did smile and laugh several times, but like I said, it was very subtle. It's a movie that's completely filled with emotions, but these feelings aren't overpowering like in some other movies.*** Small spoilers ahead ***Another great thing is the unexpected events in this movie. There was clearly no moral. This movie tells the tale of a teenage boy who falls in love with a beautiful teacher and at the same time becomes the friend of the school principal who also loves this teacher. We already think we can predict what is going to happen. It's the same thing with everything the boy achieves. He is very obsessive about everything, and that leads us to think he's going to learn a lesson and change the way he thinks and acts, but that's not what happens at all! I was very pleased by this aspect.The characters is what really makes this movie one of my favorites. Usually, teenagers in movies are based on stereotypes. Max wasn't this way. When the movie started, I expected him to be a geekish student who was good at everything, but that's not what he was at all. He's a genius and participates in all the student activities at his school, yet he doesn't have time to invest in anything else. He's obsessive and doesn't have one bit of common sense, yet he is respected by his classmates because of what he does at the school. Blume is played by Bill Murray who is one of my favorite actors. He's bored with life and old, yet very immature. There's a strange contrast between this character and Max. Max is the smart guy who has all the ideas and no power because of his young age and social status, and Blume is older and rich but definitely not as smart as Max. Even though they aren't portraits of the typical American teenager and older man, they are genuine characters.The fact that friendships between adults and teenagers are possible in this movie is something I liked a lot. It's very unusual. Most of the relationships in this movie are.This isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone. Most people these days want realism, but at the same time they want everything to be glamorized. This movie is the complete opposite of that. While not trying to be realistic, it has a very real side to it. We believe in the story, it's not far-fetched, yet it has a touch of fantasy.

It may be that his films are overblown yet are entertaining, have horrendous yet amusing dialogue, and have wooden yet colorful characters. But you seriously have to ask yourself, what great action movie does not have those qualities? OK, OK, some may not, but we're not talking about other action pictures, we're talking about the films of Michael Bay. Those who say that his films are crap seriously bother me because I have found it extremely difficult to believe that they were not at all entertained when they have paid good money to see his latest action flick.He obviously likes to blow stuff up (see Armageddon or Pearl Harbor to see what I mean), but you have to give him the praise that he richly deserves &#150; for that he has an eye for detail, in fact such an eye for detail, that he may just be the best modern action filmmaker alive today. He lavishes in detail and great camera shots of one single frame around a character or object. To make this story short, his films make for captivating, if not necessary viewing for any true action fan. His films are never boring; he keeps dialogue to a minimum and he just keep you entertained for the running time.Bay was an accomplished music video director before scoring his first hit in 1995 with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in the buddy-cop action film Bad Boys, and would later re-team with them both for Bad Boys 2 last year. However it wouldn't be until the following year that people really knew who Michael Bay was when he directed the Alcatraz thriller The Rock with Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris as the leads.Now we're at Armageddon, which was released amidst hostile reviews and received quite a tongue lashing from critics in the summer of 1998. Its story about an asteroid (dubbed a global killer by NASA) and the team of civilian oil drillers who are recruited to land on it and drop a nuke down a hole in its surface took a backseat to some really inventive special effects.Even if you don't buy the story or its characters, you could at least lavish in the special effects and the production. The antagonist of the film, a jagged, almost hellish goliath of a rock that's hurling towards planet Earth at millions of miles per hour, takes a terrifying life of its own once we see its surface. This is where our director Michael Bay comes in. He wants to show us his vision of Hell, which is his vision of this asteroid that's intent on wiping out everything on the planet; this also gives the Armageddon tagline a little deeper meaning It's closer than you think.

Yes, it cuts quickly from place to place, person to person, event to event. But it is never boring, and never less than a brilliant mixture of what movies are supposed to do tell a good story, depict characters through active events, invoke an emotional response, and entertain simply and directly, without pretense.If you are a die-hard action fan (I'm not, though my movie collection would probably suggest otherwise), don't pass up Michael Bay, because in the end, he's just giving the audience what it wants.10\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"19 June 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Love him or loathe him, you have to give director Michael Bay the thumbs up for the enormous craft and ingenuity that goes into his films.

At the beginning of The Third Man we are introduced to one of the main characters of the films, the city of Vienna. Vienna isn't the typical American, dark alley city. It isn't the understood labyrinth that shadows are gained and lost in, like in The Maltese Falcon. It is a different place, separated into four regions, and is so strange and beautiful that it almost seems like it's a person, viewing all of Holly Martins exploits but not being able to offer him any help. Holly Martins is a writer, not the Sam Spade type. Sam Spade would probably be the type of guy Martins would write about. He's a regular guy, with regular faults. You know his intentions from the very beginning. He doesn't even wear a hat. The mysterious woman isn't so mysterious. She tells us her thoughts, and she isn't lying. The twists of the movie aren't even twists. Martins investigation is so careful that he doesn't make too many assumptions and when he does, he is usually right. It hardly even matters what he is trying to investigate. The characters are so enjoyable, the cinematography is so ingenious, the music is so exciting, that the resurrection of Harry Lime just seems like an added treat. To Martins it hardly seems like such a surprise, he is relieved and disappointed at the same time, because his best friend is alive, but has been doing unthinkable crimes. Unlike Spade, Martins is actually somewhat connected to his investigation. And also unlike Spade, his love for the woman is never professed. Spade's connection to his desperate characters actually ends up being more than Martins. For Spade was forced upon the people's lives, and Martins intruded upon them. In The Third Man, Holly Martins walks into a hotel looking for his friend Harry Lime, and the porter tells him that he's `kapoosh.'

Needless to say, warm and fuzzy won out at the box office.22 years on and vile and repulsive have given way to revered and respected. Quite simply put, Carpenter's magnificent movie has stood the test of time well and is, in the opinion of many, (myself included), his finest film and considering the work of genius that is Halloween, which he directed 4 years earlier, is no mean feat. Sure, there are gorier films that have come out in the past 20 years, but few of them carry the same clout as seeing The Thing for the first time. When it first burst onto the scene, it was groundbreaking stuff. The effects were second to none. A dog's face splitting open; a human chest opening to reveal vicious, razor sharp teeth; a head sprouting legs and scurrying across the floor - just some of the surreal treats in store. If it had been made in the last decade, most of the effects would have been created with CGI, but the fact that everything you see is 'in the flesh' only adds to the jaw dropping astonishment of seeing these weird and wonderful creations.Bucket loads of gore alone, do not a great film make and fortunately The Thing has a number of great performances along with a great story to add to the mix of mayhem. Critics often complain that films lack any real characters and that there is no one to care about. Not so with The Thing. It may not seem obvious at first, but repeated viewings highlight the individual characteristics of the main players and in spite of the situation they are in, they behave in a credible manner throughout. There is a real sense that these men have been stationed at the base for a long time and that they have learned to tolerate each other even if they do not necessarily like each other.The underlying theme of the film is trust, or lack of. As the story progresses, it becomes uncertain as to who may, or may not be The Thing. It could be any of them, or it could be none of them. Tension rises and tempers fray as one by one, they each fall under suspicion. It's surely, no coincidence that Quentin Tarantino, who cites this as one of his favourite films, took the theme of trust and used it to great effect in his own film, Reservoir Dogs.There are so many great scenes in this film, it's difficult to pick one, but highlights must surely include the defibrillator scene; the blood test scene and of course the infamous head stretching until it falls off the table and sprouts legs and runs away. Everyone has their favourite!The ending is satisfyingly ambiguous and has provided fans of the movie with plenty to debate. Spin off comics and even a hugely enjoyable console \/ PC game have helped to sustain interest in the film over the years.Rumours have persisted that a remake of The Thing will appear as a TV mini-series. Please, for the love of whichever deity you believe in, don't do it!!! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Too many times a remake \/ re-imagining (whatever you want to call them) has tarnished the good name of a classic film.The DVD edition of The Thing is a true gem. Crammed with extras, the highlight is the commentary track with John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. It's informative and entertaining (as Carpenter's commentaries always are) and just listen to Russell roar with laughter during the aforementioned defibrillator scene. Priceless!As a side note, it has to be said that, generally speaking, people with beards in films, are not cool. In The Thing, Kurt Russell makes wearing a beard seem effortlessly cool!If you've never seen John Carpenter's The Thing, do yourself a favour and buy it \/ rent it, turn the lights off, take the phone off the hook and sit back and enjoy.

If I was teaching Soundtrack 501 in art school I would spend at least entire class on this one.First this is probably the most haunting musicsrore I have ever heard. I loved many but this is totally different, a class of it's own. You can't compare this with a Moulin Rouge that was sublime, it's a musical. In Dead Man I think half of the value of the movie comes from the score.It is not only Neil Young's eclectic way of playing the guitar it is also in the way they have used it along in the movie. The first 5 mins. of the movie not a word is spoken, the train is moving and you already have an idea of what's going on. Suddenly you hear that strange noise 1-2 seconds, the first sounds of the guitar and it stops...train keeps moving glimpse of this glimpse of thatYou know you're moving from east to west but you don't know why, then first words comes when the always creepy Glover comes in, then you learn a little more, opps another glimpse of young's guitar. Then a little later comes the intro generic and you get the full taste of the music score. I was on tape and I just had to stop and rewind to look at the whole piece again and from then on I was literally begging to hear that music as the film progessed. That was the trick you see, never overused, always in the right place, always in the right dose and tone, totally intoxicating.Some great actors can carry a film on their shoulders by themsleves, here the music score lift this movie to another level and carries it on its shoulders. I personally found it that powerful. It think that's the word, it's a subtle, sensitive but powerful music score that fills your brain and soul whitout even whitnessing it at first.I didn't even knew at first it was Neil Young's and I remember telling myself; but who the heck did that, who's that genius.Yes as you can see i was thrown over by it -)But what about the movie. I liked it too. It's of course different. Some might not like the pace or simingly simple story. Some might even say it was mono-tone in both sense as it's filmed in black & white and the plot is really always moving on one level only, but again it was the intention and I believed it was well justified.Johnny Depp doesn't always need to be exuberant and here again every piece of this movie is in harmony with its unity, subtle so unless you're blind you see Depp's character changing one scene after another. Some people might need a sign or an obvious cut to tell them oh OK he's not the same anymore. Gee of course he's not the same look what just happened here.The change is so slow and subtle that he DOESN'T have to act it he just IS it one scene after another.Hollywood produces so much junk cookie cutter movie than when things are not told explicitly some get bored.It's a poetic film so if you don't like the genre then you'll probably fall into the category that couldn't stand the pace of the movie. Along with the music score the pace is what makes it good and I don't need and it doesn't have to be (even if I like) filmed à la Tarantino to be good. Again stills totally in harmony here.You have to look at the totality and what the director is doing. Here it is a film that is totally congruent from start to finish and one heck of a good piece.I never rent movie as I record them when they pass on the many movie channel I have. I am usually not a keeper I listen and record over. This one I simply couldn't as I knew I was going to listen to it again, which I did 2 months later and enjoyed it even more.

I liked it too. It's of course different. Some might not like the pace or simingly simple story. Some might even say it was mono-tone in both sense as it's filmed in black & white and the plot is really always moving on one level only, but again it was the intention and I believed it was well justified.Johnny Depp doesn't always need to be exuberant and here again every piece of this movie is in harmony with its unity, subtle so unless you're blind you see Depp's character changing one scene after another.

Gee of course he's not the same look what just happened here.The change is so slow and subtle that he DOESN'T have to act it he just IS it one scene after another.Hollywood produces so much junk cookie cutter movie than when things are not told explicitly some get bored.It's a poetic film so if you don't like the genre then you'll probably fall into the category that couldn't stand the pace of the movie.

If I was teaching Soundtrack 501 in art school I would spend at least entire class on this one.First this is probably the most haunting musicsrore I have ever heard. I loved many but this is totally different, a class of it's own. You can't compare this with a Moulin Rouge that was sublime, it's a musical. In Dead Man I think half of the value of the movie comes from the score.It is not only Neil Young's eclectic way of playing the guitar it is also in the way they have used it along in the movie. The first 5 mins. of the movie not a word is spoken, the train is moving and you already have an idea of what's going on. Suddenly you hear that strange noise 1-2 seconds, the first sounds of the guitar and it stops...train keeps moving glimpse of this glimpse of thatYou know you're moving from east to west but you don't know why, then first words comes when the always creepy Glover comes in, then you learn a little more, opps another glimpse of young's guitar. Then a little later comes the intro generic and you get the full taste of the music score.

From the beginning, stunningly shot and directed, it unfolds like a dream. Images connect, but not necessarily in a logical way. They do, however, form (more or less) a disturbingly coherent picture (emotion, dream?).It all starts with the death of a child. The daughter of the Baxters (beautifully played by Julie Christie and even more beautifully by Donald Sutherland) drowns. The scene lasts about five minutes - the quiet, uneasy build-up, the alternating takes between the girl running toward the pond with her ball and the parents having an everyday conversation, and the escalation into tragedy. It's not horrifying in an immediate physical sense, but it carries a dreamlike unease.The story then moves to Venice where Donald Sutherland's John works on the restoration of a church, living in a hotel with his wife, Laura. The rest of it is relatively simple Laura meets two women, one who allegedly possesses second-sight and tells her that her daughter is with them as a ghost and is happy, which convinces Laura that this is indeed true and, when she tells John, he doubts it being pragmatic and rational, creating a rather common and over-done conflict of reason versus belief.However, this seemingly simple story enters into the realm of the subconscious. It almost reminded me with of Paul Verheoven's The 4th Man without being as vulgarly violent - but it shares a similar theme. How do we explain the coincidences and situations which occur in our daily lives? Are they merely random coincidences with only the meaning we choose to attribute to them? Or are they a part of a general, unknown (divine?) order? In other words, Don't Look Now is about religion - to some degree of course. More accurately, it is about the meaninglessness versus the meaningfulness of life.While The 4th Man evolves like a pulpy thriller of coincidences, traps and schizophrenic paranoia, where none of the characters are likable (especially the hero), Don't Look Now has a darker subtext to it. It doesn't simply jump into strange occurrences and coincidences and play with the viewer's mind - it provides a very real motivation for the way the characters behave and comprehend things the way they do. Grief, the grief for the Baxter daughter, drives Sutherland's John through skepticism and outrage at the insinuation that the daughter is somewhere in limbo. He is the central character because he doubts - but he also sees his daughter. He is thus faced with a very existential problem. He doesn't believe his daughter is alive or even that he can see her - but he follows the little red shape through the foggy street of Gothic Venice. He doubts his own cause, he doubts that it has any meaning, that his daughter is indeed alive, yet he knowingly chases her image because he has to know for himself. The question, of course, is how do deep emotions of loss and grief affect our worldly perception? What is belief in the reason behind the things we see? Are they merely a picture painted by our imagine or, once again, are they incredibly real?The film raises these questions, and rightly so, but I don't think it deals with them completely. While I don't think this is a bad thing, I do find the ending anti-climactic and consider it an attempt to tie things in a nice little package. It's a cop-out - an answer to a question which we cannot answer. Nonetheless, Don't Look Now, even if you don't accept its premise and the questions that can be derived from it, is flawlessly directed and performed. The film's survival can be attributed to Sutherland and Christie and Roeg's searching camera, and the way it evokes that ethereal region where strange things happen sometimes without logical explanation, but manage to reveal us to ourselves.

There is a great deal of philosophising; indeed, a great deal of talk of all kinds. Then when the action finally arrives, it is distressingly predictable. One can hear the minds of the writers ticking over (their minds obviously never ran faster than idle &#150; pun intended). 'Well, let's see&#133; this mutant has this set of powers&#133; so let's invent a situation that allows him to save the day.

Yes, we get it &#150; the mutants and their situation are a metaphor for 'racism' in our society, and they represent what we are told will be the future - the (supposedly) desirable mixing of races into an eventual universal racial homogeneity.This repetitive political message has no place in a popular entertainment movie, and can only detract from the enjoyment of the audience. Alright, there isn't much entertainment in this film anyway, but this propaganda just makes it worse. It's not the message that's the problem specifically &#150; it's the endless, dull repetition and the fundamental objection to indoctrination in entertainment. I would have the same objection regardless of the nature of the message being promoted.Watching such films only makes me more aware of the increasing similarities between 'Western' societies and those of such countries as Saudi Arabian, China or North Korea.

It's not that I agree with these ideas &#150; or disagree with them. My views are irrelevant. The point is that many people, both inside and outside the 'Western' world, do hold some or all of these views. Indeed, at least one of these views (women are not as strong or physically able as men) is held almost universally. Yet how often is the exact opposite view portrayed in the western media, with women out-muscling (and outfighting) men?

Michael Keaton (Bruce\/Batman) is more fun here because he shows just how much of a sacrifice being the 'Dark Knight' is, he also has a more interesting romance here. Danny DeVito (The Penguin) is gross to look at but made the character both tragic and very evil. And, my favorite performance, Michelle Pfeiffer (Selina\/Catwoman) is amazing here! She goes from mousy to sexy and evil to emotional and slightly psychotic. Here, she is a tragic character and her forbidden romance with Batman was just perfect!Tim Burton also makes this very fun to look at with an even darker Gotham City setting and some great scenes in a deserted zoo and the sewers which is also the lair of the Penguin. It also helped that the film was set in the Christmas season, the snow and everything made it look darker.**** ","genre":null},{"date":"19 June 2004","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" BATMAN RETURNS (1992)starring Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Phieffer, Christopher Walken, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Michael Murphy.plot Batman (Michael Keaton) faces two new threats to Gotham City when eccentric businessman Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is blackmailed into helping The Penguin (Danny DeVito) emerge from underground and take control of Gotham City.

While the two of them have a lot in common. They use the same combination of Nicolas Cage teamed up with another major name and state-of-the-art action sequences in order to deliver a roller-coaster action thriller against an original background. But i'm here to discuss Con Air in its own integrity. During several screenings i started to make an explicit distinction between the elements that work and the aspects which probably upset the critic community.The principal cast mostly gives away a good performance  John Malkovich is due to his voice & eyes the perfect choice to bring Cyrys Grissom to live. It was one of the few times i would nominate an actor as the new Anthony 'Zorba' Quinn. Next, Ving Rhames' portrayal of a black militant seems more convincing than the decent, but rather soulless roles of Nick Chinlund Danny Trejo - whose characters get a little more attention than most of the convicts. On the other side of the law, John Cusack found himself an appealing equilibrium between the rookie and the sidekick approach. Steve Buscemi is a man apart. Although basically he has little more to do that put his teeth and tiny humid eyes to work to play the greatest psycho of them all, Garland Greene wouldn't have been the same without Buscemi's dry sense of humour. He is a relief - well, measured by the standards of action movie humour. For example, his comments on insanity & idiocy have the class of a Trainspotting voice-over. As for the action, there are some memorable moments  the breakout, the trap at the deserted airfield and the firetruck chase in Vegas really brought out the merciless insanity connected to the convicts on the Jailbird. The other sequences may not be as good, but keep up a rapid, steady pace. So far, we have a more than average action flick which is enriched by its cast. Then where lie weak points ? Number On  Nicolas Cage !! It is a complicated matter which is best explained through another comparison with the Rock  both times he played a sensitive hero, making good use of his personal charisma, but the emotional background Scott Rosenberg came up with for Con Air feel like a lame excuse to put a likable one-man army on screen. Apart from that, his haircut and smoky BBC accent annoyed me immensely. Number two  that stupid diabetic sidekick of his was merely another twist of the script to make us connect with Cameron Poe. I did not give a damn whether he'd succumb to an insulin shortage or take one between the eyes like the three stooges aka Carl, Bensen & Popovich. Number three ... you've got to have some Elvis Presley or Tom Jones on the soundtrack when you take a trip to Vegas, though Buscemi's attachment to Sweet Home Alabama largely make up for it -)  ","genre":null},{"date":"19 June 2004","score":"8 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":"  My TV guide insists on granting Con Air a single star, whereas The Rock usually receives three.

Throughout the film, I kept hoping Young Charlie's uncle would be revealed to be innocent, possibly because his character displayed redeeming qualities. Most of all, the film explored Young Charlie's journey from innocence to reality in such a way that all of us lost a small portion of our childlike innocence. My favorite scene was when Young Charlie came down the stairs, wearing that emerald ring, causing the smile that was on her uncle's hopeful face to change to the sudden realization that he had to silence his favorite niece in order to keep his murderous past a secret.
