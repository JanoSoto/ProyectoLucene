The voices were excellent i have never seen any movie funnier than this one. The plot really got to me and showed that the uglier you are the better when it comes to falling in love and getting a hot date. The English version was not as funny as the Spanish version. so much pressure in the air, but Shrek was up to the task. no matter how much the movie was going down, Shrek was always up to the task. Even when the lady was not happy there and she wanted him to show her love, he was right there. Shrek, however was always down for his though. Giving props to his old school crew, he was right there for adventure and making sure the lovely lady had her way. What else can i say, Shrek is really good and funny. It is good for ages of all to enjoy no matter what language it came out of.
