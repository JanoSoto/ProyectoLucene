James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins seem to have been added to the cast to provide some comedy relief. That would have been welcome, except that neither one of them was very funny. Their performances as the best friends of Danny and Debbie who get consumed by jealousy starts to grate after about 15 minutes. However, in fairness, it was them who kept me watching. Two or three times there were hints that these two polar opposite characters might have a romance of their own beginning to bud, and I really wanted to see if it happened.

I used to be a Jim Carry fan but after a while he is just another irritating, overpaid actor.  The main character in this film is, without a doubt, Jim Carry, who we all thought would be perfect for the part.  He is a lot less than perfect.  He put so much craziness in the Grinch that he killed the character.  It wouldn't have been so bad if the whole movie didn't revolve around him but when the main character is in every scene and the actor kills the character, there is nothing left. When this happens you look to the director but then when you realize that the director is Ron Howard you know you are severely in trouble.  He just is not enough to save a film and there were no supporting actors good enough to help him. How can you call this film `Dr Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas' when that plot doesn't start until an hour into the show? In the first hour they attempt to give a little background on the story but it doesn't help the viewer learn anything.  Then at one point in the middle of the film the plot is solved when everyone loves the grinch.  He then is reminded of his childhood trauma and again turns into the grinch, why not end it there?  Instead they take it to another level.  This, finally is Dr. Suess' version.  The part that I don't understand is that it didn't fit with the first part. The movie could have been a lot better if the would have just left it with Dr. Suess, but instead Ron Howard made his version and then used Dr. Suess.  It can't work and it didn't.

AD&D was by far my favorite game.  All the while, I would think about how they could make an incredibly good movie about it, because of the imagination of so many great writers out there that have put out the concepts in rule books, modules, and magazines.  With today's special effects capabilities and advanced scientific theory, the time right.  But this is not the case in this movie offering.This movie reduces what could have been, either the Dragonlance trilogy or a Forgotten Realms story, into a mix-up of the stale stuff that we've seen in other movies.

This time around, with director John Woo at the helm, Tom Cruise back, and Robert Towne writing the script, the sequel is considerably easier to understand in terms of story, and the action scenes are some of the wildest and best in years.The story doesn't really matter that much in a film like this.  It's basically James Bond over again, this time with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out to stop former IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) and his henchmen from stealing Chimera, a deadly man-made virus that kills in less than 2 days.  To penetrate Ambrose's security, Hunt hesitantly brings in thief Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to work her charms over Ambrose; she was also his former lover.But not everything goes according to plan, and Ambrose discovers Nyah's real purposes for coming back to him and plans to kill her, but she injects herself with the last strain of the virus.  With 20 hours left, Hunt must retrieve Bellerophon, the virus's only cure, and stop Ambrose from delivering the virus over the world.MI2 is entirely different in style from its predecessor.  It works as pure action entertainment, and it's all the better for it.  Though it doesn't bring in fight after fight from the beginning, it's never dull, with charismatic performances, great direction as usual from John Woo, and some lovely cinematography.Woo's usual over-the-top style is here, with a little more restraint in terms of blood and gore, but there's no mistaking his touch in the film.  His trademarks are here, and as strong as ever.  This film is easily better than the last several Bond movies.  After an entertaining set up, the last 40 minutes are packed with non-stop action, with Woo turning in amazing set piece after set piece.  Whether it's a chaotic shootout in a secret lab, a long motorcycle chase that features a barage of breathtaking stunts (one of Woo's all-time best action scenes, a real compliment), or a climactic martial arts duel on a beach, the last 1\/3 of the film don't disappoint if its action you're looking for.The performances are solid for a film of this genre.  Tom Cruise simply exudes coolness as superspy Ethan Hunt, who is truly becoming an even more compelling hero than James Bond.  Thandie Newton is relatively decent as the love interest, though she's a little nonexistent in the last half hour due to the non-stop action.

It was the first `media war,' it was the first military crisis after the Cold War, and its target, Saddaam Huisein, is still causing problems today. While the war has not been depicted in many movies, after Three Kings, there is hardly a need for another depiction.Three Kings bursts with energy.  The film has a frantic pace that only lets up when we start to realize there is something deeper going on here.  It is not an easy movie to categorize, so I will not attempt to place it in a category.The opening scenes give a hint of the confusion facing the American soldiers at the start of the cease-fire.  Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) is seen running across the desert, only to come upon a man waving a flag.  `Are we shooting,' he yells.  There are elements of great satires from the past, such as Dr. Strangelove and M*A*S*H, at play here, and Three Kings holds its own in this toughest of comedy genre.  It is seen most prevalently in the form of Adriana Cruz, a news reporter, played by Nora Dunn in the film's best performance.The rest of the cast is very effective.  The four soldiers played by George Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jones, have great chemistry as a group.The plot is that of a basic heist movie four U.S. soldiers steal gold bullion from a bunker in Iraq.  After witnessing the conditions of the citizens of Iraq and seeing the cold-blooded murder of an innocent woman, they decide there is something more important to be done.  The result is a completely original shoot-out.  Here we are not shown people shot completely randomly, but instead David O. Russell puts the fight in slow-motion.  We see a strategy emerge, and each hit is as shocking as all the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan.How is this possible?  Russell puts an ingenious sequence in the film where we see a bullet enter someone's body.  It is explained exactly what the effects of getting shot are.  So when we see people getting hit about five minutes later, we know exactly what is happening to them.What is most poignant in the film is the way the Iraqis are portrayed. They have their own stories.  They are rebels fighting a dictator.  Two of them just want to open a barbershop.  Even a member of Saddaam's army is given an incredibly heartbreaking scene where he tells the story of the death of his child.  There are no villains here, just people trying to live their lives.The soldiers' change of mind and heart is truly touching.  They learn the importance of human life and see the horrors around them to come to the conclusion that our government made a grave mistake in the Gulf War.Three Kings is the high point in a great year in film.  Its satire is brilliant.  Its emotional scenes are profound.  It shatters our stereotypes. It makes us look at an important part of our recent history.  It is the best film of 1999.

It is seen most prevalently in the form of Adriana Cruz, a news reporter, played by Nora Dunn in the film's best performance.The rest of the cast is very effective.  The four soldiers played by George Clooney, Wahlberg, Ice Cube, and Spike Jones, have great chemistry as a group.The plot is that of a basic heist movie four U.S. soldiers steal gold bullion from a bunker in Iraq.  After witnessing the conditions of the citizens of Iraq and seeing the cold-blooded murder of an innocent woman, they decide there is something more important to be done.  The result is a completely original shoot-out.  Here we are not shown people shot completely randomly, but instead David O. Russell puts the fight in slow-motion.  We see a strategy emerge, and each hit is as shocking as all the blood and gore of Saving Private Ryan.How is this possible?  Russell puts an ingenious sequence in the film where we see a bullet enter someone's body.  It is explained exactly what the effects of getting shot are.  So when we see people getting hit about five minutes later, we know exactly what is happening to them.What is most poignant in the film is the way the Iraqis are portrayed. They have their own stories.  They are rebels fighting a dictator.  Two of them just want to open a barbershop.  Even a member of Saddaam's army is given an incredibly heartbreaking scene where he tells the story of the death of his child.  There are no villains here, just people trying to live their lives.The soldiers' change of mind and heart is truly touching.  They learn the importance of human life and see the horrors around them to come to the conclusion that our government made a grave mistake in the Gulf War.Three Kings is the high point in a great year in film.  Its satire is brilliant.  Its emotional scenes are profound.  It shatters our stereotypes. It makes us look at an important part of our recent history.  It is the best film of 1999.

It was the first `media war,' it was the first military crisis after the Cold War, and its target, Saddaam Huisein, is still causing problems today. While the war has not been depicted in many movies, after Three Kings, there is hardly a need for another depiction.Three Kings bursts with energy.  The film has a frantic pace that only lets up when we start to realize there is something deeper going on here.  It is not an easy movie to categorize, so I will not attempt to place it in a category.The opening scenes give a hint of the confusion facing the American soldiers at the start of the cease-fire.

This film was such a marvelous blend of action, intrigue, and personality, and I'm sure I'll see it again and again in years to come.Some of the complaints about the movie have been the golden\/brown tint and the quick, disorienting editing.  However, I loved both of these qualities in the movie, though the editing did take some time to get used to.  A great example of it, is when we're introduced to Jing Ke, the assassin.  He is offered an assignment for five thousand, and we see a close up of his face as he demands ten thousand.  The next shot shows him with sword drawn, in the house of his victims.  That whole introduction to the assassin was marvelously edited, in my opinion.  You have to realize that in order to fit the epic plot into just under three hours, a lot of tiny details needed to be cut out.  The quick editing also makes the movie seem much shorter than it really is.Someone said that the swordfighting in the movie (what little of it there was) seemed like high school drama, but I strongly disagree.  Most of the action is captured in a few shots, making it seem much more realistic.  In so many american films, we see a a flash of a dozen close ups, without getting a feel for what is even happening!  Also, the constant use of slow motion in many movies gets so old.  By having the fighting in this movie fast and furious, it is much more affecting.I won't give away the ending, but it was really suspenseful and surprising. I had no idea what would happen (being unfamiliar with Chinese history helped), and was on the edge of my seat!   So, to conclude, if you like sweeping historical epics, make sure to see this!
