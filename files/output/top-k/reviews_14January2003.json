Tarantino's dialogue has a style of fast talking, criminal characters who get involved in violent and often humorous situations. 'Reservoir Dogs' starts off by a monologue from Tarantino himself, as Mr. Brown, commenting on the deeper meaning of the Madonna song Like a Virgin. He talks extremely quickly and the camera pans around the table, showing different people listening to what he is saying. The monologue that Brown gives is almost a culmination of Tarantino's film-making style and of the film. Its ranting, disorganized, and obnoxious.After a stylish opening credits sequence, with Green Paper Bag playing the film cuts to Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) in a car, with Mr. White driving rapidly. Mr. Orange has been shot in the stomach and he is screaming in pain as White repeatedly tries to calm him, eventually yelling at him to say I'm OK!. The scene is extremely gruesome and is used by Tarantino to get the viewer into this sudden change in pace, and be interested in what is going on. White and Orange eventually get to the rendezvous point in an abandoned warehouse when Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) comes storming in, yelling about how the heist the men were planning went horribly wrong. Everything was going smoothly until the police arrived and one of the robbers, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) goes on a shooting rampage, killing several of the employees at the store. As the plot develops, flashbacks for each character's past before the job occur and it is eventually discovered who everyone is. There's Mr. White, a cool type who's done time already and is experienced in the craft. There's Mr. Pink, the ranting, sweaty character who starts of the notion that someone tipped off the police about the robbery and that someone inside the team is a rat. Mr. Blonde is the quiet but psychotic and violent man who in one scene, tortures a man by removing his ear with a blade. Also included is Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney), a renowned criminal and the master planner of the heist. His son is Nice Guy Eddie Cabbot (Chris Penn) who helps in the planning of the heist, but eventually gets involved in the hunt for who ratted them out.With these characters, Tarantino delves into the action headfirst. The heist is never shown, but flashbacks are used to develop the situation before what happened, and dialogue is used to convey what exactly DID happen that went wrong. Its the dialogue of Tarantino's films that are distinct, but unfortunately in the case of 'Reservoir Dogs' - the dialogue isn't very good. While the characters definitely have a lot of style and appeal, the dialogue seems to be an excuse for clever pop culture talks and another excuse for Tarantino to use f*ck in every other sentence. There's nothing wrong with using vulgar language in a film, but at least it needs to be done to add to the plot rather then detract from it (see Taxi Driver and Glengarry Glen Ross). The whole setup of the plot seems intelligent but its rather murky. These characters are as simple as they seem, and nothing more. The performances work, but not on any exceptional level. They basically scream a lot at each other. And swear. While this may seem like a very simple deconstruction of the dialogue in the film, its true. This kind of slang, American language can sometimes be turned into something more effective or intelligent (see Barton Fink) but in 'Reservoir Dogs' its void of that notion. As a director, Tarantino doesn't exactly give a lot. The camera angles aren't anything unusual or stimulating, and while he is able to obtain solid performances from his cast, its not enough to hold up the film.I give some credit to Tarantino for making an entertaining movie, something he always is able to do. I also give him points for the solid performances and the amusing scenes he's able to compose, but overall 'Reservoir Dogs' turns out to be a disjointed and ranting film that doesn't quite go anywhere, and isn't quite as intelligent as it seems.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 January 2003","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Reservoir Dogs' is the debut of writer\/ director Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill), and it shows.

But it had flaws. I really think there are two separate points that bother most people.The first is the way the film deals with faith and predestination. The film takes the beliefs of many Christian groups about predestination to their logical conclusion.The second bigger problem is due to the incredibly bizarre behavior and nature of the aliens, and the very strange reaction of the humans to the invasion.***Spoilers ahead***Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Some things need an explanation or they ruin the entire movie. Yes, I know Signs wasn't really about aliens. But that doesn't mean that the aliens shouldn't make some kind of sense. I'm also willing to ignore things like the baby monitor that picks up space aliens and the book on aliens that is way too accurate. Those are minor things. I'll even overlook how a small boy manages to calmly kill a large enraged dog with a fork. But, some things were just too major to overlook.The aliens were burned and injured by water. That's possible I guess. As I remember it, we are immune to water because proteins don't dissolve readily in water. But it might be possible for life to be based on a substance that did dissolve in water, like sugars or something.But an alien like that wouldn't just go walking around on Earth naked. Even humidity would hurt them. One rainstorm and they would melt away. They would last about as long as a naked human would in the sulfuric acid atmosphere of Venus.Water is very common in the universe, very common. There's no way that any alien species wouldn't realize water was harmful to them. It would be like humans not knowing about ammonia or methane.The aliens crossed thousands of light years and they can't even manage to break into an isolated farmhouse? They didn't have a disintegrator ray gun or even a crowbar? They couldn't find a crowbar? They don't know how to start a fire? Nothing the aliens did in any way exhibited intelligence beyond that of chimpanzees.They just came to Earth, made a few crop circles, harassed people for a bit, then started kidnapping people. All of it seems very, very, implausible and this is from someone that has already accepted for the sake of the movie that there are freaking aliens running around on Earth.I guess I could explain it by speculating that the aliens we saw weren't intelligent and were instead a semi intelligent species that was transported to Earth by the intelligent alien species.But Earth has nothing a star traveling species needs. There are thousands of cubic miles of metal rich rock floating around in space. Water is also very plentiful in space too, not that these aliens need water. The only thing on earth that can't be found in space is life. But what good would this be to Aliens, except in a zoo. OK, so maybe the alien plan was to capture humans and put us in a zoo.I'm really having to stretch here. So far we have sugar based aliens that send their semi intelligent slaves to capture humans for zoo animals. I guess that works. The crop circles might have been something to mark pickup areas to the semi intelligent aliens or something.But the real question is, why didn't the family have a gun? That was a rural are where nearly everyone has a few firearms. Even if they didn't have guns in the house they would have managed to get one from somewhere when the problems started. They didn't even have a good pitchfork or axe to fight with.There's no rational explanation for that.I've always thought that people go to ridiculous extremes to explain things like crop circles, which are obviously man made. Perhaps the intent of this movie was to show how absurd some of those beliefs are. On that level it worked very well.Other than that though, I thought Signs was pretty good.

All of it seems very, very, implausible and this is from someone that has already accepted for the sake of the movie that there are freaking aliens running around on Earth.I guess I could explain it by speculating that the aliens we saw weren't intelligent and were instead a semi intelligent species that was transported to Earth by the intelligent alien species.But Earth has nothing a star traveling species needs. There are thousands of cubic miles of metal rich rock floating around in space. Water is also very plentiful in space too, not that these aliens need water. The only thing on earth that can't be found in space is life. But what good would this be to Aliens, except in a zoo. OK, so maybe the alien plan was to capture humans and put us in a zoo.I'm really having to stretch here. So far we have sugar based aliens that send their semi intelligent slaves to capture humans for zoo animals. I guess that works. The crop circles might have been something to mark pickup areas to the semi intelligent aliens or something.But the real question is, why didn't the family have a gun? That was a rural are where nearly everyone has a few firearms. Even if they didn't have guns in the house they would have managed to get one from somewhere when the problems started. They didn't even have a good pitchfork or axe to fight with.There's no rational explanation for that.I've always thought that people go to ridiculous extremes to explain things like crop circles, which are obviously man made. Perhaps the intent of this movie was to show how absurd some of those beliefs are. On that level it worked very well.Other than that though, I thought Signs was pretty good. ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"14 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Signs is a good movie, and I enjoyed it. But it had flaws. I really think there are two separate points that bother most people.The first is the way the film deals with faith and predestination. The film takes the beliefs of many Christian groups about predestination to their logical conclusion.The second bigger problem is due to the incredibly bizarre behavior and nature of the aliens, and the very strange reaction of the humans to the invasion.***Spoilers ahead***Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Some things need an explanation or they ruin the entire movie. Yes, I know Signs wasn't really about aliens. But that doesn't mean that the aliens shouldn't make some kind of sense. I'm also willing to ignore things like the baby monitor that picks up space aliens and the book on aliens that is way too accurate. Those are minor things. I'll even overlook how a small boy manages to calmly kill a large enraged dog with a fork. But, some things were just too major to overlook.The aliens were burned and injured by water. That's possible I guess. As I remember it, we are immune to water because proteins don't dissolve readily in water. But it might be possible for life to be based on a substance that did dissolve in water, like sugars or something.But an alien like that wouldn't just go walking around on Earth naked. Even humidity would hurt them. One rainstorm and they would melt away. They would last about as long as a naked human would in the sulfuric acid atmosphere of Venus.Water is very common in the universe, very common. There's no way that any alien species wouldn't realize water was harmful to them. It would be like humans not knowing about ammonia or methane.The aliens crossed thousands of light years and they can't even manage to break into an isolated farmhouse? They didn't have a disintegrator ray gun or even a crowbar? They couldn't find a crowbar? They don't know how to start a fire?
