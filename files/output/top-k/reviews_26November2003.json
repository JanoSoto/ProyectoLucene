I am a hard core movie fan\/critic so I'm not easy to please, but I have to say that although this movie was cliche, and predictable who cares????? Most movies are predictable. That doesn't make them necessarily bad films. Drew Barrymore is so charming as the nerdy Josie Geller who at 24 years old gets a chance to go back to high school undercover to write a story about high school.Unfortunately her first time in high school was a total nightmare because she was the class geek and did not fit in. This is her chance to go back in time and get it right. Unfortunately she is quickly reminded that high school doesn't change and she hasn't changed all that much either so when she returns to school she is right back in the middle of her nightmare.Fortunately her brother who also has long since graduated high school comes to her aid and poses as a student assuring her that in order to be popular you only need one person who IS cool that thinks YOU'RE cool and you're IN! She doubts what he says but sure enough on his first day back in school he is immediately the most popular guy in school and everyone knows and loves him.Meanwhile despite all her efforts she is still Josie Grossy. Rob, her brother (who poses as an old boyfriend of josies) tells a bunch of the popular kids that he used to date her and that she's actually really really cool, so like the typical high school lemmings they all follow suit and decide to not only like and accept her, but she quickly becomes the most popular girl in school. Because she has all this natural charm, and now is allowed to shine she has the advantage of not only being accepted by the movers and the shakers, but she has a real advantage because she is very intelligent and let's face it, already been to high school.While this is going on she develops a crush on her teacher, who is gorgeous  ). It's pretty obvious that he is smitten by her too, even before she made it into the popular group. Since her boss (the editor of the newspaper she wrote for) was getting ancy that she still had not completed her feature story (the whole reason she was there in the first place) he decides that she should use this teacher to expose innappropriate teacher student relationships. She ofcourse does not want to do this, but she has not choice.After she is named prom queen, the piest de resistance of high school popularness she spots the cool kids planning a cruel joke on her good friend (who was deemed a geek) and she is horrified. She outs herself as an undercover reporter and tells everyone how she duped everyone into liking her and accepting her all for the sake of a story. Her teacher, Mr. Coolson hears this and realizes he is part of the ruse to be set up for this story and loses all faith in Josie.The end is ofcourse predictable. We all know that Josie and Mr Coolson will get together but so what!!!!! It would have sucked if they didn't. She arranges it so that the media will cover a high school baseball game and writes a story for the chicago tribune explaining her whole story and how a certain teacher was hurt during this experiment, and that she profoundly apologizes and that if he accepts her apology he will come to the game while she waits for 5 minutes on the pitchers mound for him to arrive and give her her first real kiss. So the game is packed and everyone is rooting for her and the five minutes go by and no teacher. It made me cry. Just watching her standing there so hopeful. Finally the crowd cheers wildly and Mr. Coolson runs onto the field and gives her a big smoocheroo. It is just so sweet, formulaic, cliche, predictable......but I just loved it.Who hasn't wished they could go back to high school and do it right this time???? I think everyone, even the cool kids can relate. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2003","score":"","review":"  SPOILERSI've seen this movie a few times now and I must say I just love it.

Dead Poets Society is a graceful and elegant melodrama centered around the coming of age of young prep school boys through the discovery of the souls of dead poets in their classic works.Robin Williams injects much needed levity with bits that absolutely must have been ad-libbed as only he could. The Marlon Brando and John Wayne impressions are simply side-splitting. But it is in his dramatic moments you see that Williams range is far wider than the comedic fare for which he is known. In fact, it is those moments of cunning insight and biting wit that few actors can create where Williams' finest work lies. There is no shortage of such moments here.This is not the typical kids acting like idiots in school lame groaner that most high school films are. It is intelligent and insightful, woven around disparate young men dangerously involved in the discovery of self. And dangerous it is, as discovery often reveals hidden conflict.Robert Sean Leonard is simply stunning. His conflicted portrayal of a boy whose father's expectations are not aligned with his own dreams culminates in one of the most unforgettable scenes in the genre. Ethan Hawke is beautifully brittle as a young boy about to enter his own maturity.If you don't have tears in your eyes at the final scene, you should be forbidden by law ever to watch another movie in your life. So many people live lives of quiet desperation, and if you ever had a teacher, or ever were that teacher, who encouraged young minds to seize the day, this is a film you will always treasure for the towering accomplishment it is.

Annie Proulx, on which it's based.  I assure you, the novel is no better.  If you haven't read the book, the film will encourage your suspicion that Literature  (or Lit'rature, as they say in Oxford and places like it)  has degenerated to the point of extinction.  After seeing the film, you will be astonished that this nonsense, in its novel-form, won the National Book Award.  (Or was it the Pulitzer?)  But then you'll recall that the folks at the National Book Award just gave Stephen King some sort of Lifetime Achievement Award, so how can you say that you're surprised?But this is a review of the movie, not the book, so I'd better get to the point, eh?  First of all, we have Kevin Spacey, who has sadly become the guarantor of bad, maudlin movies.  Here, he plays Quoyle  (pronounced Coil), an apparently half-witted man who, thanks to a plot contrivance, gets involved with a slut played by Cate Blanchett.  You won't believe your eyes when you see Blanchett  (whose character's name is  Petal -- can we get more  lit'ry?)  ride Spacey like a mechanical bull.  Only in the movies . . . and in today's prize-winning lit'rature, I guess. Naturally, the doofus gets the slut pregnant -- enter new daughter  Bunny  (I guess we CAN get more lit'ry).  Well, Petal proves to be averse to family life and -- NOT a spoiler, this is very early in the film -- takes a powder, dying in a car wreck with a new boyfriend.  Hilariously, the police tell Quoyle that Petal sold Bunny to an  adoption slave-ring.  Now THIS is Lit'rature, folks!Judi Dench shows up and steals the ashes of Quoyle's father.  I forgot to mention, Quoyle's parents had died at some point during all this, and Dench is the sister of Quoyle's father.  Which makes her, of course, Spacey's aunt.  To quote Don Henley, Are you with me so far?  Dench spirits Quoyle and Bunny away to their ancestral home of Newfoundland for a fresh start. (Proulx'  choice of setting is a typical lit'ry cliche  New - Found - Land. Get it?)  You're probably wondering why Dench stole her brother's ashes. It's so that she can urinate on them after dumping them in an outhouse toilet.  Ah-HA -- there must be some sort of Deep, Dark, Lit'ry Secret behind all this!This is getting wearisome, so let me wrap it up like a Newfoundland cod. Quoyle gets a job as a reporter for the local rag and meets Julianne Moore, a widow of four years whose single status is extremely unlikely in such a small community.  Meanwhile, the Quoyle family lives in a tied-down house on a cliff above the beach that's so drafty one wonders why they're not all dead from pneumonia by the end of the movie.  Spacey learns how to use a boat, and finds decapitated bodies in the sea.  His daughter beats old dolls to death with hammers, and befriends Moore's retarded young son.  A skinny ghost with a pet lurks about the tied-down house, leaving trash on the doorstep in the dead of night.  Everyone eats squid hamburgers.  One character rises from the dead like Lazarus, thereby ending a salty old curse.  Magic realism, hidden tragedies, broken people -- all the usual ingredients that constitute today's crappy literature.The biggest revelation in  *The Shipping News*  is how good Cate Blanchett looks with her pants off.

Neal (Martin) is still trying to get rid of Del (Candy) and does this time, Neal (Martin) tried to get a car to drive the rest of the way home and it turns out that the car was not there and that someone took it. So how does Neal (Martin) get home and does he??? What does he learn ?? You'll just have to watch it and find out for your self.

So in comparison, Perfect ain't so bad, but there are enough complaints coming from me to make it less than an average rental. Here Travolta plays a reporter for Rolling Stone Magazine who is currently working on two stories one is a serious piece about a computer salesman accused of drug smuggling, while the other is meant to be a lighthearted puff tale of men and women getting together at health clubs. While working on the health club piece, Travolta (whose character's name is Adam), meets an icy Jamie Lee Curtis who refuses to give an interview based on a previous bad experience with a reporter. Will Travolta be able to break through her frosty demeanor? Could it be possible that these two attractive leads might fall in love? Aw, but I don't wanna ruin it for you good folks. That would just be wrong! In any event, while this may seem like a simple plot line, the fact is that there are so many other elements in Perfect that eventually it becomes too confusing for its own good. The movie never focuses long enough on one angle, instead cutting to multiple stories so that we never get enough development on any of them. For instance, there are a bunch of characters who frequent the health club that are meant to be major players in the film, but actually get very little screen time. So when the idea of having them seem important came up, I just couldn't buy it because there wasn't anything to back it up with. If you were worried that Perfect may not show off all of the horrible fashion trends of the 1980s, don't get too stressed. Every bad fashion choice is here, from the leotard that comes with an extremely thin belt (a BELT, ladies?!) to grotesquely short gym shorts on the guys, this movie is an orgy of neon and spandex. Blech, blech, blech! How does Curtis not get a yeast infection from that leotard she's wearing??? Seriously, it looks like it's going to go inside her at any moment, and that is just not cool. There were definitely moments of pure cheesiness and frustration in the film Some songs are played in full, so for 3 1\/2 minutes we are forced to watch Curtis and Travolta sweatin' to the oldies, thus allowing footage of our leading man's nasty package being thrust at the audience to be shown again, and again, and again. In a word Eew. Considering that the movie is two hours in length, I was surprised at how it seemed to drag on forever. Literally, I thought it was almost over when in fact my VCR had clocked in a little under 45 minutes. Groan! Other silly spots Curtis fleeing from Travolta as an 80s version of that old cowboy chase music plays in the background, and Travolta showing up at his office with a baseball bat, ready to kick some butt. Oddly enough, he doesn't get arrested for trashing his boss' office, but he does wind up in jail over his story about the supposed drug smuggler. Speaking of which, I couldn't care less about that part of the movie. With about 40 other characters and subplots to think about, this was the least interesting by far. When it came time for the court to declare its verdict on the drug smuggler, let's just say I wasn't on pins and needles. If anything I was checking the clock again! But compared to other Travolta disasters like Look Who's Talking Now and Moment by Moment (good luck catching that second on video, but I hear it's truly one of cinema's worst), Perfect, again, ain't that bad. 2\/4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"26 November 2003","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Battlefield Earth was, to put it mildly, catastrophic in terms of John Travolta's career.

This is not to say that the film is one of his very best. I could see what Allen was doing, for example, with the scenes and instances of tipping the hat to Fellini and his masterwork 8 1\/2- the two films share that common thread of an artist in an overall funk of bittersweet memories and creative confusion. But while Fellini made his film out of a burning need to reveal all of his love for cinema out of his angst(s) after La Dolce Vita, Allen's track record shows that he's near incapable of waiting around too long to make a film (he's averaged nearly a film a year in 37 years up till 2003) so much of what comes forth in Stardust Memories isn't as much autobiographical as it is told through a character filtered with and not with himself. In short, a lot of the 8 1\/2 dues were my least favorite parts in the movie (though I did like the quick Superman-type mementos).But does that make Stardust Memories a failure, pretentious? Not to my point of view- once Allen starts the story rolling, and he gets his characters\/actors into the gist of the film, it goes along like most other Allen films involving phobias, fears, loves (women), and sophisticated sense of varied parody. There are moments that Allen's stand-up act is injected into the mix, or a scene that could've been a chapter from one of his books, but mostly the audience gets the sense of his OWN love of cinema via Sandy Bates. Bates is another one of those Woody characters that seems all the more impressively formed and executed since it feels like the Woody we know, but Bates is just a little more on the edge of satire, viewing into his own self-doubts and trying to see if there can be any hope or meaning to it all- or if he can tell funny jokes. The script contains some of the most memorable moments of Allen's career in one-liners (there are a few from the fans and autograph-hounds that stick out) and in having a natural flow, close to a type of poetry, in the conversations and dialog in the film. Even if one doesn't laugh, it definitely shows the work of a wonderful writer at the peak of his game. His direction is also intrinsically interesting, especially how he uses the unique, dark, and evoking cinematography by the great Gordon Willis, and the unusual editing stylizing by Susan Morse (though, once again, some of these editing tricks are to Fellini's credit). And the performances work well enough for the material, more often than not, with Charlotte Rampling as Dorrie, Bates' wonderfully stressed ex-girlfriend, Marie-Christine Barrault as Isobel, an old friend who left her husband for him, Jessica Harper as Daisy, whom he falls head over heels for while she and her professor-boyfriend are at the Stardust attending Bates' appearance(s), and Tony Roberts, who had a worthy supporting role in Annie Hall, pops up here as well.I can recommend Stardust Memories for Woody Allen's main fan base, as it gives those who love his early films and his films that have more mature subject matter a bit of a (delightful) challenge. I don't know if I could recommend it however, as the very first film someone could see if the person wants to start of his films. There is an amusing quality to it that could give non-Woody fans a second thought about the filmmaker's work, but it's hard to say. It's not an altogether easy film to watch, or is it a masterwork like Manhattan. By the end of it, never-the-less, my time was not the least wasted, I knew I saw some ingenious scenes and jokes here and there, and there was a subtlety to it that has me liking it and responding more to it on repeat viewings.

This is not to say that the film is one of his very best. I could see what Allen was doing, for example, with the scenes and instances of tipping the hat to Fellini and his masterwork 8 1\/2- the two films share that common thread of an artist in an overall funk of bittersweet memories and creative confusion. But while Fellini made his film out of a burning need to reveal all of his love for cinema out of his angst(s) after La Dolce Vita, Allen's track record shows that he's near incapable of waiting around too long to make a film (he's averaged nearly a film a year in 37 years up till 2003) so much of what comes forth in Stardust Memories isn't as much autobiographical as it is told through a character filtered with and not with himself. In short, a lot of the 8 1\/2 dues were my least favorite parts in the movie (though I did like the quick Superman-type mementos).But does that make Stardust Memories a failure, pretentious? Not to my point of view- once Allen starts the story rolling, and he gets his characters\/actors into the gist of the film, it goes along like most other Allen films involving phobias, fears, loves (women), and sophisticated sense of varied parody. There are moments that Allen's stand-up act is injected into the mix, or a scene that could've been a chapter from one of his books, but mostly the audience gets the sense of his OWN love of cinema via Sandy Bates. Bates is another one of those Woody characters that seems all the more impressively formed and executed since it feels like the Woody we know, but Bates is just a little more on the edge of satire, viewing into his own self-doubts and trying to see if there can be any hope or meaning to it all- or if he can tell funny jokes.
