Still, nice sets of living, insane (!) house and complete lack of exploitative gore\/torture\/filth fantasies- this is attempt at spine-chilling suspense - are plus points in my eyes.

Overall, I liked the movie, I thought it was quite good (if not magnificent). Yes, Hepburn is wonderful, and the part seems custom tailored for her. And let me throw in that I quite enjoyed John Williams, always a favorite of mine, delivering his usual strong supporting performance as the chauffeur.But I fail to see why people think this is a hilarious comedy. It had a few amusing moments, but I would never call it a comedy. To me it came off entirely as a light romance story. But then again, maybe I just wasn't born with the Billy Wilder comedic gene. While his serious films-- Sunset Blvd, Lost Weekend-- have always scored high with me, his comedies-- 7 Year Itch, Some Like It Hot-- have always left me completely flat. I don't know what it is, but it seems to be consistent. The quintessential example is Stalag 17, a movie which I consider almost a frankenstein patchwork of serious and comedic, where I love the serious story, and find the comedic side to be pretty dumb. So maybe I shouldn't be surprised that I didn't find humor in Sabrina. Maybe that's just me, and your take will be different.But what I really want to talk about is Holden and Bogart.I've read a number of reviews here that castigate Bogart's performance, and play up the chemistry between Holden and Hepburn. I didn't see it that way *at all*.Holden comes off as a shallow jerk. Chemistry with Hepburn? He wouldn't give her the time of day, and now he's all hot for her? It's clearly the most shallow of shallow infatuations, I didn't find any real chemistry. Well... *her* performance makes you feel like she has real feeling for him, but he struck me as just turning on the charm for the latest hot babe he's lusting for. Which is what his character *should* be doing. It's a fine performance, but it's not *chemistry*.Where's Bogarts performance is more subtle (and should be). I think he does a *fine* job of working against type. I think he's completely convincing and completely on top of the role when he's playing the businessman. Indeed I *loved* his speech about *why* he busts hump to put through big deals like the plastics deal, beyond just the money. A rare bit of pro-capitalism from Hollywood.So you don't think he had real chemistry with Hepburn? GOOD! He's not SUPPOSED TO! Part of what makes the movie interesting is that you, the viewer, is *never sure* just where he's at with her. Is he really falling for her, as it sometimes seems? Or is it all just an act, as he outlines to his father? The movie wouldn't be half as interesting if we clearly knew what he was up to and where he was coming from. And what's more, the gloomy awkwardness he often displays around her, is entirely appropriate, because it seems that he's not sure himself. He's wrestling with himself. He's growing feelings for her but reluctant to accept or even admit them. And what's more, let's face it, this guy, who seemingly hasn't dated since college, IS going to be awkward with women. You would not *expect* him to have this great charismatic chemistry with her under these circumstances. And yet, there's enough there that I, at least, did find myself pulling for the two of them to get together.So I guess I'm the only one who's *glad* they cast Bogart instead of Cary Grant (despite the fact that I'm a *huge* Grant fan, he's my favorite actor). If Grant had had the role, it would've been obvious from frame 1 that Hepburn was fated to end up with him. With Bogart, we were never really sure *where* it was going. And that makes for a vastly better movie.

That's okay, because this is a movie that would play best on cable TV.Billy Gambini (Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Mitchell Whitfield) are two friends on their way to college. Along the way, they stop at a little shop in small-town Alabama, and after a few misunderstandings (including a forgot-to-pay-for can of tuna), the two of them end up being charged with the murder of the clerk. To avoid getting fried, Billy's mom hires the lawyer in the family, his cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci). Unfortunately for Billy and Stan, not only Vinny new at the job, he has absolutely no idea what he's doing! My first exposure to Joe Pesci was when he played the inept criminal Harry in the Home Alone movies. There he made it clear that he's an adept comedian. If you were to take his buffoonery in that movie, amp it up way past the eleven and throw in a huge does of Fran Drescher from The Nanny, you'd get Vinny Gambini. He's rude, crude, and totally clueless. Fortunately, he's got his fiancée, Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) to help. She may be as Brooklyney brash as he is, but she's no ditz. Marisa Tomei is delightful as Lisa. She's interesting because while she has the energy and the personality of a brainless bimbo, she's smarter than Vinny, and frequently saves his neck from the messes he gets himself into. Fred Gwynne, in his final film appearance as the procedure-loving judge, is perfectly cast. His imposing size and deep voice make him an imposing figure, but Gwynne uses that for humorous purposes. The banter between him and Vinny are some of the film's highlights. The other cast members, Macchio, Whitfield (who is still funny despite playing the stereotypical Jewish neurotic), Austin Pendleton and the late Lane Smith, are good as well.But for all the good qualities it has, My Cousin Vinny isn't that good. It's amusing, but barely diverting. It's one to watch on TV, but not something to rush out and see.
