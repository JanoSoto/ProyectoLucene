This is a funny film, no doubt about it, but there's something so gentle and warm about it. Something that really did hit emotionally in a way I didn't expect. The writing is pretty brilliant, but the performances really do make it work. McDormand is always one of those actresses that can garner sympathy and be likable with so less, and this is no exception. Hudson is a revelation. I haven't seen her in many things, but this is easily the best work I've seen her give. It's an effortlessly effective performance. Fugit is a strong lead, but Crudup could very well be just as fantastic as Hudson. The lack of awards love for him really boggles my mind.

The film ends in a very memorable way. In fact, I shiver every time I think about the ending. It is an ending which should be seen, and not revealed.The movie affected me strongly and also reminded me of the movie bicycle thieves.

The other three of course, who of course aren't nobody's deliver good performances too, but it was Beatty's here that stayed with me as one of the humiliated and raped victims of two rednecks yokels having some fun, which soon backfires nastily, yet really the violence here was kept to a minimum, it almost had me pi..ed to be honest, which as revenge fare, with more blood, it would of been better, as from the viewers point, to really see these fu..ers get what they deserved. Yes, I'm saying these two really deserved to die, for what they did as fun loving friends, Reynolds, Beatty, Voight, and Cox, the not so fortunate one, who I liked too, weren't hurting anybody and were just out to have a good time.

The movie moves at such a nice (some impatients out there, would say a grinding) pace, which I liked, though I guess evben I was slightly irked at this factor, but it made the film more real. What also impressed me was the aftermath, after committing the murders of the yokels, how they dealed with it, and conspired to cover the truth, where in the real world, is how you do it, or how you answer under pressure, when faced with authorities. Yet, still in this situation, I don't really think you could get away squeaky clean, and too these two these creepy yokel cops smelt a lot of suspicion. The last scene with Voight, lying next to his wife on his return home, was almost eerie, in light of what he's been through.

I like the story, the characters, the jokes, and the songs. It's not the best movie, but it's really enjoyable and I have a lot of fun watching it.ANIMATION The animation is...good. Unlike some of our earlier movies, it doesn't really have bright and popping colors, nor does it really showcase China. We get some great visuals of Chinese culture (The Great Wall, white space, Girl Worth Fighting For number), but we don't really see much else. But the designs of the characters are OK, and the backgrounds are nice. All in all, it's good animation.SONGS\/MUSIC The songs here are pretty good, too. I like Please Bring Honor to Us All and A Girl Worth Fighting For, and the sound of China in them. If the animation doesn't totally bring us to China, the music in these songs do. I really like Reflections. It shows us the struggle Mulan is battling in the movie. Of course we all know and love I'll Make a Man Out of You. It's the movie's Number One song those lyrics, that music, the rhythm - it's awesome! I also really love the True to Your Heart song during the credits. It sums up the movie, it's a fantastic song, it has 98 Degrees, and it features FRICKIN' STEVIE WONDER!!! That man wrote and sang the soundtrack to LIFE!!...But I digress. The songs are good.ROMANCE You might be thinking there's nothing to talk about here, there wasn't really a romance here. Actually, this movie has what I think is one of the best Disney romances ever. We get a couple hints that Mulan and Li Shang are developing a romance, but the movie doesn't focus on it. It doesn't try to give us a random, unnecessary romantic moment like The Lion King did. They don't get married, they don't commit to a relationship, they don't kiss, they don't even talk about being in love. But we know what's going to happen, it does happen, but the movie doesn't focus on it at all. I think that's great!CHARACTERS I always thought Mulan and Pocahontas were one and the same. They both feel as though they don't fit in with their environments, they have free spirits, they do something radical to change their cultures, and they're looked at as strong heroines...And it's for that reason I think Mulan is just OK. Don't get me wrong, I really like her, but from an analytical point of view she's just like Pocahontas and other typical strong female characters. I also really enjoy Mushu. He gets a lot of laughs, and I like Eddie Murphy's portrayal of him. But I think my favorite character is the Emperor. Why? Because he's crudded awesome! Did you hear his dialogue?

You'll want to see what they'll do, what sort of people they'll become, and what they'll learn. You'll be rooting for all our main characters, and you'll love them. They are totally worth watching this movie. Of course I wasn't able to write about all the characters, but check out the film and see which ones you like the most. They're pretty good and entertaining. It may not give you a lot of culture, at least nothing new; but give this movie credit, it seems to be making up for the possible racist Siamese cats in Lady and the Tramp. Were those cat racist?

I like the story, the characters, the jokes, and the songs. It's not the best movie, but it's really enjoyable and I have a lot of fun watching it.ANIMATION The animation is...good. Unlike some of our earlier movies, it doesn't really have bright and popping colors, nor does it really showcase China. We get some great visuals of Chinese culture (The Great Wall, white space, Girl Worth Fighting For number), but we don't really see much else. But the designs of the characters are OK, and the backgrounds are nice. All in all, it's good animation.SONGS\/MUSIC The songs here are pretty good, too. I like Please Bring Honor to Us All and A Girl Worth Fighting For, and the sound of China in them. If the animation doesn't totally bring us to China, the music in these songs do. I really like Reflections. It shows us the struggle Mulan is battling in the movie. Of course we all know and love I'll Make a Man Out of You. It's the movie's Number One song those lyrics, that music, the rhythm - it's awesome! I also really love the True to Your Heart song during the credits. It sums up the movie, it's a fantastic song, it has 98 Degrees, and it features FRICKIN' STEVIE WONDER!!! That man wrote and sang the soundtrack to LIFE!!...But I digress. The songs are good.ROMANCE You might be thinking there's nothing to talk about here, there wasn't really a romance here. Actually, this movie has what I think is one of the best Disney romances ever. We get a couple hints that Mulan and Li Shang are developing a romance, but the movie doesn't focus on it. It doesn't try to give us a random, unnecessary romantic moment like The Lion King did. They don't get married, they don't commit to a relationship, they don't kiss, they don't even talk about being in love. But we know what's going to happen, it does happen, but the movie doesn't focus on it at all. I think that's great!CHARACTERS I always thought Mulan and Pocahontas were one and the same. They both feel as though they don't fit in with their environments, they have free spirits, they do something radical to change their cultures, and they're looked at as strong heroines...And it's for that reason I think Mulan is just OK. Don't get me wrong, I really like her, but from an analytical point of view she's just like Pocahontas and other typical strong female characters. I also really enjoy Mushu. He gets a lot of laughs, and I like Eddie Murphy's portrayal of him. But I think my favorite character is the Emperor. Why? Because he's crudded awesome! Did you hear his dialogue? He says some of the most awesome things ever! No matter how hard the wind howls, the mountain will not bow to it.

Over Inge's protests, he changed the play. It went to Broadway where it was successful. Logan was then pegged to direct the film. He brought the play out of the box of the theater and set the movie in an actual town.After the success of Picnic the movie, another Inge play, Bus Stop was brought to film with Logan again directing. This film has obvious similarities to Picnic even though Logan is not listed as writer. In particular, the scenes that occur before they reach the bus stop--with their slice of life montage--and the presence of Arthur O'Connell. Marilyn Monroe replaces Kim Novak as the small-town girl and Don Murray replaces William Holden as the interloper who enters her life.I disagree with those who find Marilyn Monroe's performance lacking. She plays Cherie--at least that's what she calls herself--a chanteuse from the hill county who has created what she thinks is a refined personality. For those who find her accent uneven, I suggest that it is no more real than her name, so it makes perfect sense that it comes and goes, mixed with her hill folk twang.Don Murray's performance is criticized by some as annoying or overly loud. Beau is a farm boy who has probably never talked with a woman, let alone kissed one. His manners are suitable for the barn because he doesn't know any better. His attraction to Cherie (whom he calls Cherry) is like the first crush of a schoolboy, transformative and tempestuous. He is bursting at the seams with enthusiasm. His ideas of manhood are, no doubt, garnered from ranch hands. Jack Lemmon has played a few characters with similar traits--loud and enthusiastic.The original play was much different and, as Inge intended, much darker. It is a story about the essential loneliness of life. The movie has been considerably brightened. No doubt Logan had a large hand in that. When Cherie and Beau are waylaid at a bus stop with some strangers, Beau is forced to confront his caveman ways. Cherie is touched, leading to her revelation about her background. Somehow the bus stop scene is still the central part of the film. The kiss between Cherie and Beau after their transformations is touching and intense (thanks to the contrast with Beau's behavior beforehand).I don't think Cherie's decision at the end is as risky as the decision Madge makes at the end of Picnic, but it still indicates a major change in the character. In the end, Bus Stop goes from over-the-top comedy to a love story.

Then I learned that this movie was directed by the same man who directed one of my favorite movies of all time, Francis Ford Coppola. Yes, the same man who directed the Godfather trilogy (or duo-logy depending on who you ask) and Apocalypse Now is the director The Outsiders. I was so on board with this movie.

How could Francis Ford Coppola, the film-god who has 6 Oscars, take such a beloved story and butcher it like this? How? The movie is an almost word-for-word retelling of the book by S.E. Hilton.

Ralph Mucchio is so poorly directed that I honestly think that he didn't know what he was saying. His emotional scenes are so unbelievable that it's humorous.

Many complain about the lack of chemistry of the two stars, but I think it's a bunch of Barbra Streisand (BS). What these people don't get is that these characters are NOT SUPPOSED to like each other. As far as I'm concerned, Smith & Kline make an entertaining team and are perfectly suitable for this movie.Kenneth Branagh and Ted Levine are also on hand as villains, but it's sassy, petite Salma Hayek who wins the prize for best supporting actor. This is only the second film I've seen her in and she just shines. Salma appears in some attractive outfits, including one with white fishnet stockings, and she's just a beauty to behold.BOTTOM LINE I don't get what the whiners are complaining about with this movie, unless they were uber-fans of the TV series and were expecting a serious film adaption. Wild Wild West is an energetic goofy blockbuster spoof with all the requisite trappings, like 1999's The Mummy and 2004's Van Helsing. I call these types of films big dumb fun movies because they're not meant to be taken too seriously; they're Summer blockbusters and solely exist to entertain & amuse the viewer.

Many complain about the lack of chemistry of the two stars, but I think it's a bunch of Barbra Streisand (BS). What these people don't get is that these characters are NOT SUPPOSED to like each other. As far as I'm concerned, Smith & Kline make an entertaining team and are perfectly suitable for this movie.Kenneth Branagh and Ted Levine are also on hand as villains, but it's sassy, petite Salma Hayek who wins the prize for best supporting actor. This is only the second film I've seen her in and she just shines. Salma appears in some attractive outfits, including one with white fishnet stockings, and she's just a beauty to behold.BOTTOM LINE I don't get what the whiners are complaining about with this movie, unless they were uber-fans of the TV series and were expecting a serious film adaption. Wild Wild West is an energetic goofy blockbuster spoof with all the requisite trappings, like 1999's The Mummy and 2004's Van Helsing. I call these types of films big dumb fun movies because they're not meant to be taken too seriously; they're Summer blockbusters and solely exist to entertain & amuse the viewer. Knowing this will help you appreciate Wild Wild West. So turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in California, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Idaho.GRADE B ","genre":"Action, Western, Comedy"},{"date":"17 June 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie hit theaters when I was 5 years old and, while I thought I had seen it over the years, when I viewed it presently none of it seemed familiar. I found it on the Movies! channel. It uses a unique approach for the script in that the whole elapsed time represented is about 90 minutes, from about 1030AM to Noon on the same day. About the same as the running time of the movie itself.In this small old west town in the 1800s, Gary Cooper (about 50) is Marshal Will Kane. He is an imposing man with a serious demeanor and is credited by townsfolk as having brought the town to respectability, turning it into a place where women and children were safe. But he is retiring, getting married, and moving on, the replacement Marshal will arrive in a couple of days. His bride is very young (about 22) Grace Kelly as Amy.But bad news arrives in town just about as Will and Amy are to get into their wagon and leave. A notorious outlaw that Will had put away for murder some years earlier had somehow been released, and it was clear that the outlaw and three of his cronies were coming to town to get revenge, to kill Will. The outlaw was to arrive on the Noon train into town.That is the core of the story. Will decided, rightly, that it was no use to head out of town, if they didn't get him here then they would track him down, wherever he and Amy went. So he had to stay and deal with it that day. Much to the disappointment of Amy. His job was made more difficult because of the refusal of the townspeople to volunteer as temporary deputies, they were all too fearful. They figured Will would get killed and the outlaws could do what they wanted afterwards. Classic old western movie.SPOILERS As expected the 4 outlaws came into town looking for Will. He was able to shoot a couple of them, but as a third was re-loading his guns at the corner of a building, he was shot dead through the window. Amy had gotten off the train when she heard the shooting, and she shot through the window. In the final showdown the bad guy had Amy in the street, she was able to throw him off balance as Will shot him. Showdown at High Noon and Will prevailed, he and Amy would be able to go off and lead a good life.

Never. The troubled making of it was a disaster, indeed, but the movie is almost a masterpiece and a good film on its own. The ones that came after Cimino's ban from Hollywood are the excellent The Year of the Dragon, the average Desperate Hours, his last The Sunchaser (a nice film for those with eyes to see), and this one The Sicilian, adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel and based on the life of criminal Salvatore Giuliano. In my humble opinion, this is his worst film. Confusing, ineffective and trapped in a weird chaotic fashion with scenes going from good to painfully bad. But it's better to blame on Steve Shagan's script and the studio who trimmed down the film in a few minutes making the story even more confusing than what already is.What we gather is that Giuliano (played by a dreadful Christopher Lambert) and his Sicilian group of criminal peasants cause horror in Sicily stealing land from its rich owners and giving to the poor, working for the cause of making Sicily independent. He defied politics, the church and everyone against his actions. His popularity was so great that even a powerful mafioso (like the one played by Joss Ackland) gave him some support until the day his arrogance for more power drives him off course, and no one's there to help him anymore. I guess this film could be called Salvatore Giuliano The Beginning as it ends from the part where Francesco Rosi's good classic begins with the disastrous and controversial investigation about the mysterious robber's murder, a political criminal that devastated Italy. If built on the same tradition of The Godfather, with substance and greatness it would have turned out to be a great endeavor. However, it all looks phoney, simplistic and we feel as if watching a poor version of Scarface. Another story about a man trying so hard to be a powerful criminal, difference is that he has some ideals of respect, justice and fights for others though he's no hero - but he seems more reliable than all the other corrupted Italian institutions. And in Giuliano's role, Lambert comes off a stiff, unnatural, only pleasing to look at when he's dressed with his elegant trench-coat. Ruined the movie just as much as Barbara Sukowa as the American lady who rapes the gangster.And there are qualities to be found in this Cimino work, qualities that remind us of his previous works. The cinematography bears similarities with the shots captured in The Deer Hunter and Heaven's Gate and Vilmos Szigmond is not the director of photography here yet it looks like one of his works; David Mansfield score has its moments; Mr. Ackland was a strong presence, as John Turturro as well, playing Giuliano's best friend. It's the story that is wrong. I couldn't get anything from it, no life, no truth, nothing new. Worthy of a view? Maybe, out of curiosity. Bear in mind that Cimino lost his mojo with this thing with badly staged scenes (but some horrifying and effective moments as well, demonstrated in the barber's execution in front a whole village after being discovered as a traitor who denounced Giuliano) and no story to work with.

During the first half of the movie, we see Perhan living on the village side with his grandmother, crippled sister and his uncle. Later, more precisely midway through the film, we see the mood of the movie switch dramatically. It starts out as a light hearted comedy, but when Ahmed, the kind of Gypsies, drives through the town to collect crippled children and dwarfs, we see it switch to a more tragic and serious tone. This continues throughout the entire movie, as Perhan decides to Join the caravan, in exchange for healing her sister's leg. As excepted, it all unfolds as a lie story and tragedy- where no one keeps promises and friendship is built on lies.Time of the Gypsies is an amazing visual treat - it shows a healthy amount of surrealism of sound, element, scene and story. Perhan's adventures truly represent the nature of the human heart, a persons loss of innocence, the difficulty of growing up and losing dreams.Two specific parts that affected me very personally and emotionally in the movie, were the dream sequences that Perhan experiences. I believe Time of the Gypsies is one of the best movies to re create dream sequences in a realistic and believable way. The sheer beauty of the scenery and camera work can not be stressed enough. The first dream functions as a transpositions of images; so powerful that it could easily be the single highlight of the movie. The second dream sequence is scenery of madness, depravity and distance from his loved ones. A lot of times, it is very hard to distinguish the dreams from the actual movie, but that is what makes it magical and unreal.After watching the movie, I felt a little bit sad.

What needed to happen is little Buster, played by J. Evan Bonifant, needed a better relationship\/bonding story with Elwood. (Then the part of Jake being gone would have smoothed out easier.) I always said when Buster breaks out the harmonica (it's out of nowhere) - Elwood should have given him a harp before. Like This is the first cool thing my brother (or Curtis) gave me, etc. Then we would assume he started practicing & was a natural. Again, that could have bonded them together. J. Evan Bonifant won me over with his dance moves during Respect. He shows a lot of talent in the film and it could have made the film better.I'm told about 3 hours of film was on the cutting room floor, and that could have happened somewhat. Anyway, having Mac REPLACE Jake was the problem. Letting Elwood mentor Buster, was NOT the problem if you watch & think about what I just wrote.Only my opinion... but it does make sense.

Regardless of your opinion of the man, his life makes for a fascinating subject as we trace his early years as a criminal, his time with the Nation of Islam and his acrimonious break from that group, culminating in his violent death.First of all, Denzel Washington was made for the title role. He not only looked the part; he effortlessly captured the essence of what made Malcolm X a powerful presence. His Oscar-nominated performance was undoubtedly awards-worthy. There were also standout performances in supporting roles from the likes of Angela Bassett, Delroy Lindo & Albert Hall, among others.In the director's chair, Spike Lee successfully brought his vision of an epic biography to the screen. The varied cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and the evocative score by Terence Blanchard (both frequent collaborators of Lee's) were important contributions in this vein. Frankly, it's a bit of a head-scratcher that a film with such impeccable production values only garnered one Oscar nomination in the technical categories (in this case, for costume design). Even Spike Lee was unaccountably snubbed.With a runtime of over three hours, the script provides us with a story that's engrossing enough to captivate our attention from beginning to end. Some of the political viewpoints espoused are questionable to say the least but, ultimately, a compelling case is made for Malcolm X as a positive influence on civil rights. If anything, the openness to showing multiple sides of the man makes the film all the more intriguing.Overall, I think that Malcolm X is a fascinating epic character study in the tradition of Lawrence of Arabia. Awards recognition may have been minimal at the time of release but I think that the movie has definitely stood the test of time, as its 2010 induction into the National Film Registry attests.
