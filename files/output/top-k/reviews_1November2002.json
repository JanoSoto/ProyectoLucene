The plot here is a lazy adaptation of The Shop Around the Corner (with James Stewart).  The idea is so basic that it fails to convince.  The problem is that the whole thing is so damn twee that it just feels to sugary and sentimental to be believable.First off the characters exist in this sort of posh upper-class Manhattan life that isn't like any life I've ever lived.  They live in a warm cocoon that is annoying and not real life for all but the most fortunate elements of New York society.  Secondly the fact they meet in twisted circumstances and is deeply contrived.  This just gets worse and worse and the plot just bends over backwards to allow our characters to do whatever they want.  The final 15 minutes is so unlikely given what's gone before that it is just silly.Hanks is on auto-pilot here doing this chubby faced clowning thing.  He isn't a real character but just his usual good guy caricature.  Ryan is even lazier.  She is so sappy and sentimental that it made me want to b*tch slap her till she just grew up.  Her performance is so very average that I never felt for her situations once.  She was not a real person to me at any point.  Supporting characters are not in effect.  Sleepless in Seattle was not a perfect movie but the support cast was good enough to add some foundation (Reiner, Pullman Pierce and O'Donnell).  Here we have potential &#150; Parker Posey and Greg Kinnear &#150; but they're just not used well at all and add nothing to the film.  It like the film knew it needed to have a supporting cast but just didn't know what to do with them.The film is not bad, just distinctly average and merely passes the time rather than entertains.  Ephron at her best is hard to stomach at times, but on auto-pilot her brand of sentimental romantic `comedy' is barely worth sitting still for.  Lazy and mushy.

Through a series of events (none too ludicrous), he winds up with an offer to be in a new porn film, Orgazmo. Due to his faith, he has obvious doubts. However, he has a sweetheart, Lisa, who sorely wants to be married to Joe in a muslim temple (?), which is fortunately the only inaccruate thing in the film (they don't charge for marriages).Joe meets several Adult film actors-Ben aka. Choda Boy in the film (he bemuses that no one takes his seriously, while strapping a dildo to his head), who becomes a good friend of Joe's during the film.He also meets Candi and Saffi, two female stars.They hang out after work in a sushi bar run by G-Fresh, a Japanese rapper (played by the same actor who played the Nihongin Cheif in Cannibal! The musical) and see a racketeering operation threatening G-Fresh to move out.Later, Ben shows Joe the Orgasmorator. Based on a prop in the porn movie they are both working, the Orgasmorator fires a purple beam into people, causing them to...you know... Ben and Joe take it upon themselves to take out the racketeers and destroy a contract G-Fresh was forced to sign.The next day, Ben finds out that the porno director, Maxxx Orbison is also the head of the racketeering operation. Ben urges Joe to take up the fight again, this time on the Maxxx. Joe declines and then finds his fiancee Lisa back at his condo, for a suprise visit. He is shocked and worried (He has been telling Lisa the money is coming from a production of Death of a salesman). The porno is a huge hit, promting a sequel which Joe reluctantly agrees to, due to an increased pay check (though in the films, Joe only acts and fights-for the love scenes a Stunt Cock is used).However, due to lack of payment, Joe declines to return to work. Lisa is kidnapped and Joe and Ben rejoin and head for a final battle.I won't mention any more except that the end resolution features the I've learned something today... line, also used in Cannibal, BASEketball and all South Park episodes.The film is ironic, because it's a film about crime and porn but it's a completely innocent story-Joe does it for love, takes out the bad guys and saves the day. It also features mild swearing (harsh words but not in harsh circumstances) and brief mild nudity (a man's behind).I found this film extremely funny, with some great moments. The acting is all good, the humour is good natured and at no one's expense and it has a linear and consistant plot.A good film. Hope the Special Edition DVD comes out soon.

Also features the line Now you're so popular you're gonna act in a Hollywood film? Sellout..., an in-joke of course.The game features the opportunity for some great gags-while the opponant takes their shot, the defense can PSYCHE OUT the opponant by doing pretty much whatever they want-the best involve a pair of pliers and Got Milk? (my favourite though was an audiobook of the Horse Whisperer, which sends the opponant into a coma...)The film is good natured, well acted and very very funny. Although the film features many of the background gags that David Zucker's known for (it's very much one of his films), Trey and Matt's great performances makes the film. They are only credited as actors, but their improvisational humour is felt throughout the film.
