ALSO, THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, SO IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM DON'T READ MY REVIEW. Summary The death of his son awakens intense feelings of love, suffering, and humanity in the previously hate-filled Hank Grotowski. Hank meets Leticia, whose son has also died, and the two of them save each others lives from going down the same despair-filled, hate-filled path. THOUGHTS\/COMMENTS Well, I suppose I should start with the sex scene. It's what you're all reading this for, isn't it? The sex scene. All right then, let me see... It wasn't too graphic. It was very graphic, but these two people have been locking up their emotions for a very long time and to tidy up the graphicness would be to tidy up the emotion. So my problem with the sex scene wasn't the graphicness. No, my problem with the sex scene was the acting. It was mainly Berry's fault. Her elaborate hand gestures were too fancy, too choreographed, and they threw the entire scene off kilter. It wasn't that she didn't capture ANY of the emotion of that scene, but she didn't capture most of it. Thornton wasn't very good either in that scene, but I think that's because, in that scene, his character is following Berry's character very closely, and Berry made it difficult (though not impossible) for him to do that by her bad acting. The second sex scene, near the end, was much more well acted, very powerful and moving. The sex scenes near the beginning seemed gratuitous at first; then when you saw the cold impersonality of that sex scene, in contrast to the emotion and spirituality of Hank's sex with Leticia, you understood why the filmmaker had put the earlier sex scenes there. Now for the rest of the film. Well, the script, as I said, was wonderful. It's a truly great script. The detail each line is laden with, the interesting ways the events interconnect, and the profound themes of love, death, hate and forgiveness create an excellent script. Some people say that the script is too incident-based and doesn't have enough flow, but I feel that the script's incident-based quality captures something about the stark lack of communication in Hank's and Leticia's lives. The camera-work is very good, as well. It's a bit too downright, a bit too direct, which causes it to have little room for complexity, but sometimes (for example, when we learn that Leticia's son has died) the downright, direct quality is quite effective and appropriate. I also like how, often, we are unable to see the faces of the characters it conveys the closed-off lives the characters lead. The music and cinematography are good as well, providing a subtle, melancholic mood for the film. The lighting was maybe a bit too staged, though--I'll have to watch again. The acting...Well, let's see. Puff Daddy is abominable we feel no emotion coming from him at all, only dull dreary nothingness. Thornton is very good. Though he never reaches the emotional intensity of Berry's best scene, he sustains a higher level of acting throughout the film, and for that I'd probably say his performance is the best in the film. Berry is unconvincing at majorly crucial moments, but in the scene where she learns of her son's death she's...I just can't describe how good she is, you'll have to see for yourself. Her acting in that scene will make you proud to be a member of humanity...and make you feel a lot of other things. Calhoun, Boyle, and Ledger are good as well. Ledger occasionally becomes too shrill, but mainly does a very good job. The more I watch him, the better he gets. Calhoun and Boyle are very good as well--not Oscar-nod caliber as many are saying, but they are very good. Calhoun's acting has a mature air of elegance which all the adults' acting (especially Berry's and Boyle's) seems to lack. Overall, I liked this film. At first I felt it needed more energy, but by the end of it I realized that it had been slowly building energy for its seemingly quiet but really tremendously powerful climax. I think it had a lot of flaws, but many of the flaws could have been overlooked if Puff Daddy hadn't given such a bad performance. I don't know how to rate it numerically. I'll just rate it very good. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 November 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" FEEL FREE TO SKIM THIS IT'S QUITE LONG.

The Howling III takes place in Australia, where a team of scientists have discovered a tribe of half-human-half-werewolves living in a rural plot called 'Flow' (you get it?). While the government wants to kill this carnivorous clan, the scientists merely want to study where the tribe came from; how did they become a werewolf? What we have is a scientific, though highly bizarre (the main character, an American man, has sex with the other main character, the wolf girl, who gives birth to a little wolf baby and no one seems at all disturbed by it) and rather unique, exploration of werewolves that I have only really seen done in a similar way with zombies in Romero's Day of the Dead (where the crazed scientist wanted to know about the psychology of zombies). The story is indeed, only somewhat captivating, especially if you like traditional werewolf tales and lots of action. Supplanted, instead, is lots of scientific jargon about this particular tribe. Your not faced with the kind of eerie werewolf transformations or malevolent shadows lurking in the dark, which were essential elements of the first in the series, and many of those that followed (in fact, probably all that followed other than part 3). Indeed, the special effects crew, does not leave you hanging with too much technical information, and offers a few transformation sequences, but which pale in comparison with many werewolf films (even the bad ones). There is a sequence in the movie where the main character, an American, takes the strange Australian wolf-girl (in human form) to a horror movie. It is a shoddy werewolf movie, and one done so badly, you might actually laugh (I think that was the point, anyway). The werewolf costume looks so stupid, but many of the transformations in the movie do model it quite closely.I would say that if you're in the mood for something different by way of werewolf tales, then this may be just right for you. If you enjoy all the pulsating action and incredible scenery and special effects of the first Howling, or of any other fantastic werewolf film, then you might find yourself rather bored at times (if not bored entirely with the whole thing), and possibly amused here and there by getting something different (in this story, the werewolf tribe descended from dingos and they are marsupials), though not very 'scary.'However, before recommending this movie, I must warn prospective viewers that, about three quarters of the way into the movie, the picture dramatically shifts gears and turns into an absolute cheese fest, complete with dreamy unfocused shots and orchestral score. This, too, is about the point when the story becomes slightly confusing, as though the filmmakers had run out of ideas at this point. The main characters return to America to raise their marsupial child while the scientist and his werewolf mate stay behind in the isolated town to raise their children. While, up to this point, the filmmakers may have been able to sustain my attention at least with some of the uniqueness in story (though somewhat lacking on craft, nonetheless), this point in the film nearly had me laughing this completely bizarre and rather sudden turn in the story. The remainder of the movie is totally lost by this point. Not to mention, it ends too abruptly.

This, too, is about the point when the story becomes slightly confusing, as though the filmmakers had run out of ideas at this point. The main characters return to America to raise their marsupial child while the scientist and his werewolf mate stay behind in the isolated town to raise their children. While, up to this point, the filmmakers may have been able to sustain my attention at least with some of the uniqueness in story (though somewhat lacking on craft, nonetheless), this point in the film nearly had me laughing this completely bizarre and rather sudden turn in the story.

The Howling III takes place in Australia, where a team of scientists have discovered a tribe of half-human-half-werewolves living in a rural plot called 'Flow' (you get it?). While the government wants to kill this carnivorous clan, the scientists merely want to study where the tribe came from; how did they become a werewolf? What we have is a scientific, though highly bizarre (the main character, an American man, has sex with the other main character, the wolf girl, who gives birth to a little wolf baby and no one seems at all disturbed by it) and rather unique, exploration of werewolves that I have only really seen done in a similar way with zombies in Romero's Day of the Dead (where the crazed scientist wanted to know about the psychology of zombies). The story is indeed, only somewhat captivating, especially if you like traditional werewolf tales and lots of action. Supplanted, instead, is lots of scientific jargon about this particular tribe. Your not faced with the kind of eerie werewolf transformations or malevolent shadows lurking in the dark, which were essential elements of the first in the series, and many of those that followed (in fact, probably all that followed other than part 3). Indeed, the special effects crew, does not leave you hanging with too much technical information, and offers a few transformation sequences, but which pale in comparison with many werewolf films (even the bad ones). There is a sequence in the movie where the main character, an American, takes the strange Australian wolf-girl (in human form) to a horror movie. It is a shoddy werewolf movie, and one done so badly, you might actually laugh (I think that was the point, anyway).

He not only has the ability to push his actors, but also create these amazing visuals that transport us deep into the setting of the film. He has mastered the cinematography of nearly every picture he has done, giving us these beautiful shots of the world that we may never see in our lifetime. Several of his films enhance my DVD collection like Crimson Tide and True Romance, but sadly Spy Game will not. While Scott does wonders with the actors, scenes, and camera angles, it is the story that is ultimately flaws this film. The lack of coherence, consistency, and structure take this Tony Scott film and transform it into just your average Hollywood spy film. It had the potential to reach new levels, and there were several scenes that I loved, but I just couldn't believe the story. Let me explain.My biggest issue with this film was the lack of aging from our two main characters. This film spans a timeframe of about sixteen years, and throughout the course of that time neither Pitt nor Redford age. Director Scott chose not to use CGI or younger actors for the parts when they were in Vietnam, so as the time progressed in the film, our main actors did not. This was a huge hurdle to overcome since I wanted to enjoy this film. I did not see the mission where the discovered the fountain of youth, so I can only assume that this was some bad judgment on Scott's part. Redford and Pitt should have aged more than what they did in this film allowing us to see the emotion and sheer force behind their eyes.Outside of this point it was your average Hollywood action film. Large explosions and violence countered with a sneaky Sneakers-esque style subplot overshadowed the plot. Pitt was nothing more than the muscle of the operation, and Scott gave us nothing to build more upon his character. I fault the writer of this film. I believe that the homework was done correctly, just not structured correctly. Perhaps it was just me, but I had trouble following some of the missions. I realize they were necessary, and possibly not rocket science, but the scene with Charlotte Rampling made no sense. Maybe I missed a part that was crucial in some way, but overall it just seemed like there was more jumping and fighting than actual plot. I felt as if the love interest was randomly placed through the film. I realize that Pitt was not one to follow simple commands, but I felt early on in this film that he would have the ability to walk away from a woman if needed. Spy Game suddenly went from smart espionage film to 'master has to fix newbie's mistake'. This felt strange to me because throughout the film Redford continued to speak about having the upper hand, and not straying from the point. Yet, when Redford was faced to save his friend, he did just that. Was he learning from his pupil? If so, it was not very well spelled out and a very weak point.Outside of the story, director Tony Scott gives yet another beautiful film. The cinematography is outstanding. I loved the way that he kept us, the audience, in suspense as to what time it was and how much time they had to save Pitt's character. The black and white flashes followed by the time were inventive and it seemed to work. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Scott controlled this film and it was a pleasure to see that. There is no doubt in my mind that he is the master of the action genre and that more scripts should be coming his way. I hope they are more inventive than this outing and have at least a bit more meat on their bones. Overall, I thought this was an average film. I am disappointed because there are better than average films that Tony Scott has released, I am ashamed to ask why this film was not one of them. Pitt was solely used for the purpose of his strength (and to capture the attention of a younger female audience) while Redford was used mainly for his dashing good looks (and to capture the attention of the older female audience). Once you realize this point than this film will fall into place.

I'm going to try not to repeat in detail what the other reviews have said. This movie scared the crap out of me when I first saw it age 12. All the horror movies I had seen up to that point were of the Saturday afternoon schlock variety, and were easily dismissable; this was my first somewhat adult horror movie, and it left a lasting impression.Because of that impression, it's hard for me to put myself in the place of a first-time adult viewer. It's certainly somewhat dated in it's dialogue and it's themes (except that it may have been the very first major studio movie to have lesbianism as an explicit element in its plot); certainly the the idea of a serious exploration of the supernatural was much fresher in 1963 than it is now. This takes a lot of the punch out of the subtheme of the young skeptic Luke coming to accept the possibility of the supernatural. That simply does not resonate now as it must have in 1963. I'm willing to bet that for many moviegoers in 1963, this movie introduced them to the terms ESP, poltergiest, and psychokinesis. I want to comment on the influence of the movie on popular horror. It is well-known that it was a major early influence on Stephen King. He paid homage to it in the book *Carrie* by recapitulating the stones-falling-on-house episode in Eleanor's past, transferring it to Carrie and her mother. More importantly, *The Haunting* was quite obviously the inspiration, even, I would say, a template, for *The Shining*, just as King mined *The Monkey's Paw* for *Pet Sematary* (let's face it, King is nothing more than a very gifted reprocessor of classic horror tales). *The Shining* is pretty much *The Haunting* with blood and with the main character's madness turned outward, rather than inward. Other influences, besides the later rip-offs and the hideous remake, obviously include *The Exorcist* and *Poltergeist*. The real strength of the film, and it's real contribution to modern horror, IMO, is it's uncanny ability to depict the *numinous*, that is the peculiarly unfleshly, otherworldly, aspect of the supernatural. Although quite rightly left unstated in the movie, by the end we have the sense that what probably haunts Hill House is not so much a collection of individual ghosts, as it is some sort of unimaginable dark spiritual *force* or entity, built up out of the accumulated tragedy and bad karma, if you will, of the house. I think the central horror is summed up in Luke's line toward the end when the whole group is bottled up in the parlor, and he tries to prevent the doctor from opening the door, saying, I don't know what that is out there, and I don't want to find out. We, in the audience, both want to know, and we don't want to know. We have the sense that whatever it is, it's more horrible and unsettling than whatever we can imagine it to be. It's that idea, along with the horror of Eleanor's self-destruction and absorption into the house, that give the film it's power.Aiding this, of course, is the impeccable location chosen for Hill House (Ettington Manor, in the Cotswolds, England, in answer to a previous poster), the pioneering sound effects, the fantastic cinematography, and the evocative music score. A drawback is the sometimes quaint and heavy-handed dialogue (I *hate* it that Dr. Markway at the end is made to say, Hill House *is* haunted!; we'd like to come to that conclusion ourselves, thank you). 9 out of 10.

There are films that define a genre. There are films that define cinema. 'Lawrence of Arabia' defines all of the above. Within its frames 'Lawrence of Arabia' captures the essence of a man, a time and place with unparalleled cinematic magic. Though a winner of 7 Oscars and one of the Top 100 ticket sellers of all time, most people were not able to see 'Lawrence of Arabia' the way it was intended until 1989 (and I still imagine most people have only seen it during one of its annual Christmas TV viewings). Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and Robert Harris deserve massive applause for their efforts to restore this film to its 2.201 widescreen, 220 minute glory. I, myself (thankfully) have never seen any other version of this film. So when I first saw the film it was in its untainted glory and it's an experience I shall never forget. Never before had I seen a film that blurred the lines between storytelling and art so much. Never before had I seen a film so assured in visual storytelling. Never before had I been so transplanted into a film's world. The awesome acting, the stupendous story, the remarkable visuals, the sublime script, the fascinating dialogue and majestic music all combine to make a film like none other.'Lawrence of Arabia' is played out in five acts, each one of them represents a different part of Lawrence's psyche. The first act is Lawrence's introduction into Arabia where he is very much an Englishman &#150; albeit an outcast. The second act concerns his assimilation into Arabia, the taking of Aqaba and his rise to deity. The third portrays Lawrence at the peak of his military career and his growing egotism. The fourth act is his capture, torture, mental breakdown and dissertation of his troops. The fifth concerns his comeback, revenge and both his greatest and most flawed accomplishment the slaughter of Turks and the liberation of Damascus. Every scene in these acts is essential to the development of his persona. Lean and Bolt raise the question of who Lawrence was, but they never answer the question. This is one factor that brings me back to the film time and time again &#150; each time I watch the film I am left with a different perception of Lawrence's character.The film contains an all star cast including Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains. Only 'JFK' rivals it in my view. Of course, there was been many all star casts that haven't performed to their usual standards, but it is not the case here. Everyone is on top of there game especially Peter O'Toole who gives the greatest cinematic performance I have ever seen. From extremes of joyous extremes and heated contempt he dominates the screen with undeniable screen presence and charisma. Many an actor would be lost on screen amidst all the sand, but O'Toole never is. Watch Lawrence's scene in the mess hall near the beginning then watch his immense 'No prisoners' scene &#150; the change is remarkable. Omar Sharif is also superb and it is easy to see why he became a big international star following his charismatic performance.I have never been a fan of desert films and find the majority of them boring, but Freddie Young's 70mm widescreen photography brings the desert alive in such an exciting and absorbing way. The film is simply full of memorable and beautiful scenes such as Sharif's introduction, the long pan over the assault on Aqaba or the glorious reveal from a purple flag of Lawrence and Sheriff Ali leading their final army. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is a unique visual experience and one you will not forget in a hurry.Although it comes in at over three and a half hours, 'Lawrence of Arabia' never lulls and if not for the forced DVD intermission I doubt I would move at all while watching it. The innovative editing (including some of the most famous examples of direct-cutting) keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. There are no gratuitous scenes. Every scene is a required piece of the puzzle. Maurice Jarre's phenomenal music also helps keep the film going. I'm sure some of the scenes of people crossing the desert would have been tedious without his music, but with his majestic music transplanted over the images they are simply compulsive viewing. The epic action scenes are breath-taking in their scope and execution. But what gives them their impact is that Lean (perhaps limited by censorship laws) is not concerned with the visceral thrill of battle, but rather the effect they have on the battlers. What drives men to war and what do they get from it. And thankfully the action scenes are succinct and progressive with no blasted shaky-cam or CGI troops. Everything you see on screen is real and was performed, which just adds to the gob-smacking sense of the shots. It is this sense of realism that deepens the experience.If one's respect for 'Lawrence of Arabia' is not enamored after viewing the film, perhaps it will be when thinking that we will NEVER see a film like this again. No studio would take the risk of a project this big that excludes many of their 'key demographics' and 'film rules'. There are no talking parts for women. There is no love interest. There is no happy ending. 'Lawrence of Arabia' a product of Hollywood showing its balls, which for many a year it seems to have lost.

When they get there, the crew are shocked to discover there are only two survivors, Dr Morbius and his daughter Altaira plus, of course, Robby the Robot. Altaira hasn't seen any other human apart from her father until some of the crew arrive at the residence. After learning what had happened to the others and being shown round the residence, a giant invisible monster attacks the spaceship and kills a crew member. The following night, a force field and radar is set up so the crew are ready for the beast and when it 'appears', we get to see its outline though the laser gun fire. More men are killed and then it 'disappears'. The captain then goes to fetch Morbius, Altaira and Robby but the monster attacks and breaks through the thick steel doors and Morbius is killed. Through all this, the Captain and Altaira fall in love.Forbidden Planet is beautifully shot in colour and the special effects are excellent.

When they get there, the crew are shocked to discover there are only two survivors, Dr Morbius and his daughter Altaira plus, of course, Robby the Robot. Altaira hasn't seen any other human apart from her father until some of the crew arrive at the residence. After learning what had happened to the others and being shown round the residence, a giant invisible monster attacks the spaceship and kills a crew member. The following night, a force field and radar is set up so the crew are ready for the beast and when it 'appears', we get to see its outline though the laser gun fire. More men are killed and then it 'disappears'. The captain then goes to fetch Morbius, Altaira and Robby but the monster attacks and breaks through the thick steel doors and Morbius is killed. Through all this, the Captain and Altaira fall in love.Forbidden Planet is beautifully shot in colour and the special effects are excellent. The electronic score is very eeire.The movie has an excellent cast Walter Pigeon (Mrs Miniver, Voyage To the Bottom of the Sea), Anne Francis, a young Leslie Nielsen and Warren Stevens.This movie is a must see for all movie fans.

Part performance art, part low-key workout, Stop Making Sense benefits from a set of 16 quality songs, an ever-changing visual style that never loses its inventiveness, and a lead performance by David Byrne that has to be seen to be believed.He jogs around the stage. He bends his body in weird contortions. He puts on a really big suit. From the beginning to end, he has his shirt collar buttoned to the top like a Catholic schoolboy, and I'm not sure how or why.How and why are words that pop up a lot while watching this. Talking Heads were weird even for the punk\/new wave crowd; they wore their hair like accountants, mined everything from disco to doo-wop to African exotica for their sound, and pulled off the trick of being both mocking and reverential. So whether it's Byrne dancing with a living-room lamp or words like facelift and sandwich appearing on screen, the viewer is well advised to follow the advice of the title and just let the goofy, heady mess roll over you. You'll probably find yourself having a bit of fun.It helps if you like their music. You don't hear much of it these days it seems. People know Life During Wartime and Once In A Lifetime, while Take Me To The River and Burning Down The House were Top 40 hits in the U.S. But the most familiar tune here is probably the one non-Talking Heads song, Genius Of Love, which is performed by the band's Byrne-less incarnation, the Tom Tom Club. That's because Mariah Carey sampled it (read sang over it) for one of her big hits, Fantasy.Frankly, the band as individuals aren't all that interesting. They don't play off each other or the audience in any way, leaving it to Byrne to sell each song. Jerry Harrison, one of the four Heads, seems AWOL even on the middle of the stage. Bringing up a few session players like Bernie Worrell, the P-Funk keyboardist, helps the film avoid this boring white guys playing their music trap at least somewhat, though if the mission of this film is to introduce us to the Talking Heads, it's certainly no Hard Day's Night or Last Waltz.But the songs are good, and Byrne works through his bemused detachment to become quite passionate on some selected numbers. His Once In A Lifetime is one of the great screen performances of 1984. Goofy lighting sets up Swamp and What A Day That Was and there's oddball tricks aplenty throughout. I like the lower-key Heaven, a wistful number about a place where nothing ever happens which Byrne delivers with the right amount of grace while bassist Tina Weymouth delivers some solid accompaniment.I see a lot of times where the notes being played or hit don't correspond with what's on screen. The film was shot over a period of days, and then edited together, but judging from the perfect quality of the performed pieces, I sense some post-game sweetening went on. But it's a nice piece to watch, very sublime, and the new DVD treatment is a decided gem worth having. You'll wish you were back in the 1980s when the Heads were the newest thing, though they never really got old. At least they will always be fresh and alive and together on Stop Making Sense.

Suspension of disbelief is allowed when you're watching a sci-fi movie and it comes to laws of physics to be stretched, as long as the world presented is coherent. But the same does absolutely not go for characters and their actions and development through the movie.Awful acting, spoiled further by even worse treatment on the cutting room floor, unconvincing scenes, immaterial detail and too little substance plague the movie beyond comprehension. There is little coherency between what the characters do and why they should be doing it. H.C. is a well-below-average actor with a pretty face (or is it just the directing\/cutting? - Nah, he's bad), Amidala - bad & stiff, Ewan - ruined by cutting and awful dialogue (I felt sorry for this fine actor to have to belch out Lucas's nonsensical dialogue), Liam Neeson - same fate as Ewan. Now, a good director gets the best out of his actors. I am tempted to blame it on the director, but the actors are simply not all up for the job.Shallow emotions! Oh, god. Every scene that has got to be emotional to be believable is shallow and has a terrible dialogue. There is not a single emotional scene that is credible.I wonder about one thing Why does the movie do so well and why do people rank it 10 by the thousands? It is tempting to say that the public is blind or stupid, but it's more complex than that. Out of respect for the first three movies and blind devotion to a failed and dead sci-fi leader. Respect for a 25 year old sci-fi authority should weighs heavily. Lack of understanding. Denial. Denial. And then some denial - Nobody wants to admit that the old trilogy is being violated by an increasingly appalling prequel. A lot of voters are probably children (and fall for the funny looking animals and kids flying spacecrafts) who will hopefully develop their cerebrum enough in the coming years to see how bad this movie (and Phantom Menace) is.The movie is fun for 8-13 year olds. That is probably undisputed. But that is a drastic step backwards from the original SW trilogy which could be watched and enjoyed by grownups as well as children. Something important went missing in the intervening years. Proper directing for one.Positive Attack of the Clones paints a pretty picture to some really nice musical score and that's about it.

While the whole story has very limited plausibility, it has its own internal logic and consistency, rather like the better of the more manic screwball comedies of an even earlier era.The submarine setting is used creatively, and it has just enough realistic detail to keep it from getting too silly. Grant and Curtis have rather different styles, yet they work well together in setting the right tone for everything, and in involving the rest of the cast. While it would be hard to single out any of the other cast members, since none of them have a particularly large or important role, they all do well enough, and they make the secondary characters a solid part of the story.There are plenty of amusing highlights, such as the pink paint and Curtis's scrounging expeditions. For all that it is just fluff, it fits together well, making for an entertaining, unpretentious movie.
