I was expecting something different. Well, If you like special effects, then you will definitely enjoy it. But if not -and that is my case, I have to admit- you will most likely find it boring and too long. The first thirty minutes of the movie are just a huge display of special effects showing the development of one of the most important battles during the II WW. Yes, it is very well-made but this half an hour doesn't add anything at all to the movie. I am still wondering what is the goal of so much time devoted to that battle- I think the best answer is an excuse for displaying all the special effects. Once those minutes had finished, I hoped the rest of the movie would be something different, and it looked like that was going to happen, but not for a lot of time. When something interesting was finally going on and there were some interesting dialogs, once again the same more shooting, more noise and more deaths... Anyway, my vote was a 7 apart from all those long unnecessary scenes, the movie is quite good some interesting dialogs, as I said, an interesting plot and, above all, some great performances, especially from Tom Hanks.

There was no fault in wishing to share The AbsentMinded Professor with a later generation, but it had to be remade. With Robin Williams replacing Fred MacMurray, the professor could be more boisterous and physical. With 1997 replacing 1961, the special effects could be much more sophisticated. So it's win-win, right? No, but a few things did go right. Two things, actually. Robin Williams had one good scene. In the opening, Dr. Brainard is introduced as a man who is so out of touch with his surroundings that he could step into the wrong lecture hall and deliver an elementary physics lecture to an art class. Other than that, the role and the actor were forgettable. Also, the Danny Elfman soundtrack was very lively, particularly the Flubber Rumba.This time around, the flubber has anthropomorphic properties. That change was simply an excuse to have the computer-animated dance scene, which was fun in a Scrubbing Bubbles kind of way. Other than that (and color), the special effects fell considerably short of the 1961 version. When people fly, they look like they are hanging on wires. When they fall, they look like they are hanging on wires. When they bounce -- well, you get the pattern.These days, movie makers are free to do quite a few things that were not allowed in 1961. Unfortunately, many of them feel a need to remind us by including a gratuitously vulgar scene in everything they release. This time we get a man blowing flubber out his rectum.

Watch the film first, eh.Body Heat is an odd little gem found, in my case, with no preamble on late-night TV. What's this, I thought? William Hurt in a 1940s-era film, complete with long sleeves\/tie\/hat in a sweltering heatwave? But the cars looked vintage 1970s, as did the phones. So where was the aircon? Obviously a contrived plot device to emphasise the oppressive nature of the heat, climatic and climactic, and one that irked me throughout. Clearly the director wanted a film noire atmosphere and it generally worked. Except for the lack of aircon!Anyway, I loved the initial verbal tango between Hurt and Turner. When Hurt tries to strike up a conversation with Turner, she tells him she's not looking for company. He asks what that means. I'm a married woman, she says. Then you should have said 'happily married' he replies. That's my business, says she. What is, he wants to know. How happy I am, is the reply.How could you not love a film like this?Admittedly, the similarity with the famous film noire titles (Double Indemnity; The Postman Always Rings Twice) made me feel as if I'd seen the film before. But Body Heat was sufficiently engrossing--and Hurt was sufficiently compelling, despite being the ostensible bad guy--to keep me watching to the end. Really felt for the Hurt character as he began to realise that the infatuation in his life--the woman for whom he became a murderer--had cold-heartedly framed him.Then, later, when he found that telltale wire on the door, he learned that she had set a bomb to murder him. He knew all this when she returned to the house and, recovering quickly from not finding the shed burning and emergency crews out the front, professed to love him and promised that they would now have everything they wanted. Broke my heart to see the look on his face as he witnessed her treacherous performance while still, deep down, being in love with her. Wonderful performance, and all the more powerful because he didn't resort to the stereotypical rage\/swearing\/violence so often expected of male characters showing great emotion.Anyway, I love William Hurt in virtually everything, although I was never a Kathleen Turner fan. Know her mainly from Romancing the Stone, and confuse her with Cybill Shepherd. Except, as I've now learned from Body Heat, Turner is the one with the tiny breasts. So now I can tell the two apart -) If you've noticed an absence of detail about the Turner femme-fatale role it's because, until the last scene, the story is told from Hurt's perspective and all we know of her is what he knows. So she's pretty much a mystery to us too. I honestly think any cool blonde could have played this role adequately, although Turner does have that seductively deep voice. Plus, I'm a Hurt fan and so possibly a little biased.The supporting cast is a treat too. We were well into the film before I began wondering why the Ted Danson character looked familiar. Wow, he was so young and lithe then. (There's an understated but touching moment when he warns Hurt that he's under suspicion. Rather than feeling anger at being deceived by Hurt, he projects disappointment and sadness, as if he's lost a good friend.) And who was that ex-convict and expert on arson? Mickey Rourke. I'd heard he'd been good-looking in his youth and this film confirms it. (What happened to you, Mickey?) Only two scenes and yet every line he utters sounds utterly compelling.The film is dated in the most wonderful sense it gives you a taste and feel of what modern film noire could have been like if Hollywood hadn't discarded real storytelling for graphic violence and special effects.

Using fractured time sequences, delirious flashbacks and a reflective narration to illustrate an anti-hero's perilous obsession with following strangers, Following incorporated a variety of props, things and fragments of décor in the noir iconography that were underscored, naturally, by the film's 16mm black-and-white stock. These narrative and visual ambiguities would serve Nolan well in Memento. The cerebral psycho' thriller that would (1) defy the conventions of narrative cinema, (2) throw up a marvellous prism of manifold meanings and interpretations and (3) become a full-fledged classic of modern cinema.With its wrong-way-round narrative structure, Memento is a maze-like, many-mirrored movie that's designed to absolutely stump the viewer. It's an often dark, sometimes light affair without a sense of time or place and without an air of fidelity or even resolution.Beginning with the end, Memento, put simply, is a revenge tale in reverse that maps out onetime claims investigator Leonard Shelby's (Guy Pearce) path to kill the man who brutally raped and murdered his wife. The plot is not configured in this manner to merely show-off, though. There is a reason. For during the attack, Leonard suffered a costly blow to the head which rid him of his ability to make new memories. Don't confuse this with amnesia, though. He remembers everything prior to the incident, just nothing after. Imagine something along the lines of short-term memory loss. Alas, Leonard's forced to place what little trust he has in pictures of people and places as well as personal notes and tattoos that serve as reminders with regard to his progression in his manhunt.Leonard's disability is pretty much beyond comprehension. Nolan demands via the fragmentally restricted narrative that we attempt to twig it on some level though. Which is why the plot make-up serves as kind of empathizer between us and Leonard. We're deliberately made to feel as confused as he is, so much so to the point that you'll begin to question your own views regarding every motive, detail, scene and character, Leonard included.Opening with an extreme close up of a Polaroid un-developing, Memento's pattern of narrative progression is best described in terms of the film being divided into two main visual and stylistic categories.The colour sequences take a subjective view on Leonard's quest as we witness the events that lead to the incident in the opening scene in reverse order. Each of these sequences, however, are spliced with objective, documentary-like monochrome sequences of Leonard discussing the details of his condition, his investigation and experience with a former client who suffered from a condition similar to his. These black and white scenes would appear to be in chronological order but at what point in the tale are they taking place? After the events in colour? Before? During? It's purpose in time does become apparent towards the end, well it's really the beginning but whatever- the final transition from chrome to colour is quite sublime.The beginning of each coloured segment, then, acts as the end of the next. So every time a colour sequence is interrupted by a black and white one, the following colour sequence will map-out how Leonard got to the start of the colour sequence you saw last. Sounds confusing and believe me- it is, but you can't help but marvel at the film's ingenious scope and after a half hour or so, you'll all but get the hang of it.Underpinning the film, in true noir style, is Pearce's unreliable yet commonsensical narration which guides us through the ground-breaking noir labyrinth with a cool and sometimes satirical tone. On his backwards journey, we encounter a variety of dodgy characters who appear to be out to support Leonard just as much as con him. From shady cop Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) to barmaid Natalie right down to motel clerk Burt, everyone appears to be out to exploit Leonard's condition on some level to reek their own benefits, Leonard included.Sprinkled with sardonic moments and noir-esquire wit, the ambiguous script and performances further invite viewers to piece together a puzzle they may never be able to fully solve. And for this air of blissful uncertainty, Nolan has Pearce and Pantoliano to thank a great deal. How do you play a character with no memory? No ark? Spontaneously, I guess. Whatever the Aussie's methods- his performance within the role of Leonard is unforgettable. A poor choice of words, perhaps, but it's an appropriate lexicon when looking at Pearce's emotionally tangled performance. Honesty within dishonesty, idiocy within intelligence, Pearce's chameleonic quality means sheer purpose in a three-piece-suit which breathes new life to the cinematic anti-hero. As for Pantaliano, the casting of the coveted actor renowned with antagonistic roles is one of the film's numerous masterstrokes. Comical, deviant, sarcastic, cunning- Pantaliano's Teddy is an ideal metaphor for ambivalence- he's as much the anti-villain as Leonard is the 'hero.Adapted from brother Jonathan's short story Memento Mori, Christopher Nolan's Memento could've been far too clever for its own good. That's a fact. But it isn't. OK, it throws up all kinds of riddles at the end, many of which will invite numerous answers and interpretations. This, though, is the mark of any good thriller- film noir or not. You know the kind of film that after watching, you just can't help but watch again? That's Memento. The kind of film you'll find yourself yapping about to friends, colleagues and complete strangers for months on end? Memento. The film that whenever you hear its name, you'll be quick to join the conversation, offering your opinions and views. You see where I'm going with this. Christopher Nolan's irresistible indie labyrinth is a bona-fide masterpiece of modern cinema that proves impossible to forget. It's a film like no other that remains, in my opinion, unparallelled in terms of style and originality since its release some 8 years ago.

One of them was only 17 years old, five years older than me.La Bamba, the title of his biggest hit in his all too brief career tells the life story of Ritchie Valens, shortened from Valenzuela so he could appeal to a wider audience. Today that would never happen, he'd tell them to get it on the theater marquee somehow. It sticks pretty close to the facts.I saw a picture of Ritchie Valens when I actually bought a vinyl record when La Bamba came out. It contained all the known recordings for Ritchie Valens, including a few instrumental tracks he hadn't time to do the vocals for. A lot of those songs are heard in this film.The real Ritchie Valens looked more like a high school football player than a musician. He was a big bull of a kid and Lou Diamond Phillips doesn't look a bit like him. Yet Lou captures the spirit of a kid who lived for his music and his family in reverse order.The key to this film is the triangular relationship between Phillips, his mother Roseanne DeSoto, and his older half brother Esai Morales. There were two younger sisters, but no doubt Roseanne favored the younger son. Morales is an outlaw biker rebel who later does find salvation and a good career as an illustrator and we do see the beginning of that. But he's supporting the family with a few illegal activities so Ritchie the good kid can work on his music. In my family, not my immediate family, we had a situation where the mother favored the younger over the older son. It was a sad situation because I knew both and the older man was a nice man and a good citizen.

Initially, I was afraid it would be a violent prison movie with very little meaning and would have very little to move me to tears. But it did. The film was Oscar worthy but it was a film that lost that year to Forest Gump. Its release on VHS made the film very popular. Cable television airs the film frequently and it's even the stuff that film screenplay classes study as a sample of brilliant movie. Based on the short story by Stephen King Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption it tells the story of wealthy banker Andy (Tim Robbins) accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The time at the start of the film is the 1940's and by the end of the film it's the 1960's. Andy has been sent to Shawshank, a notorious prison (in Washington state or Oregon) where harsh discipline is provided by the Warden (Bob Gunton) and by its captain of prison guards. The elements of a prison movie are indeed here (nightmarish conditions, cruel punishment, gay prisoners raping straight\/hetero prisoners) but it becomes a prison movie at a higher level with its theme of redemption and humanity, hope and perseverance. The bond between Morgan Freeman's character and Tim Robbins is perhaps the most poignant relationship of any two men portrayed on film. The prisoners have lost hope and although not bitter, become very comfortable with prison life and know no other type of life. This was the tragedy of the prison librarian who after decades of prison life, could not cope with the real world that had changed after his release. His suicide is extremely depressing. The bad guys turn out to be not the criminals who attempt to rehabilitate themselves but the hypocritical and cruel Warden. Andy is innocent as proved by a later inmate's confession to knowing the true culprit (played by Gil Bellows) but the Warden is too bent on keeping his image of having always done justice and keeps Andy in prison. The grim aspects of the film are nevertheless lightened by humor, good writing, nuance in character and scenes that have such power and subtlety. The scene in which Andy plays an opera album (Le Nozze Di Figaro by Mozart, duet Sull'aria from the 1968 Karl Bohm album with Edith Mathis and Gundula Janowitz) is so moving and so touching. Andy's subsequent escape and the table-turned justice when the investigation into the corruption of the prison leads to the demise of the administration.This movie ranks as one of the finest made in the 1990's, with excellent writing and fine acting. It's a movie that has become a classic and that continues to hold audiences enthralled.

The film is not of a large scale nature, it doesn't rely on gimmicks or special effects to get across the world in which it is set and nor does it ever want to get across an impression like that. In fact if anything, everything is shot very much on ground level and kept very simplistic on a visual and storytelling level. So why is it the film threatens to creep into a realm of the un-real when it has its protagonist and character of the title Betty (Zellweger) come across as an outgoing and perhaps overly confident woman and yet has her retain certain qualities that would see her in the real world carted off to an asylum? The joke Nurse Betty has flowing through it throughout is that small town girl, partner of a used car salesman, diner waitress Betty thinks that a fictional television series programme revolving around a hospital melodrama is actually real. The characters and the situations and events that transpire in their fictional lives are soaked up by Betty, whose relationship with her partner played by Aaron Eckhart does not seem so disconnected that she comes home each day and locks herself away, eating her way through hours and hours of episodes; soaking up everything and believing it's real. But that's what she does; her relationships with real people around her seem healthy she talks and discusses things with her partner Del Sizemore in a friendly manner over dinner; such things like if ten pin bowling should be an Olympic sport.He cheats on her at work and comes across as someone relatively unkind but there is no domestic problem &#150; would a violent domestic episode aided in prolonging Betty's wish to escape her life and hide amongst a fictional televised one? I think so. Additionally, Betty comes across as a cheery and outgoing girl at work and knows people in the neighbourhood; it seems she has some sort of network, indeed some sort of life given a friend she was due to go to a concert of some sort with a friend the night the initial incident occurs.Yet Betty gets so involved and we are supposed to believe that she genuinely thinks this television serial is real that it's all too much for her. The film carries a gritty and realistic of sorts feel but I just didn't feel that Betty could ever be as crazy as she is. Indeed, a better set up involving darker and nastier themes and incidences would've worked better in persuading me. Have her partner hit her; establish she has no friends and then make the television programme the only bright spot in her existence as she comes home; evades her husband and locks herself away, pouring over all these tapes and episodes.So the film is really a study of how individuals can get obsessed over certain texts. Betty is so obsessed with the show, she thinks it's real and goes to hunt the cast down with the other equilibrium revolving around Charlie (Freeman) and his gradual obsession over Betty herself through another type of text, a photograph of someone he's never met but must track down due to her oblivious owning of criminal related goods. Again, it's cute and somewhat funny in a surreal way but do we ever believe it? If not, can we really enjoy the events that are transpiring if the film does not 'feel' as if it is adopting an aesthetic of escapism? Like I said, Betty is in ownership of things she does not know of and the film is a tale of two men, Charlie and Wesley (Rock), attempting to track it\/her down. The character study actually works pretty well. The buddy combination of Rock and Freeman works thanks to good dialogue for Rock's character and his loud mouth routine fits the often inane ramblings of a young gangster desperate to get the job done. Betty comes across as a somewhat independent woman in a backwater world dominated by men and we get the feeling that while she may not be a feminist of sorts, she makes her own decisions and if crossing the country looking for someone who doesn't really exist is what she must do, then away she goes.But the drag for Nurse Betty is its middle chapter with the final third coming off the rails completely in the sense it all boils down to odd events in one location with all the characters coming together. But we don't really care, because by then we want a bit of stupidity following the iffy second sector when it's established Betty is right on that brink between crazy and 'special' (if you know what I mean). The film juxtaposes its laughs with fake, cheesy soap scenes and scalpings as well as binary opposing its assassins old\/young; healthy\/dietless; experienced\/newbie. The film feels like Last Action Hero only without the golden ticket as we watch a film about someone who thinks another piece of visual text is true.

There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens on screen without it having an effect on the plot. By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once. There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points. Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully. The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown\/stop\/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying Zee Germans and things like It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it? quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.

I had put off seeing this all these years since I was afraid of the memories it would bring back, and I was never even in the service. One of the few statements that Dick Cheney has made that I identify with is, I had other priorities in the '60s than military service. Truth be told staying out of Vietnam was a priority of mine, as well as most of my friends - the specter of the draft was always there. Student deferments were the method of choice for accomplishing avoidance for a lot of kids. But then in 1969 came the draft lottery - every day of the year was assigned a number and the lower your number the more exposed you were to being drafted. The lottery was televised and I remember sitting in a large room with about sixty guys and hearing the groans as the low numbers were drawn out of the hopper. This was truly a surreal experience, a mild version of Russian roulette. Many of those with low numbers opted for the method of last resort - flight to Canada. I offer this memory as but one that this film triggered. Almost everyone who lived through the Vietnam war era was scarred by it - few got off scott-free, including of course the countries involved (estimated U.S. deaths 58,000, with 300,000 wounded; estimated Vietnam deaths in excess of one million). The wounds are still healing.The most acute memories this movie brought back were recollections of the clips on the nightly news which indeed had the same feel as this movie. Oliver Stone's having served in Vietnam lends credence to this harrowing tale; you have to assume that it is to no small extent autobiographical.The satire of Tropic Thunder notwithstanding, no matter the the backstage antics, judgment should be rendered on the quality of the final product. And Platoon ranks high on that scale. The performances are uniformly good, presenting us with an ensemble of believable characters.The real quality of the film lies in its focus on how the soldiers dealt with the constant backdrop of anxiety, chaos, and fear. This is captured so well that those emotions are transmitted to the viewer, albeit at what is probably a one per cent level of what the actual soldiers experienced, but enough to cause troubled sleep. There are no battle charts or high level officers discussing strategy here, just what the men in this platoon were facing on a daily basis. One of the values of the film is that it dispels much of the mystery as to how some of the horrendous things that were reported at the time (like civilians being killed, villages burned, officers fragged) could happen. And you see why using any drugs to get you through the day made perfect sense. It makes you a lot more hesitant to pass judgment on the actions of soldiers while sitting in the comfort of your home.I think this is the least political of Stone's films. There seems to be a desire just to tell it like it was. The political back-story never enters into the picture. There were not many people who served in Vietnam with the intelligence and movie-making skills of Stone and it is good that he has given us this film as one portal to understanding what happened on the ground in Vietnam.I have always been curious as to whether I would have lasted ten minutes or five on the ground in Vietnam.

The gags in Austin Powers 2 The Spy Who Shagged Me surpass the original not only in comic creativity but also in how much they make you cringe. The cosmic struggle between good and evil as embodied in Austin Powers' battle against Dr. Evil has never been funnier. Cheeky scatological humor permeates this derivative tale along with the usual bad puns, double-entendres, infantile innuendo, and farcical slapstick. Director Jay Roach and writer & star Mike Myers have boned-up their flaky-flashy formula, introduced new characters, embellished on-going subplots, and pulled out all stops to top the original. Naturally, the Austin Powers movies celebrate as much as poke fun at those hip 1960's spy sagas where James Bond, Matt Helm, and Derek Flint used their wits and ways with women to vanquish the villains.Co-scripted by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers, AP2 picks up where the original left off. Opening with a campy nod to Star Wars, they recap the original adventure with their own prologue scrolling into deep space. Not only has Austin Powers (Mike Myers) defeated his arch enemy Dr. Evil (Mike Myers) and exiled him to the dark recesses of space, but Powers also gotten his ugly teeth fixed and has married Vanessa Keningston (Elizabeth Hurley in a cameo).While Austin and Vanessa shag away in the honeymoon suite, Dr. Evil's Big Boy rocket reappears on Norad Radar. An American astronaut working on the space shuttle looks up and finds the famous Shoney's Restaurant icon hovering ominously in an atmospheric Armageddon' like rendezvous that sets the tone of hilarity in this facetious sequel. Whirling 180 degrees around the smiling Big Boy rocket, the camera focuses on the Big Boy's butt as a hinged compartment lowers, launching an egg which tumbles to the Earth. Indeed, the diabolical Dr. Evil is back! Meanwhile, Austin learns that Vanessa isn't really Vanessa. Instead, she is a fembot, a Terminator-like robot equipped with machine guns in her breasts which she deploys to gun down Austin. Predictably, he survives her barrage of bullets and rescue her Swedish, penis-enlarging machine while the deadly fembot obliterates everything in sight before she self-destructs.Later, Austin learns from Basil Exposition (Michael York), chief of British Intelligence, that they knew all along that Vanessa was a fembot. Rejoicing at his new found freedom, Austin cavorts throughout the motel in his birthday suit while psychedelic screen credits carefully obscure his genitals. When the credits don't cover up his crotch, different objects resembling his genitals show up in a series of inventive sight gags cover them up. Basically, director Jay Roach has recycled the same joke from the first AP movie but has tripled the objects standing in for Austin's genitalia.While the first AP movie gave its eponymous hero the lion's share of screen time, Dr. Evil dominates the sequel. Actually, between the two, Dr. Evil is far more interesting. Resembling Ernst Blofeld from You Only Live Twice, Dr. Evil is the epitome of irony. Just as he did in AP, Dr. Evil allows his vendetta to kill Powers overshadow his plans to enlarge his astronomically wealthy empire. The product placement here is clearly over-the-top as we find Dr. Evil in his high-rise headquarters in the Seattle space needle. Number Two (Robert Wagner in a cameo) reports that since they have acquired a minor coffee franchise, Starbucks, they have reaped a fortune. Acquiring a fortune takes a back seat to Dr. Evil's latest mad scheme. He intends to go back in time to 1969, two years before Austin Powers has been frozen cryogenically, to pinch our hero's mojo. Dr. Evil dispatches his most odious hoodlum, Fat Bastard (Myers in a third role), a baby-chomping, kilt-clad Scottish bagpipe blowing thug who weighs a ton.Meanwhile, back in the future, Austin learns to his chagrin that he has lost his mojo. Essentially, the swinging secret agent no longer has his virility, leaving him impotent. Basil Exposition confirms it, and British Intelligence plans to send him back to the past in a time machine to 1969. Appropriately enough, a new Volkswagen Beetle with psychedelic colors serves as the time machine. Austin returns to swinging London and hooks up with fox CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham of Boogie Nights). They set out to recover his mojo and thwart Dr. Evil's fiendish plan to destroy Washington with a moon-based laser.The Austin Powers movies synthesize the spy flicks of the 1960s along with the premise from the Sylvester Stallone thriller Demolition Man. References to other movies creep into the action. When Dr. Evil's chair spins out of control, he invokes the chant from The Exorcist. Incidentally, we learn in AP2 that Austin's favorite movie is In Like Flint. Nothing more than a loosely aligned jumble of Saturday Night Live skits like the original, AP2 happily acknowledges its own absurdity in a couple of self-depreciating asides. Boldly, the filmmakers tell audiences in one scene to ignore the loopholes in the plot and enjoy the show. During a ride along a scenic stretch of road, Austin observes, Amazing how England looks in no way like southern California. Director Jay Roach, who helmed the first AP movie, returns for the sequel. Clocking in at a trim 95 minutes, AP2 rarely slows down, so if you watch it with a rowdy audience, you may miss some of the punch lines. The dancing interludes are flavorful and flashy, and the film's energy never wanes. Roach keeps the story rolling and the jokes flying as thick as bullets. One of the funniest scenes has Dr. Evil flying a spaceship shaped like erect male genitalia. Quick cuts from different people reacting to the object fuel the comedy.AP2 boasts beefed up production values that approximate the films that it sends up. Some of the funniest scenes involve Dr. Evil's relationship with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green). You'll die laughing at AP2.

Appropriately enough, a new Volkswagen Beetle with psychedelic colors serves as the time machine. Austin returns to swinging London and hooks up with fox CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham of Boogie Nights). They set out to recover his mojo and thwart Dr. Evil's fiendish plan to destroy Washington with a moon-based laser.The Austin Powers movies synthesize the spy flicks of the 1960s along with the premise from the Sylvester Stallone thriller Demolition Man. References to other movies creep into the action. When Dr. Evil's chair spins out of control, he invokes the chant from The Exorcist. Incidentally, we learn in AP2 that Austin's favorite movie is In Like Flint. Nothing more than a loosely aligned jumble of Saturday Night Live skits like the original, AP2 happily acknowledges its own absurdity in a couple of self-depreciating asides. Boldly, the filmmakers tell audiences in one scene to ignore the loopholes in the plot and enjoy the show. During a ride along a scenic stretch of road, Austin observes, Amazing how England looks in no way like southern California. Director Jay Roach, who helmed the first AP movie, returns for the sequel. Clocking in at a trim 95 minutes, AP2 rarely slows down, so if you watch it with a rowdy audience, you may miss some of the punch lines. The dancing interludes are flavorful and flashy, and the film's energy never wanes. Roach keeps the story rolling and the jokes flying as thick as bullets. One of the funniest scenes has Dr. Evil flying a spaceship shaped like erect male genitalia. Quick cuts from different people reacting to the object fuel the comedy.AP2 boasts beefed up production values that approximate the films that it sends up. Some of the funniest scenes involve Dr. Evil's relationship with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green). You'll die laughing at AP2. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"}]
