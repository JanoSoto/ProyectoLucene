Mike Myers uses his famed Scottish accent to bring Shrek to life in a charming, amusing way. I also liked the suave, conceited tone John Lithgow gave to the evil Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy also do very well as Princess Fiona and Donkey, respectively. The only SMALL problem I have with the voice acting is that I'm still not sure why Robin Hood had a French accent in the film. The actual scene with him is hilarious, but I just don't get why he didn't have an English accent.VERY SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD! I thoroughly enjoyed every scene of Shrek.Throughout the climax sequence in the church, I continuously had a smile on my face first, a large grin as Lord Farquaad got his comeuppance, then a warm smile as Shrek sweetly tells Fiona how he really feels about her. Also, when I first saw Shrek at the movie theater, during the end scene when Donkey sings 'I'm a Believer', a bunch of audience members were happily singing along, myself included.This film deserves to be nominated for several Academy Awards (At least for Best Music Score and Best Art Direction). Also, although the MTV Movie Awards don't usually nominate a lot of animated films,I could see Shrek getting a bunch, such as Best Movie, Best Villain, Best Onscreen Team, and Best Fight(for either of the two fantastic fight scenes in it).So, whether you're nine, nineteen, or ninety, it would be hard not to love Shrek.

Even when dealing with high expectations of fans of the novel who have been DYING to see it he has come through.  Also translating a novel so rich and large into a film can be a difficult task so obviously he is not going to satisfy all fans of Tolkein's book.2) A large part of the entertainment value was the beautifully shot New Zealand scenery (is it possible to make that look bad?) combined with extremely well designed sets and costumes.  This film is about as close as one can get on film to making real life scenes look like a fantasy land.3) But some of this was clearly use of CGI, and I think that the use of this technology was maybe the best use I've seen of it to date in a movie.  Many film makers seem to fall in love with this technology, not understanding when to use it and when not to.  I thought Speilberg (who has commented on the overuse of CGI) in A.I. made good use of it this summer, and Jackson and his crew also used it properly.  One of the other problems of misusing is that some things just don't look REAL enough when they are CGI.  I knew that some creatures and effects were clearly CGI, but it never appeared unrealistic enough to not enjoy it.4) The acting was strong from many of the characters especially from the central ones, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, and a surprisingly good Sean Austin.5) The film really kicks in when the Fellowship is officially formed, and it leads to the best sequence, IMHO, the mines scene.Cons1) This film had a lot of potential to be even better.  One of the keys to its weakening was the overuse of the dramatic score combined with long drawn out scenes, to get the audience to react emotionally.  Personally I think it is an insult to the intelligence of the audience when EVERY SINGLE TIME we are supposed to feel some kind of emotion sad, dramatic music combined with slow motion has to be used.  I think near the end, especially, when a particularly emotional scene happens, the use of music and slow motion was excessively to the point of ruining it.  And it's not that music and slow motion can not be used effectively, but again it is overuse, and timing that are key. 2) One of the reviews mentioned a roller coaster feeling, where sometimes it was slow and then BOOM the pace suddenly changed.  Of course, this is not necessarily bad, but sometimes the flow of the film was not so great.  However, in defense, some of this slowness was developing the characters, so that is understandable.3) Some of the actor choices I feel were not so solid.  There is just something about Liv Tyler, where I cannot take her seriously.  I think she is just a poor actress.  Also the choice of Hugo Weaving (of The Matrix fame) for the roll of Lord Elrond.  He seemed to overact a bit, and did not command the kind of status that his character should have.  There were also times, in general, that the dialogue was a bit overdone (like Kate Blanchett's lines), but I have not read the book, so I don't know how true to the novel it was.SummaryOverall this was a strong and entertaining film, that is worth your money time (and you need a bit of it, at nearly 3 hours).  I did find it funny that some people I was in the theater with, based on their reactions, did not seem to realize that this was part 1 of a trilogy.  I am definitely looking foward to the sequals.

Then you also have Tom Sizmore, the Mr. know-it-all, yet funny guy, also a good leader, then there's Ewan McGregor, the dude behind the desk, the funny coffee maker who is totally surprised once he finds out he's going out to fight but feels totally freaked about it. But it was funny how he portrayed his character. And then there's Orlando Bloom, from Lord of the Rings, who is really serious about fighting, so motivated, and ready to fight, but later is injured went the Somalians targeted their chopper.

It's unbelievable! They did a good job representing who they were. I mean, there you have Josh Hartnett, the ever-so-gorgeous looking man (alive) in the movie. I loved his character! He was so soft spoken, yet he was a good leader for his troops, and he knew his stuff. Then you also have Tom Sizmore, the Mr. know-it-all, yet funny guy, also a good leader, then there's Ewan McGregor, the dude behind the desk, the funny coffee maker who is totally surprised once he finds out he's going out to fight but feels totally freaked about it. But it was funny how he portrayed his character. And then there's Orlando Bloom, from Lord of the Rings, who is really serious about fighting, so motivated, and ready to fight, but later is injured went the Somalians targeted their chopper. Ewen is just too funny! Just like he was in Pearl Harbor. These are just some of the roles that you'll find interesting.I thought about how these little things in the movies that we don't normally pay attention to really mean a lot if you catch it. I mean,  the characters in this movie obviously play different roles and that is something that you'll notice in the movie. The actors obviously knew how to portray their characters and that's what made it seem so real. They all looked like real military boys! It's just so awesome! I really am dying to watch it again and again. Hey even when I needed to use the restroom, I told myself no way I'm getting off my seat because I am not going to miss a thing! I just can't explain (on computer) how excited I am for this movie but I do hope that they take this movie to the AWARDS! It deserves the biggest award. I hope the audience LOVED this movie. Wow! I wish I was a part of it! Hard work and fun is my philosophy and that's what this movie was about!

He was about to call it quits. His good friend, arguably America's greatest film actor, Robert De Niro, approached him with a book he had read. The title of the book was Raging Bull. After some coaxing, Robert finally convinced his friend to do the film, and it resulted in a MASTERPIECE!!!!!Raging Bull is the story of former boxing middleweight champion Jake La Motta, and his penchant for self-destruction. La Motta is not in the least a nice guy. He is well, a jerk, who eventually drives any and everyone who has ever cared about him out of his life. He evolved from a lean, trim boxer to an overweight loser who owns a night club.This film currently ranks on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies at #24, and for very good reason. It contains arguably THE GREATEST acting performance in the history of cinema, by arguably the greatest actor in the history of cinema, directed by arguably the greatest director in the history of cinema. But together, nothing needs to be argued, they are the greatest tag team in the history of cinema. Robert De Niro is flawless, superb, excellent, amazing, any positive adjective is warranted by his performance. There is a reason why they call him the greatest actor. This is it. (also Taxi Driver) Naturally, Scorsese's direction is flawless, and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing will pretty much speak for itself. The black-and-white(or tinted monochrome) was an ingenious touch, similar to William Friedkin's gunshot at the very end of The French Connection. It is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen, if it were a woman I could only beg to drink its bathwater. Joe Pesci is excellent as Jake's brother Joey, as is Cathy Moriarty as Jake's long suffering wife. It is sad when you realize that De Niro will never act that great again, but you find solace in the fact that he once did. He is maybe my favorite actor, Scorsese maybe my favorite director, and I only hope to have a millionth of the impact they've had on film. Far superior to Rocky, even though Rocky is very good and contains maybe the most inspirational theme song ever.This film was criminally robbed of 1980's Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards, by Ordinary People, another one of those dysfunctional family drama's. The Academy has since lost a huge amount of credibility, but I find solace in the fact that they honored De Niro with an award for Best Actor, in a performance that warrants two of them and makes me want to shine his shoes.The film gets nothing less than a 10. It was voted the film of the 1980's decade. I agree wholeheartedly.Scorsese and De Niro forever.

Howard should be nominated for his directing job on this film because he did a great job. Let me say that again. A GREAT JOB! The film should also get a nod for Best Picture too. It's one of the very best movies of 2001. A Beautiful Mind tells the true story of John Forbes Nash Jr., a man who is one of the world's greatest mathematicians, and a victim of schizophrenia. From undergraduate days at Princeton to his winning of the Nobel Prize, we follow Nash on a journey that takes him into the far reaches of mathematical discovery, and into a bewildering labyrinth of hallucinations and madness. Russell Crowe brilliantly portrays Nash in what I think is the best performance of his career. He's sure to win another Oscar nomination this year (we'll see if he can duplicate what Tom Hanks did several years ago and that is win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars; Crowe has a very good chance of doing that). A great supporting performance is turned in by Jennifer Connelly as Nash's wife Alicia; she'll get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. These two key performances by Crowe and Connelly make A Beautiful Mind the great film it is thanks primarily to Howard's direction and Akiva Goldsmith's wonderful screenplay (based on Sylvia Nasar's book).

Anybody else will probably be annoyed by all the contrivances and the maudlin script. A LOT of stuff in the movie doesn't make sense.For instance, if Chunk could sneak out the window of the basement, why did the rest of them crawl down the hole in the fireplace? How come Mikey & Brandon's father never got the idea to go after the treasure? If they were so hard up for money to save their house, why did he have so many expensive gadgets in his attic (and a real Spanish dubloon, no less)? While One-Eyed Willie and his men where trapped in the cave for six years, what the heck did they eat? What did they drink? Why does Mikey call Willie the first Goonie when he so obviously slaughtered his own friends just to save his treasure? How did the pirate ship set sail against the tide, unmanned no less? How come Sloth seems to sacrifice his own life to save the kids, and then suddenly both he and the other Fratellis just appear on the beach? What would really have happened to Sloth after that day, anyway? Could Chunk really just take him home, like he was a pet or something? Shouldn't he have asked his parents about that first?Ultimately the movie works though. There were certain scenes that actually make me choke on the silly dialog (could any kid have ever been as sappy as Mikey, with all of those speeches?). I'm guessing it was Steven Spielberg who came up with the idea to have obviously stereotypical kids like Data (who is, at times, impossible to understand) and Chunk, who was one of the funniest and most interesting characters in the movie in spite of the annoying fat kid clichés they put him through. Most of the appeal for me as an adult is the antagonistic banter between Mouth and Stef. Stef runs away with a lot of the best jokes too, like when the bats invade the cave and she shrieks RABIES!! RABIES!!!, and the kooky scene where she and Andy step on the rake and then hysterically insist something disgusting tried to attack them.In fact, I think the sense of nastiness is the only thing that saves this movie from being totally boring. Anne Ramsey is classic in her role, a real treat to watch in how mean she is to the Goonies, and the bad language that the kids use is actually a refreshingly realistic thing to see in a movie about kids. The too-tidy resolution almost comes off as too heavy-handed, until they bring back the hilarious Mexican maid...whoever the actress is who played her did a wonderful characterization. I get the feeling that, ironically, the only thing that kept The Goonies from being a major hit instead of a guilty pleasure is Steven Spielberg. If the film had simply been directed by Richard Donner maybe it would have been truly great, or else maybe if Spielberg had just done the damn thing all by himself it wouldn't have seemed so jarring to have a mixture of their two distinctly different visions.

It seems to be one of the first films to really find an audience on videotape instead of in the theaters.Kids should really enjoy this, or people who were kids the first time they saw it and would now enjoy it for nostalgic reasons. Anybody else will probably be annoyed by all the contrivances and the maudlin script. A LOT of stuff in the movie doesn't make sense.For instance, if Chunk could sneak out the window of the basement, why did the rest of them crawl down the hole in the fireplace? How come Mikey & Brandon's father never got the idea to go after the treasure? If they were so hard up for money to save their house, why did he have so many expensive gadgets in his attic (and a real Spanish dubloon, no less)? While One-Eyed Willie and his men where trapped in the cave for six years, what the heck did they eat? What did they drink? Why does Mikey call Willie the first Goonie when he so obviously slaughtered his own friends just to save his treasure? How did the pirate ship set sail against the tide, unmanned no less? How come Sloth seems to sacrifice his own life to save the kids, and then suddenly both he and the other Fratellis just appear on the beach? What would really have happened to Sloth after that day, anyway? Could Chunk really just take him home, like he was a pet or something? Shouldn't he have asked his parents about that first?Ultimately the movie works though. There were certain scenes that actually make me choke on the silly dialog (could any kid have ever been as sappy as Mikey, with all of those speeches?). I'm guessing it was Steven Spielberg who came up with the idea to have obviously stereotypical kids like Data (who is, at times, impossible to understand) and Chunk, who was one of the funniest and most interesting characters in the movie in spite of the annoying fat kid clichés they put him through. Most of the appeal for me as an adult is the antagonistic banter between Mouth and Stef. Stef runs away with a lot of the best jokes too, like when the bats invade the cave and she shrieks RABIES!! RABIES!!!, and the kooky scene where she and Andy step on the rake and then hysterically insist something disgusting tried to attack them.In fact, I think the sense of nastiness is the only thing that saves this movie from being totally boring.

The casting is excellent, and the acting is far, far above-par.  The changes are necessary, and for the most part are quite well-done.

Viggo Mortensen is simply amazing as Aragorn, though not entirely like the book character.  Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are almost scene-stealing as Legolas and Gimli, respectively.  Liv Tyler gives a surprisingly good performance in this film as Arwen, and Cate Blanchett is a beautiful, if slightly exaggerated, Galadriel.  Hugo Weaving is a true delight as Elrond, and Sean Bean's portrayal of Boromir is nothing short of spectacular.  Sir Ian Holm was often a little too dramatic for my taste as Bilbo Baggins, but was a treat nonetheless.  Have I gone on about the cast enough?  They're amazing!Everything ELSE  The scenery is awe-inspiring.  It's all just gorgeous (or hideous, in some cases).  The costumes are completely appropriate, and very well-made.  They really reflect each character's attitude.  The makeup is fantastic as well, and deserves and award.  The camera work is extremely effective (they deserve an award for the contrast they use in this), and there's more raw emotion than you can shake a stick at.  Especially wonderful are the scenes with Saruman, which tend to be jerky and use fast pans and close-ups; scenes in The Shire, which use the natural, beautiful New Zealand light outdoors and great dramatic lighting indoors; and the scenes at Rivendell, which are tinted with a simply magical golden-brown, giving it a nostalgic, aged feel.  The special effects are entirely believable (Save one or two shots.  SHOTS!  Not scenes, shots!  Wow!!) and really do add to the experience.My REVIEW  One word?  WOW.Recommended stuff  Other movies I'd say you might like?  Anything epic, really.  Try Gladiator perhaps, or The Mummy Returns.  I liked those films.  For something that will get you emotionally, like this did for me, try Schindler's List on for size.  For a lighter fantasy romp, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  As always, I must recommend anything Star Wars.  For music, try something nice by John Williams, especially Schindler's List and Star Wars.

I assume that's the trick. Because once you see the movie, you see how the previews either showed all the funny scenes or skewered them to seem funnier (in this case, both), and the hype is just that--hype, and cast and crew end up being wasted by a weak storyline and not much material to work with.It all starts well enough, as we get to know this strange family of Tenenbaums in a nameless city, with the heartless and thoughtless father, the oblivious and obsessive mother, and their three genius children, Chas, Margot, and Richie. They all grow up physically, but not mentally, at least in Royal's case, as he claims to be terminally ill to his now estranged wife and even more estranged children. He returns to live with Etheline, only after being kicked out of the hotel suite he was living in, and the children, now depressing, aged shells of their once capable minds, come home to be with him. Throw in Etheline's new love interest, Henry, the wannabe Tenenbaum, Eli, Margot's neurologist husband Raleigh, Chas's soon-to-be carbon copy sons Ari and Uzi, and a show-stealing Indian servant named Pagoda who seems to be the only one willing to stick by Royal's side (even though he's just as willing to stab him in the back...literally), and you get a story that doesn't really manage to go much further from there.The movie quickly side-steps the guise by which it is marketed (this pseudo-Golden Pond reunion of a family), and the sad excuse for a plot falls apart. We find out what really goes on, and are left to wonder, Wow, is that all? But no, then the story pointlessly plods around for a while to, I suppose, a climax that is supposed to change everything and conclude it all, but only seems to mess things up even more, those these people don't seem to pick up on it.Watching Tenenbaums, you pretty much sit there waiting to laugh yourself to tears. You walk in the theatre expecting that. But it never really happens, and more often than not, you find yourself feigning a laugh just so the one other person in the theatre who liked a certain joke won't feel so lonely, and you can pretend you got it. I was almost, strangely enough, embarrassed during the moments of dead silence when there should have been people rolling in the aisles. I thought, Jeez, this is really sad. Nobody finds that funny--not even me? And the moments that did evoke a laugh were not shared by all, so it was but a sporadic giggling here and there.The drama side of the movie is more dark comedy. There's a strange subplot of incest that really isn't, legally, but is still much too uncomfortable, and the early-on tensions between Royal and Henry, and of course, the issue of Royal's illness, and his children having to face the man who was never much of a father to them, are all dealt with as light-heartedly as possible, as one would expect. But they never come across as funny. Not that Wes Anderson (director\/co-writer) should have felt any inclination to make this a very serious movie, but hell, the comedy never comes through, why not try another approach?The one thing the movie does have going for it is the sometimes great but sometimes dreary music, and a few performances. Gene Hackman as Royal is the only saving grace, because he's just a terrific actor, and given the only good role in the movie, he does a lot with it, and he's great. I would expect at least an Oscar nomination. Maybe not a win, but at least a nomination. He was worthy of the Golden Globe win. Angelica Huston is decent as Etheline; she isn't given much of a part, and only gets really one good scene, with Royal as they go for a walk in the park, and only then is she able to really get a chance to be good. Other than that, she only has a few good lines, though I blame the script more than I blame her, because she's a very capable actress. Ben Stiller is another highlight of the movie as the over-acheiver Chas, and his typical right-on Ben Stiller delivery of good lines is here. He comes away with his dignity, and I thought he did well. Luke Wilson, on the other hand, as Richie, isn't particularly memorable, and is more depressing than anything else. Gwenyth Paltrow is good as Margot, barely cracking a smile and never particularly enthused about anything. But like the character of Etheline, she isn't given enough good scenes or good lines. Paltrow has a lot of talent, and the role should have been good for her, but once again, I more blame the script for the hand she's dealt. Owen Wilson as the pointless character of Eli is actually quite annoying, probably more so than anything because he helped write this damn movie, so maybe I more don't like Wilson as a writer, but his performance is only mediocre. Danny Glover isn't given enough to do as Henry, but he comes through with a good performance, and the scene where he falls in the hole is one of the only really funny scenes in the movie, and much needed after probably a half-hour of no laughs at all. The saddest case of all is the treatment of Bill Murray in the throw-away role of Raleigh St. Claire. Murray, in my opinion, has probably one of the best comedic deliveries of most actors of his time. He's always great and he's always a riot...except here. His role is small and pointless, but he seems to keep popping up for no other reason except, I suppose, to pad the movie out. He's never given a good Bill Murray line. He's never given a chance to use the dry wit he often uses so well. I, of course, once again, blame the script, but I think anyone else could have done this role, and not have given so wasted a performance. Kumar Pallana is great as Pagoda, and was the source of some of the only comedy in the movie, in a Simpsons-style laughing at the minority sort of way. He was much needed. Alec Baldwin narrates; I thought it was Gene Hackman the entire time.The Royal Tenenbaums lacks any real plot, and there are only a handful of good scenes. I liked when Henry fell in the hole, I thought the scenes between Royal and Etheline in the park were charming there was a lot of chemistry between them there, I loved the stabbing scene, I thought that was maybe the funniest scene in the movie next to the hole scene, and I liked the much-too-quick dinner scene between the Tenenbaums. It could have been longer. Actually, there were a lot of scenes not milked for their potential. What also comes to mind is when Royal takes Margot out for ice cream. That could have been a great scene, but the only highlight of it you'll probably see in the preview, and it's not that funny in the movie.The movie has profanity (along with a lot of pointless, inconsequential dialogue, which I suppose should be an equal warning), drug use, and unnecessary nudity which seemed to only be there for the sake of nudity, and to beef up a very short flashback scene of Margot having a lesbian encounter (believe me, it sounds more enticing than it is). The plot bobs and weaves throughout the entire running time, and the actors seem to do the same with their parts.  Skip this mess.

His role is small and pointless, but he seems to keep popping up for no other reason except, I suppose, to pad the movie out. He's never given a good Bill Murray line. He's never given a chance to use the dry wit he often uses so well. I, of course, once again, blame the script, but I think anyone else could have done this role, and not have given so wasted a performance. Kumar Pallana is great as Pagoda, and was the source of some of the only comedy in the movie, in a Simpsons-style laughing at the minority sort of way. He was much needed. Alec Baldwin narrates; I thought it was Gene Hackman the entire time.The Royal Tenenbaums lacks any real plot, and there are only a handful of good scenes. I liked when Henry fell in the hole, I thought the scenes between Royal and Etheline in the park were charming there was a lot of chemistry between them there, I loved the stabbing scene, I thought that was maybe the funniest scene in the movie next to the hole scene, and I liked the much-too-quick dinner scene between the Tenenbaums. It could have been longer. Actually, there were a lot of scenes not milked for their potential. What also comes to mind is when Royal takes Margot out for ice cream. That could have been a great scene, but the only highlight of it you'll probably see in the preview, and it's not that funny in the movie.The movie has profanity (along with a lot of pointless, inconsequential dialogue, which I suppose should be an equal warning), drug use, and unnecessary nudity which seemed to only be there for the sake of nudity, and to beef up a very short flashback scene of Margot having a lesbian encounter (believe me, it sounds more enticing than it is). The plot bobs and weaves throughout the entire running time, and the actors seem to do the same with their parts.  Skip this mess.

I assume that's the trick. Because once you see the movie, you see how the previews either showed all the funny scenes or skewered them to seem funnier (in this case, both), and the hype is just that--hype, and cast and crew end up being wasted by a weak storyline and not much material to work with.It all starts well enough, as we get to know this strange family of Tenenbaums in a nameless city, with the heartless and thoughtless father, the oblivious and obsessive mother, and their three genius children, Chas, Margot, and Richie. They all grow up physically, but not mentally, at least in Royal's case, as he claims to be terminally ill to his now estranged wife and even more estranged children. He returns to live with Etheline, only after being kicked out of the hotel suite he was living in, and the children, now depressing, aged shells of their once capable minds, come home to be with him. Throw in Etheline's new love interest, Henry, the wannabe Tenenbaum, Eli, Margot's neurologist husband Raleigh, Chas's soon-to-be carbon copy sons Ari and Uzi, and a show-stealing Indian servant named Pagoda who seems to be the only one willing to stick by Royal's side (even though he's just as willing to stab him in the back...literally), and you get a story that doesn't really manage to go much further from there.The movie quickly side-steps the guise by which it is marketed (this pseudo-Golden Pond reunion of a family), and the sad excuse for a plot falls apart. We find out what really goes on, and are left to wonder, Wow, is that all? But no, then the story pointlessly plods around for a while to, I suppose, a climax that is supposed to change everything and conclude it all, but only seems to mess things up even more, those these people don't seem to pick up on it.Watching Tenenbaums, you pretty much sit there waiting to laugh yourself to tears. You walk in the theatre expecting that. But it never really happens, and more often than not, you find yourself feigning a laugh just so the one other person in the theatre who liked a certain joke won't feel so lonely, and you can pretend you got it. I was almost, strangely enough, embarrassed during the moments of dead silence when there should have been people rolling in the aisles. I thought, Jeez, this is really sad. Nobody finds that funny--not even me? And the moments that did evoke a laugh were not shared by all, so it was but a sporadic giggling here and there.The drama side of the movie is more dark comedy. There's a strange subplot of incest that really isn't, legally, but is still much too uncomfortable, and the early-on tensions between Royal and Henry, and of course, the issue of Royal's illness, and his children having to face the man who was never much of a father to them, are all dealt with as light-heartedly as possible, as one would expect. But they never come across as funny. Not that Wes Anderson (director\/co-writer) should have felt any inclination to make this a very serious movie, but hell, the comedy never comes through, why not try another approach?The one thing the movie does have going for it is the sometimes great but sometimes dreary music, and a few performances. Gene Hackman as Royal is the only saving grace, because he's just a terrific actor, and given the only good role in the movie, he does a lot with it, and he's great. I would expect at least an Oscar nomination. Maybe not a win, but at least a nomination. He was worthy of the Golden Globe win. Angelica Huston is decent as Etheline; she isn't given much of a part, and only gets really one good scene, with Royal as they go for a walk in the park, and only then is she able to really get a chance to be good. Other than that, she only has a few good lines, though I blame the script more than I blame her, because she's a very capable actress. Ben Stiller is another highlight of the movie as the over-acheiver Chas, and his typical right-on Ben Stiller delivery of good lines is here. He comes away with his dignity, and I thought he did well. Luke Wilson, on the other hand, as Richie, isn't particularly memorable, and is more depressing than anything else. Gwenyth Paltrow is good as Margot, barely cracking a smile and never particularly enthused about anything. But like the character of Etheline, she isn't given enough good scenes or good lines. Paltrow has a lot of talent, and the role should have been good for her, but once again, I more blame the script for the hand she's dealt. Owen Wilson as the pointless character of Eli is actually quite annoying, probably more so than anything because he helped write this damn movie, so maybe I more don't like Wilson as a writer, but his performance is only mediocre. Danny Glover isn't given enough to do as Henry, but he comes through with a good performance, and the scene where he falls in the hole is one of the only really funny scenes in the movie, and much needed after probably a half-hour of no laughs at all. The saddest case of all is the treatment of Bill Murray in the throw-away role of Raleigh St. Claire. Murray, in my opinion, has probably one of the best comedic deliveries of most actors of his time. He's always great and he's always a riot...except here.

Never before, not Saving Private Ryan, not any other film, had I seen such a powerful anti-war message.   The constant fighting, the confusion, and the sense of hopelessness helped create an atmosphere in the movie than plainly spelled out not only how horrible war is, but it also raised questions about the American use of military power on the international stage.War movies in the past have been about distant times, ones we are far detached from.   Black Hawk Down was about an event that occurred eight years ago, but it just as well could have been today, in Afghanistan.This film was not a shoot-em-up, nor did it depict any glory in war.   It was not a patriotic, go America film.   It was about a government, placing its boys in danger's way for the sake of politics.   The only good thing happening in the film is how these 18-22 year old boys respond to the chaotic world around them.   They fight with all they can muster, they follow the orders given to them, and they die for the guy next to them. Their bravery, courage and dedication show what normal people can do when placed in extraordinary situations, not what a great country America is. I'm honestly surprised they released this so close to Sept. 11 because it raises a lot of questions about America's role on the world political stage.The emotional impact on me of this film is difficult to describe. As a 19 year old college student, all I could think about was myself in the shoes of the actors in this movie.   I could not see myself handle something like this, but if America did go to war, I would be faced with this reality. It is scary, each man getting shot could very well have been me, or even worse, my close friends.Most of the audience in the theater were college students as well, and I have a feeling that they were all significantly impacted by this film as well because the theater was dead silent upon the completion of the film. One of my good friends was utterly speechless and could only mutter, Why do we have war?    Parents of young adults, imagine your sons being shipped across the world to face the hell of war depicted here.I can not think of any way to make a stronger anti-war message.  We are living this, these people could be us or the ones we love.   What is the good of war?Other users on this site have commented that the movie is less of a film because the characters aren't developed.   I'm willing to offer that it does not matter what the names of the characters are or where they're from. These soldiers could well have been anyone who has served in the military, or who could be drafted into the military.   Each of them could have been me, my best friend, or your son.   Imagine your 22 year old son in the place of Josh Hartnet's character, would he have felt that way about each man under his command, would he have made the right decisions to save his men?Others have also mentioned that the film is not entertaining enough because it is constant shooting.   One, this film is not meant to be entertaining, it is to hit each viewer with a square punch of what is going on in the world, and two, that's what war is, there is no bathroom break, no timeouts. These soldiers faced 18 straight hours of pure hell, knowing that each second they could die.   The purpose of the constant combat is to help ram the message home of just how horrible war is.The comedic relief is also a big plus in this film because it helps show that the men fighting are still human when facing the most inhuman of conditions.   It would be all to easy to forget that the men fighting are real people, but by cracking a few jokes, we are able to continue immersing ourselves in the horrors that they are facing.This film was an absolutely incredible experience.   I am willing to offer that anyone who did not go home and hug their parents, spouses, friends, or grandparents after seeing this film really needs to get in tune with the realities of the modern world.   The soldiers in Black Hawk Down showed what has made America the great collection of people it is, normal guys fighting for and giving their lives for the good of their nation and for their comrades fighting alongside them.      If only it didn't take a war to get people to exhibit these qualities in day to day life.

I give this film 3 stars and a thumbs up.  This is what Pearl Harbour should've been like.I'm sure people who read the book will react differently from those who didn't.  The book is excellent in cranking out the many details that transpired,  making the reader feel like they are right there.  So many anecdotal events occurred,  it seems strange that a 2 hour and 20 minute movie could not show them all,  even though the actual event lasted a little over 12 hours.  Most people have already seen `Saving Private Ryan'.  We were all shocked by the brutal reality of battle,  and the film deservedly got many Academy Award nominations.  So this time around,  when the blood splatters on the camera lense,  it feels somewhat familiar.   'SPR' also worked because many of the cast were fresh faces,  allowing us to see them as their characters,  not as familiar actors.In 'BHD',  we see Tom Sizemore, Josh Hartnett, and others from Bruckheimer's 'Pearl Harbour'.   That cast,  along with the battle,  is fresh in most people's minds (since it was mandatory that everyone see it).    So this time around,  we, the audience,  feel like we've got combat experience going into this film.   Also,  Ewan McGregor,  now quite familiar as a Jedi Master with a Scottish accent in `Star Wars',  does a poor job with an American accent.  One thing that both 'Private Ryan' and 'Pearl Harbour'  did NOT have during their battle scenes was music.  Without music,  the battle scenes feel like documentary footage.  With music,  like in 'BHD',  it pulls us out of the immediate surroundings,  and reminds us that it is a movie. I was quite surprised how much of this non-stop battle was underscored with a Hans Zimmer soundtrack.  Perhaps the decision to go heavy on the music was to pump up the patriotism,  post 9\/11.All that said,  `Black Hawk Down'  is a smart, unflinching,  realistic, and unapologetic film.There are periods during the battle where events seem incoherent,  which realistically depicts the confusion that really happened.  But it stops short to show the whole story behind some of details on screen.  Near the beginning of the film, we see a short clip of the film 'The Jerk',  where Steve Martin is being shot at.  The gunman misses and hits some cans.  In the book,  this scene is referred to later during the battle,  where bullets are puncturing a piece of metal,  demonstrating how poor a shot most of the Somali shooters were.  `It's the cans!  He hates the cans!'  the soldier declares.  It is a telling piece of humour that helps relay the sense of disbelief the Rangers had while it was happening.  Many of them said it was like a movie.Another such moment occurs when another Ranger stops when he sees a hand sitting on the ground.  The movie literally stops when the soldier stops to pick up the hand and put it in his jacket, (I almost thought that something had gone wrong with the movie projector).  We learn later in the book that the hand was matched up back to the soldier who lost it.   Then there is Mike Durant,  the most memorable part of the original incident in 1993. The book gives more detail about him being held captive and how he was eventually released.  The movie merely supplies some post-script about his fate.There is some obvious foreshadowing at the beginning of the film,  and Capt. Steele,  trying to corral his troops,  goes against Hollywood type by showing his vulnerability.   The movie doesn't quite effectively show the Delta troops' influence on the Ranger's behaviour.  It is an important sub-context in the book.  Delta soldiers are trained to be very independent, and the Rangers are trained to stick together and go by the book.   My guess is that the Delta side of the story could not be told, since officially they are not allowed to reveal anything about themselves.  This is unfortunate,  because the movie could have done a better job in setting up the relationship between the Deltas and the Rangers.   It would give more depth to the clash between Capt. Steele and the Deltas later in the film.Those are my gripes,  but everything else Ridley Scott does is right on. Scott said he wanted to show things how they really happened,  good or bad. For that,  this movie allows the good guys to do not-so-good things,  and gives credence to the fact that the men in charge don't always make the right decisions.  Other than the wall to wall music,  the movie puts you right there,  with very few of those glitzy TV commercial style shots that Bruckheimer is infamous for.   I felt that futility and desperation of the lost convoy was less effective when the film jumped back and forth between them and the pinned down Rangers.  The lost convoy, as it reads in the book, is a trip into pure hell,  the reader wants to scream in horror as much as those that were there surely did.  By cutting away from convoy,  the audience gets a chance to escape,  where there was no escape from the hail of bullets and RPG's in real life.If you are trying to decide to see this film,  it is up to you whether you can handle the graphic violence,  and the somewhat one-sided point of view of the conflict.   If you can,  you will be rewarded with a gripping story, a thoughtful narrative,  and 2 hours and 20 minutes of film that will never leave you bored.  Few films have done that.

Some of you who criticize them don't mentioned which ones, so therefore it could be assumed all of them do.

Those that say the acting was terrible without saying exactly who (and even if you did) also say that EVERY actor in the movie didn't do good.

I personally found every actor in the movie doing the best they have ever done than before.And for those of you who hated the movie WITHOUT EVEN READING THE BOOK AND HAVING HIGH EXPECTATIONS should change your strategy in watching book-adapted movies. Peter Jackson did not want to do a direct book-to-screen translation (he mentioned it to be impossible in one of his interviews) but rather an interpretation where the same idea of the original is taken and translated into the world of cinema (with slight modifications due to the fact that literature =\/= cinema) for the readers and non-readers to follow the story. If PJ had left in Tom Bombadil then I am sure that those who have not read the book would get completely off track of the story and would hate the movie even more. And, people, I am sure that Jackson has read the book, like most of you, 10 times in his lifetime. For who else would undertake such a project and put so much effort into it? Certainly not Spielberg, or McTiernan or Cameron since they seem to make Hollywood flicks that show their taste in movies, which don't seem to be very fictinous (except maybe for Terminator). I could be very sure about Danny Boyle's changes, director of The Beach, since he said in the director's commentary that he did not want to base the movie on the book but rather take the idea and use it efficiently.Those of you saying the movie was LONG, well if it was short (unlike the book) you'd then be saying that its too short and not enough was explained and that most of the book was cut out. Those that say that the people who voted 10 for this film were (quoting from some comments) nothing more but ignorable 15-year-olds who just liked the effects and action. Well, I'm pretty much assured that most of those who voted for 10 in Star Wars were below the age of 20. In fact, that movie seems more tengerish, but I also loved it, though I am 24.Trust me, if the movie was like the book, I mean like all of you wanted it to be, it would be a total disaster.

I went with 4 friends and at the end of the movie we all just sat and said wow for a moment.this movie is the first quality film I have seen in quite some time. It is now one of my all-time favorite movies! The movie starts off a little slow, but it does a wonderful job of getting the audience acquainted with the characters - you fall in love with them and want them to be happy. So, when the climax hits, it takes you by surprise and hits your emotions. I won't give the climax - I actually had been told a little more about the movie than my friends had, but luckily I had forgotten. Not knowing some of the key ingredients of this film made it a better film by far. I'll just say there is a powerful twist in this film, and the topic is handled very well by the writers and by the actors (who all do a marvelous job! and the make-up in this movie is also terrific). If at the beginning you feel it is slow, please just stick with it! Once you get into it, you won't be able to leave until you know how it ends... and once it ends, you won't know how to leave because it is so amazing.A Beautiful Mind is definitely one of the best quality films ever made.

I hate to say that by the end, I wasn't happy with what I saw, mostly because the movie fell flat on its face after our two protagonists made brought this whole nightmare to civilization.Anyway, first, the plot synopsis, which is unnecessary, because what most people know about this movie going in is about enough. Brother Darry (Justin Long) and sister Trish (Gina Philips) are driving home from college, taking the scenic route. All is not well when a menacing old truck tries running them off the road Duel-style. When they later see the same truck parked at an old church, and a dark figure dumping what looks like a body down a sewer pipe, things get more suspicious. They eventually return to investigate out of concern (it's actually a weak excuse, but the script makes it sound logical), and find something unbelievable.And that, my friends, is as much as I feel like describing, because after that, the movie goes downhill. More cast members show up for bit parts before either disappearing or getting killed for no good reason. Trish and Darry make various stops, trying to explain what's happening and why someone needs to believe them, then the Creeper shows up and chases them away. You won't even realize when the movie reaches it's climax, because you're just expecting this formula to continue playing out. But then the movie ends, with an epilogue that only somewhat helps the weak precedings (sans the great first half-hour) with a shocking final scene that was pretty original.Jeepers Creepers, as I've metioned, does start out well. The dialogue between Long and Philips is fun and original, and none of that self-aware, pretentious crap we usually hear. It's very natural. They play roadgames and bicker like a brother and sister would, and everything seems fine, until this very natural threat of a creepy car roaring up behind them tries to run them right into the corn field. It's scary and very effective, and when they see the truck again, and it comes after them again (in the most frightening scene of the movie), it only seems to get better. Then they go back to investigate, and for some reason, the pace slows down a little. It's not as creepy, I don't know why. Then they get to the diner, and from then on, the movie never picks up again. Sure, there's action, and most of the same stuff is going on, but it's just not scary anymore. By the time Trish and Darry get to the police station, it's downright boring.I think the problem is, everything is quickly revealed, and the mystery and the creepiness about the movie is lifted. We quickly figure out what's going on, we see who (or what) the Creeper really is (very cheesy, actually, should have kept the big jacket and hat on), and the relevance to the title of the movie is realized (something else that should have stayed under wraps, or never used at all). Also, the characters of the two cops and the Cat Lady are thrown in our way and quickly disposed of, only slowing down the pace even more. Then the psychic, Jezelle, shows up, and is more of an annoyance than anything else, and she tells us everything that's going on. I can understand maybe why that method was used skip the long revelation, move on to the action. But in this case, it didn't work.I think the movie would have worked really well if Darry, Trish, and the Creeper were the only characters in the movie, and the setting was the open road and a few abandoned buildings. The Creeper could never be revealed to us, and maybe it wouldn't matter why he was doing what he was doing. To mention Duel again, what if he was just some form of evil. Or just a jerk.Still, Justin Long and Gina Philips turn in great performances, and have so much chemistry together. They only help in making the first half-hour so great. But not even their acting could carry the audience through the tedious hour that ensues. Hopefully the sequel will be better.
