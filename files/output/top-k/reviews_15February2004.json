Shot widely on location, The Mexican looks truly perfect as a road movie, with eye-candy galore and some wonderfully impressive shots of the lovely locations.--I was massively impressed with what the writer of this film, J.H. Lyman, manages to do with the hitman-hostage story. It is the best element of The Mexican by far. Instead of getting the simple shoot-bang-em-up-and-take-a-sexy-hostage-girl, us viewers are left to contemplate one very fascinating character Leroy. This is a complicated character, who is discovered in-depth by some truly impressive counselling scenes with Sam (Julia Roberts). This is the most developed character in the film, played perfectly by Soprano James Gandolfini, and this film is worth viewing for that performance alone, which far overshadows the (still very good) performances of mega-stars Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts.--Is it just me, or did this movie seriously deserve an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score? The music in this film was just astoundingly good! I loved the driving theme, it was very catchy, and the flashbacks (projector story) had a great score too. The music was all-round inventive and fitting to the film, certainly one of the most memorable aspects.--Another strong point of the film is its great ability to bring together a number of genres and intercut them effectively without anything ever feeling forced or boring. On the outside the film looks like a Pitt\/Roberts romantic comedy but it is certainly more than that. The film has strong elements of drama (Gandolfini's character) and lots of road action as well as a historical value as well (loved the projector flashbacks - stylie!). And then of course you have the aforementioned romantic comedy side of things, which is lots more fun than many other typical Roberts vehicles of late. The characters aren't your typical rom-com characters and the two leads play off each other during their on-screen verbal fights so well.THE BAD--The only really annoying factor of the film which brought down the quality a lot for me was the tedious ending, which dragged on for a very long time and shoved a lot of information in our faces all at once. Without much time for plot qualities to sink in I was left feeling more empty than I was prior to that last 20 minutes or so because all of it had no real effect on me. Furthermore, I think the ending was supposed to really grab the audience by the balls and give them a surprise. It certainly had elements of surprise, but grab me by the balls?

It's about two (purportedly) gay men, Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) who strangle a friend to death for the thrill of it.  They then hide the body in a trunk just before a dinner party they have which include the victim's family and friends.  They also proceed to serve the food on the trunk containing his body.  They also invite a headmaster they had at school together--Rupert Cadell (James Stewart) a very cynical individual.  As the party progresses Cadell realizes something is very wrong--and is afraid he might be responsible in an indirect way.Absolutely fascinating.  Hitchcock's first color film was also shot in 10 minute takes--Hitch thought it might provide a seamless flow of narrative.  After all this was adapted from a play.  I think it works very well--it's not distracting at all and the film does move very smoothly.  Also he purposedly had the color toned down--he didn't think bright Technicolor was appropriate for the subject matter.  Purportedly Dall, Granger and Stewart's characters were all gay.  It's never made clear but it DOES seem like Dall and Granger are lovers (and both were gay in real life) and the script was adapted by a gay man (Arthur Laurents).  Also it's based the Leopold-Loeb murders in which two gay men killed a young boy for the thrill of it in the 1920s.  So there is a strong gay subtext in the film.Also there's plenty of black humor throughout.  After the murder there are lines like Knock 'em dead, killing two birds with one stone, I could strangle you and these hands will bring you great fame.  They're actually quite funny and frightening at the same time.  With two exceptions all the acting is good.  The two bad performances are by Sir Cedric Hardwicke (he seems to have no idea what he's saying) and Farley Granger.  Actually Granger is so bad he provides some unintentional humor!  The best acting is by Dall who is absolutely chilling and Joan Chandler (who Hitchcock kept tormenting on the set) as Janet Walker.  She has some great lines and gives her all to every one of them.  Best of all is Stewart--he doesn't pop up until the film is almost half over and he's incredible.  He plays a very cold, cynical intellectual--this is unlike anything he's played before.  His acting is very toned down (until the end) but you can see all his expressions through his eyes.  This is easily one of his best performances.  He hated making the film.  For the 10 minute takes Hitch had to design a set which could accomidate the huge cameras.  When the camera moved the set walls were designed to go flying up (off camera) so the crew could move from room to room.  It distracted Stewart a lot and he couldn't sleep nights.There's also the VERY impressive cyclorama background of NYC where we slowly see day turn into night.This is basically all talk but every single line is fascinating.  Stewart's lines especially are great and the philosophy described is intriguing.  And the gay subtext adds another layer to it--see the looks Dall and Granger exchange once in a while.  Actually Montgomery Clift was approached about playing Granger's role but turned it down.  He was gay too but wanted to keep it hidden and that role was just a bit too risky.All in all an absolutely fascinating picture.  A definite must-see!  It's short too (only 81 minutes).

Orange County doesn't just rely on Black to do the comedy though, it has some great one-liners and visual gags, as well as characters who might sound clichéd (the drunken mom, the rich dad, the various stoners) but who are turned into funny and entertaining characters.

The same is true for the writer of this film.--Like Shaun, I am an aspiring writer (actually, writer\/director of films, but hey, same diff) so I sympathised and reflected with his character during his struggle to become a great writer. I liked how they showed his dreams affecting the rest of his life and the people closest to him, and how it was recognised that it is very hard to become a successful selling writer in today's modern world.

A hitman and his female partner; notice the juxtaposition of shots. As the man is walking, he seems to be quite the womanizer, giving sly smiles to women as they walk by. His partner, on the other hand, gives an almost mean sneer to men, although she dresses very sociable and even says I know how to be easy going. Notice how she has a deep love for him, and how he couldn't really care less.The other story, on the other hand, follows a mute (who happens to be played by Takeshi Kaneshiro, who played a character of same name in Chungking Express) and his brief encounter with love.An interesting note is when the two main male characters cross paths, in the most subtle ways. It is complete coincidence; each character is completely oblivious to each others stories. Or when the mute and the female partner cross paths.

There are several reasons for this and normally I would avoid talking about a movie's predecessor in reviewing it, but it is a *sequel*, and it's called Godfather PART II, not Godfather II. This, of course, implies a direct connection not only to the characters, but also to the story of the first one. So - the second part is both a prequel and a sequel merged into one movie. It's a great prequel in that it tells the story of the rise of Vito Carleone so naturally and realistically that the metamorphosis from boy to gangster is seamless. De Niro is phenomenal as Michael's father, a role performed almost entirely in Italian (hardly a handicap for De Niro whose first language I believe is English). He has the emotional range that Al Pacino had in the first Godfather. From extreme benevolence, even grief (Fredo gets sick vs. old Don Carleone in the first movie gets sick) he turns to cold-blooded, calculated murder. However, Godfather Part II focuses primarily on Michael, telling his story as both a continuation of the first part's tale and as an antithesis to Vito Carleone's rise to power. In that, Godfather Part II is one of the best sequel's ever made, it fleshes out the original story and it adds more plot and character depth to the original. The movie doesn't serve at all as a money-making scheme, but rather a second part of a book that's already got you hooked. Still, I belong to the group of the purists, those who enjoy the first part more than the second. While Godfather Part I portrays Michael's almost unknowing (definitely subtle) takeover of the family, Godfather Part II already finds him knowing his way around the family, capable of doing anything to his enemies. It's about Michael's complete collapse - he murders or gets rid of virtually every person in the movie, including (most tragically) his own brother, ultimately alienating himself from the family he seeks to protect. The tragedy here, however, is in some sense less subtle and nuanced than the tragedy of Godfather Part I, which is about a deep and complex father-son relationship that foretells its own ending. There exists an element of love and responsibility that naturally leads to and cannot escape from Michael's return to his family. Godfather Part II re-examines these themes (which detracts from some of its originality - but that is hardly a complaint), but Michael's character has somehow shed any notion of mercy or restraint. In fact, he does not change in any significant way, but merely continues down the path the first film set for him. The murder of his brother is simply yet another point of no return, much like the scene with the doors closing on Diane Keaton's character ending the first film. In any case, my point is that the Michael Carleone section of Godfather Part II is mostly an entertainingly told story that expands on what was already introduced in the first film, which I believe is much stronger. The best part of Godfather Part II is De Niro's performance, and its contrasting role in Michael's descent into continuing alienation and violence. (And of course it is remarkably directed by Francis Ford Coppola, with a good performance by Al Pacino, but it remains in the shadow of the first Godfather - inevitably so.)
