The Exorcist had brought horror out of castles and into the suburbs where no vampire had been seen. The film's director, Tom Holland, being a fan of Hammer's and Universal's films, decided to make his own vampire movie as the genre had fallen into self-parody with Love at First Bite (1979). Holland was very familiar with Hitchcock from writing the screenplay for Psycho II, so he adapted Rear Window for contemporary preferences, adding a vampire as the antagonist. He was given a modern name in Jerry Dandridge, wore fashionable clothing, and even knew how to dance! Clearly, this was a novel idea that seems less impacting today than it actually was. Coming two years before The Lost Boys, Fright Night laid the groundwork for the revitalization of vampire cinema as it is today.Other than 80's-specific elements that are quite dated, Fright Night is nearly as pleasant today as it was a quarter-century ago. Holland isn't a great director and knows it, so his nostalgia and opportunism were stymied into making a genre horror film. And being such, the movie's adequacy denies its cult supporters from proclaiming it the classic they would like it to be while stylistically shielding it from being remade. The film's formula resonates as well today as it has since Nosferatu. A young man must save his lover from the clutches of a seductive vampire. Charlie Brewster of course manages to save his girlfriend Amy from Jerry, and he does it without our having to know too much about anyone involved in the process. Holland instead devotes a lot of the screenplay to various types of humor that vary in their effectiveness. Charlie is stuck between being a boy and a man and lets his curiosity deny him the sex he so much desires from Amy while making him susceptible to wasting his money warding off Jerry with every anti-vampire trinket his friend Ed sales him. Holland seems to have written the part of Charlie's assistant Peter Vincent for Roddy McDowell who literally echoes his anger at slasher films by saying, Today audiences only want to watch madmen chopping up young virgins. Unfortunately, Vincent's dialog is mostly just an explicit in-joke for fans, but McDowell's aptness for physical comedy redeems the character in the film's second half. His television program, another in-joke, could actually be made relevant in the remake were it tied more appropriately to a character. Holland chooses to focus on what he perceives as a funny screenplay to make up for his pedestrian direction. His skills sure are obvious and in need of a re-write.Though, the enduring legacy of Fright Night has everything to do with Jerry Dandridge. His turtlenecks, affinity for art, physical closeness to his manservant, and the pet name Jer he likes using, all point to the metrosexual identity that has come to define the modern vampire. He never has to reaffirm his masculine identity, thus allowing the humor to actually be effective. Chris Sarandon plays the role to its fullest with his perpetually smug facial expressions, beyond what Holland probably intended. Even today there aren't actually that many notable gay vampires, but Louis and Edward can trace their family history distinctly to Jerry Dandridge.Recommended ","genre":null},{"date":"11 September 2011","score":"","review":" While it is inconceivable to imagine a time when vampires weren't smothering pop culture, when Fright Night was released in 1985 audiences were more interested in slasher sequels.

The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is perhaps the most knowing and self-aware statement of those themes. It appeared however in the early 1960s, an era in which the classic Western itself had run its course and was beginning to fade from cinema screens.Of course, such an ultimate Western could have no-one less a personage than John Wayne in a lead role. This was just about the last time The Duke&#x99; would be able to play the he-man as opposed to the old man. Compare his physique here to that just six years later in True Grit. Though in his mid-50s, Wayne still has all the presence and charisma that made him the archetypal Man of the West, at least in outward appearance. And who better to play the level-headed lawyer who serves as both his ally and nemesis than good old Jimmy Stewart. Stewart works here because although a similar age to Wayne he has that real ability to inhabit the persona of an even older man in the prologue, and then remember that eager youth he was in Mr Smith Goes to Washington for the main bulk of the movie. This is a typically deep and considered performance from Stewart. Look at the way he places his hand on Doniphon's coffin, conveying so much meaningful reverence in such a tiny gesture.And appropriately enough The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance comes right at the tail-end of the career of John Ford, the man who was to Western directing what Wayne was to Western acting. Let's forget for a moment that this is (for very good reasons) Ford's first black and white Western since 1950. An equally big departure here is the sense of smallness and confinement. Most of Ford's oaters were what I call *plains Westerns*, ones set way out in the wilderness. This however is firmly a *town Western* of saloons and homesteads, and is in fact even more sparing in its use of landscape than such seminal town Westerns as High Noon and The Gunfighter. In fact the only really significant use of Western backdrop is in the prologue where we see the remains of Doniphon's shack, with some typically Fordian framing beneath the bow of a tree. It gives us this little whiff of the great outdoors, and it's enough to colour the rest of the movie, indoor and stuffy as it is. When we return to that location later on, the backdrop is not so prominent. It's only in the very last shot that we receive a pay-off.

But really, it is more about the death of the *Western* itself (of which Jimmy Stewart was presumably innocent). There's more to Ford's choice to shoot in monochrome than for a bleak, shadowy look. Apart from the widescreen and of course the ages of the various actors, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance looks like it could have been made at any time in the preceding twenty years. The acting is of a style that was fast becoming outmoded by 1962, with Edmund O'Brien and Strother Martin both gloriously theatrical. And although there we seldom see rolling plains or galloping horses, this is still a movie of Western cliché, epitomised in a brilliant shot of John Wayne and Lee Marvin staring each other down completely motionless.

This is really not something that I can say about this sequel.This was a pretty bad movie, plain and simple. It has a very weak story, that the film-makers don't even seem able to handle but what was mostly disappointing that this movie really wasn't much fun to watch. There really is no good comedy in this movie, which already is plenty of reason to just skip on this movie.Guess it has lots to do with the fact that this movie had a different director involved. And not a very good one! Brian Yuzna's directing is incredible lacking. The movie has an awful pace and it takes a long while for the story to actually kick in. But once it does it becomes all the more apparent what an incredible mess this movie actually is. Different story lines are hanging together, without really making an apparent connection. Lots of characters and actors from the first movie return in this one but you really should wonder why they are even in this. They don't really have a big impact on the story it seems and the movie could had so easily done without most of them. They just seemed to be thrown in all, in a desperate attempt to continue to the series.

I hope this doesn't mean that we can still expect more sequels to be made in the far future.Just like the first movie, it's deliberately trying to be B-movie like, with over-the-top moments and silly characters but by doing so this movie actually becomes a B-movie itself and just not a very good or enjoyable one.it's also a problem that this movie truly seems to be lacking creativity.

If you do, you're good. If you don't, you are the red-headed step child among your friends and are subject to ridicule because you didn't laugh all that much. I have to say I'm in that category, but I appreciated what the film was doing. It was trying to be a different movie for a certain crowd. It succeeds in being different, but not much else.I think that this film is appreciated by people who also worship The Big Lebowski and the new comedy Our Idiot Brother, also starring Paul Rudd. They have a certain quotable reputation and are filled with so many random and oddball scenes that they soon get the cult classic status. I did like The Big Lebowski, but didn't see much hope in a rewatch because of the humor only being truly hilarious one time around. Some have said that Wet Hot American Summer gets better with repeated viewings. I don't think I'll stick around to find out.The story is just thrown together with odds, ends, and characters. Everything is thrown against the wall and the characters wander aimlessly throughout the camp hoping to be hit on the end with some comical elements. We're at Camp Firewood, a Jewish summer camp, and this is the last day of the summer. Everyone is scrambling to find someone of the opposite sex, or same sex, to be with so they can share a kiss at the end of the summer talent show.The characters are has shallow as the no diving end at a pool.

It's rarely taken in a fresh manner, and it always results in the same jokes again and again. Some horror movies, like Friday the 13th work because they are in a camp, at night, giving a creepy vibe to an already uneasy setting. In comedies that use the setting, it seems that every film is just random antics, with no rhyme or reason, filled with incompetent camp counselors and teenagers fueled by raging hormones and immaturity.The characters are drawn and made to be likable, but they are nothing but walking mannequins motivated by personal satisfaction, lust, ego, and hormones. Many of us are, but it rarely do these things make a good, likable film. If the film had been more about finding your inner self and more a coming of age story rather than just be a comedy run by the characters' ridiculous antics it probably could've been more inspiring and more entertaining.The acting and directing doesn't kill the film has much as the events and characters do.

If you do, you're good. If you don't, you are the red-headed step child among your friends and are subject to ridicule because you didn't laugh all that much. I have to say I'm in that category, but I appreciated what the film was doing. It was trying to be a different movie for a certain crowd. It succeeds in being different, but not much else.I think that this film is appreciated by people who also worship The Big Lebowski and the new comedy Our Idiot Brother, also starring Paul Rudd. They have a certain quotable reputation and are filled with so many random and oddball scenes that they soon get the cult classic status. I did like The Big Lebowski, but didn't see much hope in a rewatch because of the humor only being truly hilarious one time around. Some have said that Wet Hot American Summer gets better with repeated viewings. I don't think I'll stick around to find out.The story is just thrown together with odds, ends, and characters.

It had great actors, great scenics, great cinematography, and no story. Perhaps the story was there, as it was an adaptation of a novel, but the director TOTALLY failed to tell whatever story there was to be had. The director did a great job of finding shots, and making the viewer feel as though he was experiencing a developing mining town in the 1800's, but there was just no cohesion of story telling. The pace of the movie was so slow, it was impossible to follow. One scene sets up, and you think as the viewer that you are going to being to get a feeling of what the movie is about, and then it just trails off and another scene begins. I thought it was especially stupid when the band of guys with guns confronts the band of rail road guys. Everybody pulls out their guns, the rail road guy shoots on of the town guys, and then all the town guys just turn around and walk away like nothing happened. The direction was so soft, so subdued, so poker-faced, that the movie never picks up any momentum and consequently fails in telling any real story. This is a failure of the director. This movie should be avoided. If you are looking for a good western about gold miners confronting greedy town folk, then you should watch PALE RIDER with Clint Eastwood. THE CLAIM was boring and pointless. The only reason I rated it a 2 instead of a 1 is because I thought it was shot well. One last point I want to make is the Wes Bently looked pretty much exactly the same in this as he did in American BEAUTY, sporting the same stupid snow cap. That kind of snow cap is a modern one, with an ELASTIC HEAD BAND, that did not exist in the 1800's. Again, a total failure on the part of the idiot that directed this disaster.

Whilst in the Zone the Writer and the Scientist embody their two distinct ways of thinking through their actions and words creating a dialogue on the human condition.

I would say that this is one of the strangest yet most beautiful films I've ever seen. The philosophy and symbolism is so thick that it is very hard to grasp a coherent message. Set in some kind of post apocalyptic wasteland two men (a writer and a scientist) embark on a quest to the mysterious 'Zone' where in a certain room one's desires are made reality. On their journey they are guided by the Stalker - a man who understands the zone and is able to navigate through it's landscapes and hazards. Whilst in the Zone the Writer and the Scientist embody their two distinct ways of thinking through their actions and words creating a dialogue on the human condition. I think perhaps the Stalker represents the inner self - trapped in his life, searching for an escape and a purpose, displaying the strengths and weaknesses of human beings and perhaps discovering what is truly important at the end of the film.The cinematography is utterly fantastic from the depressing squalor of the opening to the lush vegetation of the Zone with its crumbling vestiges of civilisation; from the confusing close ups of man made objects to the captivating close ups of haggard Russian faces; from the creative use of camera angles and lighting to the jarring and puzzling uses of sets and props, this film is so visually rich and an absolute feast for the eyes! The acting is great too but I especially liked the writer and the wife's scene at the end is very powerful.Be warned that this film is very slow and artsy fartsy to the nth degree - it's sci-fi Jim but not as you know it. I also found it totally baffling especially in the last scenes as it really takes you somewhere that you were not expecting, but I guess you wouldn't expect anything less based on the previous 2hrs!

Uma Thurman... good choice for Poison Ivy, but badly performed and a total miss as a character. Bane? As a character from the comic, well he jumped right on the movie screen here, he visually looks good, but he is still extremely irritating!

With its opening credits super imposed over that of a cobra, one would expect this product to be set somewhere in Burma where hunters fall victim to a dangerous and largest of all venomous snakes. The cobra in this case is a symbol, categorized later in the story to be one of the female characters depicted through a close up of a bronze sculptured cobra mesmerizing a tiger. Nita Naldi assumes the role of the temptress symbolizing the cobra while Valentino, the tiger, becoming its prey, and reciting these words, You are infamous - you are poisonous, like a cobra! There are times when friendship becomes the most important thing in a man's life, stronger than love, equal to any sacrifice -- even that of love itself, marks the first inter-title as the plot begins amusingly on the terrace of Cafe Del Mare as Victor Manardi (Hector V. Sarno) arrives looking for Rodrigo Torriani (Rudolph Valentino), a young Italian count who's been romancing his daughter, Rosa (Claire De Lorenz). Wanting to settle an account with him, he mistakes the visiting American, John Jack Dorning (Casson Ferguson), for the count. The disruption has Rodrigo entering the scene posing as an Italian interpreter, proving Dorning to be whom he is and not Torriani. Torriani then takes Jack with him to his debt-ridden palace where he tells of his life story and family history. Because his playboy lifestyle finds him with female complications, Jack helps him to forget women by inviting him to sail with him to New York where he's to become his partner at his antique shop, Dorning & Sonm which he readily accepts. Believing New York a great place to avoid female troubles, Rodrigo soon encounters Mrs. Huntington Palmer (Lillian Leighton), a dowager, who introduces him to her niece, Elise Van Zile (Nita Naldi), a fortune hunter. Learning Rodrigo to be penniless, Elise soon turns her affections towards Jack. Though Jack is loved by Mary Drake (Gertrude Olmstead), his loyal secretary, he marries the flirtatious vamp who, in turn, uses Rodrigo as her lover on the side. Arranging a secret rendezvous at the Van Cleve Hotel, Room 1002, Rodrigo, due to his loyalty towards Jack, rejects Elise's advances and leaves. The next day Rodrigo reads in the newspaper the startling news of the hotel burning down, claiming Elise and an unidentified man as victims. Guilt-stricken, Rodrigo is torn between telling Jack the truth about his unfaithful wife or keeping her illicit affairs a secret.Seldom revived Valentino melodrama, COBRA has turned up on cable television's Nostalgia Channel as part of its Saturday night line-up of When Silents Were Golden. In its March 19, 1994, broadcast, COBRA consisted of a print with piano sound score composed by Bob Mizzell (Copyright 1979 by Big Eopper Music\/Mizzell Films). While it was commendable for Nostalgia Television's dedication to rare and hard to find feature films from the silent screen era, the series was regrettably handicapped by frequent and long-winded commercial breaks. Other video or DVD distributors as Kino Video and\/Or Grapevine Video featured different scoring and time frames (70 to 75 minutes) while Image Home Entertainment contains average orchestral score by David Shepard (1998).Not quite an important film in a sense of greatness, COBRA still owes some of its modest degree to the short-lived leading man status of Rudolph Valentino. Nita Naldi might be another reason for her title-influenced characterization. Naldi, who vamped Valentino most famously in BLOOD AND SAND (Paramount, 1922), does the same here, but not so memorably this time around. Her career as a silent screen vamp would soon come to a close before the end the decade. Cemented into his image as a great lover, COBRA offers Valentino one of his few chances to enact a portrayal true to his Italian origin as well as appearing in a product in contemporary setting as opposed to others taken from another time or place. Often categorized as a disappointing Valentino melodrama, it somehow works on a level of choice, whether accepting COBRA for what it is or simply laugh at its outdated acting style and material. Casson Ferguson (1891-1929), a name nobody knows, who, like Valentino, succumbed too early in life, dying from pneumonia four years after the release of COBRA. Ferguson's role of an American business owner who hires the Italian count to be the expert on Italian antiques is acceptable but forgettable in its final result. Gertrude Olmstead (1987-1975) gives an commendable performance as the secretary who comes to a decision which man she truly wants. Also featured in the cast are Eileen Percy (Sophie Binner, the blackmailer, Believe it or not, she's a lady); Henry Barrows (Henry Madison, Manager of Dorning & Son); and Rosa Rosanova playing Marie.While the COBRA title had been used a couple of times subsequently, the basis from this story were never remade, not even as the 1986 action thriller starring Sylvester Stallone. For this 1925 edition, no cobras here, just fine actors doing what they do best, rising above an average story scripted by Anthony Coldeway, adapted from the Martin Brown play, some venom by Nita Naldi, the presence of Rudolph Valentino and the films for which he appeared that have survived through the passage of time.

Being Stanley Kubrick's final film and starring then married couple Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman, there was good reason for it to be so anticipated. Critical reception was positive but underwhelming, critics mostly admired the film but few called it a masterpiece. Audience response was mixed to negative, Eyes Wide Shut was a modest box office success based solely on it's two stars. The opinion of some of Kubrick's films have changed drastically over the years. 2001 and The Shining received mixed to negative responses when they first debuted, now both are viewed as seminal masterpieces in their genre. It'll be interesting how Eyes Wide Shut is viewed in another ten years, I'm not so sure how it's overall legacy has changed much in the twelve years since it debuted. My opinion of Eyes Wide Shut on the first viewing was that it was an interesting failure. It had some memorable scenes and images but I just didn't see the point in the film. For the most part, it seemed like Kubrick was going through the motions and it was an underwhelming way to end a brilliant career. To say my opinion has changed is an understatement. While I would not call Eyes Wide Shut a masterpiece, I will say it is a very worthy addition to Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre and a fitting conclusion to his career. When I watch it now I see a film with some very memorable scenes and rich images, but also a fascinating look at jealousy and sexual temptation. What wasn't apparent to me on the first viewing has become so on repeated ones. The gratuitous sex doesn't seem pointless anymore, it's there for a reason. Give Kubrick credit for making sex seem so unappealing and mechanical, he's making a statement about the human condition. Sex isn't about love in EWS, very little of the sex is an act of love here, it's about filling urges and temptations. EWS has the same striking visual style as previous Kubrick films. The film has a dream-like atmosphere, which has lead some people to believe that much of what is transpiring on the screen is a dream through Tom Cruise's character. The most memorable scene is the sexual orgy, it's very Gothic with the black cloaks and the masks worn by the characters. This scene ranks up there with the most memorable imagery in Kubrick's films. Another memorable scene is Tom Cruise's character being stalked through the streets of New York. On the first viewing, I was not crazy about Tom Cruise's performance, I would've described it as wooden. While I don't view it as great work and there are few instances where the performance falls flat, I think it is a generally solid performance. Nicole Kidman, though she has lesser screen time, is consistently excellent, taking attention away from Cruise every time they're on screen together. EWS is a complex film that's difficult to describe and hard to take in on a single viewing. This film needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Perhaps it's not for everyone, which describes most of Kubrick's films, but for the adventurous film watcher, EWS is a worthy film.

What wasn't apparent to me on the first viewing has become so on repeated ones. The gratuitous sex doesn't seem pointless anymore, it's there for a reason. Give Kubrick credit for making sex seem so unappealing and mechanical, he's making a statement about the human condition. Sex isn't about love in EWS, very little of the sex is an act of love here, it's about filling urges and temptations. EWS has the same striking visual style as previous Kubrick films. The film has a dream-like atmosphere, which has lead some people to believe that much of what is transpiring on the screen is a dream through Tom Cruise's character. The most memorable scene is the sexual orgy, it's very Gothic with the black cloaks and the masks worn by the characters. This scene ranks up there with the most memorable imagery in Kubrick's films. Another memorable scene is Tom Cruise's character being stalked through the streets of New York. On the first viewing, I was not crazy about Tom Cruise's performance, I would've described it as wooden. While I don't view it as great work and there are few instances where the performance falls flat, I think it is a generally solid performance. Nicole Kidman, though she has lesser screen time, is consistently excellent, taking attention away from Cruise every time they're on screen together. EWS is a complex film that's difficult to describe and hard to take in on a single viewing. This film needs to be watched more than once to be appreciated. Perhaps it's not for everyone, which describes most of Kubrick's films, but for the adventurous film watcher, EWS is a worthy film.

Being Stanley Kubrick's final film and starring then married couple Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman, there was good reason for it to be so anticipated. Critical reception was positive but underwhelming, critics mostly admired the film but few called it a masterpiece. Audience response was mixed to negative, Eyes Wide Shut was a modest box office success based solely on it's two stars. The opinion of some of Kubrick's films have changed drastically over the years. 2001 and The Shining received mixed to negative responses when they first debuted, now both are viewed as seminal masterpieces in their genre. It'll be interesting how Eyes Wide Shut is viewed in another ten years, I'm not so sure how it's overall legacy has changed much in the twelve years since it debuted. My opinion of Eyes Wide Shut on the first viewing was that it was an interesting failure. It had some memorable scenes and images but I just didn't see the point in the film. For the most part, it seemed like Kubrick was going through the motions and it was an underwhelming way to end a brilliant career. To say my opinion has changed is an understatement. While I would not call Eyes Wide Shut a masterpiece, I will say it is a very worthy addition to Stanley Kubrick's oeuvre and a fitting conclusion to his career.

The Battle itself is pretty well depicted, but is unfortunately left to basically the last third of the film. At that point, it perhaps overdoes the use of film footage of planes being shot down and loses sight of the human side of the battle from time to time. It does manage to get many of the details right, and it successfully manages to avoid for the most part the good American vs the bad Japanese stereotypes. These Japanese were military men out to fight and win a war - just like their American counterparts. There was no sense of moral superiority of one over the other. These were two countries at war and two fleets involved in battle, with neither being sure of what the other was up to. If there had been more focus on the battle itself - and especially the human side of the battle - I'd rate this a lot higher.A lot of the runtime of the film, though, is taken up with the planning for the battle. That's important, of course, but not really the stuff out of which excitement is manufactured. The biggest weakness, though, is the rather forced subplot about the internment and mistreatment of loyal Japanese Americans, introduced by having Tom (Edward Albert) engaged to a young Japanese American woman who's about to be shipped off to an internment camp, and Tom's father Captain Garth (Charlton Heston) involved in some tension with his son over this issue. It was unnecessary and it wasn't really either developed or seen through to fulfilment. The cast is pretty well known, but really there were no true standout performances.

James Woods was under used and yet I thought his scenes were the film's highlights but a mere cameo couldn't save this wreck. Mary McCormack was equally wasted in her little part. The very worst piece of casting was Bernard Hill....truly bizarre. I don't suppose America has much idea about Yosser Hughes...I don't think it's possible to act and direct and give your best to both jobs. The pacing is all ponderous and Eastwood's performance is lazy...just the typical late era Eastwood characterisation of a hard drinking, lecherous b***ard who just happens to be the best at his job and it's lucky that it all just comes easy to him. Swap Dirty Harry's nose for his reporter's nose in this bilge...it's like Mr Benn trying on a different uniform each week.I loved Dirty Harry but those films became formulaic...and so has much of his acting since. The Space Cowboys bilge was even worse than this clunker, so maybe he's trying to kill his iconic status before he dies?

I have watched other movies about wives betraying their husbands and have liked them. For example I liked Unfaithful also featuring Diane Lane. This particular movie however, I felt was depicting the process of betrayal in very unnatural way. Main character Pearl decides to have an extra marital affair and even when caught does not show the emotions that I would expect from a character like hers. She decides to leave at night while her mother-in- law is asking her not to go. Mother-in-law finds out that she is having an affair but does very little about it. Daughter finds out that her mother is sleeping with another man and she shows her anger for mere two minutes. Husband finds out that wife is screwing another man and he just throws the milk and drives car fast. At the end all are fine. I personally feel that even in American family in 1969 this is not what happens after an extra marital affair. This movie almost seemed like the director was telling the audience that this is how you should behave after having an affair. Very unconvincing story-line.

It has existed on the outside edge of my awareness since I was a kid, and I have caught odd tasters of various versions over the year without ever encountering the full works. So this 1994 movie version is the first version I have ever experienced all the way through, and I am considering it on a stand alone basis.This is an historical piece, telling of four sisters growing up in fairly cushioned circumstances in Concord Massachusetts. Father is away in the Civil War and money is tight. Each of the sisters is strongly drawn, but the story belongs to Jo, strong-willed, independent, and rather progressive (and, I suspect, also author Louisa M Alcott's alter ego).It is also rather soapy, much of what happens being fairly ordinary - money problems, boyfriend problems, births, deaths, marriages and so on. It's all fairly comforting and mildly entertaining.It comes alive when it hits moments of high emotion, and also when it follows Jo into an adult life in which she chooses to quietly challenge convention. She is also the sister who has the least obvious love life, falling in love (though neither of them are minded to face it) with German Professor Baer.This film is beautiful to look at and presents attractive performances from all the principals. The story is, frankly, a bit drippy for your average ageing British bloke, but it passes the time reasonably well. I think women will enjoy this a lot I enjoyed it well enough.
