[{"date":"9 October 2009","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In the cinema, as in most areas of life, one occasionally comes across some strange coincidences. In 1999 the then reigning James Bond, Pierce Brosnan, starred in a heist movie, The Thomas Crown Affair, about a suave, sophisticated Scottish art thief who becomes entangled with a glamorous female American insurance investigator. And in the same year the original Bond, Sir Sean himself, starred in a heist movie, Entrapment, about a suave, sophisticated Scottish art thief who becomes entangled with a glamorous female American insurance investigator. A priceless Rembrandt painting is stolen from an office. Virginia Baker, an investigator working for the painting's insurers, suspects that the culprit is Robert Mac MacDougal a well-known international art thief, and is instructed investigate him. She tries to entrap him by claiming that she herself is an art thief and that she needs his help to carry out one of her schemes, the theft of a priceless Chinese mask from an English stately home. Mac does not need the money (he is already extremely wealthy and lives in a luxurious castle in the Scottish Highlands) but cannot resist the challenge of trying to outwit the owner's extremely elaborate security precautions. Having completed the theft of the mask, Mac and Virginia then plan an even bigger job, the theft of $8 billion from a bank. (This particular theft does not involve works of art, but will be accomplished by computer fraud). The scene of the crime is to be the Petronas Towers, Kuala Lumpur, Jon Amiel having borrowed Alfred Hitchcock's device of a cliffhanging scene set at a well-known landmark structure. (In 1999 the towers were the world's tallest building). Like his exact contemporary Clint Eastwood (both were born in 1930), Sean Connery has continued to act in action films throughout his sixties and into his seventies- The Rock and The League of Gentlemen are other examples- but as with Eastwood his age is generally an important plot point. (Certain other ageing action heroes still insist on taking roles which rally should go to men several decades younger). Here Mac accepts Virginia's assistance in stealing the mask because, in his sixties, he is no longer as athletic as he once was and needs a younger accomplice. Like most films of this type, Entrapment has a complicated plot. Many of the complications, apart from the details of the actual crimes, derive from what might be called a triangle of mistrust. The three parties involved in this triangle are Mac, Virginia and her boss, Hector Cruz. No-one knows whom they can trust. Is Virginia really helping Mac, or is she simply trying to entrap him? Is she working on her own account, planning to betray both Mac and her employers in her own interests? Or is it in fact Mac who is planning to betray Virginia to the police?For a film that makes glamour its main selling-point, it was a wise move to cast Catherine Zeta Jones as the female lead, as she was probably the most beautiful screen star of the nineties. Apart from the Petronas Towers cliffhanger, the one scene in this film that everyone will remember is the one where the lovely Catherine, dressed in a figure-hugging catsuit, does an elaborate gymnastic routine around network of laser beams during the stealing of the mask. She and Connery work well together despite the big age difference.For me, one weakness of this film, and of the genre to which it belongs, is that it is based on the sort of moral code that will not bear too close scrutiny. The main rule of heist movies is that the commandment Thou shalt not steal does not apply in situations where no-one gets hurt, where the victims are large corporations or hugely wealthy individuals and where the perpetrators are suitably glamorous, especially if they are sexy young women like Catherine Zeta. Yet despite its dubious morality, Entrapment is generally enjoyable. I would rate it higher than the Brosnan Thomas Crown Affair remake, which suffers by comparison with its predecessor. Like the best heist movies- the original 1967 Thomas Crown being a good example- it is slick, glossy fast-moving and does not take itself too seriously. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 October 2009","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In the cinema, as in most areas of life, one occasionally comes across some strange coincidences.

The same could be said of Woody Allen. For years the received criticism of every new Woody film has been Woody is not as funny as he used to be. He never was. Exactly when he was funny varies according to the particular tastes of the critic in question. Some will tell you that he has not been funny since Hannah and Her Sisters, others that he has done nothing worthwhile since Manhattan. There are probably even some purists who will insist that nothing in his later work can compare to early slapstick comedies like Sleeper or Bananas.I myself have never been an adherent of the Woody is not as funny as he used to be school of thought, for two reasons. Firstly, not all his films from his supposed golden age in the seventies and eighties were equally good; several of the sketches in Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex&#x85;., for example, today come across as frankly embarrassing. Secondly, by no means all of his films from the 1990s and the 2000s are weak; he has made a number of good films during this period, of which Sweet and Lowdown is one of the best.In structure the film is a mock-documentary about Emmett Ray, a jazz guitarist from the 1930s. Ray is a fictitious character, although the spoof is so well done that it becomes entirely credible. (The day after I first saw this in the cinema I went to the library to check out what it said about him in an encyclopaedia of jazz. Needless to say, I did not find his entry). Scenes from Ray's life are intercut with shots of jazz experts, including Allen himself, being interviewed about Ray's music. To add to the idea that this is a non-fiction documentary, the various commentators give differing versions of anecdotes about Ray or differing interpretations of his life.Allen, of course, is well known for his love of jazz, and it would appear that he first conceived the ambition to make a film about a jazz musician in the early seventies, but this did not come to fruition until 1999. He originally planned to play the part of Emmet Ray himself, but unless he has a much wider range as an actor than he has hitherto shown it was a wise decision to cast Sean Penn rather than himself in the role, as Ray is far from being a typical Woody character. For a start, he is neither Jewish nor a New Yorker. Nor is he a nervous, angst-ridden, self-deprecating intellectual- indeed, he is far from being an intellectual at all. Great artists are not always great men, and for all his brilliance as a performer Ray is a deeply flawed individual- crude, boorish, an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac. Besides his music, he has a sideline as a ponce running a stable of prostitutes. His idea of a hobby is to go down to the local rubbish dump and shoot rats, even inviting his girlfriends to join him in this dubious sport. Obviously the last of the great romantics.Ray is also conceited about his talent, proclaiming himself to be the second best guitarist in the world after his idol Django Reinhardt (who was of course a real person). Ray's relationship to Reinhardt, whom he does not know personally, is a complicated mixture of jealousy and hero-worship; he adores Reinhardt's music, but also hopes to be able to better it. Ray's one redeeming quality is his passionate dedication to his art, and Penn (in an excellent performance) is able to suggest all the many facets of his personality and to make him someone who is not totally unsympathetic despite his many faults.The other really excellent performance is that of the young Samantha Morton as Ray's sweet, innocent girlfriend Hattie. Hattie is mute, which means that Morton could only express her character through gestures and facial expressions. It is a performance similar to that of Marlee Matlin as the deaf-mute heroine of Children of a Lesser God, although with the difference that Hattie, although mute, is not deaf. Uma Thurman is also good as Ray's wife Blanche, an upper-class socialite who marries Ray out of what might be called nostalgie de la boue. She is attracted to him precisely because he is crude and uncultured with dubious personal habits- they first meet when she catches him stealing an ornament at a party.There is plenty of humour in the film, much of it centred upon Ray's sense of self-importance, such as the slapstick sequence about his attempt to make a stage entrance seated on a wooden crescent moon lowered down from above. It is not, however, a pure comedy, but also a character study and a film about the power of music to transform even the most mundane of lives. I am by no means a great jazz buff, but I was enthralled by the beauty of the music in this film (performed by the guitarist Howard Alden).

A movie producer played with Walter Pidgeon's unfettered naturalness urges them to help Shields out. The subsequent segmented chronicles are narrated in recollection. In each retrospective, Shields' extravagant life is seen through their eyes. Their careers have profited from working with him, but each of them also undergo an intimate expense. Jonathan estranges, cons, deceives, abandons, and almost consumes each of them in his own egocentric, legendary ascent to his peak.This was one of the first in an extensive sequence of films, some acerbic and disparaging, that lampooned, speared or studied the making of films on the gaudy Hollywood back lot, including the same year's and studio's Singin' in the Rain, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, Truffaut's Day for Night, Kazan's The Last Tycoon, Robert Altman's The Player, and sundry more. This one is a melodrama, but director Vincente Minnelli separates his love of romantic fantasy from his ability to identify with the whole spectrum of human gray area, yet there is much veiled satire Indeed, Dick Powell's novel about early Virginia provides a wealthy opportunity for it. We deliberately determine that this serious work is a commercial work. It promises its celebrity with a liberal peppering with sex, and the film version is decidedly trite with a man in a gray Confederate uniform is pecking with a heroine. The Bad and the Beautiful submits that romances of the Old South merely sell the tackiest sentimental delusions. This Minnelli endeavor also sees making B-Movie Westerns as among the least notable enterprises in Hollywood. And budding star Lana Turner's first movie role associates trade novels with tasteless teasing and garish mise-en-scene.Alternately, there are tremendous insights into the creative process, such as when Shields proposes the concept of scaring people by uncertainty and shadows when called on to make a thriller influenced by the actual film Cat People. This inspired episode is realized with various lighting transitions, including turning a switch on and off and moving a lamp. The scene's intricacy is assured by its long-take camera movement, and its visceral effect is imprinted fleetingly in other moments Lights going on and off in the screening room cause the window from the projection booth to start or stop working as a mirror. We see the heroine's image show and vanish in the window.There is a party at a mansion where an enthralling tracking shot furnishes an elaborate evolution through the crowd, each of the extras having their own clique of goings-on and intellectual dialogue. Candelabra are everywhere. On the set of a movie wedding scene, there is a checkerboard floor, 19th Century dress uniforms, Christian symbolism. On another film set, a huge chandelier is over a dining room table, statues present. Another film set shows a revolution, opening with special effects men adding smoke. All the studio shooting set pieces are roped off from the real world. Their style is found in movie sets, not day to day. A few extras get to wear white tie and tails, but none of the outer movie's focal male characters ever do.Gloria Grahame won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this Hollywood melodrama, in which she plays a status-seeking wife, pressing her screenwriter husband to move to Hollywood and live a more lavish rank. But Kirk Douglas finds that she is distracting to her husband's screen writing. Despite her unmistakable sexy grandiosity and childlike enthusiasm, his award was clearly for her earlier work, as she hardly gets to do anything here but babble on in a Southern accent in the periphery of a few shots in the latter half of the film. But whatever she does, it's certainly a refreshment to see her in the interval dividing Lana Turner's screen time, because unlike Grahame, Turner does not, in her impersonal approach, appear to have any internal dynamics (as well as any reason for Jonathan to be coaching her on how to alluringly smoke a cigarette for her movie when her role is in a historical picture asva peasant princess). But overall, this is a fascinating film.

But overall, this is a fascinating film.

The main character, a freshly dead, underhanded, exploitative Broadway producer, was adapted into a living, vainglorious Hollywood producer desperate for a return in a versatile, restless performance by eternal youth Kirk Douglas.In Hollywood, screenwriter Dick Powell, played with an exacting self-honesty despite his old-fashioned style, movie star Lana Turner and director Barry Sullivan each decline to speak by phone to Douglas' Jonathan Shields. A movie producer played with Walter Pidgeon's unfettered naturalness urges them to help Shields out. The subsequent segmented chronicles are narrated in recollection. In each retrospective, Shields' extravagant life is seen through their eyes. Their careers have profited from working with him, but each of them also undergo an intimate expense. Jonathan estranges, cons, deceives, abandons, and almost consumes each of them in his own egocentric, legendary ascent to his peak.This was one of the first in an extensive sequence of films, some acerbic and disparaging, that lampooned, speared or studied the making of films on the gaudy Hollywood back lot, including the same year's and studio's Singin' in the Rain, Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, Truffaut's Day for Night, Kazan's The Last Tycoon, Robert Altman's The Player, and sundry more. This one is a melodrama, but director Vincente Minnelli separates his love of romantic fantasy from his ability to identify with the whole spectrum of human gray area, yet there is much veiled satire Indeed, Dick Powell's novel about early Virginia provides a wealthy opportunity for it. We deliberately determine that this serious work is a commercial work. It promises its celebrity with a liberal peppering with sex, and the film version is decidedly trite with a man in a gray Confederate uniform is pecking with a heroine. The Bad and the Beautiful submits that romances of the Old South merely sell the tackiest sentimental delusions. This Minnelli endeavor also sees making B-Movie Westerns as among the least notable enterprises in Hollywood. And budding star Lana Turner's first movie role associates trade novels with tasteless teasing and garish mise-en-scene.Alternately, there are tremendous insights into the creative process, such as when Shields proposes the concept of scaring people by uncertainty and shadows when called on to make a thriller influenced by the actual film Cat People. This inspired episode is realized with various lighting transitions, including turning a switch on and off and moving a lamp. The scene's intricacy is assured by its long-take camera movement, and its visceral effect is imprinted fleetingly in other moments Lights going on and off in the screening room cause the window from the projection booth to start or stop working as a mirror. We see the heroine's image show and vanish in the window.There is a party at a mansion where an enthralling tracking shot furnishes an elaborate evolution through the crowd, each of the extras having their own clique of goings-on and intellectual dialogue. Candelabra are everywhere. On the set of a movie wedding scene, there is a checkerboard floor, 19th Century dress uniforms, Christian symbolism. On another film set, a huge chandelier is over a dining room table, statues present. Another film set shows a revolution, opening with special effects men adding smoke. All the studio shooting set pieces are roped off from the real world. Their style is found in movie sets, not day to day.

So, if you belong to any minority, you have too invaluable advantages that no one from a majority has and that make you almost invulnerable.This is the only way I can try to explain to myself why someone whose sanity I would like to presuppose has financed the movie Once were warriors (1994). According to the company that produced the DVD, the story of the movie goes around a woman who is abused, violated, humiliated and still tries everything in her force to protect her family. When you actually watch the movie, you realize that both the woman and the man are drinkers. She sits already in the early morning at her kitchen table and drinks bottle after bottle of beer. He does exactly the same, only he does it in the local bar. When he comes home drunk, she is also drunk, when he brings money , they sleep with one another, but when he tells her that he earns 13 dollars less the next months, she keeps provoking him until he hits her. Not even than she stops attacking him with the worst possible vocabulary. He does the same, but in all scenes which the movie shows he is defending himself. Since he is the stronger, she always looses. She sits beaten up on the floor and cries Kill me, kill me. One gets the impression that she enjoys that.Therefore, this is the story Father drinks, mother drinks, mother provokes father, father beats mother up. That's it. This is repeated around 100 minutes long. The promoting company must have hallucinations when it saw in this movie any social-critical background. At the end of the movie, the mother blames the father because their daughter hung herself up, although we hear that she was raped by another family member. She turns towards him, says the sentence that became the title of this movie and discloses him that she goes back to her roots, i.e. she takes all the children and lets someone else pay for their living, because she does not earn money. Once were warriors must refer to the New Zealand Wars in the 19th century. However, it is strange that this is brought up in the situation in which the family is, because being a warrior is as untypical for any Polynesian as it can be. Polynesian behavior normally implies going out of the way of any social problem before it even appears. The reason for that may be that the ancestors of the Polynesians, coming to a big part from Europe, by the way, had nobody to fight against when they entered the South Seas Area, so they were not originally warriors. However, the movie has no story, no message, no meaning. It can best shown in which miserable condition today's Maori is, for those who understand the few morsels that they speak. The disaster of the whole film is especially not helped by imposing upon it some weird social ideas at the end.

Not to mention a romance that is both puzzling and oddly satisfying by the end, at least for me. Sean Connery seems an odd choice for Hitchcock, but if you can get James Bond out of your head (this is the same period), Connery works out well. Better than Tippi Hedron, who for me has always been a kind of archly false actress, perfect maybe for the plastic looks that Hitchcock milks, and bleeds, so well so often.Because, most of all, you have to see this movie to see Hitchcock at work. When the screen goes red as in a wash of fresh blood, when Bernard Hermann's score gushes with heavy orchestral doom, when the title character rides a horse top speed through the woods, and when this same character wakes from a nightmare with dread and fear in her face, you know you are in Hitchcock territory. There is almost no real blood, most of the movie is filled with petty crime and small talk, not murder, and the tension is often romantic, if anything. Such is Hitchcock, not a horror film director, but a suspense director, fluid, twisting, and patient.I say all this because if you don't know the director's films and are not used to the artifice he flaunts (the lack of total verisimilitude, suck-you-in realism, is decisive and deliberate), you might not get far with this. But once you accept it as theater, as a light hearted (though of course seriously made) entertainment, and one that is masterful at controlling its artifice, you'll be surprised for the better. It's a forgotten and really excellent movie, in some ways better than The Birds, which does have some more astonishing moments, but which stutters, too, just as this one does.In Marnie, there are echoes, maybe too many echoes, of other Hitchcock films--not just Tippi Hedron reappearing (Birds), but some effects with color and glaring back projection (Vertigo, for starters), and a secretary stealing money from her employer (Psycho). Here Hitchcock, typically, explores a psychological affliction, with an interesting positive thread through it all--the Sean Connery character, a very rich Mr. Rutland, is out to cure Marnie through it all.In interviews, Hitchcock is openly disdainful of psychology's ability to cure by mere analysis--he describes what happens in Marnie as a psychiatric purging, and says, Of course, I don't believe this to be true at all. Or something to that effect. And maybe this explains the puzzling lack of conviction that dogs the movie at times. You might also wonder what Rutland sees in this selfish, thieving, cranky woman, because he stays with her tenaciously, patiently, lovingly. Until the dramatic end, which is the true climax, including not only flashbacks in a great montage, but also a tracking zoom shot that distorts the room in a brilliant and often-copied way. Thank legendary cinematographer Robert Burks for giving even a lesser Hitchcock film every reason to watch it carefully all the way through.

He has created many classics, including Poltergeist, and the hip slasher\/monster movie The Funhouse. But Hooper began his career with a low-budget film that many had called gruesome, obscene, and unwatchable. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre may not be the most fun movie to watch, but it most certainly is a classic horror film.The plot is extremely simple. Five teens are traveling through Texas. The teens are Sally Hardesty, her wheelchair-bound bro Franklin, Kirk, Pam and Jerry. After picking up one wacko hitchhiker, it's pretty clear that the worst is yet to come for Sally and her friends. After their van runs out of gas, Kirk and Pam go looking for help and stumble upon a backwoods house. They don't come back, so Kirk goes looking for them. Kirk doesn't come back either. Now Sally and Franklin are left all alone with no sign of help. Tonight, Sally will be put through hell and back as she is brutally terrorized by a depraved group of cannibals, led by the iconic Leatherface, who uses a chainsaw to kill his victims.Tobe Hooper's non-stop fright-fest was released in a time where horror directors were considered insane. Films like The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes were two of those kind. But The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is where it was done best. So, what makes TCM a piece of essential horror? First off, the movie is extremely eerie and filled with tension and scares. It felt like you were watching some twisted documentary on some of the most brutal crimes in history. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is known for being the goriest movie of its kind. That is not all true. While the movie sure has its violent moments, a lot of the kills are off-screen, which just makes it scarier.Second of all, the acting feels so incredibly real. Marilyn Burns, Sally, was put through so much torture with TCM. All that running and getting hurt. I feel sorry for her just thinking about it. The rest of the teens are also very good. But the movie's demented clan of butchers are pretty damn believable. I thought they were actual criminals. You also gotta give props to Gunnar Hansen and Edwin Neal as Leatherface and The Hitchhiker. They are very good actors.Third of all, the movie's main villain, Leatherface, is so enormously scary. But he also is interesting to watch when he's not killing. Leatherface is not very intelligent, and he is pretty shocked when Sally and company appear at his house. But when he's on the job, he's a brilliant villain. The fact that this guy ran after his victims and you couldn't get away from him makes him creepy.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre will always be the most gruesome and claustrophobic horror film of the 70s. This one isn't for the faint of heart and if you get nightmares easily, TCM's definitely not for you. You'll feel like taking a shower after this movie. It's that effective.

She learns she will be receiving an inheritance from her deceased auntie in a quaint, conservative little rural town.

As a form of protest, I didn't see 'Cruising' until about 30 years after its release. The film remains controversial, though times have certainly changed. Gays were feeling somewhat empowered back then; however, mainstream media portrayals of gays were few and far between. Therefore, some gays protested what they considered a too-negative portrayal. Also, some protesters were testing if they actually could shut down a film production or significantly interfere with it. In DVD commentary, director Friedkin cites his freedom of speech right, and that is a valid point. Now that gays are quite visible in mainstream media, we have become less defensive about negative portrayals, and hopefully most of us recognize that freedom of speech is important to us too. The narrative involves finding the killer(s) of gay men in the leather S&M scene of those days. Oddly we never find out who he is or they are. In his commentary Friedkin contends that all the open questions and ambiguity were completely intended. Completely? I don't think so. He says 40 minutes had to be cut, and it's a stretch to believe that some narrative coherence was not sacrificed. The controversy centers on the relationship between sex and violence. (Some women are interested in S&M too but the film does not mention that). On the other hand, countless films have in some way explored a possible relationship between sex and violence. It seems difficult to argue that this should be taboo subject matter, no matter what community it takes place in.The club scenes in the film are quite sexy. No frontal nudity but practically everything else. 'Cruising' shares the distinction w\/ 'Querelle' of being the sexiest films I've rented. To its credit, the film acknowledges that a lot of blurring occurs. There are brief scenes in which 1 of the policemen is shown to be closeted but gay. Also, rather humorously, one of the clubs is shown to have a 'precinct' theme night, when virtually everyone is dressed in some kind of police uniform. So the movie shows 'crossing over' in both directions. In the film, the police are trying to prevent murders (as well as solve cases) but their methods are sometimes questionable. Not exactly new ground, but 'Cruising' makes a few stabs at being balanced. Eventually we find out that one of the main suspects (who probably committed at least 1 murder) had a difficult relationship w\/ his father. (ho hum). That comes off as trite, and certainly a lousy defense for becoming a psychokiller. Thus my middle-of-the-road rating not love, not hate.

First, the film shows us the amount of sacrifice that good men as George Baily do in order to see people around them happy. from the beginning of this movie, Baily starts to Sacrifice, First when he get beaten by the old pharmacist in order to prevent him from serving the wrong medicine, then the rescue of his brother, then dropping his dream in becoming an adventurer to allow his brother to study, and much more of these things, these allowed Baily to be rewarded for his acts at the end of the film, when all those people really were by his side in order to help him !

Here, in a bizarre casting choice, we replace the doubtfully capable Tippi Hedron with doubtfully appropriate Julie Andrews, fresh out of The Sound of Music. And of course, there is Paul Newman, who had recently filmed Harper and before that, Hud. A weird mix, and it has its moments. In fact, the chemistry between the two leads in the first scenes is surprising and you might expect or want more of that later on--and you won't get it.Add to these actors a tense milieu from the time, Cold War defections and the atom bomb, and you have an intriguing basis for making a movie. You can see why he gave it a go. The plot, for what it's worth, is ultimately thin and not convincing (hints of Cloak and Dagger with Gary Cooper way back in 1946) but Newman, at least, pulls off his role as Dr. Armstrong, atomic scientist, with intense restraint. Andrews? She doesn't sing, and there are no children to be seen (except briefly, on Hitchcock's lap in his cameo!), and frankly, sadly, she comes off a little out of her element. But then, her character as Armstrong's assistant is also meant to be a bit out to sea. We don't see too much of her. We do see lots of various bit characters, little known and not very interesting men, mostly, with Swedish or German accents. (I say it that way because they are almost just cardboard props for types of people--you know, those cold hearted Stasi types or the cool and cunning Swedes you can't quite figure out, neither of which is especially true or helpful for the plot.)Of course, Hitchcock doesn't intend to make this a Cold War commentary. (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold with Richard Burton the previous year is the film to see for that.) Hitchcock uses the East German scene as a backdrop for the suspense of deception, and of ordinary people trying not to get caught, a perennial theme he manages so well. Besides Newman, there is a fabulous small role by the great Soviet actress Lila Kedrova that brings the last half hour to life. In the middle of the movie there is one scene that's totally brilliant and wordless, with Newman and Carolyn Conwell in a farmhouse, and it's worth the ride alone. Don't miss that for the world.This can't be Hitchcock's or Newman's or Andrews's best movie for a lot of reasons. But it's a very good movie, which is enough for most of us, and an essential for any Hitchcock fan, and a enlightening surprise for anyone who thinks they know Paul Newman and want to see yet more of his impressive range.

The source material itself is one of King's merely decent moments, and only presents a sketch of the events that are fleshed out here, so we're left to trust the film-makers to put some meat on the bones of this tale about a cult-like band of religious zealot children who murder any adults they come across to appease an unseen god that lurks in the vast cornfields surrounding their desolate town. Though the core concept is rather intriguing, the execution here leaves a lot to be desired, and while Children Of The Corn isn't awful, it also isn't good.The bulk of King's original story is represented here, and the set-up that leads our hapless couple into the lair of the murderous children is portrayed quite well. But the film uses one of these children (a non-murderous one, luckily for the couple) to narrate the tale, which allows the film-makers to delve into elements of King's story that were only hinted at in the text, but also confuses the entire plot as we try to make sense of why only the narrator and his companion have managed to reject the religious fervor that grips every other child in the small Nebraska town.The source of this spiritual mania, only alluded to in King's story, is given full reign here, and that's ultimately what makes this film so utterly goofy. You see, our titular Children aren't just moved by their sinister saviour (He Who Walks Behind The Rows, natch) to murder all of the adults in town, but also to gather in the cornfields conducting religious sermons in wildly antiquated language. If the humor in these lengthy interactions between the psychobabble-spouting children was intentional, then we have to praise the film-makers for getting their point across, but one suspects that the kids are mostly playing things straight. This makes clunky dialogue like question me not, Malachai, for it is I who has been chosen and the classic Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, Outlander! inherently hilarious.Since we're relying almost exclusively on a cast of children, it isn't surprising that most of the acting in this film is atrocious. The afore-mentioned dialogue certainly doesn't help in this regard, and we can see the Children struggling to make sense of the Victorian language they are asked to emote (seize him? Who EVER says seize him?). The lanky lad portraying the evil Malachai has a particularly hard time keeping a straight face while spewing his hateful machinations, which is particularly fitting since we end up having a hard time keeping a straight face while we watch him spew them. Ditto with Isaac, the de facto leader of this crop-worshiping cult, thus the source of most of the silliest passages of lugubrious religious rhetoric.While a massacre in a diner starts the plot off, since the MPAA zealously neutered this film this expository sequence loses much of its horrific value. Most of the movie beyond the onset is relatively bloodless, which strips away the implied menace of the blade-toting kids, since we rarely see the results of their handiwork. Clearly there wasn't a big budget for effects, and this is never more evident than during the scenes where He Who Walks Behind The Rows manifests Himself, which integrate live footage with some very cheap and shoddy fire animation.Wisely, the film-makers have the sense to keep their apparently subterranean beast under wraps, but one of the ambiguities of King's original story was whether the children actually were in service of some dark presence, or if a collective insanity settled over them and prompted them to create a myth to support their murderous deeds. Personally, I find the second scenario more frightening. Apparently, the film-makers disagree with me, and they make it clear that there is something dwelling underneath the cornfield (shouldn't it be He Who Walks BELOW The Rows, then?). This sort of negates the sensibility of the climactic showdown with He, since laying waste to the cornfields with fire wouldn't do much to destroy a creature that lives safely burrowed under the cornfield, would it? Of course, this leaves definite room for a sequel... no less than six, in fact. I've never invested my time in any of the follow-ups, so I can't judge those objectively, but despite the few bits of inspiration here, Children Of The Corn is barely worth visiting once, let alone returning to for multiple harvests.But we do have to thank the Children for providing satire fodder for a particularly funny episode of South Park. Indeed, seeing this film makes a great deal of The Wacky Molestation Adventure that much more hilarious, so I can certainly recommend it for that purpose.However, as a horror film, Children Of The Corn is just too silly to have much impact. The premise here is decent, however, so perhaps the 2009 television remake did better things with it. I'll let you know when I see it.

If the humor in these lengthy interactions between the psychobabble-spouting children was intentional, then we have to praise the film-makers for getting their point across, but one suspects that the kids are mostly playing things straight. This makes clunky dialogue like question me not, Malachai, for it is I who has been chosen and the classic Outlander! We have your woman! She still lives, Outlander! inherently hilarious.Since we're relying almost exclusively on a cast of children, it isn't surprising that most of the acting in this film is atrocious. The afore-mentioned dialogue certainly doesn't help in this regard, and we can see the Children struggling to make sense of the Victorian language they are asked to emote (seize him? Who EVER says seize him?). The lanky lad portraying the evil Malachai has a particularly hard time keeping a straight face while spewing his hateful machinations, which is particularly fitting since we end up having a hard time keeping a straight face while we watch him spew them. Ditto with Isaac, the de facto leader of this crop-worshiping cult, thus the source of most of the silliest passages of lugubrious religious rhetoric.While a massacre in a diner starts the plot off, since the MPAA zealously neutered this film this expository sequence loses much of its horrific value. Most of the movie beyond the onset is relatively bloodless, which strips away the implied menace of the blade-toting kids, since we rarely see the results of their handiwork. Clearly there wasn't a big budget for effects, and this is never more evident than during the scenes where He Who Walks Behind The Rows manifests Himself, which integrate live footage with some very cheap and shoddy fire animation.Wisely, the film-makers have the sense to keep their apparently subterranean beast under wraps, but one of the ambiguities of King's original story was whether the children actually were in service of some dark presence, or if a collective insanity settled over them and prompted them to create a myth to support their murderous deeds. Personally, I find the second scenario more frightening. Apparently, the film-makers disagree with me, and they make it clear that there is something dwelling underneath the cornfield (shouldn't it be He Who Walks BELOW The Rows, then?). This sort of negates the sensibility of the climactic showdown with He, since laying waste to the cornfields with fire wouldn't do much to destroy a creature that lives safely burrowed under the cornfield, would it? Of course, this leaves definite room for a sequel... no less than six, in fact. I've never invested my time in any of the follow-ups, so I can't judge those objectively, but despite the few bits of inspiration here, Children Of The Corn is barely worth visiting once, let alone returning to for multiple harvests.But we do have to thank the Children for providing satire fodder for a particularly funny episode of South Park. Indeed, seeing this film makes a great deal of The Wacky Molestation Adventure that much more hilarious, so I can certainly recommend it for that purpose.However, as a horror film, Children Of The Corn is just too silly to have much impact. The premise here is decent, however, so perhaps the 2009 television remake did better things with it. I'll let you know when I see it.

The source material itself is one of King's merely decent moments, and only presents a sketch of the events that are fleshed out here, so we're left to trust the film-makers to put some meat on the bones of this tale about a cult-like band of religious zealot children who murder any adults they come across to appease an unseen god that lurks in the vast cornfields surrounding their desolate town. Though the core concept is rather intriguing, the execution here leaves a lot to be desired, and while Children Of The Corn isn't awful, it also isn't good.The bulk of King's original story is represented here, and the set-up that leads our hapless couple into the lair of the murderous children is portrayed quite well. But the film uses one of these children (a non-murderous one, luckily for the couple) to narrate the tale, which allows the film-makers to delve into elements of King's story that were only hinted at in the text, but also confuses the entire plot as we try to make sense of why only the narrator and his companion have managed to reject the religious fervor that grips every other child in the small Nebraska town.The source of this spiritual mania, only alluded to in King's story, is given full reign here, and that's ultimately what makes this film so utterly goofy.

The brother is paralyzed by this champ and the other brother finds a guy to train him so he can defeat this super killer guy who took out the American champ in a few seconds. So the rest of the movie is Jean training to get back at the super kick boxer. The movie is okay, but it has problems too. There is only so much training one can take and this one has those scenes in spades. The super kick boxer in the final fight is a bit weak and that whole fight is a bit anti-climatic. And seriously they just dump the American champ outside after his loss? Why did the American agree to go over there without some sort of backing by the government to take care of him and sanction the fight, just goes to show you never go to an underground like fighting arena to prove yourself.

If you're reading this and asking Who?, well I'll tell you. He first became known as the visual effects artist on Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, had just done the same for Robert Wise's The Andromeda Strain, and would later also serve in the same position on Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. One of his associates on this film was one John Dykstra who would later be acclaimed for his work on Star Wars a.k.a Episode IV A New Hope. Okay, the plot has Freeman Lowel (Bruce Dern) taking care of a forest put in a dome in space because Earth had become inhabitable because of various ecological problems. While he's serious about his work, his work mates John Keenan (Cliff Potts), Marty Barker (Ron Rifkin), and Andy Wolf (Jesse Vint), are more interested in riding fast in some go-cart-like vehicles and generally getting out of space since they've all been there for a long time. Eventually, they're all told to go home. However, there's something else about the order Freeman doesn't like...While the lead character doesn't always generate sympathy, one does feel for him because of his passions and his struggles to deal with his situations. He even decides to name a couple of his robot friends Huey and Dewey instead of the numbers they previously were called. Written by Deric Washburn, Michael (Mike) Cimino, and Steven (Steve) Bochco (yes, the future Oscar-winning director and the future co-creator of Hill Street Blues), Silent Running is a very compelling sci-fi drama about what it would be like if one man had to choose between what he believes and what he'd do to maintain that. Dern is very good as someone who tries to be hopeful but gets increasingly desperate. This film is not without humor, however, such as when he teaches the robots a card game especially when he laughs. And the music of Peter Schickele with lyrics sung by Joan Baez are hauntingly beautiful when they play on the soundtrack. So if you love sci-fi and care about the environment, I highly recommend Silent Running.

In the year 2029, the world is in the aftermath of a nuclear war and machines have taken over the world. But the machines have lost to the human resistance, and they send back a Terminator (800-series) (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to kill Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton). The humans send Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) as a protector, and both have to battle to cyborg and the police to save themselves.The story is simple and effective. It is just a mighty entertaining film, with great dialogue and wonderful action scene. They are visions of an apocalyptic future, as well as the scenes set in 1984, with The Terminator and Kyle Reese cause death and destruction across Los Andreas. James Cameron shows his skill as a writer and director, focusing on character development of his two main characters, showing how Sarah Conner turned from a scared kid to a strong woman that she becomes. The Terminator is show to be a totally ruthless machine, and it is easily the best role Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever done. I love the use of models, showing the dedication of James Cameron and Stan Winston to the project. They were great designs throughout the film. The film does have a B-Movie feel to it, but that what people like about it. It was meant to be fun.
