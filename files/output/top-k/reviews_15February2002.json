I don't think one person had the exact same reasons for disliking or loving the movie. I have my own opinions, however.I went and saw the movie twice. Not because it was a favorite or some fabulous film, but because I wanted my friends to see it. When I first saw the movie, I cried four times, and I do not cry at movies. It's not my thing. But this movie brought out so many emotions relating to my own life that I could not hold them in. Admiration, courage, sadness, happiness, and pure ANGER gripped me. My younger brother is autistic, much more severe case than Sam in the movie. But I totally related to the feelings of frustrations of dealing with people who treat you like s*** because you are different. My own good friends sit there right in front of me making fun of retarded kids knowing full well about my brother. This society acts as though it is so compassionate towards others, but reading some of these comments just proved that this isnt the case. i knew it before, though. oh well, theres only so much that can change a close minded person.The movie had its flaws, I'll admit. I walked out of the theater unsure if I even liked the film. It is pretty unbelievable that Sam could live in a nice area like he did with Lucy and raise her even to the age of 8, yet it has happened before i suppose.But from my own personal perspective, there was much more good to the movie than bad. The movie was filmed beautifully. I read comments people had about it looking like a camcorder and being too chaotic, but did you ever stop to think why? Sam is retarded, and his whole world is dizzy and confusing. The camera movements simply displayed how Sam was feeling and set the mood, a perfect way for it to be done. The movie was well acted, all i can say is SEAN PENN. I thought he was amazing. yes i will always think Leonardo did it best in gilbert grape but this is the closest i have seen. It was completely believable in that sense, and like another commenter stated, the chemistry between lucy and sam was incredible. what a great casting job and what a great job done by the cast!The message is there, whether you liked the movie or not. It was that love is not an emotion created for normal people, but one that anyone can feel. it was also about stereotypes and the fact that people judge before they know a damn thing. I suggest this movie for anyone, open your minds please! 8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2002","score":"","review":"  Well I have gone through almost all of the comments, it gets a bit time consuming, but it was interesting to see the different viewpoints on this movie.

ERIN BROCKOVICH is a horrible movie.  Whoever thought that a woman with a bad taste in clothing, a vulgar mouth that spews obsceneties every time it opens, and continuous self-absorption could be the basis for a quality movie?  This movie tries to illustrate Erin Brockovich as a kind person with a good heart and will stop at nothing to help people and to make things right.  What a load of SH**!  Steven Soderbergh tries to fool us into believing that Brockovich is a good-natured woman trying to help the disease-striken residents within the area of PG&E.  Any wise viewer would look past this and see the truth, which is that Erin Brockovich is nothing but a bitch with a dirty mouth, a fraud, a dumbass, and not to mention a bad mother, which is well displayed when she leaves her children with a man she doesn't even know (George, who she treats like crap, even when they're together).  Another thing I couldn't stand about Erin was her selfishness and ungreatful, rude attitude that she displayed for her boss.  It seemed that every half hour she was asking for a raise, didn't seem to care when Masery was facing financial problems as a result of the lawsuit, and showed no respect for him at any point in the movie.  I guess she thought that she was the only one working her ass off in this whole thing.And another thing that really annoyed me was that this movie was praised by so many people!  The movie had no good taste much like the title character. How this movie was praised by the Oscars is the worst of all things about this movie.1.)Best Picture.  PLEASE!  This movie was probably one of the worst of the year!  It had no place to be in the running as the best of the year.  Its spot could've easily been taken by Almost Famous.2.)Best Screenplay.  Susannah Grant may have had a remote deserving for an Oscar nomination if her screenplay was true to the facts, which would've illustrated that Erin Brockowitch truly is a money-hungary fraud who dresses like a wench.3.)Best Director.  Soderbergh is a great director.  But it was nothing out of the ordinary here.  He did deserve a nomination for TRAFFIC,which he won. But the Academy shouldn't have squandered yet another nomination on something that was not worth it. 4.- Best Supporting Actor.  This was the only deserving nomination for this movie.  Albert Finney brings us the only likeable main character in this movie, and serves as the only bright spot in the film, except for maybe Marg Helgenburger.  He made the movie somewhat watchable with his strong, compelling performance. 5.- And now, last and certainly the least, BEST FU**ING ACTRESS!  Julia Roberts did a bad\/OK job here.  Her performance might have been credible if she didn't accept all of these accolades.  All she did in the movie was flash her boobs, most of which were just a push-up bra, lash out at just about everyone in the movie for no good reason, and put in a sob, sympathetic facial expression, or a few tears in just to soften people up (didn't work on me Julia!).  The fact that she thought so much of her performance as to actually accept a nomination and then the award itself just shows how greedy she is.  Her nomination was a complete waste, and she couldn't hold a candle to any of those in the running.  Her nomination should've easily gone to one more deserving, such as Bjork for DANCER IN THE DARK.  The academy truly proved that it was out to boost egos and careers instead of rewarding for individual achievement.  The fact that every major awards organization (the oscars, golden globes, sag awards) and several critics associations gave their best actress honor to Roberts for her effortless performance instead of the true best actress of 2000, Ellen Burstyn, shows just how scandalous Hollywood is.  Roberts won the awards because she's the most bankable star in the business.  If these organizations did what they claimed, they would've awarded Ellen Burstyn for her heartbreaking performance in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.  Burstyn reaches out to audiences and rips their hearts out of their chests with her performance, which is unarguably the best in years, if ever, from an actress.  Not to mention the fact that Burstyn went through hell for her part, and still few gave her the recognition she deserves because they felt Julia should've won everything because she's younger, prettier(well, not really), and more people like her movies (yeah, sure remember, Burstyn was the lead in THE EXORCIST one of the most influential, scariest, and most talked about movies of all time in which she gave one of her best performances, not to mention her great performances in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE for which the academy awarded her, and SAME TIME, NEXT YEAR just to name a few.)Overall, I give this an imdb rating of 1\/10.

I can, instead, describe how I felt as I watched the movie.In my 30 years of life, my top three movie moments are 1) The opening battle scene of Star Wars when Darth Vader comes walking through the door, 2) Seeing the AT-AT's marching toward the Rebel base on Hoth in the Empire Strikes Back, and 3) the speeder chase scene through the Forest on Endor in Return of the Jedi.  I mention this because these three moments were so awesome to me because I couldn't believe I was seeing it.  I'd never seen anything like it before.  It was literally a feast for the eyes!Lord of the Rings had the same effect on me.  With every scene, every battle sequence, every turn of the corner, something new blew my mind.  I share the other reviewer's comment of having a smile glued to my face the whole time. AND I HAD NEVER READ THE BOOK!!!  I don't know how many times I said to myself how cool this was or how cool that was and how awesome the scenes were.  All those memories of seeing the Star Wars Trilogy came rushing back.Star Wars defined my generation.  I feel that the Lord of the Rings Trilogy will define this one.  All three movies were made at the same time, so we can expect - AT LEAST - the same quality of movie, if not better since we will see the conclusion of the quest.The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is two movies away from being the best epic since Star Wars.

I didn't want to sit through whatever Meg Ryan romantic comedy was playing and Mom vetoed anything potentially violent. So I suggested that we break the impasse by seeing The Omega Code, a film that none of us had seen advertised or knew anything about. I figured that as a result of being adventurous, we might be pleasantly surprised by an offbeat box office sleeper.What a mistake. I sat cringing throughout the entire film, with the shameful knowledge that my open-minded, random pick had backfired on us so miserably. I spent literally hours after we left the theater apologizing for leading us so far astray.Another reviewer commented that Omega Code's premise of a numerological interpretation of the Bible is similar to that of Darren Aronofsky's Pi. While I felt that Pi was ultimately unsuccessful in its treatment and plot, it is at least a watchable investigation of the idea. Even my mother, who has purchased and read novels of the `Biblical fiction' genre, was unenthusiastic about this lackluster interpretation of the apocalypse.I remember the film Dogma, which covers similar Biblical subject matter was also playing at the same time. I wish we'd stumbled into that one instead. I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Smith's films, but I've since rented Dogma and it at least presents a coherent, if convoluted plot and some interesting characters in its comically warped take on Armageddon.There have already been over a hundred commentaries for this movie, but the reason I felt compelled to write this one is that I stumbled across the entry and found that the title of the first contributor's summary is a very positive  `Accurate Biblical Drama.'

Now, I heard so much about this film in all such Holiness and seeing it myself, I am confused by my direction of anger. Should I feel contempt as a Sex Pistols fan; a punk fan; or as someone who can spot an aimless, often derailing take on a crap of a love story? This film really has no objective. It fiddles with the truth, setting itself up as some sort of a reenactment of events on the Sex Pistols based solely around Sid Vicious. I assume this because they felt the need to go out of the way to insert the Bill Grundy incident, which happened before Sid joined the band, as well as a post-Pistols John talking about Public Image Limited depicted in an interview that happened a year after Sid's death. This film also misspells the spirit of Sid Vicious, making him look to be more worthless then he really was. The film never spits out what a great bloke he was, or at least before he joined the Sex Pistols. He never seems to be viewed with any sort of talent (with the exception of his cover of My Way), charisma or much in the way of intelligence and it's a bit heartbreaking to see it as if John and Sid had no chemistry together, ignoring all hints that they were the best of mates. Sid also had a great since of humour as people like Sue Catwoman or many others who knew him could tell you right, something left out all together. I also felt no sadness for Sid in this film, as I know he was a tragic character in reality. As for Nancy, she is eyed as if she was all right unless she was drugged up &#150; something that many testimonies from people who met her can negate. It also leaves out that she chased around a lot of different bands like the New York Dolls or that she gave a hard time to Jerry Nolan of the Heartbreakers. Nor is there even a scratching of the surface on how much everyone hated her the bird. A bit is dropped on John's position on her, but Steve and Paul also hated her as well as a lot of other people in the punk community. Then there is how the movie takes it upon itself to say that Sid did in fact kill Nancy, despite some popular theories that it was just some one whom Nancy owed money, thus making it out all for the grandeur of something all Romeo and Juliet-like which is why if it were for the benefit of a love story, then it fails at that too. It glamourizes so many wrong things. Also, I really never felt that the two were really in love in this movie. She was more horrible in real life and yet I have more sympathy for the real relationship then that of the characters. And might I add on how bad the acting is. It didn't seem like it was acting really, but rather bad impersonations. The characters who are real-life people are so one-dimensional that they come off as cartoons. Seeing a John Lydon would-be clone made me laugh and then I was saddened by the fact that they made John look to be devoid of any intellect. And whoever was portraying Siouxsie Sioux in the Bill Grundy clip should be smacked. Speaking of smacked, why is it that about every punk in this film seemed to be in a mix between drunken stoopurs and whacked out on drugs? Again, just about every character is depicted as dumb and hollow, real or otherwise. Only the characterization of Malcolm McLaren is dead-on as he personifies creepy, possibly even more so then the real McLaren (if that's even possible). Not to mention on how there was never such person as Rock Head. But kudos for the inclusion of a character of what I assume was based on the real-life dominatrix by the name of Lynda (spelled Linda in this film) Ashby who really was part of the U.K. punk scene in what was known as the Bromley Contingent which at one time included Sid himself. In conclusion, do yourself a favour and see The Filth and the Fury (a film I had seen about a week before) to get the real truth on everything and everybody as well as more compassionate storytelling. The only highpoint of this film was the closing credits, mostly because it was the only good music in the film... all those Sex Pistols songs tainted.

It surpasses other action classics such as Mad Max, Terminator, and Blade Runner with flying colors.  Yet the film could have been better.  For one, the plot isn't that great.  Yes, for the average redneck moron from Alabama who drives or wants a truck, loves football, and never reads books, this is a deep, mind-blowing, philosophical journey into the mind.  But for anyone in the higher social classes this plot is not original.  Many say this is the first time they have heard of any idea so original...what we see is false, and there is another underlying world.  For me, the plot seemed simply like a modern, popular culture-injected remake of Plato's The Allegory of the Cave.  Now that is genius.  That is original.  Guns. Lots of guns (A quote by Keanu Reeves from The Matrix) is not original, it's moronic and ignorant.  Again, this is a perfect example of how this film was aimed at morons and teenagers.  Its only goal was box office profit.  The film was loaded with trench coats, bullets, guns, and a hideous script (at times the dialogue was so bad I felt embarrassed watching it), but used all these elements to no purpose...the film had no significance.  Where The Matrix failed and a film like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon triumphed was the only thing a movie like The Matrix has going for it--action.  In Crouching Tiger, the fighting is beautiful, wonderfully choreographed, and visually peaceful.  The fighting in the matrix is yes, visually stunning, but only because of special effects.  Yes, Crouching Tiger used computers, but succeeded in doing so.  It used computers to better the film, to make the fighting look like moving art, not to simply support violence and the NRA simultaneously.  I think that the acting in The Matrix was as good as possible based on the script, but that isn't saying much.  The film is incredible entertainment, but seemed hollow--when it was finished I didn't feel enlightened or like my life had changed, I only felt like I had made good use of $10 and a few hours at the movies.  Like I said, I believe that the Matrix was an incredible action film and fabulous entertainment, but that's about it.

Is the Star Wars Saga, then, the ultimate fairy tale adventure of the post-nuclear age? Some have said yes, others no. In the end, as always, the real answer is up to us. By digging deeper into the various legends spawned by the adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, we can perhaps see something greater within ourselves.    I once called the Star Wars Saga our generation's version of The Lord of the Rings. Luke Skywalker may have set out to save the galaxy, I remember saying at the time, but now that the galaxy has indeed been saved, for whom and from whom has it been truly been rescued, and at what cost? Even now, so many years later, I am struggling to answer those same questions. That a mere motion picture lies buried under the surface is no longer an issue. If it were, we would not have websites like starwars.com and theforce.net. Then again, the Force was probably within us all from the very first. What do YOU think?

The film has some of the most beautiful sets out of any movie I have seen in recent times. The battle sequences were simply astounding. Director Peter Jackson did a fine job of putting this film together. Although, to me, the film doesn't have as many good qualities as other people say it does. A lot of the effects were outstanding, but some of them were a little too cartoony. Also, I really wasn't impressed with the cinematography and I didn't think it deserved an Oscar nomination for that category. Another problem was the editing, I felt that the film was too long, and at times, extremely boring, but there are plenty of entertaining sequences and the acting was top-notch, especially by Ian McKellen as Gandalf. Christopher Lee also does a great job as the villain Saruman. Overall, the film was a masterpiece.

No, they are a few moments here and there (only about 5 of which last for more than a minute) spread out throughout the entire film.  The remaining 2 hours and 10 minutes are waste, where we get snippets of several characters who are slightly interacting together, developing aborted plots and character semi-portraits.  About a third of these characters are speaking in soft voices with thick common accents and low vocalization, making their snippets of dialogue even more pointless to the untrained ear.  They might as well have included static to replace those moments, because there's nothing interesting to look at either (regardless of the costume and set design Oscar nominations, which are merely for the ability to recreate the look of an English mansion falling into decadence in the 1930s, not because any of it is eye candy; filler nominations, if you ask me).Despite the crowding of characters and Altman's alleged legendary abilities to weave many stories and characters together and explore them fully, there's only about 6 to 8 characters that we really get to know about (and for half of those, most of their information is revealed in the last-minute exposition at the conclusion of the film).  And unfortunately, only three characters are regularly entertaining a rich socialite grouch (played by Maggie Smith), a nobleman who dreams of being an entertainer yet is met with flops, and a police inspector's smarter assistant.  Unfortunately, the latter two are left to a side.  Thus, it's up to Maggie Smith and her character (Constance) to carry the movie for us.  After a while, you share her grouchiness towards the fellow socialites.  Smith's nomination is deserved, although it is odd that she's in the supporting actress category, when her name is top billed in the credits, not to mention the movie opens and closes with her.  I guess the lead actress is considered to be Emily Watson, who plays Constance's servant, Elsie, a character who serves as a vehicle to connect the other many characters, although Elsie's emotional gamut is limited, and some of her decisions are inexplicable.  Helen Mirren is also top billed, although she's in the background during the entire picture, except for the last 10 minutes, when at last she gets a chance to show off her marvelous acting talents and tells us something about her character.Supposedly, Gosford Park is a murder mystery spoof.  Actually, that plot line does not develop until 1 hour and 20 minutes into the film.  In other words, there's practically an entire standard movie before the advertised plot develops.  The rest is a look at the different interaction between social groups in old Britain.  If you've seen ANY other movie about the British elite and their servants, then you've seen and know everything this movie has to offer on that topic.  And it isn't an entertaining take on the division (don't expect any humorous Tom Jones-like direction here).  The screenplay offers some amusing lines here and there, but most of it is bickering, or random lines spouted by obnoxious characters, like Bob Balaban's gay filmmaker of Charlie Chan flicks - geez, can't Altman make a movie without lamely attacking Hollywood's elite?  The Player is 10 years old, and wasn't that great to start with.  To round out Gosford's problems, Robert Altman directs this in a limp, standard, hardly caring manner, with even some amateurish moments (e.g. overly dramatic music bursts out when a servant is informed that her hard work of the previous night was meaningless).  He does have the occasional interesting shot, but those are quite few.  His Oscar nomination just shows the influence of Hollywood politics on these awards (let's give him an Oscar before he kicks the bucket - Altman is 77 years old and Oscarless to this date).  Heck, the only deserving nominations are for the actresses.  It's troublesome that the wittiest writing of the movie is featured in the its poster, yet it has a best original screenplay nod.The best thing I can say is hey, at least it isn't H.E.A.L.T.H.!
