ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is one of the most thought-provoking, visually stunning films to come along in a really long time, perhaps even since Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of my favorite films -- this one often reminded me of it). This is very high praise, I know, but the film is a remarkable achievement in imaginative filmmaking. I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly incredible special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the  movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels above the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.

I haven't seen this many incredible visuals since STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE, but the amazing thing is that the film is also consistently involving, absorbing, powerful, and fascinating. Spielberg's film, in its own unusual and unique manner, definitely lives up to the expectations -- and it exceeded mine.What made me skeptical in those expectations was that the man who made E.T. was going to take over a project from the man who made A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I was afraid that Spielberg would turn Kubrick's icy intellect and brilliant cinematic technique into something shallow and tear-jerking. The surprise is that Spielberg puts his own personality only into the final 20 minutes which represent the film's third act. The rest really looks and feels like something Kubrick could have made with a 90 million dollar budget. The film has some truly incredible special effects. Sequences showing cities of the future, all kinds of robots, cities we know like Manhattan half-submerged in water will have your jaw dropped in amazement and wondering how they got it all on screen. It has the most astonishing effects ever seen even in a Spielberg film, and that's not saying little. But not only did he direct this film, he also was responsible for the carefully written screenplay. It's his first writing credit since 1982's POLTERGEIST, and he has written only one of his movies, which is 1977's CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.In the film's first act we see the life of a robotic, or 'mecha', child called David, played very well by Haley Joel Osment. He is adopted by a mother (Frances O'Connor) and father (Sam Robards) whose child's survival is very uncertain, and he's cryogenically frozen. Initially David seems to be having a good time with these people. He has some weird attitudes, to be sure, but most of the time he seems to be acting like a real kid. Osment's performance is intelligent in the way that he doesn't give his character a typically robotic voice or attitude, but acts and reacts sort of mechanically to his surroundings. It's a unique and intelligent performance that blends the attitude of a real boy and a cold machine. I'm not sure if the Academy will see the goodness of this performance. Perhaps the scene where he shines brightest is the one where his mother, played by Frances O'Connor, leaves him in a forest to fend for his own; once he realises it, his immediate reaction is played to perfection by Osment. He bursts out in tears, and yet the little genius still manages to give hints that his character's emotions are not real, not human anyway.After this heart-wrenching scene the  movie radically changes tone. The film's first 40 minutes or so are rather slow, shot with a blanket of haze by Oscar-winner Janusz Kaminski (who has photographed every Spielberg film since SCHINDLER'S LIST), played subtly and delicately, but after that the look and pace of the film become crisper as it assaults our senses with some big, confusing, fast action sequences as David is captured by a weird character, played briefly by Brendan Gleeson, who travels above the land in a balloon in the form of a huge moon in search of lost mechas so he can take them to his 'Flesh Fair', an ugly festival where all sorts of robots are tortured and killed as entertainment. David manages to win the audience's sympathy and escape certain death (or is it just destruction?). He makes a valuable friend at the Fairs, a 'love mecha' named Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, with whom he will leave the Fairs and set out for Rouge City, a sleazy, glitzy, light-filled place with every kind of woman you could wish for, as Joe puts it. David wishes to find the Blue Fairy, since he's been listening carefully to the Pinocchio tale his mother told him and thinks that if he'll find the blue fairy she'll turn him into a real boy. Once they're in Rouge City they go and see a sort of digital Albert Einstein, a computer that answers every of your questions with an animated character called dr. Know, voiced by Robin Williams. This sequence is technically mervelous, but largely wears out its welcome. He's amusing to watch for a while but gets tiresome after a while, although he is important to the plot's development because he leads the two to Manhattan, which as I've said is shown almost completely submerged by water, and deserted, in this film. The effects in this sequence are incredible and scary in a way as well; to give you an idea, we only barely see the head of the Statue of Liberty and it all looks completely credible. I will not spoil the movie more for you by revealing what happens once David and Joe arrive there. Suffice it to say, the movie gets consistently weirder and more intriguing as it goes along after that point. In that way in reminded of 2001, as it takes the main character's journey to a climax in a place he doesn't know, but is shaped into something familiar to him (like Dave Bowman in the weird hotel room) by unknowns to make him comfortable.Many critics around me were disappointed by that ending, and although I must admit that I found the final 5 minutes a bit forced and sentimental, I was still enchanted, all the time wondering what would happen next. For those reading who have seen the film, you must agree with me it's the only way this film could've ended. It also raises arguments for discussion; for example, how can we be sure that a robot can't have real feelings? When a mechanical 'being' has such a burning desire for anything, in this case to find his 'mother', can we just coldly say that it can't be genuine emotion? What makes us more real than robots? We are also made out of organs, atoms, molecules, biological cells. We also react more or less logically to our surroundings, don't we? So do robots.In this unusually long review for me, I still have just scratched the surface of this film's richness, depth, and power. Its flaws and partly unsatisfactory conclusion keep me from giving it my highest rating. It is definitely a 'flawed masterpiece' if there ever was one. After I came out of the theater I was thinking so many different things, not being sure if I had seen a great film, thinking about the parts I loved, about the flaws, about those last 20 minutes... imperfect as I felt it was, I couldn't put it out of my head. That's definitely a higher compliment than you can give to most other movies. I think I could go on for a lot longer, but I will stop right now and tell you that if you like Kubrick movies, if you like to think about movies, this film won't disappoint you.

But that still doesn't guarantee I will eventually find humor in these goofy gags.I don't like to stereotype British comedy, because there are in fact some that I find quite funny.  And their humor is not always bland as a certain number of (American) viewers say it is.  I've seen episodes of Mr. Bean with Rowan Atkinson, and think it is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  I also like Atkinson's other show The Thin Blue Line and Keeping Up Appearances (I forgot the name of the actress who stars on the show). But the humor in this movie is as bland as bland can get.  Why build a series of elaborate set pieces when all you're going to have are a bunch of characters doing lame VERBAL gags?

What we have are comedic angles of the tales of such warriors as King Arthur and Robin Hood, and not one satirical jab came to mind?  I'm still a firm believer that there should be a certain element of truth to every joke.  Some good examples are in Mel Brooks' Robin Hood Men in Tights when Cary Elwes (playing Robin Hood) says, I'm the only Robin Hood who can speak with an English accent and when the Chief of Nottingham is portrayed as the Chief of Rottingham.And who came up with the decision to show lots of blood?  I know the violence looks fake, but come on!  This is a comedy!  Again, rubbing salt on a wound.I thought the film was lame from the get-go, from the minute they started that running gag involving King Arthur pretending to ride up to the castle on a horse by having his peasant bang coconut shells together to make it sound like a horse trotting.

Braveheart would feel shorter in comparison (because that happens to be a great movie).For those who are fans of the Monty Python series, you might want to argue my opinions.

This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral 'moral tale', it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues.

HOW I wonder would they have made it, given the opportunity? I am saved from further contemplation along these lines by the fact that Peter Weir made it.....and rather well, I hasten to add.A worthy successor to PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK in as much as the viewer is left with his or her own interpretation of what they have just seen. Events occuring in an everyday environment but where the line between fantasy and reality is so blurred, no lens can be found to bring up a sharp focus. It is a disturbing film which highlights and pays homage to the Aboriginal dreamtime.Chamberlain, in one of his best roles (made even better when you reminisce about the celluloid embarrassments BELLS, KING SOLOMON'S MINES and NIGHT OF THE HUNTER) plays a hot-shot Australian attorney (complete with DR KILDARE accent) who is called upon to defend a small group of Tribal Aborigines on what appears to be an open and shut case murder charge. Initially he finds his clients anything but co-operative and seemingly disinterested by the threat of the white man's legal system. Aspects of the case begin to disturb him and he is drawn into a world of ancient beliefs, symbolic half-lives, a very dimension that causes him to question his own comfortable existence and purpose. Central to his dreams is one of the Defendants (brilliantly played by Australian actor David Gulpilil) who appears existentially, perhaps a disembodied spirit (?), holding out to him a sacred stone with ancient cabalistic markings. He learns that the aboriginal man who was killed was the victim of tribal law and that he must not, cannot, intervene.The nightmare spills over into real-time...black rain, (we have already witnessed hailstones crashing into a tiny outback school from cloudless skies!) water prophetically leaking through his roof and cascading down the stairs. Visions of a great flood. He becomes obssessed with seeking the truth, not only of what is going on around him, but who he is? The scene where he confronts the Head Tribal Elder in his inner city squat is totally chilling. The viewer's own close and comfortable existence is challenged and put up for re-evaluation here.Eventually and too late of course, he stumbles across the truth. But IS it?

I'm nineteen, I've been drunk dozens of times, had a few girlfriends, seen something of the big bad world and have decided to check out a live cinema screening of this film. What a mistake. There I sat, gamely dressed like Eddie, surrounded by the most pathetic and disturbed people I have ever met. Sweaty, middle-aged businessmen and their giggling, peroxide secretaries dressed up like the Transylvanian party guests, geeky students revelling in the naughtiness of dressing in well-holed stockings and thick layers of black make-up, boring nerds doing Riff and Magenta's hands-together salute thing and quoting the dialogue ad nauseum, rice flying everywhere, water pistols being sprayed this way and that, toast crumbs down my neck, drunken morons screaming SLUT!!! and A**HOLE! every time Brad or Janet were on-screen...the whole experience was loudly, defiantly screaming This is FUN!, but nothing could prevent it from feeling extremely forced and desperate. Worse yet, a friend of mine was working at the venue, and he loudly complained to me about the drudgery of cleaning up rice, toast, soaked newspapers and God knows what else off the seats and carpets that awaited him once the transvestite speed freaks had gone home to their snooty semis or halls of residence.

Freund was a cinematographer whose few forays into directing were not sufficiently successful for a career, so he returned to photography. The Mummy is far and above his best known movie, though his later Mad Love has its partisans and is, like this film, a tale of obsessive love. It has no equivalents in film history; and for all the sequels and remakes it remains sui generis.More than most horrors, this film is a mood piece, and a sophisticated one at that in that Freund seemed determined to get the 'shocking' stuff out of the way early so as to concentrate on mood. The plot, for the most part, is a reworking of Dracula, but in this case the 'undead' party has his eye on one woman, not many. Prince I'm-Ho-Tep was raised from the dead by the impetuous and ill-timed mutterings of a young archaeologist from the Scroll Of Thoth, a sacred document of ancient Egypt. The mummy's object of desire is a young Anglo-Egyptian woman he believes to be the reincarnation of his beloved, for whose love he was mummified alive more than three millenia earlier. I'm-Ho-Tep, disguised as a wizened modern Egyptian, Ardeth Bey, lures the woman to the Cairo Museum, where he plans to kill her in order to have her join him in his eternal death-life. If one can accept this unlikely premise The Mummy is a good, eerie and creatively made piece of work. It is profound primarily at the unconscious level; in its abrupt camera movement, languorous pacing, somber mood and air of foreboding. The Mummy is not perhaps the most fun horror picture to watch. It lacks the throwaway camp of the Frankenstein movies; and its mood of remoteness and the single-minded obsession of its monster it is well beyond the Middle European charm and occasional warmth (in the village scenes) of Dracula and his various vampire successors. There is no safe place in The Mummy. As I'm-Ho-Tep comes from a vastly different time, and really has only one thing on his mind, his menace has about it the urgency of a stalker. Unlike the Frankenstein creature, Dracula and the Wolf Man (when a wolf), I'm-Ho-Tep has a genuine personality aside from the mayhem he creates, and in a way seeks our sympathy. He gives his beloved a lengthy autobiography in a pool, which we have no reason to doubt; and he clearly wants her not only give herself to him but to understand him, to appreciate the suffering he has gone through on account of his love for her. And he makes a good case.This would be a quite good movie with a mediocre mummy, but with Boris Karloff in the part it approaches greatness. Karloff had an empathy for monsters and monstrous-seeming creatures, and his performance here is one of his best. He captures perfectly the ancient dignity of this lost prince, who has beneath his dusty surface a scholarly, at times didactic side. One doesn't sense cruelty in the character so much as determination; and though he prays to ancient gods one sees him always as a cast-off human with very real needs, adrift in time. Is this a horror movie or a character study, you ask? Well, I see no reason why a film can't be both. In making I'm-Ho-Tep seem so human the film draws us into his mind and character, making him as much a figure of pathos as terror.

When I finally stumbled into the night after watching it, I wished it had been pornography I had been watching, not the absolute insult to celluloid manufacturers everywhere that is Human Nature. To say I was disappointed is the biggest understatement since the pilot of the Hindenberg told reporters he'd never quite got the hang of landing. The film stars Tim Robbins, Patricia Arquette, Rhys Ifans, and Miranda Otto and I think I could have been forgiven for thinking that this cast alone gave the film more potential than Cannonball Run II and I was actually looking forward to seeing it. Tim Robbins can act the pants of most other actors around; Patricia Arquette is an adequate actress and can be convincing when she needs to be; Miranda Otto is riding the new wave of Antipodean talent in Hollywood; and although Rhys Ifans will be in any film, anywhere, any time for the price of a biscuit and a cup of tea, he is a talented comic performer. So what went wrong? Well, the easier question to answer would be what went right? The answer is nothing went right - the film is a complete mess of unexplored themes and unfinished thoughts giving it what feels to the viewer like an identity crisis. Just what is this film trying to be? It tells the story of several people with challenges (not least the director Michel Gondry who had the unenviable task of filming this dross, but I digress). Robbins plays a behavioural scientist (with a small penis and a confidence problem) named Nathan Bronfman, Arquette plays a writer with a hormone problem which makes her grow hair allover her body named Lila, and Ifans is a man brought up in the woods as an ape. Bronfman and Lila discover the apeboy while hiking, and decide to use him to further their experiments in behavioural science. They will turn this wild, untamed man into a pillar of modern society - a startlingly original concept (see California Man, Tarzan in New York, George of the Jungle,  and countless other movies). The story jumps around flashing forward and backward, even utilising a dead person as a narrator (has that EVER worked in a film?) as it tries to flesh out the story of human nature and how it is repressed or exploited by the modern world. At least that is what I think it is about - the film never decides what it wants to say, do or be. It tries for undergraduate gross out humour, as well as attempting deep moments of pathos, and also even chances some drama. Usually when a film tries to be several things at once, you get the impression if it had chosen one identity, it would have been better for it - the thing is, with this film, I don't think it would have succeeded on any of the levels it attempts to visit. Human Nature looks like it got halfway through production as a serious movie before someone seeing the rushes announced it wasn't working and that they were going to have to play it for laughs. The result is a film which has a scene of intended dramatic pathos where Arquette, in a hysterical fit of self loathing shaves herself of all of her hair, cutting herself bloody in the process, right next to a scene of Ifans humping the leg of a waitress in a trendy New York restaurant.Not dramatic, and not funny. The film stumbles along for 90 minutes and then falls over itself in rushing to an ending, mirroring the chaos in the aisles as the audience rushed for the exit. It is astounding to note that the writer (Charlie Kaufman) and producer (Spike Jonze) of this drivel are the men who gave the world Being John Malkovich. If the creators of something so original, so inventive, and so good can turn around and deliver this piece of shambolic nonsense next time around, what hope is there for human nature? To err is human, to force this rubbish upon your fellow humans is unforgivable.
