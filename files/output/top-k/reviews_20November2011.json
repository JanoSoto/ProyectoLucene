[{"date":"20 November 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Saw this film when it was first released and thought above all else what a fine future the lead actor, Rob Brown should have, in a perfect world. Upon seeing it again, my opinion has not changed about the film but only in disappointed that Rob Brown is not a bigger star. In this, his film debut, he stars opposite Sean Connery as a kid from the South Bronx with a lot of talent and quite a bit of sense. He can play basketball, he can write, he's a charmer. He has a lot going for him. On a dare, he enters the apartment of a reclusive writer, (William Forrester, played with feistiness and vulnerability by Connery in surely one of his best roles in some time) and so begins a contentious relationship but one founded on respect.Rob Brown is just fantastic as a hoops-loving high-schooler named Jamal Wallace who lives with a loving mother (well played by April Grace) and a caring brother named Terrell (Busta Rhymes) who makes a living as a parking lot attendant at Yankee Stadium. F. Murray Abraham is also great as the oleaginous teacher who won't admit that he's racist although it's pretty clear he is.The script is great. It gives Rob Brown the ability to be a kid-talking trash with his friends and talking to girls and yet it doesn't emasculate him, subject to the goodwill and intervention of the Benevolent White Man as happened in The Help. It also doesn't emulate a movie like Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile in which a black character is seen as a magical talisman whose mysterious wisdom makes Everything Right In The End.In this movie, while Jamal is helped, Forrester is helped more. Indeed, the film is calling Finding Forrester rather than Finding Wallace which would seem to indicate that the writer and director considered Forrester more in need of help than Wallace. This seems plausible given Wallace's athletic and academic gifts. Forrester's prickliness is finally dissolved when he realizes Jamal's desire for his help is genuine and when puts a scholarship to a prominent prep school on the line in order to keep a promise he had made to Forrester.The script by Mike Rich can't be credited enough for giving Jamal agency and power over his life but at the same time allowing him to learn from Forrester. That said, the fact that Jamal helps Forrester more than the other way around nearly makes this the exception to the rule of movies featuring black and white characters. It is nice though to see two characters helping each other gain from what the other can offer. It's nice to see a film that realizes that the surplus of help does not need to be massive and that there can be a fair exchange of support among two able, imperfect characters.Gus Van Sant continues to prove himself a versatile director, reaching large audiences without making terrible movies. Van Sant makes interesting movies and tries not to pander audiences and this is a fine example of filmmaking in which you don't feel stupider when you're finished watching. Truly a film that many could watch and enjoy.

It's the story of Toula Portakalos (Nia Vardalos) who is 30 and for whom her father Gus (Michael Constantine) has all but given up hope of marrying. One day while working at her father's Greek restaurant, she is waiting on handsome Ian Miller (John Corbett) and is so transfixed she makes a fool of herself and botches his order. She does not indicate her interest at the time because she is so embarrassed, but later on, fortuitously for her, he sees her working again. She's now working as a travel agent in an effort to be assertive and take control of her life and both fall in love almost immediately. This does lead to some clashes between Toula and Gus however because Ian is not Greek.The film hilariously depicts reservations of an older generation about their offspring marrying someone from another background. I've heard from several friends who married folks from different backgrounds that this movie reflected their experiences. I saw this movie when it came out and it was very funny then. It has aged well.Vardalos is a gifted and empathetic writer. She not only sees the funny side of things, but also captures the humor in the pain of an intelligent woman who is unmarried and working as a waitress. In writing for herself, Vardalos is not afraid to look silly which makes this film funnier and shows her fearlessness. She narrates the film and it is done in a deadpan, I'm-so-over-this tone which is wise in that it does not undercut the hilarity which naturally comes from the film.She really deserves a lot of the credit for this. It is a shame she hasn't enjoyed more success since because of her clearly agile comic mind. The dry WASPiness of her in-laws in the film (Fiona Reid and Bruce May) contrast wonderfully with the extroversion and earthiness of her family. Her aunt Voula is played fantastically by SCTV's Andrea Martin and her mother, masterfully manipulating her father and encouraging her daughter is played by Lainie Kazan. Her father Gus is played by Michael Constantine. Gus is a wonderfully stereotypical Greek father &#x96; loving but very old-fashioned and sexist, all bark and no bite. Joey Fatone distinguishes himself as one of Toula's mischievous cousins, and her macho brother Nick (Louis Mandylor) is encouraged by his sister's rebellion to plot his own non-traditional path. John Corbett is very good as an understanding, open-minded, passionate man who loves Toula regardless of the eccentricities of her family.Ultimately, this is a wonderfully life-affirming and family-centric film. It will make you laugh at Gus' traditionalism and at the misunderstandings which happen between families of different backgrounds. It is a wonderfully written and acted film. Opa!

You know, fast-paced shots that rarely last over 30 seconds each. I actually enjoyed The Graduate though, the film shows how a young man's fantasy of being with an older woman can be easily ruined if you fall in love with her daughter. I showed this film to my buddies and we could all agree that if we could go back in time, seeing this movie when it was released at the age we are now, it would have been an enjoyable movie to watch. The movie appealed to my friends and I because this is something that every teenage boy thinks about in some point of his adolescence; as in FINALLY graduating from school and doing absolutely nothing except for have sex and laze around in your pool. Though the movie brings the good point that doing something wrong like this eventually comes back to bite you in the rear.The shot of when Mrs. Robinson is naked in Elaine's room with Ben the shot sequence is actually really fast switching between Ben and shots of her naked body. I didn't think this fast-paced style of shots would happen much in this movie. The scenes in the movie show the advancement in cinematography that was happening through the late 60's. Some things I did find weird about the movie was how awkward Ben was as a person. I was reading other posts and people were relating Hoffman's character to Napoleon Dynamite. I could see where they are coming from saying that, both characters are socially awkward with others. The other main thing I didn't get was the ending scene of the movie.

It took me 30 years to get around to it, my brain feels terebale already. 1 round, and only for making me laugh.

First off, to all you idiots that took the time to write these glowing reviews, this is the most intelligent and thoughtful review by the entire lot of you blind Peckinpah sheep....this movie is very good, i saw him many times. and i still enjoyed from him. this movie speak about the hard battle in Russia in world war two. thats thats reflact that the German fight to survive not for hittler or for the Nazis. this movie his very hard to see. you see the terebale of the war. Yes, you do see terebale, lots of terebale! haw haw haw One of the worst war movies ever made, from the kissing scene, to the acid flashback in the hospital, to the salad fight, to the German dude getting his private parts bitten off.....the absolute stupidest and one of the bottom worst of all WWII flicks.Peckinpah.... why do you people worship this guy so much? His films are horrible, and this one is no different with hundreds\/thousands of scene transitions this movie is totally unwatchable.

I haven't been able to watch this movie until now but I kind of knew what would happen because I saw this movie spoofed in 2003's Scary Movie 3. Needless to say, this is a very well-acted film and quite possibly M.Night Shymalan's best film after the Sixth Sense.This is about a former reverend and his family finding a unusual crop circle in the corn crops in their backyard. Now these crop circles are destined to bring the end of the world via alien invasion.As I mentioned before, the acting is superb. Mel Gibson turns in another quality performance, possibly his last. Joaquin Phoenix did a pretty good job as his brother.Overall, this is a solid film. I was creeped out for a good portion of it. And people should back down about the faith of this film. It's pretty insane. I rate this movie 8\/10.

One thing that you really have to give credit to is the acting, Davis gave an outstanding performance as the victim of a rape and Susan Sarondan was also very good as her best friend.The movie is basically about two very beautiful middle aged women who are the victims of an unfortunate accident and have to runaway as two former outlaws. I really liked this movie because it really centres in how a woman can be very underrated and not be taken serious and in this case raped. The movie really tells you how your life can change completely in just one minute.The end of the movie was very intense but when Thelma and Louise road off the cliff it really got my heart pounding, at that moment i knew that this movie is definitely going to be known as a cinematic classic and Davis and Sarondon's performances will be counted as one of the best.
