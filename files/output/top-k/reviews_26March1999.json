I've seen it about over a dozen times and can never get enough of it. Martin Scorsese is a master at telling Nicholas Pileggi's true-story novel about Henry Hill, a man who grew up in a Mafia family only to sell them out in the end.Secondly, the acting in this movie is equal to the story and direction, its superb! Robert DeNiro is excellent in a secondary role as the ruthless Irishman Jimmy, who's character I might add is up for parole in about 15 years. Ray Liotta is also very impressive as Henry, and I can't forget Joe Pesci who pretty much stole the spot as the insane\/psycho Tommy.Lastly, I just wanna speak a little on the film overall. It in no way tries to whitewash the mafia scene like the GODFATHER movies, rather it gives you a look inside, at its rawest. The scenes of violence in this movie will blow you away and they give the movie a strong sense of realism. By far Martin Scorsese's best film to date, combining great actors, a story that will definitely keep you watching > loved the voiceovers, and probably one of the best depiction of real-events I've ever seen on film.

The acting, particularly Macy, Maguire, Allen and Daniels deliver subtle sensitive performances that go way beyond the standard that The Academy would consider for nomination.The direction is superb also combining the breath-taking cinematography with a score that stays on the right side of sentiment. But the most remarkable thing about this film is the quality and standard of the script itself.At first thought the film's subtext seems straight-forward; that one should live life to the full in order that you can realise your potential. This is most obvious in the fact that Jennifer\/Mary-Sue stays in Pleasantville to go to college because she wouldn't make it in the real world. But this is not the only point. One has to accept that things change. Pleasantville exists in the eve of the 60's, and this was something that some of the characters could not accept. Racial intolenrance was another theme (demonstrated by the courthouse segregation a la To Kill A Mockingbird). The most fundamental such feeling is that of destroying what is not understood (the park bench through the malt shop window). The most shocking example is the Nazi-like burning of books which represent a different way of life, and also a change. The suggestion of rape, a theme in To Kill a Mockingbird, is also potent in the sight of teenaged girls with ripped clothes. Sex is another theme. The 60's would see a sexual revolution, shown by the antics in Lover's Lane, and the idea of Betty masturbating shows not only this but her breaking away from her husband, pre-empting feminism. Censorship is a running concept, with the afore-mentioned bonfires, blank books and disgust at the nude paintings evoking memories of McCarthyism, and making the Patton spoof that much more meaningful.In short, this film has the perfect setting for its many themes a town on the cusp of change plauged by the narrow-minded. But the town itself is a theme. The point is not just that it never existed, but that it cannot exist. The spirit of imagination, emotion and curiosity is something that can never be contained.I walked out of the cinema feeling elated. I valued what I had more. I even appreciated colour more. I found this film moving on a very profound level. The reference to The Shawshank Redemption was a master stroke however. Never has a film reference been more skillful, natural, and emotional than that single shot. But then what do I know. I liked The Avengers.

Since her fierce return to the big screen in 1992's Poison Ivy, Barrymore has given the audience more and more reasons to fall in love with her over the years. Last year's Ever After showed the world that she could carry a film on her own, Never Been Kissed proves that was no fluke.Barrymore portrays Josie Geller, a newspaper employee for the Chicago Sun-Times, who is given a reporting assignment to return undercover as a student in high school. The catch being that the last time the 25 year-old was in school, she was the class loser. With the help of her brother (David Arquette), Josie climbs from the lower ranks of the high school cliques to become the most popular girl in school. Trouble is, she has fallen in love with her English teacher, and he thinks she's only 17.Barrymore, who produced this movie, has wisely surrounded herself with a fantastic supporting cast. David Arquette brings his usual goofy self to the proceedings, but he is one of the few in this film who can make a joke work. I stood up and noticed Leelee Sobieski in last year's painfully underseen A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries. She is a actress who has remarkable inner strength for her age, and as the nerdy girl, she gives a wonderfully sturdy performance, never once letting her character become a joke. Molly Shannon and John C.

This is his second film, but yet the Columbus influence remains. Some of the best laughs in this film have an amazing sense of timing and great camera placement. Oddly, the material seems deflated due to the high self-conscious humor in much of the film. This new crop of teenage high school movies seems to forget that the actual educational experience wasn't as pat as EVERY film chooses to show. I was annoyed at how the teenagers are presented in this film. As bumbling, mean-spirited idiots, the kids are bland and one-dimensional.

I know that this is a movie, but what suburban Chicago high school is going to let a girl wear a belly shirt that practically cuts off at her nipples?There is charm in Never Been Kissed, but this is only because of Barrymore.

The kind, young, talented pauper falls in love with the rich, testy, unhappy girl who is betroethed to the evil industrialist. Joan Collins would be impressed...Basically, if you want loud noise, and don't mind a few tits, plus you can survive 2 hours of boredom interspersed, this movie is worth it. Otherwise, you haven't hit puberty yet, or you really need to watch some real movies, like Citizen Kane or On the Waterfront.

The same elecrifying thrill and fear you feel every time the shark approaches is mirrored by a terrifying monster in this film, one that also eats people - Dr Hannibal Lector. The popularity of this film was such that I knew the plot when  I was ten in 1991, although I only saw it about a month ago. I will usually never watch films that are disgusting, and I didn't really want to watch this. But rather than being a disgusting horror, it turned out to be a psychological thriller of the highest order. The movie is amazing. It presents a gritty, realistic world like that of a documentary, with no typical Hollywood cliches whatsoever. That way we don't know what to expect. The actors are actors first and stars second, and the two central performances are simply superb. Hopkins is so effective in his role, you could easily believe Hannibal Lector really exists. In fact he is so good, he won the Best Actor Oscar for a supporting role.Even better is Jodie Foster, who has surely proven herself now to be one of the best actresses ever. The most convincing performance I have ever seen. Director Demme skillfully uses angles to make her look small and isolated in a world of danger and fear. Better than Psycho. Better than Jaws. Undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
