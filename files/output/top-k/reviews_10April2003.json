I am talk about the Julia Roberts drama, &#145;Something to talk about'. I have seen many movies that look into the issues concerning relationships and infidelity, such as 2002's, &#145;unfaithful'. Yet this film looks at a different side of the problems that can hurt a relationship and also shows that one couples problems can be the &#145;talk' of the town. Grace Bichon has a picture perfect life. She helps manage her father's riding-stable and has a great husband and little daughter. That is until she discovers that her husband Eddie is deceiving her with another woman. After confronting him in the middle of the night on the streets of their small home town, she decides to stay at her sister Emma Rae's house for a while, to make up her mind. Breaking out of her everyday life, she starts to question the authority of everyone, especially her father's, thus causing a stir in her parent's marriage, too.  What a great story this film has. I love the way that the audience get the chance to experience what a place it is that poor Grace has to live. It also shows that being part of a relationship is not an easy thing. Another clever addition to the story is the use of gossip, which is perfectly incorporated and performed by the movie's actors. You really believe that this town's people want to know what is going on in the lives of the &#145;Bichon family' and that is ultimately why it was called &#145;Something to talk about'. This all being said, the film has many characters that I did not like, which is credit to the film's story, allowing me to actually like it. The screenwriter for &#145;Something to talk about', is Callie Khouri, who did a film last year, that I want to see, called &#145;Devine secrets of the Ya-Ya sisterhood'. Callie wrote a most enjoyable script from where I see it.There are flawless roles from all involved in the movie. This movie's main star is a gal I like, that being Julia Roberts. I remember reading that someone said Robert's needed to do this movie, to save her career from going down the wrong path. Well she shone in this most likeable of roles. I love the way that her character goes through so many emotions, especially the hot-headed temperament, but for good reason. I had to laugh when Grace is so abrupt, asking all her friends at a meeting, has anyone and everyone in the town been sleeping with her husband. The next line is priceless.The men in Grace's life are not so great. Husband Eddie (Dennis Quaid) is in a most uncomfortable of situations, which he put himself in. Eddie is upstaged by Grace's sister, Emma Rae (Kyra Sedgwick), who brings Eddie to his knees. Then add in the scene when Grace tries to get revenge on her husband. It is a movie that shows Eddie has done many things wrong. What Grace does might seem a little extreme, but I have no doubt that hurt people will go to such lengths to feel better about themselves and their situation. Grace's father, Wyly King (Robert Duvall) is a man who cares not so much for his family, but more about the disgrace one of his daughter's will bring to the family name, reputation and business. I was shocked when he blurts out &#145;All of our friends complain about how their kids grow up and run off and they never hear from them anymore. Why the hell can't that happen to us?'Director Lasse Hallstrom did a good job with this movie. He certainly seemed fascinated in making a movie which shows how dysfunctional a family really can be, and on more than one level in this film. There was also one name that came up as a bit of a surprise to me in the casting credits, that being Goldie Hawn. She was executive producer of the film, and in some way, you can feel the comedic touch she brought to the film. &#145;Something to talk about' hit home personally for me, as I have been part of a family break up, via one parent being unfaithful to the other. It is very hard for kids to understand what is going on when parent's relationships are disintegrating right in front of them. I have resigned to the fact my parents will never be back together again, but this film shows that not all relationships are a lost cause as I am sure they are not. Julia Robert's role in the film was so compelling from where I see it, as she was well within her rights to be as upset as she was. Her role justifies to me, why she is a star in Hollywood today. I guess the only downer for me in this film was the language, which I found just a little slack and disturbing. Roger Ebert said in his review of the film &#145;that &#145;Something to talk about' is the kind of film where you start out wondering how all these people are related, and end up knowing all to well'.

But as I went further and further into it, I felt myself not liking what I saw. For a movie to use the celebrated term of &#145;Lent', like they do in &#145;40 days and 40 nights', for me was just offensive, as Jesus Christ's sacrifice is much more important. Sure, sexually active people might find solace in what is being shown here, but I was not the least bit interested in one guy's plight to stay &#145;celibate', as I feel this is not a great challenge at all. Are you interested?   To get over his last serious girlfriend Nicole, Matt Sullivan turned to sex &#150; and lots of it. But Matt realised that he needed to go further - to go where no man has gone before. No sex. Whatsoever. For 40 days. That's tough at the best of times, but for Matt it seems impossible he's just met the woman of his dreams, Erika and bets are out that he won't make it. Will he hold on? Will she hold out? *SPOILERS* warning review contains elements of the plotWhere do I start with my disapprovals of this heinous movie? I want to come out and say that I am not a fan of Josh Hartnett. My feeling is that the guy cannot act to save himself. In this film, I squirmed for the majority of the time I saw him on the screen, as his character seems desperate to relieve sexual tension. I only wished half way through that he did! Unfortunately, this movie will leave an unforgettable impression of what sort of an actor Hartnett is, and this will influence the movies I watch with him in it.But Hartnett is not the only one I intend to bag from the movie, as this film has characters that I found to be &#145;empty' for one of a better word. His love interest is Erika (Shannon Sossamon), a girl who is as confused by the whole situation she is placed in, with good reason. I believe people should not jeopardise any relationship by such a challenge, as one partner is sure to end up hurt. I wished that a girl who is as attractive as Shannon is, had not touched this movie with a ten foot pole, as l believe it did not bring out her acting talents well at all. The other female role that was bad in this film was Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), as I found her to be a bimbo and a girl that I am sure I would steer clear of. I much preferred Vinessa in the '99 movie &#145;eyes wide shut', which again discussed sex, but in a much more professional way. Yet I found a lot of the people that Matt comes into contact to be infuriating from where I see it. His work colleagues, male and female and even his room-mate Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) frustrated me, as they are only interested in this guy's sex life (or the lack of). I have to ask, do these people have lives of their own? Not if you watch what this movie tries to portray. I mean to have a running bet over this most personal of ideals, for me was not appreciated, as people deserve privacy, and this guy does not get it, when he needs it the most.     So whose really at fault for making this movie the kind of experience that I wish to forget. Start with the director, Michael Lehmann, from &#145;Heathers' and the romantic comedy &#145;Truth about Cats and Dogs'. While those two movies were great, this one was not. Michael's direction was weird from where I viewed it. I did not like the obvious religious reference that were placed in the movie by Lehmann as I felt they were in poor taste and make the movie offensive for religious people, who are bound to view it. But Lehmann is not only to blame, as this movie's script also had big faults. Written by Rob Perez, the script holds a story that I find to be somewhat bitter, with his character creations nothing I would call brilliant. There are some really disturbing scenes to this film in my view. The scene that disturbed me the most includes a scene which shows Matt tied up to a bed. This is quite fine, that is until we see Matt being raped by a character of the movie, to stuff up this quest that he is on. I know that I am giving away a lot of the films plot, but I find male rape to be an important issue in the world that we live. The other scene I found appalling was between Matt's brother, John (Adam Trese), a priest, who is caught making out with a nun. In the real catholic world, this would never happen. I am certain the Catholic Church would be offended by such a scene. The conclusion to the movie was also horrible, as it paints the picture that having sex is ok, after you have gone a while with out. I do not believe this for a minute. Then to have the guys continuing to bet how long Matt will bonk for, again is in bad taste, and nothing that makes a movie fresh or exciting.I do not mind movies that look into the issues of sex, and the implications that it can have on a person or a relationship, but to show it in a way that can make a person uninterested, like I was, is just appalling. Instead, I would have preferred to see more of the love that &#145;40 Days and 40 Nights' tried to show when Matt was not so concerned about using his crotch. I might have then given this movie more of a chance and credit. As it stands, I am not so forgiving.

But as I went further and further into it, I felt myself not liking what I saw. For a movie to use the celebrated term of &#145;Lent', like they do in &#145;40 days and 40 nights', for me was just offensive, as Jesus Christ's sacrifice is much more important. Sure, sexually active people might find solace in what is being shown here, but I was not the least bit interested in one guy's plight to stay &#145;celibate', as I feel this is not a great challenge at all. Are you interested?   To get over his last serious girlfriend Nicole, Matt Sullivan turned to sex &#150; and lots of it. But Matt realised that he needed to go further - to go where no man has gone before. No sex. Whatsoever. For 40 days. That's tough at the best of times, but for Matt it seems impossible he's just met the woman of his dreams, Erika and bets are out that he won't make it. Will he hold on? Will she hold out? *SPOILERS* warning review contains elements of the plotWhere do I start with my disapprovals of this heinous movie? I want to come out and say that I am not a fan of Josh Hartnett. My feeling is that the guy cannot act to save himself. In this film, I squirmed for the majority of the time I saw him on the screen, as his character seems desperate to relieve sexual tension. I only wished half way through that he did! Unfortunately, this movie will leave an unforgettable impression of what sort of an actor Hartnett is, and this will influence the movies I watch with him in it.But Hartnett is not the only one I intend to bag from the movie, as this film has characters that I found to be &#145;empty' for one of a better word. His love interest is Erika (Shannon Sossamon), a girl who is as confused by the whole situation she is placed in, with good reason. I believe people should not jeopardise any relationship by such a challenge, as one partner is sure to end up hurt. I wished that a girl who is as attractive as Shannon is, had not touched this movie with a ten foot pole, as l believe it did not bring out her acting talents well at all. The other female role that was bad in this film was Nicole (Vinessa Shaw), as I found her to be a bimbo and a girl that I am sure I would steer clear of. I much preferred Vinessa in the '99 movie &#145;eyes wide shut', which again discussed sex, but in a much more professional way. Yet I found a lot of the people that Matt comes into contact to be infuriating from where I see it. His work colleagues, male and female and even his room-mate Ryan (Paulo Costanzo) frustrated me, as they are only interested in this guy's sex life (or the lack of). I have to ask, do these people have lives of their own? Not if you watch what this movie tries to portray. I mean to have a running bet over this most personal of ideals, for me was not appreciated, as people deserve privacy, and this guy does not get it, when he needs it the most.     So whose really at fault for making this movie the kind of experience that I wish to forget. Start with the director, Michael Lehmann, from &#145;Heathers' and the romantic comedy &#145;Truth about Cats and Dogs'. While those two movies were great, this one was not. Michael's direction was weird from where I viewed it. I did not like the obvious religious reference that were placed in the movie by Lehmann as I felt they were in poor taste and make the movie offensive for religious people, who are bound to view it. But Lehmann is not only to blame, as this movie's script also had big faults. Written by Rob Perez, the script holds a story that I find to be somewhat bitter, with his character creations nothing I would call brilliant. There are some really disturbing scenes to this film in my view. The scene that disturbed me the most includes a scene which shows Matt tied up to a bed. This is quite fine, that is until we see Matt being raped by a character of the movie, to stuff up this quest that he is on. I know that I am giving away a lot of the films plot, but I find male rape to be an important issue in the world that we live. The other scene I found appalling was between Matt's brother, John (Adam Trese), a priest, who is caught making out with a nun. In the real catholic world, this would never happen. I am certain the Catholic Church would be offended by such a scene. The conclusion to the movie was also horrible, as it paints the picture that having sex is ok, after you have gone a while with out. I do not believe this for a minute. Then to have the guys continuing to bet how long Matt will bonk for, again is in bad taste, and nothing that makes a movie fresh or exciting.I do not mind movies that look into the issues of sex, and the implications that it can have on a person or a relationship, but to show it in a way that can make a person uninterested, like I was, is just appalling.

The story that is shown is certainly different, and after you have seen it, you will say it is movie that is definitely different in almost every aspect. Of course, I am talking about the 2000 sci-fi thriller, 'eXistenZ', which shows that going into the world of 'virtual reality', can be weird and dangerous. 'eXistenZ' also proves that virtual reality' can be a world that one cannot be sure of being in or out of.During the first closed-door demonstration of an amazing new virtual reality game - called 'eXistenZ' - the system's brilliant designer, Allegra Geller, is violently attacked by a crazed assassin intent on killing her and destroying her creation. Forced to flee into hiding, Allegra enlists the help of young marketing trainee, Ted Pikul, to help her test the damaged system, by convincing him to join her inside a game of eXistenZ. The action then explodes as their world's real-life dangers begin to merge with the fantasy of the game.This film has a most unique and unusual story, but in a good way. I have read on the internet, that eXistenZ 'makes the Matrix look like child's play', and I would have to agree. What I will say about this film's story, is that it gives the impression that its audience will understand where it actually is, and that they will believe who someone is, is truly that person, and that they are on a level par. I guess that is what is most inventive about the film, to make what is seemingly so true, to be actually not true at all. The writer\/director of eXistenZ, David Cronenberg (from 'the Fly'), wrote a most inventive screenplay, that I am sure you will not see in along time.This movies lead actors are Allegra Gellar (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Ted Pikul (Jude Law). The pair share a most unique chemistry onscreen, as we see their game characters doing some very weird and wacky things as they keep going deeper and deeper into the game of 'eXistenZ' they are playing. I love the way that both Leigh and Law turn this movie into a very erotic kind of an experience to watch. Allegra says this is all part of the game and that the pair should not give into any of these so called 'bits'. I must mention that Jude Law suits this kind of movie genre. Law has also been a part of the Steven Spielberg movie 'AI', which was another unique movie that I did not mind.The supporting cast of this film was also good. I like how we get to meet the guy at the gas station who affectionately known as Gas (Willem Defoe). The role that he took on in this film suits him down to the ground. However, I thought that his role of the 'Green Goblin' in the 2002 blockbuster 'Spiderman' was ordinary to say the least. Other supporting cast members include Kiri Vinokur (Ian Holm), the strange man at the trout factory Yevgeny Nourish (Don McKellar) and the Chinese waiter (Oscar Hsu).I also like the way this movie looks. The 'virtual reality' world created for  'eXistenZ' looks so weird and wonderful, that part of me feels that I might be tempted to play the game. Then the creation of the funny creatures in the movie, the funny pods that are used to play the game and the surprise in the 'special' Chinese meal are interesting to see as we go further and further into the film. Then take the great parts of the film. I like how this movie starts, as it is one thing that needs to be looked at carefully, or you could misread what is happening for the entire movie. When the lead pair then start to play eXistenZ the movie becomes all the more interesting, as this is the part where you can start to realise that not everything is what it seems.But here is a clue for you out there that are a little confused by the whole reality vs. virtual-reality parts of the film. The film does point out very subtle clues as to what mode both Allegra and Ted are actually in. However, if you are one person who is clever enough to work out the movie's entire plot, then you are one lucky person, as even I am still thinking up questions that I want to know the answers to (such as was the entire movie just a game? What does the end of the film actually mean? Did those mean streaks that happened in the supposed 'game', turn out just to be glitches in the real life 'virtual reality' game? What should you make of the two lead characters after the end of the film?) I am sure I will think of more questions, but whether I find out there answers is another thing.The whole world of 'virtual reality', is becoming realer and closer in the world that we live in. We can enter into many different aspects of virtual reality at the drop of the hat, thanks to technologies such as computers (the internet) computer games and the movies that we watch. However whether the whole idea of 'virtual reality' is good, that I am unsure of. My opinion is if we enter into a world that is outside of our reality, than we could be giving something of ourselves that we don't actually know we are giving, and could turn us into people that we might not normally be. That being said, this movie makes me so curious about the world that I have just criticised.

Nothing is expected of them, nothing they do matters, to them or anybody else. So they figure, why not kill somebody? Maybe that will matter!' This is essentially what the movie is about, but it is the planning that the pair does in making the crime not so easy for the cops to work out, and the randomness in choosing their victim, that was the highlight for me, in addition to the weird relationship that this pair have. Michael Pitt was a part of the 2001 controversial movie, &#145;Bully'.  Murder by numbers' story was cleverly written by Tony Gayton. I enjoyed the elements of &#145;the boy's crime' that were a little bit different. I am sure that it would have been difficult to make the story seem correct, considering how confusing a plot it really had. Tony's characters were also well written. Then to make this movie would have also been a challenge. That was left up to director Barbet Schroeder who did a fine job. I like the flashback elements that she presented for the movie, in addition to the way that we get to really feel for the characters' of Cassie and Justin. The movie also starts well, which I feel is the good work of Schroeder. Sandra Bullock was also an executive producer of the film, which I believe helped enhance this movie all the more. But for a thriller to succeed, it also needs a &#145;thrilling soundtrack'. This film did have such a soundtrack, making many of the vital scenes have a much greater impact and all the more thrilling.  It was a shock to find out that two of this movie's stars, are actually somewhat of an item at the moment. They are Sandra Bullock, 38, and Ryan Gosling, 22. I am not sure whether these two really suit each other, but it is up to the individual who they do and don't date. From my resources, I found this funny quote, &#145;when Gosling was asked if he was smitten with Bullock, Gosling replied Don't say I'm sweet with her. Say I'm taken with her'. Interesting, very interesting. In times where school murders and other scenarios are going on (especially in the USA), I found the whole story to this film fascinating. So were the characters of Justin and Richard, who were, I have found out, loosely based on real-life murderers, Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold Jr., who planned their own &#145;perfect murder'.  So with all this in prospective, if you are looking randomly around your video store for a good video to watch, then I say you cannot go past &#145;Murder by numbers'.CMRS gives &#145;Murder by Numbers' 4.5 (Very Good &#150; Brilliant Film) ","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"10 April 2003","score":"18 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":"  The struggles in reporting the news are shown in such an interesting way in the 1996 movie, 'Up close and personal'. It also shows that a little bit of luck can help a person go a long way in an industry like that of TV journalism. This movie's story, which has a strong and very emotional romance within it, also has some surprising twists that I am sure people will not expect once they have watched it.Sally Atwater is fresh from a small-town trailer park when she arrives in Miami, overdressed and overeager to be the weather girl. He debut is disastrous but her boss, experienced newsman, Warren Justice, admires her spunk and takes her under his wing, making her an on air reporter. As Justice moulds Sally into one of the county's most sought after journalists, the pair fall in love, only to have their relationship threatened by the very success they have created.Here is one of the great romance movies I have seen in a longtime. I love the way that the main stars first meet and how their relationship develops. By the time that Tally is a great journalist, what is more important than her career, is the man that she loves that being Warren Justice. The screenplay for this movie was beautifully written by John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion. I love how the two main stars are able to fall in love, but at the same time, able to do what they do as a career. Sure it might take a little while for the movie to show that this is important, but I feel that the time needed to be taken, so that both Tally and Warren fall deeply in love.The director of 'Up close and personal' was Jon Avnet, who has been a part of some great movies such as that of 'Risky Business', 'When a man loves a woman', and the 'Mighty ducks' trilogy. In this movie, I love the way that Avnet shows Tally Atwater at the start, to be someone who is a struggler, ignored and made fun of. Then to make her character be so vital and important in the whole make-up of the film, was great. This I believe is the good work of Avnet and makes the movie all the more compelling. I also like the world that Avnet has created for the film, that of the pressurised, TV journalism environment.The stars of the movie are two of Hollywood's better known actors in Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer. The pair have a good chemistry in this movie, with the way that they fall in love very believable. I also like how Redford's character, Warren, refers to Tally at the start of the film, saying that 'she eats the camera'. This scene shows that Warren not only likes Tally as a journo, but as a woman as well. I also like the way that Pfeiffer appears in this film. She looks very much like a reporter does on the news and it is in her appearance that this needed to be so definite.The supporting cast of 'Up close and personal' is a pretty good one. I like Marcia McGrath (Stockard Channing), who is the tough as nails anchor girl, who is pushed out of her position by the rising career of Tally Atwater. She treats Tally pretty bad in the film, if the truth be known. I also like Joanna Kennelly (Kate Nelligan), who we find out is one of Warren's former wives. She is one of the reasons why Warren has had a turbulent journalism career. Do not discount the little role taken on by Tally's cameraman Ned Jackson (Glenn Plumber). He is an incredibly brave cameraman, who admires Tally for the work that she does. Trust me I would not have liked doing the camera work that he was doing in the prison.'Up close and personal' might not have the greatest of sound tracks, but it does have one song that I really like. That song is 'Because you loved me' sung by Celine Dion. It is a song which was used well in the film and its lyrics suit this movie beautifully. How great a song this was, made me want to watch the film all the more. By the way, there is one scene in the movie that shows Pfeiffer's character singing 'The impossible dream' at an empty football stadium in front of Warren. All I will say about this is that Pfeiffer should stick to the acting game, because she does not sing that well.This movie, is such 'a good drama love story', because it shows how tough the 'TV journalism' area can be, and does not shrug away from showing how difficult and dangerous such a career can be (the prison scene is wonderfully shot and one of the great parts of the film). I also like how this movie concludes, and I am not afraid to admit that it has gotten me upset both times I have watched it. You will notice, that I say that Sally Atwater's name is actually 'Tally'. I will not reveal how this change happens, just to say that I like it. I believe it was placed in the story for a bit of fun. But I am not so sure I would like my name changed for my chosen career.

The actual plot, if there is one, is about a man who grows up in a Mafia family, and must come to facts regarding his heritage and what he must do to carry the family legacy after his father dies. The whole thing is a setup for lots of Godfather gags, which see a young Mafia-Boss-to-be causing trouble in Italy and moving to America, where he sets up a family of organized crime.

For example, you watch a subtle comedy, and you really enjoy it. But you just didn't laugh very much while you were watching it. You watch Mafia! and it generates dozens of chuckles at least, but somehow it's still not as good as the subtle comedy you watched before which generated about five laughs. Why is this? The only reason I can think of is because in failed slapstick while there are many laughs, not many of them are as great as they could be. Slapstick (also) doesn't usually have great plots.

For example, you watch a subtle comedy, and you really enjoy it. But you just didn't laugh very much while you were watching it. You watch Mafia! and it generates dozens of chuckles at least, but somehow it's still not as good as the subtle comedy you watched before which generated about five laughs. Why is this? The only reason I can think of is because in failed slapstick while there are many laughs, not many of them are as great as they could be. Slapstick (also) doesn't usually have great plots. Subtle comedies usually build up deeper characters, emotions and plots, making them better. So really, slapstick and comedy are on two very different levels. I can laugh a hundred times more watching slapstick and still say I liked the regular five-laughs-an-hour comedy better. I just thought that was interesting to point out.In the end, I wasn't exactly disappointed in Mafia! but it could have been a lot better consider what it was spoofing. I mean, it set out to spoof one of the most fondly remembered film legacies in recent years, and it came back a bit crippled, if somewhat humorous. There's no excuse for why it didn't live out to its full potential It had a great director, a great cast, and like I said before It sets out to spoof one of the best film trilogies of all time and comes back a bit crippled, if humorous.It could've been better, but I still had a good time watching it.3\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"10 April 2003","score":"","review":"  Ordinary People is a very good movie.

Then there are some that have good premises but become tiresome after a while (Brewster's Millions, The Man with Two Brains, and Delirious to some extent). Big fits in the category Good Idea, Good Premise, Good Actors, Intelligent Script, and Boring After an Hour.Our story begins with a short teen named Josh, who dreams of girls, girls, sports, being older (so he can impress girls), and girls. So one day, at a carnival, after being shrugged off by (guess who?) a girl, a miserable and sad Josh makes a wish at a fortune telling machine, which slides out a card after your wish that says if it's been granted or not (if I remember correctly). So Josh goes home, mopes about, goes to sleep, and when he wakes up he is a thirty-something-year-old Tom Hanks (wonderful if in his part, even if he acts like a toddler more than a teenager). After his mother thinks Big Josh is a crazy loon, she chases him out of the house with a knife. (Later she thinks Josh has been kidnapped\/killed after he disappears from home.)So Josh, with the help of his friend, retreats into New York City, where he lives in a seedy apartment (great scene involving that), and, being a child, is scared witless. After a few days (or one day?) Josh, again with the help of his friend, gets a job at a toy company, only because the employer likes his goofiness so much. (Josh shows up in a cheap, disgusting suit and says he went to college at his Middle School.)Of course, being a child, Josh soon beats bad-man John Heard in toy ideas (he comes up with wacky inventions, because he is a kid and he knows what kids really like, and he unintentionally criticizes Heard's toys). He comes up with all kinds of ideas for toys not out of greed, but because he innocently wants to create good toys for kids.Tom Hanks plays his character well, if a bit too childish. Let's face it Thirteen-year-old boys are old enough to know that when women say they want to sleep over they don't mean they want to have a sleep over party. But aside from the fact that he doesn't act like a thirteen-year-old, Hanks hits the nail on the head and gives a tremendously innocent and sweet performance. It's just too bad that the main character had to be thirteen (or fourteen), because Hanks doesn't act thirteen (or fourteen). It's still a great performance, though.Nowadays this film would probably tag a PG-13 rating, because not only does a teenager (much less an adult) use the F-word (which was startling to hear in a Tom Hanks PG-rated movie), but there are also sexual situations involving teenagers. At one point Hanks sleeps with a business associate in her thirties (Elizabeth Perkins). Of course, this means that since Hanks' character is really a teenager, it means the teenager had sex with her--which implies some controversial subjects. In fact (spoiler ahead), when Josh (Hanks) tells the woman he is a teenager, she doesn't seem to show any surprise that she has slept with a thirteen-year-old, though it is implied they have slept together many, many times during the course of the film. (They even live together at one point.) She just seems to be surprised overall, not at anything (ahem) in particular.Sometimes Big seems like it was written by teenagers thinking of cool things they would do if they happened to become adults one day. I guess this works to the film's advantage in a way, because if it was written by real adults (who have forgotten childhood yearning), the film would end up with Josh doing too many adult things and not enough childish things.But right there I contradict myself, because I have found that at one point in the film when, in a matter of seconds, Josh puts behind his childhood and seems to grow up very suddenly--something I think was done a bit too quick--the film seems to lose its charm. If Josh is a child at heart, how could he suddenly, in a matter of minutes, gain the knowledge of a college-graduate in business economics, if he didn't even finish middle school? I think that bit is done to be symbolic--that all of us have seemed to lose our innocence at a certain age, out of expectations of doing so, or because of a ruthless world that beats down upon our childish souls--but it doesn't all fit together too well.The film is funny, but like many films with great premises, they outstay their welcome, ultimately ending in a funny, if not memorable film. I really expected a lot from Big because of the big deal everyone made about it, but I would say that after a while the gags become too worn out. There's only so many things you can have a teenager do in a grown man's body, and, unfortunately, Big, ranking in at about 90 minutes, only uses half of what it could have. It seems to search for gags in the latter half, but can't find them when they're right in front of them. Perhaps some of this is because Hanks acted too immature in his role (even though he gave a tremendous performance), or perhaps it is because the writers gave up on the film too quickly. Whatever the reason, Big doesn't fulfill all it could have, and ultimately ends up just funny, and nothing entirely memorable.3\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2003","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  Certain films spark imagination and warmth; they make you feel good.

(Josh shows up in a cheap, disgusting suit and says he went to college at his Middle School.)Of course, being a child, Josh soon beats bad-man John Heard in toy ideas (he comes up with wacky inventions, because he is a kid and he knows what kids really like, and he unintentionally criticizes Heard's toys). He comes up with all kinds of ideas for toys not out of greed, but because he innocently wants to create good toys for kids.Tom Hanks plays his character well, if a bit too childish. Let's face it Thirteen-year-old boys are old enough to know that when women say they want to sleep over they don't mean they want to have a sleep over party. But aside from the fact that he doesn't act like a thirteen-year-old, Hanks hits the nail on the head and gives a tremendously innocent and sweet performance. It's just too bad that the main character had to be thirteen (or fourteen), because Hanks doesn't act thirteen (or fourteen). It's still a great performance, though.Nowadays this film would probably tag a PG-13 rating, because not only does a teenager (much less an adult) use the F-word (which was startling to hear in a Tom Hanks PG-rated movie), but there are also sexual situations involving teenagers. At one point Hanks sleeps with a business associate in her thirties (Elizabeth Perkins). Of course, this means that since Hanks' character is really a teenager, it means the teenager had sex with her--which implies some controversial subjects. In fact (spoiler ahead), when Josh (Hanks) tells the woman he is a teenager, she doesn't seem to show any surprise that she has slept with a thirteen-year-old, though it is implied they have slept together many, many times during the course of the film. (They even live together at one point.) She just seems to be surprised overall, not at anything (ahem) in particular.Sometimes Big seems like it was written by teenagers thinking of cool things they would do if they happened to become adults one day. I guess this works to the film's advantage in a way, because if it was written by real adults (who have forgotten childhood yearning), the film would end up with Josh doing too many adult things and not enough childish things.But right there I contradict myself, because I have found that at one point in the film when, in a matter of seconds, Josh puts behind his childhood and seems to grow up very suddenly--something I think was done a bit too quick--the film seems to lose its charm. If Josh is a child at heart, how could he suddenly, in a matter of minutes, gain the knowledge of a college-graduate in business economics, if he didn't even finish middle school? I think that bit is done to be symbolic--that all of us have seemed to lose our innocence at a certain age, out of expectations of doing so, or because of a ruthless world that beats down upon our childish souls--but it doesn't all fit together too well.The film is funny, but like many films with great premises, they outstay their welcome, ultimately ending in a funny, if not memorable film. I really expected a lot from Big because of the big deal everyone made about it, but I would say that after a while the gags become too worn out. There's only so many things you can have a teenager do in a grown man's body, and, unfortunately, Big, ranking in at about 90 minutes, only uses half of what it could have. It seems to search for gags in the latter half, but can't find them when they're right in front of them. Perhaps some of this is because Hanks acted too immature in his role (even though he gave a tremendous performance), or perhaps it is because the writers gave up on the film too quickly. Whatever the reason, Big doesn't fulfill all it could have, and ultimately ends up just funny, and nothing entirely memorable.3\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family"},{"date":"10 April 2003","score":"8 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":"  Spoilers!After hearing so many good things about this movie, and also finding out that just about every review I could find on it gave it glowing remarks, I anticipated seeing the director's cut of this movie on DVD.I mean, what wasn't to like?

I find him to be an arrogant kind of character onscreen, with some of his movies just &#145;bad'. Yet I can understand why people like him, he is a star and does do some great films. Well I still say to people that my favourite Tom Cruise movie is the NASCAR racing hit, &#145;Days Of Thunder'. But public opinion is divided as to whether it is a great film or not. Here is what I think&#133;&#133;.Engines roar and fever pitch of professional racing is alive and well. Meet race car driver Cole Trickle, whose talent and ambition are surpassed only by his burning need to win.

However a fiery crash nearly ends Cole's career and he must turn to beautiful doctor, Claire Lewicki to regain his nerve and the true courage needed to race, to win and to live. When it comes to &#145;Days Of Thunder', I look at it as a film which can be viewed by either the head or the heart. My &#145;head' feels that &#145;DOT' is a clichéd and standard Hollywood movie that follows a standard and overused plot. The main star is always playing a hot-headed character that finds it hard to take direction. This movies success has to partly come from what a successful movie &#145;Top Gun' was. I have to also ask are movies that follow the same format good for cinema? My answer is yes and no. Yes, because they bring movie-goers and the bucks in, and can be thought of as a classic. Then the answer could be no, as these films are nothing new and do not make cinema experiences fresh and exciting. Yet what my heart says about &#145;DOT' gives quite a different spin on it all together. It is an exciting movie that not only shows the competitive side of racing, but what lengths a race driver will go to be behind the wheel. I also like the relationship that Cole (Cruise) has with his crew chief Harry (Robert Duvall). Then with all Jerry Bruckheimer films, if you have an enjoyable experience, then that will last with you for alongtime to come.So with all that in prospective, &#145;DOT' is a great film in my opinion. The racing sequences are well incorporated into a story about a racer that is pushed, and once he is, you will not like the reaction that you get. Tom Cruise's performance is pretty good. I like how we see him go from being one sort driver to the other. However my favourite character has to be Harry, as Robert Duvall is great in what he says and does. He gets Cole through many races with clever and intelligent moves, that many experienced crew chiefs would not even think of. Other roles that need to be highlighted include Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), who is the driver that brings the best out in Cole, with the pair's competitive streak and friendship just great for the film in my view. The role of Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman) has been praised and criticised by fans. I personally like what she brings to the film, as her character brings great sexual tension to the story and makes Cole realise that everything is not quite right for him in life. Of course it is common knowledge that &#145;DOT' was the film that sparked the 11 year relationship for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, which unfortunately fell apart in 2001.&#145;DOT' was directed by Ridley Scott's brother, Tony. Tony really brought out the important racing themes well for us all to see. I understand that some people might not have liked the direction Scott took us on, but all the themes are brought out in such a way that I simply enjoyed.

So I am sure the women that campaigned for freedom and liberty, would have loved the movie, 'Thelma and Louise'. The tradition of the American road trip is shown in such a refreshing way in this movie, with its two lead characters people who are fed up with life, and no longer take any crap from the men that they live with or that they meet. Thelma and Louise is a film that will make you feel warm, but also leave a some what 'bitter-sweet' taste in your mouth.Thelma and Louise are best friends on a desperate flight across the American Southwest after a tragic incident at a roadside bar. With determined detective Hal on their trail, a sweet-talking hitchhiker called 'J.D.' in their path and a string of crimes in their wake, their journey alternates between a hilarious, high-octane joy ride and an empowering personal odyssey... even as the law closes in.'Thelma and Louise' are exceptionally well written characters for the big-screen. Callie Khouri wrote a fascinating script, capturing the 'female power' beautifully. But it is in her characters that I like the most. While, I had feelings for both Thelma and Louise, I also wanted the pair to get caught, and part of me also loved what made the pair the individuals that they were. This is all from the great work of Khouri, who is an intelligent screenwriter. I have watched this film a couple of weeks after viewing another of Callie's movies, 'Something to talk about', another movie from the female point of view that both sexes can enjoy.Yet Callie's screenplay would have been a waste, if the actors did not play their part properly. The main stars here are Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon), who are some what fed up with the life that they are living, and plan a trip to get away from everything. Things soon start to get out of hand for the women, and when trouble causes them have shoot and kill somebody, the fun really starts. In fact from the time that this incident begins and concludes, the movie to the very end was for me, one great joy ride.Davis and Sarandon share a great bond on the film. Thelma and Louise are great friends, but completely different characters in their own right. Davis plays a ditsy sort of character, who is naïve, but becomes an individual once again, after the men in her life have been nothing but tragedy after tragedy. Then with Sarandon, I got the feeling that she was the one that had the 'balls' out of the two, making her best friend realise that they should stand for no crap anymore. It was a shame that neither actress won an academy award for their role, but of course they were up against a great performer in another 1991 movie, that being Jodie Foster in 'Silence of the Lambs'. If foster was not there, I am certain that one of these two would have walked away with an academy award.Yet there are other cast members that need to be highlighted from 'Thelma and Louise'. I enjoyed what DJ (Brad Pitt) brought to the film. He was a character that I trusted, but like the girls, I was scorned after working out how bad he was. Then there is Louise's love interest, Jimmy (Michael Madison), who shows his girlfriend glimpses of what she is trying to escape, and that being married to him would be a mistake. Then to round the cast of this film is Police detective Hal (played by Hollywood legend, Harvey Keitel). Hal is genuinely interested in working out the situation with the girls, but realises that these are extraordinary women, in an extraordinary situation.'Thelma and Louise' is well directed by Oscar winning director, Ridley Scott. I feel that he brought out the road trip of the girls well, making it really interesting for the viewer, as we want to know what is going to happen as the girls go from one situation to another. Scott also helps to define what makes the girls tick as individuals, and to why they are such great friends. He also makes it easy for his audience to understand what theses girls are doing is necessary to their freedom and survival.I also like the locations that were chosen and shot for this movie, showing off much of America that we rarely get the chance to see. The American west, which is where the majority of the film takes place, looks partly like a fun place to live, but also a place that holds great danger for the girls. Thelma also emphasises that going through 'Texas' is completely out of the picture. Then when the girls are really on the run we get the chance to see some of the great cannons that America has to offer. The camera work by cinematographer Adrian Biddle is exceptional, and makes wonder what it would be like to visit such a part of the world.There is a lot to like about this movie. Things like its style, story, lingo, characters and conclusion, which are all captivating. I feel that the audience of this movie is on an intoxicating sort of ride here, by the sort adventure that 'Thelma and Louise' allows us to experience. We are affected by what affects this pair. Well I know I was anyway. This movie also proves, by creating more problems, you do not make the situation you are in better, but much worse. Nevertheless, it looks like fun to be on the run!CMRS gives 'Thelma and Louise' 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film) ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2003","score":"61 out of 94 people found the following review useful","review":"  For many years now, women have taken power into their own hands.

The best bit is that they actually star famous actors such as Michael J Fox, James Earl Jones and Jack Black that are killed off in the first fifteen minutes - unlike most SFI-FI movies in which we know that the stereo-typical Good Guy is going to survive all the way to the end. In my opinion, this is one of Tim Burton's finest works.  The highlight would have to be the scene with the Martian Girl.  Danny Elfman's music once again sends a chill down my spine.  The only downside to the movie is it's boring ending. This movie isn't mean to be serious realistic; it is just a large group of proffessionals creating a movie that is fun.
