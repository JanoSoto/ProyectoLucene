I specially liked him in Notting Hill with Oscar nominee Julia Roberts (Pretty Woman). Hugh Grant has that Oxford, Ivy league look that in Notting Hill he reminded of my husband. He did a good job of acting. There is something missing about this movie. I can not say exactly what it is. My guess it is the humor.  There is a possibility that sometimes what is funny in one culture is not funny in others.  I was telling a friend about this hilarious movie I had seen. She stopped me and said told me the name of a movie that she had walked out of because it was not funny. The movie, in both cases, was  Monty Python's The Meaning of Life which I still think it is funny. Sometimes funny is just universal.  The music is great, and I had to look it up because I thought that the music was by James Newton Howard (French Kiss), but it is not it is by not. The music was in this case a whole lot more universal and touched a cord. Okay entertainment. \t\t\t\t\t  ","genre":null},{"date":"1 March 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Mickey Blue Eyes is an okay movie.

Still, this movie isn't too bad.  Quite fun to watch actually.  Rachel Leigh Cook is funky in this movie. (spoilers!!!!)It does take awhile to figure out that Cook was raped in the movie.  And her father got killed for it.  More of a mystery than anything with alot of action in it.  Stallone's best movie in a long time.  Mickey Rourke's best movie perhaps since 9 1\/2 weeks.  He's had some stupid movie's in the past and this one may erase some of them.  If only he can get his head out of his butt long enough.  Half the movies he's been in are movie's you wouldn't be caught dead in.  Is Gretchen Mol in this?  I think she is.  Think I'll look, she's not listed in the character list at the end.  She's like the supposed lover of Carter and Carter's boss. Hardly made much of it and it woulda just as been easy to cut the story out of the movie.The DVD is quite good.  Has both the 1971 Carter and the 2000 one.  And several deleted scene's including a less effective original ending.   (in my opinion)   The camera shots were marvelous in this movie as well as some of the artsy fun the director had.  (dvd also includes a directors commentary) Definatly a must rent.   (people who want a quality drama stay clear. ;) 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 March 2001","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  I get the feeling this movie is milder than Michael Caine's original Get Carter.
