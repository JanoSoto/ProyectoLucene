The story is a sober but enjoyable one and although the film is maybe a little dull at times, it still manages to be one of reflection and humour that are very well mixed together. Starring such actors as Michael Caine, Helen Mirren, Bob Hoskins and Ray Winstone, this is one film with a real Crème de la crème of British talent and also one that for some people could be a real highlight.As said I did feel the plot plays out a little boring at moments but it never gets so dragged down in dullness that it becomes bad. The whole tone is never really happy even in the well, happiest of times, something always seems to come a long to make the moment a little sadder and this is one reason I couldn't ever love this film. Having said that all the sadness surrounding the passing of Michael Caine's character Jack and the spreading of his ashes is one of fine characters, each with unique personalities and back stories which interweave into each other's very nicely.I felt of all the acting on show here it is really Helen Mirren who shows off her talent and is just fantastic as Amy(Jack's widow) who is a depressed yet lovable character, caring for her intellectually disabled daughter who has never said a word to her in her life. It is all yet again rather sad but Amy has been created to be just used to it all, even Jack's death we see has bothered but not broken her, she is just a sad person but one who can still have a laugh now and again. Bob Hoskins is good as Ray who is Jack's best mate and he seems to bring a good presence to the screen alongside all the others. One more person to compliment is Ray Winstone as Jack's adopted son Vince, Winstone seems to work the character rather well, blending an honest man with a man who also has demons and anger, brought out a lot by the character of Lenny(David Hemmings).I couldn't help but feel this is a kind of movie that tried to maybe push for awards, and it did work, but maybe not on the level they really wanted. Sure Mirren deserved the credit but as a picture this is nothing special, the kind of movie that is alright don't get me wrong but just not good for numerous reasons. Fred Schepisi is not one of those reasons, I mean I didn't think either his directing or writing were great but importantly they are steady and make the picture one that is a close one, where you connect with the characters, Schepisi really tries to draw you in and make it as if these people are real.I think this movie is the kind of thing that sure, on a quiet Sunday lazing about, this is the kind of thing that may just be very enjoyable. I felt throughout the film goes for the sweet stuff from the first minute with heart and emotion everywhere trying to hit you hard so you too maybe shed a tear. For me this isn't strong enough a movie to make me sad but I do admit there are scenes in it(especially with Mirren in them) that make your heart drop, and the scenes to be fair with her daughter are both heartbreaking but also show us Mirren's complete talent.

You've gotta save yourselves from yourselves.Shot in only 20 days with a hand-held camera in a single 14'x14' cubical set and a very low budget, this minimalist Canadian sci-fi horror film has become a cult favorite for many. Directed in 1997 by Vincenzo Natali, this was his first feature film and it still remains as one of his most popular ones, although Splice has also been warmly received by critics and seen by many more people thanks to its much bigger budget. He's also directed several TV series, including Hannibal which in my opinion stands out for its cinematography. Natali also co-wrote this original script with Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson (creator and producer of another hit series, Orphan Black). For its minimalist approach, Cube does manage to stand out and deliver several thrills along the way, but five minutes into the movie I feared I knew what direction the story was heading, and unfortunately it did, so it was a bit of a letdown. However the journey was quite a pleasant and gripping one, so the movie did flow at a strong pace and I was engaged with it original premise.The film begins with a man (Julian Richings) waking up inside a cube-shaped room without any recollection as to how he got there. There is one door on every side of the cube, leading to other same shaped rooms although with different colors. According to the suit he's wearing his name is Alderson. As he leaves one of the rooms and enters a new one he is sliced into small pieces by a trap consisting of thin wires. We later discover that there are more people in the cube when a small group of them find each other in one room. A police officer named Quentin (Maurice Dean Wint), an architect named Worth (David Hewlett), a doctor named Holloway (Nicky Guadagni), an escape artist named Rennes (Wayne Robson), and a mathematician named Leaven (Nicole de Boer) all seem to have woken up in the same condition as Alderson and they are fighting their way through this maze trying to avoid the traps hidden in some of the rooms. They seem to have nothing in common as their personalities completely differ from one another, and they have no idea who could've put them in such a place. They do decide to stick together and try using their different talents to avoid the deadly traps as they move along through the maze looking for an escape. As the story unfolds and these characters begin interacting with one another tension and suspicion begin to rise among them. David Hewlett who has worked with Vincenzo Natali in all his feature films gets one of the lead roles here along with Maurice Dean Wint and Nicole de Boer. The performances in this film are the weakest link. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed forced and most of the characters' interactions felt unauthentic. The greatest problem was that most of these characters behaved in an inconsistent manner and the pressure they go through isn't a convincing reason for it. Quentin's character is the one who goes through the strongest transformation here and I just didn't feel it was natural. Other than the performances and the predictable finale, I did enjoy this small film and found the premise quite inventive despite its simplicity. With a stronger cast this could've been a great sci-fi horror film because Natali excels at setting the right atmosphere which creates a thrilling environment. The mood of this film reminded me a lot of Saw and I'm sure it was inspired by Natali's work. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"14 August 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" That's the real challenge.

By this point in his career, Hitchcock was quite content to plagiarize himself, as a lot of elements in TOPAZ can be found in his other (better) films, but I did find this to be a slight improvement over his previous effort, TORN CURTAIN. Without the star power behind this as was in TORN CURTAIN, TOPAZ's story, as labyrinthine and convoluted as it is, is brought to the foreground. As always, Hitch's use of camera-work and editing to create suspense is as evident here as it is throughout most of his other work. The sequence which stood out the most to me was a prolonged, mostly silent scene in which a Martinique agent gains access to a hotel where he will get some documents important to the plot, all while his French contact watches from the other side of the street. There was also a just-before-death confession reminiscent of one in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and an exquisitely filmed death scene in which a woman's purple dress fills most of the screen. Still, the plot this time was a bit unwieldy. As there weren't any stars in the film, there wasn't as much focus in the story as I would have liked. At first you think it will be about some Russian defectors, later American NATO agents, and then it settles on a French NATO agent who works on behalf of the Americans to get some information on Russian activities in Cuba. Although it will probably benefit from watching it a few more times, on first viewing it was a lot of take in and keep track of. Still, the complicatedness of it all allowed for some interesting double and triple-dealings. From an acting standpoint, I thought that most of the performances were rather wooden. Considering that this is perhaps the most talkative Hitchcock movie I've seen so far, it was a little difficult to watch in that regard. Still, it wasn't all bad. John Forsythe (THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY) had a supporting role as an American NATO agent, and he did fine. And even though badly miscast, John Vernon did alright for himself as Cuban Rico Parra. Switching composers again, Maurice Jarre provided the score, and while not in the same league as Bernard Herrmann (after all, who is?), his cues and main theme set the tone of the film quite nicely with some occasionally quirky touches. The title sequence, set over a Russian parade, also had a stirring martial quality that perfectly set the mood for the tense opening scene. Overall, I would say that TOPAZ has more immediate entertainment value than did TORN CURTAIN, although the plot is more complicated and the acting isn't as good.

Why do poets or literature giants feel the need to romanticize language in their writings? The same reason movies weren't meant to be all realism, and no fun.This film has fun, it is entertaining, there isn't one part where I get bored. There are a lot of films that are good in sections, but have down moments. This movie keeps it going.Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday was brilliant. Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp was perfect. Together they made a great duo on screen. There is character development (which is missing in a lot of newer Hollywood films) and the story progression is natural (there isn't action for the sake of having action. Each action beat means something to the plot).The love story wasn't too over the top, but it wasn't dull. It was a good mixture of romance. I like how the film doesn't try to either be a romance or have no love interest at all. There are too many films that feel the need to choose one or the other. This film has great balance.The final act of the film was a great way to wrap up the story. I also like how it all focuses around the time period of Tombstone, and doesn't stray into a new story after the final cowboys are taken down.The scene when the man says to Doc Why are you doing this? You should be in bed. Doc says Wyatt Earp's my friend and the other guys says I got lots of friends and Doc replies I don't was one of my favorite lines. It really stuck with me. It shows what true friendship is all about. Also, I love the idea of Justice. I hate it when a story has villains who are misunderstood or heroes who are anti heroes because the world isn't black or white. It is covered in shades of gray. Well sometimes I want a story where the good guys are GOOD and the bad guys are BAD and there is justice not vengeance.I was wowed. I saw clips and trailers in the past and thought it might have been too over the top or cheesy (I really like Unforgiven and Open Range) so I thought this film was possibly going over into the unrealistic\/theatrical style.

Beyond the Poseidon Adventure is no exception. Notorious for being one of Michael Caine's paycheck movies, Beyond has him starring as a tugboat captain\/salvager. Karl Malden is his second mate while Sally Field (full of plucky energy and providing a great scene with Caine when they are looking for a way out; just balling her eyes out, she just breaks down because the day couldn't be much worse; it is a nice little moment with Caine, who just tries to comfort her) is a passenger on his ship. They board the capsized USS Poseidon, hoping for valuables to save his boat from being confiscated by the bank for unpaid bills. You have Peter Boyle blowing hard as Lost In Space's Angela Cartwright's uptight and always- complaining father, while a young studly Mark Harmon is her love interest (much to Boyle's chagrin). And the cast continues Telly Savales as a crook with a bunch of gun-toting hoods trying to salvage plutonium, Jack Warden as a blind man while Shirley Knight is his devoted wife, Shirley Jones (of the Patridge Family fame) as a helpful nurse, the foxy Veronica Hamel as a secretive lover of Savales trying to find a manifest to locate the items he needs to claim the plutonium and way off the ship, and Slim Pickens as a supposed Texas Oilman with a boozing disposition and unwillingness to part with his bottle of specific wine.There's a great deal of journeying through the capsized ship, trying to avoid falling debris and explosions, and the hopes of not drowning or being shot by Savales' men, equipped with machine guns. Savales pretends to be rescuers as a cover for recovering their treasure. At one point a safe literally falls into the presence of Caine and company, with gold no less, but will they be able to hold on to it? Just take a wild guess. Malden's dealing with a serious illness, Caine sleepwalks as the hero, kind of just going through the motions, skating on his star power (regardless of what you think about him, the guy has always been a star). Field brings her charm and lights up the screen with her winsome personality (without her, I just don't think I'd liked this at all), while Boyle is loud and obnoxious. Hamel is a babe, Savales is here just as a heavy (but he isn't in the film that much to tell you the truth), Cartwright has never been more beautiful while Harmon is a hunk (the two do look good together). Knight and Warden kind of just emerge in the film unnecessarily. Jones is extremely likable but as part of an ensemble, she has little moments but not enough to eclipse the main leads. The cast really does rise above the threadbare material. This is all about explosions and noise, and walking, walking, walking. Nice sets of a badly damaged ship help...a little bit.

I am without words for how badly he handles who I consider one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. The only person who is more blatant at this was Michael Bay directing Transformers, when he had Megan Fox posing on the motorbike. I'll come right back to this. Mission Impossible 2 opens with some guy doing some darn impressive climbing scenes in the mountains. I say some guy because whilst he looks like Ethan Hunt and sounds like Ethan Hunt - this guy is most certainly not Ethan Hunt. John Woo takes the frenetic, high-octane guy that we've seen in every other film and ramps the charisma up to 11 and turns down everything else. They could've taken Tom Cruise out and replaced him with Pierce Brosnan and honestly it would've felt more right. Hunt is too flirty and suave in this film - Cruise is at his best when his back is against the wall (as in the other four Mission Impossibles, where he has been a rogue agent), so to have him carrying out a fairly basic IMF mission means that the tension is gone from him. This is just another mission to him, and it shows in his lack of energy at times.To pair with Cruise is Newton, who I really enjoyed watching. She's gorgeous, dignified and even a bit catlike in her thieving scenes (if only there was more than one in the entire film). However, after Hunt recruits Hall (and bangs her for fun), he is told by his boss that Newton's role is just to pretend to be the villain's girlfriend. Hunt's reaction to this news is about what I imagine Newton's was. I thought we were recruiting her for her talent he snarls, barely able to conceal his contempt. Again, this is pretty much how I felt whenever I watched awful, sexualised scenes of Newton - whether its unnecessary cleavage camera work, or her asking Hunt what are you going to do, spank me? in the middle of a tense confrontation. Splice in the porn-quality score and suggestive camera work, and Mission Impossible suddenly changes genres.Hunt's mission is to have Hall infiltrate Sean Ambrose's confidences. Of course, many are suspicious of this, including Ambrose's loyal henchman Stamp (Richard Roxburgh, who can't seem to decide on an accent). Ambrose himself is aware that Hall is probably a mole, but he goes along with it because he's a sex-crazed psychopath (quote, I am gagging for it), and when Stamp dares to ask if he's sure, Ambrose politely agrees and cuts off Stamp's finger for some reason. While Hall infiltrates Ambrose in Sydney (oh, this movie takes place in Australia for some reason), Hunt and his team (an excellent Ving Rhames and an unbearable John Polson, who in three seconds creates the most excruciating Australian stereotype ever put to film) set up in the outback. WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY IN THE OUTBACK? There's nowhere in ALL OF SYDNEY that they can set up? The Australian slang is excruciatingly manufactured coming from the actors, even from native Australian Polson.Its cut together with typical John Woo action - two guns, flying pigeons, endless slow-mo sequences, and an explosion is always warranted. Seriously, there are points where explosions and slow-mo is incorporated where I think why are you doing this, Woo, why? Two motorbikes collide in midair and explode for some reason, instead of just scuffing each other and falling heavily to the ground. Meanwhile, Hunt (who misses a big impossible mission sequence in this movie) has one scene where he must destroy the Chimera virus, and despite Rhames shouting helplessly that he must hurry, Woo decided to shoot Cruise in slow-motion. Its excruciating to watch.Mission Impossible 2 is an action soap opera. The music, overacting, and even the way people move around the room and discuss betrayals.

Its excruciating to watch.Mission Impossible 2 is an action soap opera. The music, overacting, and even the way people move around the room and discuss betrayals. Its fun and harmless if you turn your brain off, but focusing you will see its a giant blob of stuff that Woo should never have been allowed to make under the Mission Impossible banner. He should never be allowed to work with Thandie Newton again, that's for sure.

That's what one might think of him after seeing his exceptional novel coming to life in Contact. Robert Zemeckis's love letter to mankind's search for extraterrestrial life is one of his best among many other greats and a very few menials. Sagan beautifully crafted story about the search for answers might not be a very thrilling film, but it is for sure the one you will rejoice.A young girl (Ellie) who show a great deal of interest in the fields of science and mathematics grows without the care of her parents, both of whom have died when she was very young. Ellie grows up to be what she had initially intended to be, a scientist dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial life. In this far-flung pursuit, she comes across many hurdles, but she never gives up on her dream and that finally pays off as she finds the signal she had been searching for. This signal after many days of work proves to be a way to Contact Extraterrestrials but like at any other time as Science rises Religion tries to bring it back to the ground to its wretched state. Despite these frail deeds, humanity makes Contact by sending Ellie to represent all of humanity, but of this Contact she does not have any proof and a race which never asked for the proof for God asks for proof of this historic journey into the cosmos. While Ellie happens to be the only person to witness this truly legendary moment in the history mankind, mankind itself starts to despise her, but she never tries to give away to their stubborn foolishness for she believes that she had had Contact set aside what the world is saying about it or her.A Dedication to Carl Sagan, Robert Zemeckis's Contact is a film which celebrates two of highly controversial emotions, Human Persistence, and Belief, he tries and succeeds at blending both of these emotions with high precision, allowing none of both to overpower each other. The Background score was not very enchanting but was suitable for the situations it was played in. The simplistic and yet beautiful cinematography of the film is like the one you can see in other Robert's greats. Matthew McConaughey performance among the many great ones was the one you will love most. The Science Fiction part of the film which Robert Zemeckis was crowned king for his Back to the Future trilogy looks more like possible science than impossible fiction which most movies try to sell.You should and will watch Contact if you for one love science as much as I do. The film did not capture the recluse Ellie, but it did justify her Curiosity and persistence depicted in the Novel. It captures very truly the perks and struggles one might encounter on his way to chase the unchangeable.

There is some fighting, some emotion, and unfortunately some lines that could have been delivered a bit more sincerely. But it doesn't matter, because Heath Ledger delivers. He is 100% there, all the time, completely in character and brilliant. Like always. The soundtrack is cleverly enough modern, to show how people of that time felt about their music. There aren't a lot of Middle-age movies where you see the main characters dance to David Bowie and Queen! All in all, this movie will always be very special for me, and I hope I'm not mistaken when I say that this will be a future classic. If you haven't seen it, it's worth it.
