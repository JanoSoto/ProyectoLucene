Woo films have plots which, while they may be implausible, are worth following, characters to care about, actors who get involved, and oh yes, spellbinding action.  Whereas American action films, except the few good ones, have stupid plots, monoliths as heroes, terrible dialogue, cardboard characters, and just one blowup scene after another.In Hard Target and Broken Arrow, Woo had moments, but you could sense him being hemmed in by Hollywood.  With Face\/Off, he finally gets to cut loose. Sure the story is implausible, but you don't think about it while you're watching it, because you're so caught up in it.  And unlike Hollywood action films, where you don't care about who gets killed because neither do the characters, here you do care.  Woo has said in interviews how much he liked old Hollywood musicals, and he choreographs his films like them.  Hard Target and Broken Arrow didn't feel like that, but this one does.  And in Travolta and Cage, he has actors perfectly suited not only to his action flair, but also the operatic storyline.Travolta was flat as the bad guy in Broken Arrow, but here he gets to bring out his gift for parody, and he's quite enjoyable (and gets the film's best line; Lies, mistrust, mixed messages; this is turning into a real marriage).  He's also good as Archer.  The real story here, though, is Cage.  He's great as the bad guy, but when he's called on to provide the emotional heart of the film, he does it in spades, especially in the scene where he's Archer wearing Castor Troy's face for the first time.  The other actors are all good as well.  I hope American action filmmakers learn from this film and make more movies like this.

Steven Soderbergh has, once again, failed to disappoint me.  He reignited interest in independent films with Sex, Lies and Videotape in 1989, and made one of the best films of the decade with King of the Hill.  Now comes his take on the neo-noir genre, and he gives us a real treat.Oh, I almost forgot.  Jennifer Lopez, what a dish...

There is such a thing as good dumb fun, and this movie provides it in spades.  The prologue was somewhat misconceived, though I guess it was necessary for plot purposes, but once things kicked in with the future, it was entertaining.  Luc Besson knows how to make entertaining junk food, as he did with Nikita and The Professional, and he does it again here.  For one thing, he takes the time to create a dazzling world that also makes sense.  It's colorful, eye-popping, and visionary.  For another, while the story is pretty standard, it's told with style, wit, and verve.Except for one or two over-the-top performances per film, it seems Besson favors deadpan acting as a form of humor, and the actors here are well-suited to it.  Willis can be monotonous in films like The Last Boy Scout, but here, he's got something to react to, and he does it well.  Ian Holm lends a touch of gravity to the film, as always.  Milla Jovovich is just fine as Leeloo, playing as if things were just occuring to her.  The two over-the-top performances, of course, come from Chris Tucker and Gary Oldman.  I can see why some thought Tucker annoying, but I thought he was funny.  But, of course, he was no match for Oldman, who, as he proved in The Professional, is an entertaining villain.  His voice (which he claimed was a cross between Ross Perot and Bugs Bunny) was even funny.  All in all, check your brain at the door and have a good time.

George Steven's Giant is a prototype for what a classic epic film should be like.  It takes time to develop its two main characters, and it does a good job of examining the social milieu and environment (Texas) that the characters inhabit.  Rock Hudson's performance reminds me of Richard Burton's in the underrated Joseph Mankiewiek's film Cleopatra, and indeed, there are many parallels (which I won't go into) between Rock Hudson's character and Marc Anthony.  Similarly, Elizabeth Taylor's character in Giant (radiant and wonderful as usual) resembles Cleopatra in many ways.  One can argue that Giant is the story of Anthony and Cleopatra transported to Texas.  And it's almost heartbreaking to see James Dean in his last performance. . . the flow of generations, the gaps between the older and the newer generations, the passing on off dreams by ancestors, the influence of the dead on the living, tradition versus modernity, the lasting and ever-changing nature of love. . . these are all issues which Giant addresses eloquently and majestically.  Oh, and there is a ten-minute section in Giant which has got to be one of the best cinematic passages I have ever seen.
