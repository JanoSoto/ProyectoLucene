To me, besides the gorgeous cinematography and use of the color blue which is very distinctively applied visually throughout, it's all about Juliette Binoche's superb work as a woman trying to suppress feelings of loss and sadness, by cutting herself off from everything that reminds her of the life before the accident. But, every step she takes towards this goal seems futile as the past returns time and again. At first, she does seem liberated, moving to a new building, with the financial resources available to do nothing except live, such as visiting a café to drink her coffee and eat her ice cream, listen to a seemingly homeless talented flute player, swim in a nearby pool, and spend her days with a symphony of sound presenting itself in her mind. It is established that Julie actually helped write the orchestras her husband was held in high esteem for. She later learns that her husband had a lover and this lawyer is carrying his child. Julie was also herself having an affair with an associate of her husband's, himself a musician. This man is truly in love with Julie and so desperately wants to compose a work for the Unification of Europe, but needs her help in order to bring it to life. I think the movie is about accepting a tragedy in order to heal. I don't think one ever can completely free herself\/himself from the grief of losing those you love and certainly understand the complex feelings of anger and pain about this unpleasant event that forever changes your life. Binoche is an actress I hold in high regard because I have an affinity for those who can communicate to us without the crutch of dialogue. Sure dialogue can help, but when you can tell us how you feel with very little in the way of words, I, for one(and I imagine I'm not alone), think this says much more of the ability of an actress. Binoche has always been that kind of actress, and that is why I watch a movie if her name is in the credits. I was moved by this movie because the content and central performance connected with me in that I could sympathize with how difficult such circumstances could be when you lose a family and are left alone. You don't want to face those feelings..they are there and I'm glad that eventually Julie does finish the symphony with Olivier(Benoît Régent) and decides to restart a relationship with him. The film also shows how Julie befriends a stripper whose not as base and evil a loose woman as her detractors might paint her as. We also see how Julie's mother's memory is fading and the boy who was present where the crash took place finds her so he can return a necklace and pass on something her husband said before passing away. These people, her mother, the boy, her former lover, the stripper, alter her plans at a new and different life. It is, however, for her own benefit. I do think we want her to be emotionally healthier and embracing life again truly is the way, don't you believe? Two great instances of communicating her inner turmoil are the lollipop and hand scraping alongside a wall scenes. Not to mention, the scenes in the pool when she often contemplates suicide, holding herself underwater, before coming to her senses and re-emerging.

We're talking about a movie where a woman who's basically made a career from being incredibly hot, is at her absolute hottest. If you're anything like me, that sole reason is more than enough to make Idle Hands required viewing. But some of you probably care more about the quality of the movie, than how hot young Ms. Alba was. Weirdos. Idle Hands is extremely dumb, and that's completely intentional. It's probably the most light-hearted slasher\/horror movie I've ever seen, and there's a mix of stoner comedy in here, as well. A slacker's hand gets possessed by an evil force, and most of the movie involves him trying to keep it from murdering people. His bumbling friends often get in the way, and the hand's obsession with killing the girl he's interested in also complicates matters. Obviously, this isn't Hamlet, but I think it struck a decent cord between dumb humor and campy, 90's horror. I found it strangely enjoyable, in a very B-movie kind of way. Give it a shot, if you ever get the opportunity. Just have a cool drink handy, so that you won't melt under the hotness of Jessica.

How can you forgo the joy of what you know (as the fire chief should know) are crucial seconds ticking away, as Holden slowly accepts that, yes, the guests must go?

In the more analytical, less adulatory cinema of the mid-50s onwards, these fearless heroes became the subject of lengthy character studies. These sometimes proved just as popular as their lighter ancestors, so long as they contained the necessary dose of action and adventure to add flesh to the bones.Lawrence of Arabia is, as character studies go, pretty gargantuan, and really quite devastating in its complete unravelling of the nature of heroism. But such ruminations needn't necessarily be revisionist or provocative. The screenplay by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson begins by inspiring us with admiration for the man, and leaves us filled with pity for him. It is an incredibly concentrated piece of characterisation, but what is rather neat about it is that it says very little directly about Lawrence, besides vague and sometimes conflicting statements. Demons such as his sadistic and masochistic streaks or his inability to fit into military or indeed Western lifestyle come across through his actions &#x96; not through his words, nor the words of those who speak about him. This is not only a very powerful method of storytelling but it is a very realistic way of showing the disparity between the man and the myth. Those demons of course come to dominate the character and the picture.This emphasis on show, don't tell (which is of course the essence of all great storytelling) is given life by the vibrant visual direction of David Lean. In Lawrence of Arabia his images are constantly shifting between the historical reality of the broad canvas to the emotional intensity of an extreme close-up. This is also his way of keeping the story in motion. The cut from the blown-out match to the desert sunrise is of course very well known, but in fact Lean begins and ends almost all his shots in this snappy manner. Even cuts within in scenes tend to give completely new colouring, scope and movement. However the actual shots themselves often consist of gradual shifts in tone, with objects hoving into view or slipping out of sight. It's a fairly literal approach to film grammar (cuts are for changes, shots are for movement) and this makes it extremely effective.In fact the direction of David Lean here looks even better than it really is thanks to how in tune the entire production team was. Editor Anne V. Coates (who is still going today in her mid-80s) took on the mammoth task of aligning all of Lean's jarring cuts, and did a perfect job of it. Maurice Jarre not only created a score which fits the tones of the movie (that main theme, with its hints of Arabic melody, conjures up both the hot splendour of the desert and the cool quench of the oasis), but one which dances expertly to the tune of Lean's images, even working in seamless switches in timbre and melody to coincide with the edits. The sound design too takes the reigns wherever a visual change might be too abrupt &#x96; for example the creaking of Feisal's tent after he utters the words I fear it.With such a flawless production job, the actors in Lawrence of Arabia seem simply to slot into place. Peter O'Toole is of course very good &#x96; introducing Lawrence as a softly-spoken and unassuming hero, bringing out the calm wisdom which passes for charisma, and finally showing the desperate conflict that was going on inside &#x96; but one could not say it is a performance that commands the picture. The character as he is written and presented commands the picture, but O'Toole does not. Omar Sharif's is the best performance we see, filled with a very realistic alertness and sense of indignation. Compared to him, it's a little disappointing to see Alec Guinness and Anthony Quinn give somewhat trite interpretations of wise Arab leaders, but at least they are true to the demands of the story and hold up their parts of the movie. Fun fact for you It wasn't just Caucasians being (mis?)cast as Arabs. I.S. Johar, who plays Gasim, was Indian and a fairly big star in Bollywood.I think what makes Lawrence of Arabia so appealing both then and now is that it shows us the tough, outdoors-loving warrior hero, sweeping us along on his adventures, and yet doing so without lying to us about the strains and disappointments of such a lifestyle. Straightforward realism makes for dull viewing, but no-brainer action can be hollow and unmemorable. Lawrence of Arabia gives us the best of both worlds, with a delicate precision that is beautiful in itself.

However by the time this movie had made it to cable TV, the entire concept just seemed way over done. Having a profitable movie can cause these types of situations. Of course a sequel will be made, and then the goal is keeping the material fresh, and finding new things for your characters to do. Wayne's World 2 is really just a rehashing of the same ideas from the original mixed with numerous cameos, other movie references, and ideas that just don't always pay off with the laughter that Myers may have intended.The story picks up with Wayne and Garth still doing their public access TV show, just like in the original. Wayne is still jealous of his girlfriend Cassandra's career and male attention, just like in the original. In order to prove his own worth, Wayne decides to throw a huge outdoor music festival to apparently make things right with the world again. Things culminate with the appearance of Aerosmith making their second cameo of the movie. There are some truly funny moments that mostly involve Chris Farley as a roadie wanna be, and Garth trying to woo Kim Basinger. Christopher Walken's appearance is welcome of course as a romantic rival for Cassandra's affection. Also a funny cameo from James Hong as her father.Alas, the magic just isn't there this time, and it was certainly time for Mike Myers to move on from this character. Penelope Spheeris was not on board this time as she, like so many others, found Mike Myers impossible to work with. Now after the failure of The Love Guru, it is unclear if Myers has anything new left in him. If Wayne's World 2 comes on, you might want to keep hitting buttons on your remote control every few minutes to see if something better is out there. 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.

According to Kevin McCarthy, at the time this movie was made, there was no symbolism or allegorical message in it, underlining that Jack Finney never wrote the book with that intent. That sounds a very reasonable explanation to me, which most people seem to want to ignore. It's not the movie-lover who's speaking now, but the political scientist, asking to keep things into historical perspective. It's all too easy to discover the ghost of McCarthy in almost everything that's from the 1950's. First at all, you don't have to be a Goebbels to understand that it would be against the basic rules of propaganda to try to get a political message across by means of a SF movie, using an allegory. Most people who love SF or horror movies surely won't have made a link between this movie and McCarthy at the time. When you are a little bit into political thrillers of that period, you'll know that this kind of Red scare messages were presented in a much more straightforward way than through allegories, to make sure the largest possible audience got the message. You want a good example ? Try Whip Hand (1951) in this movie, a remote village is taken over by Communists, testing and planning to use WMD against the USA. To make sure even the Simpletons understand how evil and mean the Commies are, they are using a Nazi scientist to conduct these experiments. That's plain, straightforward, just as Red Menace or I married a communist (Woman on Pier 13) were.Secondly thinking that Kevin McCarthy was chosen for the lead role because of his family name is quite ridiculous ! Let's not forget that McCarthy had already become a villain by 1954, whose megalomania had led to sneer attacks against some of the most decent people in the Armed Forces. McCarthy and Roy Cohen had become very unpopular by then, and lots of Americans agreed they had gone too far. Furthermore, Hollywood sure wasn't sad that his political career was all over. They had been a victim too of the violent attacks of the Wisconsin senator. And see... 1956 was the year in which Bette Davis played in Storm Center, which can be viewed as Hollywood's way to close the McCarthy chapter. His downfall led to his heavy drinking, and by 1957, the Senator died, aged not even 50 ! It could be argued with as much basis as for the Commie-angle, that this movie is rather depicting the fears of small town people against overworked, overstressed and emotionless people from the big cities, buying into property in their neighborhood, acting cold and distant, not joining the local people in their little bars or cultural activities. So we get a nice juxta position here of rural\/town, jovial, pleasant\/robotlike, friendly and helpful\/cold and distant. Using juxta positions is a commonly used formula in movies. To make a menace even more menacing, you first depict something good, friendly innocent, and then in comes the evil. There are two possibilities 1) an external menace (aliens like in Bodysnatchers, communists like in Whip hand, psychopaths like in Key Largo or Petrified Forest)or something not clearly defined or paranormal, like in The Mist. 2) innocence etc suddenly becoming a menace. Village of the damned and Children of the damned are in which nice and innocent children (in stead of cozy rural America) are taken over by an evil force, that make them extremely clever, emotionless, robotlike and dangerous.So, is there no message at all in this excellent movie ? Maybe it makes more sense to see the movie as just an entertaining thriller. The rest is all speculation.By the way, this psychological state of mind of no longer recognizing family members and friends really exists it's called a Capgras delusion.(Spoiler alert) Finally there are indeed some holes in the story (the sudden change of Becky Driscoll after she fell asleep).

So we have the back story of Vito Corleone and the ongoing adventures of his son Michael inter-cut throughout. This adds to the films inordinate length, which would have been long enough if Michael's story alone was told, but here is stretched to almost 4 hours. Details in both stories fail to convince, the Vito back story most of all. It is scarcely believable that a well meaning outsider could so easily take over the underworld in the manner portrayed. As played by De Niro, he is a Robin Hood 'feared by the bad, loved by the good' but why he is so universally feared not plausible. He could have easily been taken out. The real Vito Corleone would have had to have been much nastier and been prepared to deal with his opponents brutally. His character is whitewashed for Hollywood consumption. And there is some cack handed attempts at humour during, for instance, the slum landlord scene. There is, of course much fine acting from all, especially in Michael's story arc. This differs from Vito's since while Vito's is very simple, Michael's is very very complex. Too complex perhap. Various well known events from the 50s merely are stuck together to form the backdrop. The Mafia involvement with pre-revolutionary Cuba; congressional hearings; plus a few subtle hints at the Kennedy assassination. The narrative is exceptionally loose and meandering. The writing is surprisingly unsubtle, with clinking plot points being underlined again and again. The female characters are under-used but make the most of their meagre parts.

If you don't laugh or at least give a crooked smile to the battle between two men who think they are god--O'Toole as the Jesus God and Nigel Green as an Old Testament God, and the Electric Messiah (both). It's crazy and crazed and yet what else do you expect?Someone said it perfectly when they called it a comedy with tragic relief. O'Toole won an Oscar for his efforts (and he played his part for free). The American version of the movie has 6 minutes missing, though probably the wrong 6 minutes.

That's the way that I feel about The Way of the Gun. It's a good film, and it's well made, but I didn't really ENJOY it.Two low-rent criminals, Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Lombaugh (Benicio del Toro), decide to strike it rich by kidnapping the very pregnant surrogate mother for a very wealthy man. Problems arise when they realize who this guy really is. What ensues is a lot of plot twists, double crosses, and plenty of bullets.The acting is solid. Ryan Phillippe continues to impress with his acting abilities, going from a sexual manipulator in the previous year's wickedly clever Cruel Intentions to a thoughtful, if inept, criminal. I didn't like the accent he chose to use, but that's a minor distraction. Benicio del Toro is his usual reliable self. James Caan, however, gives a good performance, but it's too low-key. I hate it how every character in the past ten years has to be low-key and understated. What happened to the energetic, fun movies like Speed and Twister?Christopher McQuarrie won an Oscar for The Usual Suspects, a movie that I also admired, but didn't care for (although for different reasons). This film works better because it moves at a pace where it's slow enough to actually digest all the twists and turns. However, there's no energy here. Call me out of touch, but I think there's a huge difference between an understated film (something that should never be done in a film like this) and a dull, lifeless one. This, for all its laudable qualities, is one of the latter.
