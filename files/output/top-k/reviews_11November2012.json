But above the story and characters it is definitely David Fincher who deserves the major lot of the credit for directing such an engaging story. Fight Club at times can be disturbing but it keeps you stuck to your seats for entire 140 minutes.It was extremely surprising to note that the movie got nominated for best effects and sound effects editing and not for best film, or director or any actor.

I was in high school in the late 70's\/early 80's and I had a buddy who was a Bond-maniac, so we went to a couple together (one, I believe, was Moonraker; I can't think of the other one.) Neither impressed me. James Bond didn't seem to be my type of movie or story, to be honest, so I've never bothered with any of the other movies. Well, in honour of the release of the most recent Bond film (Skyfall) and working on the assumption that when a franchise has been going for 50 years and shows no sign of stopping it has to have something going for it, I decided to go back to the beginning, and watched the first Bond film, Dr. No. To be blunt, it really didn't inspire me to become interested in the series. James Bond must really just not be my type of movie.Not that it was bad. To give credit where credit is due, Sean Connery stepped into the role (for which I understand he was not the first choice) without effort. He was quite good and convincing and from the first scenes he managed to define James Bond. (Even I, who had never watched a Connery-Bond flick until now) had Sean Connery's face in my mind when I thought of Agent 007.) The supporting cast was just that - supporting. This was a James Bond movie; Connery was the one who really mattered. The only important thing is that none of the supporting cast hurt the movie at all. I also appreciated that Bond in this was pretty low tech. He carried a gun, but nothing else, and he wasn't turned into any sort of superman action type. He was very human. So, indeed, this wasn't bad. For me, though, not bad isn't good enough, especially given the hype around any movie that features 007, and the fanaticism with which some people follow the series.For whatever reason, I simply didn't find the story of Dr. No to be especially captivating. The title character (played by Joseph Wiseman) is a mysterious one, somehow interfering with American rocket launches from a complex on a private island off the coast of Jamaica. Bond, along with CIA agent Felix Leiter (Jack Lord) has to figure out how to stop this, since the U.S. has a major launch coming up. Leiter is background, of course. Bond does all the work. Ursula Andress is in this, usually looked upon as the first Bond girl, named Honey Ryder. She's lovely, but also not especially important, except as someone Bond can rescue in the end. To be honest, I found the first Bond villainness (Miss Taro, played by Zena Marshall) to be much more interesting.This movie deserves credit, no doubt, as the first in a seemingly never- ending series that just keeps going. I may not be a James Bond-fan, but I can't deny that others have been hooked by 007. So be it. For me, this gets 5\/10.

The plot maybe simple and it may take inspiration from the famous serial killer Jack the Ripper but its well paced as the curiosity just builds up with the suspicious man as he is doing puzzling stuff. It also has a plot twist that makes you question what the true identity of the lodger really is.The acting is also great, Ivor Novello as the lodger is the best part of the movie as he fits the role perfectly with his appearance - he has shifty eyes and his appearance fits the Avenger's appearance (not to be confused with the superhero movie) which makes us question whether he is the killer. As for the rest of the cast they don't hold up as well but manage to make great main and supporting characters. The Lodger is a silent movie but I found it quite unusual as I thought title cards need to be shown for every piece of dialogue but the title cards only appear when an important part of the plot needs to said, its doesn't appear when there is just a normal conversation for example the conversations between the Bunting family but then again this is the first silent movie I've seen. It doesn't bother me much because it keeps the plot focused.For a film from the 1920's it sure does hold up well, apart from some scratches the films camera work is impressive, I also like how the ceiling goes transparent when the lodger is walking around his room as the the bunting family is wondering what's he is doing. If I have to bring a gripe or two along is that 60% of the remastered music doesn't fit into the theme as I've seen the remastered version and as I said before the rest of the cast beside Ivor Novello doesn't stand out.Overall this is one of Hitchcock's best films to date, you shouldn't be hesitant about watching this if you want to journey into the fog of early 20th century London, give it a watch you won't regret it.

Now GoldenEye was and still is a masterpiece, and Tomorrow Never Dies was not as good, but slightly more entertaining in a way! So is The World is not Enough better than it's predecessor's? Short answer... No. However I still found this movie to be very entertaining and engaging! I liked it very much actually, and I still do! I hear a lot of complaining concerning that this film is bland, slow and boring. To comment on these three complaints this film has got exactly what the other Bond films had. Cool action sequences, beautiful Bond babes, over the top gadgets, memorable villains and sharp humor. How can that result in this movie being called bland and boring? It's a Bond movie for Christs sake?! It is slow at times, but the plot is so actually interesting and engaging that is actually suits the movie best. This may sound a bit dumb, but i'm not gonna pretend that I understands what going on in the long opening sequence. I'm just gonna say that it contains assassinations, explosions, a boat chase, plot and talking!I actually thought Michael Apted did a decent job with the direction in this movie! Seemed as though he was committed to the project! The sound and cinematography is also very well done!Pierce Brosnan is James Bond once again! I've always liked Pierce in the role as Bond and I still do when I watch this film. However is seems like sometimes he is a bit bored, but that's probably just me. Sophie Marceau as Elektra King is very interesting! The audience is let along to believe that she is the main Bond babe, but really she is the main villain! An interesting little plot twist, that Die Another Day sure as hell duplicated! Other than that Marceau is a beautiful woman, a wonderful actress and has very good charisma! She is one of the best things about this movie! When I was a little kid I always thought that Robert Carlyle as Victor Renard Zokas was scary as hell! I saw him as the most challenging villain for Pierce Brosnan's bond at least! My point is that I still like his acting and I still think he is a memorable Bond villain\/henchman. Denise Richards as Christmas Jones sucks. She is gorgeous, but her acting is bad, her character is boring and unlike to Marceau she has no chemistry with Brosnan. Judi Dench as M is still good and Robbie Coltrane makes a return appearance as Valentin Zukovsky. However the thing I want to talk most about here is Desmond Llewelyn with his final appearance as Q. After 17 Bond films... One of the best things about this movie is the scene where we last see Q! Always brings a tear to my eye. Q was and will always be the first and best Q ever! Most people won't agree with my review, but you know what... Right now, I've got no better things to do, than to share my thoughts on this film. If you're a hardcore Bond-fan like me, then watch it.

There was no rich sense of legend or mythology just an oracle pig and a floating ball, cheap, ineffective efforts. The 'Horned King' also didn't live up to the usual terrifying standards of a Disney Villain, using a skull-faced, cloaked figure is a far too obvious move, other more successful figures such as Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty, evokes fear through her malevolent aura, and ability to charm others as opposed to the blatant attempt in this film to create an evil character by giving them the face of a skull, the most stereotypical imagery of fear and death. I understand that this kind of animation was ground breaking at its time but I feel that this film was merely Disney testing the water, a blemish in a collection of timeless classics, completely lacking the fluidity of animations such as The Little Mermaid or Aristocats. This is the Disney that should never have been released, from the psychic pig to the irritating voice of the Princess and emotionless voice of Taran (the two did not blend), it does not possess the quality and depth of a Disney. This film had so much potential, they had a great story and could have created a dark, twisted tale that audiences connected with as much as the books, looking now at the success of the Lord Of The Rings movies, it just shows how badly Disney missed the mark in this poor attempt to reach out to teenage fantasy fanatics.

I had never seen The Black Cauldron before and decided to watch. Initially, I felt it had a lot of similarities to The Sword In The Stone, a film I really enjoyed, however as I continued to watch, the plot and characters grew more and more ridiculous. Knowing the story behind the film would lead me to believe that Disney's biggest mistake was condensing the plot line to an extent were it lost heart and depth, it unfolds too quickly so that character relationships aren't properly developed (especially between the Princess and Taran), I also felt no connection to the protagonist.

I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil War&#x97;a war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mates&#x97;who include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)&#x97;are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as Snowflake, and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept slave wages, and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for him&#x97;that it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to ante up and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for deserting the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the punishment at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious.

Apart from its unique atmosphere (which is a clear result of Hitchcock's experience at Ufa and his encounter with German Expressionism), I CONFESS is, perhaps, his most underrated movie. Although it offers engrossing cinematic merits along with the director's typical hallmarks, great character study, top notch performances, haunting art direction, unforgettable climax, and style resembling the director's visual mind, it has, for years, been profoundly marked by politically correct 'seal of negligence.' Nevertheless, the unforgettable moments of the movie highlight its subject matter created upon realistic details, little units that human perception relies on - thoughts built upon contrasts - best resembled in 'light vs. darkness' concept - something almost medieval. For can flowers being held in the hands of 'unworthy ones' carry certain power to result in bringing the truth out?Based on a 1902 play Nos deux consciences by Paul Anthelme, a clerical protagonist in his cassock Father Michael Logan (Montgomery Clift) calls our attention to the Catholic context. Yes, the Catholic seal of confession seems to be at the core of both the title and the story. Though not a very popular context these days, the confessional is the spot where it all ends and begins. For can we find more absorbing secrets revealed within a face to face whisper elsewhere? A thrilling story, in such a context, develops in an overwhelming manner. The guilty one admits to his crime and all torments are put on the shoulders of an innocent priest (the famous 'transference of guilt' motif).

His torments, however, are not defeated by resignation but his constant forward movement (Ken Mogg) emphasizes the character's readiness to face the future. Montgomery Clift makes I CONFESS not merely a story of suspense but a complex human drama with the subject matter even more absorbing nowadays. Yes, in him 'drama is life...' life of contradictions where sweet illusion blends with trauma, tension with relief, courage with fear, fulfilling oneself with 'lost paradise.' Predominantly, sex would blend with violence...but not here. Sweet charm blends with childish woos. More serious stuff comes with later movies by Hitchcock.ANNE BAXTER cast by Master of Suspense as the last minute (the Swedish actress Anita Bjork was to take the part), she portrays a complex female character. In fact, as Ruth Grandfort, she combines suspicion elements with pure soap opera backbone. In the flashback sequence, she is supposed to be the textbook example of romantic love, a youthful doll who comes down the staircase accepting no efforts of life, who 'thinks primarily of herself, no war' no duty of her beloved one.

He' been hired out for 70 million no less to take out someone famous in the US, but we don't know who. He's the ultimate man of mystery, taking on different disguises in different parts of the country.The FBI and CIA can't get a handle on him. Figures. So the only guy who might have a chance to keep the Jackal from blowing up the whole country is a US prisoner formerly with the IRA. Although not all the details are clear, he was involved in some kind of operation with the Jackall who shot his bride-to-be, wounding her and killing their unborn child in the process. The CIA and FBI, headed by Sidney Poitier, convince Gere to sign onto the operation to stop the Jackal from whatever heinous crime he is going to enact, which we assume is of a higher import than taking out the local janitor. He already does that with ease. In exchange, he might be released.The best parts of the film consist of the many disguises Willis dons as the Jackal. In one, he appears like a former hippie out of the Haight-Ashbury with long blond hair and plaid shirt untucked. In another, he's an international businessman. He even plays a homosexual. In one of his more contrived efforts, he's an overweight laborer with hideous taste in clothes. But he not only disguises himself. He constantly changes the color and plates of his van.

Things will happen in this film without any reason other than that they fit the general atmosphere. Quite often the camera will swift to something completely standalone and abstract, or something will happen at the background that will utterly steal your focus and leave you scrambling to discover just what was said while you were staring at the small dog being stolen by the maitre d'. And the film is absolutely brilliant because of this.It would be neglecting to say, however, that there isn't a story here waiting to be told. There are themes being addressed, most opinionatedly the idea that men are sheep and that if all we ever are is sheep then it is possible that our leaders won't be anything but sheep either. And thus the world of Brazil could be born. A world of dystopia, but one that hasn't been born out of dictatorship or malignancy, but rather out of sheer incompetence. Only two characters in this world are in any way competent. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), the main character himself, though he is crippled by his shyness and unwillingness to make a difference, so it's a bit of a stretch to call him competent, and Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), who's a resistance 'fighter' and quite possibly fictional. And thus our world is set and we are let loose to examine it, laughing and pointing as we go.It's important to remember that while Brazil is a great political and social satire, it's still an excellent comedy above all else. Its humour is dark and sometimes ill-spirited, but I watched this film with a smile on my face. The humour is often rather subtle and I'd surmise that it would require a second or even third viewing for me to get all the jokes, but that's because there are so many of them there to be found. Hidden in the background, sneaked into the dialogue, in the tones of voices.Is the film for everyone? Certainly not, as its sense of humour is not for everyone and one needs to have an appreciation for satire for them to get what the film is trying to achieve. A certain affinity for art films is also recommended, as the film is more about style than logic, as stated.

Major players and minor supporting actors in The Thin Man (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall.The story is a Whodunit and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy.Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing Rick Blaine) tells Claude Rains (playing the French Prefect Of Police who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship. But I think The Thin Man (1934) has the best final scene of all.It's a rapid fire end of the film portrait of the Nick and Nora Charles married couple about to get to bed in a moving railroad train private room, this in a movie which shows the two alone together in bedrooms before with nothing sexy at all happening between them.The audience sees unexpected beginnings of married love, and the camera switches instantly to the nighttime train entering a tunnel with the San Francisco, Here I Come tune played brightly and zestfully.Alfred Hitchcock used the same affectionate couple (Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint) about to get into bed together on a train, then quick switch to train entering a tunnel at the end of North By Northwest (1959), but that movie ending didn't have San Francisco, Here I Come music along with it, and that makes all the difference!---------------------- Written by David R.

Major players and minor supporting actors in The Thin Man (1934) are all lovable, and that includes the villain, lawyer Herbert MacCauley, marvelously portrayed by long time movie character actor of note, Porter Hall.The story is a Whodunit and the audience never guesses the real culprit until the penultimate scene (the next to the last scene) when hero detective, Nick Charles (played to perfection by William Powell), hosts a grand dinner for half a dozen likely suspects (and police in attendance, too, both as tuxedo clad guests and also as waiter staffers!), and fingers the guilty guy.Many people opine that the best final scene in any movie is the one in Casablanca (1943) where Humphrey Bogart (playing Rick Blaine) tells Claude Rains (playing the French Prefect Of Police who just helped Bogart and now becomes a fugitive along with Bogart) tells his new friend, and fellow accomplice, Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.

It is very intense and the ending is heartbreaking, but the story will keep you enraptured from start to finish.Laura (Celia Johnson) is a housewife who travels by train once a week to shop in a nearby town. Alec (Trevor Howard) is a married physician who works in a local clinic on the same day of the week. They meet by chance when Laura has a cinder in her eye, which Alec helps remove. Their romance starts innocently enough, but quickly blossoms into a passionate love affair. Alec sees that the relationship will only cause heartache, so he takes a job in South Africa. The story of the couple's last day together is sadly romantic and very moving, culminating in a poignant final sequence at a train station where they met.Brief Encounter is beautifully filmed in B&W. Johnson and Howard are both excellent, portraying two people in a relationship that cannot continue. The film is a perfect departure from most today's movies, as it deals maturely with adult themes and has no filthy language, no toilet humor, and no violence.I've watched Brief Encounter numerous times and it actually seems to improve with each viewing. I think you'll like it unless you hate B&W film or you prefer today's mostly sophomoric movies.

I watched the ad commercials which was kind of confusing. Whoever thought Disney wanted to put Stitch in Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King to begin with? That question remains a mystery to me, but despite that, I saw it in theaters and was virtually surprised at how good it really is. The reason why I'm giving this a 9\/10 is because it's not in the same depth as The Lion King, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and several of Disney's films, but it's an emotionally entertaining that still holds up for me as a young adult.The story is original with a nice concept An experiment made by Dr. Jumbaa with his assistant Dr. Pleakley escapes from a ship and lands in Hawaii where Lilo, a step-sister to Nani, meets him and adopts him before she names him Stitch. It also has some beautiful emotional moments especially the relationship between Lilo and Nani. There are other redeeming qualities such as the likable and charming characters, some excellent voice work from a cast including Chris Sanders, David Ogen Stiers, Kevin McDonald, and others, it's terrific music score from Alan Silvestri and it's beautiful animation with beautiful backgrounds and decent character designs.Overall, Lilo & Stitch is one of the childhood favorites that I usually love and I still love it right now since it's celebrating it's 10 anniversary.

One day Doc falls into Babe's doorstep with a stab wound and succumbs before he tells anything. Babe is then abducted, tortured and pursued to spit out what Doc has revealed in his final moments.A scene in the first 15 minutes where two old men has a road rage is one of the worst scenes I have come across. The entire story runs on the paranoia of Szell regarding the safety of his diamonds and the way they came up for portraying it is by Szell saying he is paranoid about the safety of his diamonds. Occasionally it gets loud and irrational (large help from Hoffman's character) and I never made me bothered to feel what is going to come next. The character Elsa does not do enough justification considering the screen time. Scheider gives a calculated and reliable performance while Hoffman is inconsistent. The scene of Szell walking by the Jewish market was effective but could have raised the pulse had it been longer or if could have been the climax.
