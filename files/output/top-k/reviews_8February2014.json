The star of the movie is Jean-Claude Van Damme who plays a a character named Chance who protects the daughter of a military man who was murdered by a team of special killers who pays people to be practice targets and kill them off leaving no evidence and now are after the daughter who wants her dead so she doesn't know that they killed her father.The movie starts slow but then it knocks you off your seat when the fights and action scenes happen, the story is OK but its hard to follow I guess that's why it's called hard target. The characters I can say are memorable but some things about the movie makes it weak which is why it got mixed reviews. Examples are like there are too many explosions happening that aren't even suppose to happen like in one scene Chance blows up a guy by pouring oil on him and then setting him on fire and he explodes, HOW! Unless he was holding dynamite or something. Also there are to many scenes focusing on the bad guys which are pretty scary because there is this henchmen who helps his boss kill people and in one part when one of there men are not following his orders the henchmen cuts of his ear, thank gosh it's off screen.My last thoughts on the movie it's not a great movie but it is a good one and it's kind of close to being popcorn entertainment cause there are many actions scenes that are awesome. I recommend this movie for people who likes action, adventure, and suspense. Another thing that makes this movie good is that,Super Mario makes an appearance I don't know what happen to his hat but it's also the first time Mario uses a weapon.

Most people consider Game of Death to be Bruce's worst film, but I give that dubious honor to this movie. Bruce Lee's dormant attitude by promising to never fight gets old very quickly. He doesn't start fighting until around the 45 minute mark. Throughout the movie, when Bruce isn't fighting or somebody else is, it's very talky. I really shouldn't be surprised though, considering Wei Lo directed it. Even Bruce's fight scenes in this one are somewhat disappointing. I'm used to Bruce's fights being one-sided in movies, but at least they contained excitement. This doesn't really have any of it, aside from the final fight at the end. He's never in any immediate danger, even when he looks to be heavily outnumbered. Let's face it, Bruce Lee is probably the only reason you decided to watch this movie to begin with. He's so fast and acrobatic. He has to deal with poor camera work and fight scenes that aren't exactly fluid. His performance is nothing to write home about, he relies on intensity and facial expressions. It works very well. What was up with that internal monologue of his?

I remember watching this around the time of release and fell for its overly stylised, excessive violence and moody, oppressive atmosphere. But watching it again last night, I was left wondering exactly why I fell for it so badly. It might not be the most original picture out there and it certainly isn't what you'd call uplifting. But there is a strange, almost cartoon-y level of carnage that action fans will lap up. A pity then, that the film is about as deep as your average burst of Tom & Jerry.Bruce Willis plays a drifter who goes by the name of John Smith who winds up in the dead-end ghost town of Jericho, Texas. Quickly discovering that the town is the site of a vicious dispute between two gangs of bootleggers, Smith senses an opportunity to make a quick buck by playing the gangs off against each other. After working with the Italians led by Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) and then the Irish families led by Doyle (David Patrick Kelly), Smith's plan quickly unravels when Doyle's psychotic right-hand man Hickey (Christopher Walken) reappears in town and takes exception to Smith's quickly-earned reputation as the ultimate gun-for-hire...Shot in a warm orange glow that's reminiscent of a sepia photograph, Last Man Standing is a real oddity that blends westerns, gangsters and even Kurosawa in a not-entirely-successful picture. The setting is an odd mix of a hot and sticky western town and even has a corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern) but seems populated almost entirely by sharp-suited gangsters in old Fords, a snivelling bartender (William Sanderson) and an undertaker for whom business is good. The plot, which shouldn't be that confusing to follow, is lost in a mire of mumbling characters and possibly the dullest voice-over in history by Willis who appears to have suffered from a personality bypass. The problem is exacerbated when Willis and Walken share the screen as each of them sneer and growl at each other like a couple of grumpy old dogs instead of lighting the screen up with sparkling dialogue like the stars they are. At times, it's almost laughable.But then a scene appears when Willis gets to do some serious ass-kicking and indeed, Last Man Standing does not disappoint in this department. There is a strong sense that writer\/director Walter Hill spent a lot of time watching Desperado because this film also has baddies flying through the air, bullets raining down from Willis's dual pistols (which only run out of ammo when the baddies are either dead or reloading themselves) as the screen lights up with muzzle flashes. It is jolly well done and very exciting but when the guns are holstered and Willis is smooth-talking his way into the bed of moll Lucy (Alexandra Powers), the film badly sags. There's no real pulse behind it as the film continues to tell its story, which is one that really hasn't any got much substance to it. Certainly, nothing ever feels at stake and Willis's enigmatic loner is a difficult hero to get behind. Seasoned action fans will get a kick out of this but I can't avoid the feeling that it needed something else. Desperado has a feeling of fun to it, a sense that its OK to laugh in places - not to mention the sexiest sidekick of the 90's, Salma Hayek. Last Man Standing has no joy or fun to it and in many ways, it's like Smith himself - awesome when there is a gun in its hand but without it, it's a load of nothing.

Last Man Standing has no joy or fun to it and in many ways, it's like Smith himself - awesome when there is a gun in its hand but without it, it's a load of nothing. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"8 February 2014","score":"","review":" You ever have a film in your mind that you loved as a kid but have since drifted away from? I remember watching this around the time of release and fell for its overly stylised, excessive violence and moody, oppressive atmosphere. But watching it again last night, I was left wondering exactly why I fell for it so badly. It might not be the most original picture out there and it certainly isn't what you'd call uplifting. But there is a strange, almost cartoon-y level of carnage that action fans will lap up. A pity then, that the film is about as deep as your average burst of Tom & Jerry.Bruce Willis plays a drifter who goes by the name of John Smith who winds up in the dead-end ghost town of Jericho, Texas. Quickly discovering that the town is the site of a vicious dispute between two gangs of bootleggers, Smith senses an opportunity to make a quick buck by playing the gangs off against each other. After working with the Italians led by Strozzi (Ned Eisenberg) and then the Irish families led by Doyle (David Patrick Kelly), Smith's plan quickly unravels when Doyle's psychotic right-hand man Hickey (Christopher Walken) reappears in town and takes exception to Smith's quickly-earned reputation as the ultimate gun-for-hire...Shot in a warm orange glow that's reminiscent of a sepia photograph, Last Man Standing is a real oddity that blends westerns, gangsters and even Kurosawa in a not-entirely-successful picture. The setting is an odd mix of a hot and sticky western town and even has a corrupt sheriff (Bruce Dern) but seems populated almost entirely by sharp-suited gangsters in old Fords, a snivelling bartender (William Sanderson) and an undertaker for whom business is good. The plot, which shouldn't be that confusing to follow, is lost in a mire of mumbling characters and possibly the dullest voice-over in history by Willis who appears to have suffered from a personality bypass. The problem is exacerbated when Willis and Walken share the screen as each of them sneer and growl at each other like a couple of grumpy old dogs instead of lighting the screen up with sparkling dialogue like the stars they are. At times, it's almost laughable.But then a scene appears when Willis gets to do some serious ass-kicking and indeed, Last Man Standing does not disappoint in this department. There is a strong sense that writer\/director Walter Hill spent a lot of time watching Desperado because this film also has baddies flying through the air, bullets raining down from Willis's dual pistols (which only run out of ammo when the baddies are either dead or reloading themselves) as the screen lights up with muzzle flashes. It is jolly well done and very exciting but when the guns are holstered and Willis is smooth-talking his way into the bed of moll Lucy (Alexandra Powers), the film badly sags. There's no real pulse behind it as the film continues to tell its story, which is one that really hasn't any got much substance to it. Certainly, nothing ever feels at stake and Willis's enigmatic loner is a difficult hero to get behind.

Cleese and Curtis hold it all together as the relatively straight protagonists, but it's in the support where things get really interesting. Kevin Kline's Oscar-winning turn as the psychotic Otto is absolutely hilarious, with never a dull moment, and really the lynchpin that makes the whole movie work.Then there's the stammering Michael Palin, almost as good, as the animal-loving and bumbling criminal who soon finds himself completely out of his depth.

But when the space station scene at Severnaya, Russia, happens, we are introduced to a new way of creating nuclear war. Not by heat blasts, thermal winds, or radioactive fallout. The new threat was realized in another movie called The Day After, where a first simulated nuclear blast was an airburst that set off an EMP pulse wave. Car engines die, lights go off, LED displays go black. In short, an EMP used as a weapon can knock out anything run by electricity. So in GoldenEye, this title refers to an EMP space weapon that, when fired, threads the needle in about a 10-20km radius...a surgical EMP strike that cripples and knocks out all electricity from everything like computers and televisions and similar devices. 2 such weapons already appeared in space for the simulated test firing on the space station, and the one that was fired was called Petya (the other was Misha). So, a space station general and Xenia enter the station, arms the weapon to target Severnaya, and then Xenia surprisingly shoots and kills 15-20 station facility members. One member who was alive after being shot did press the panic button just before being shot dead by Xenia. Then they make their escape out of the space station by their chopper before the EMP weapon fires, and steals the GoldenEye. 2 fighter jets were scrambled as well as a Tiger battle helicopter to the space weapons site, but they were no match for the GoldenEye's EMP when the strike hit. The jets and the chopper all went down and crashed due to the pulse. Natalya, who works at the station, was the lone survivor who was able to evade the mass killing but could only watch the first-hand damage to the station when the space weapon was fired and she could not stop it.

I was able to see Bond overwhelm several Russian squad cars with the brute size and strength of the tank. Then, the final scene, where a secret plan to use GoldenEye in Cuba was launched, reveals the character Natalya at her best. Even though she was a 2nd-level programmer, she was able to change the access code to the Misha EMP space weapon, so that it re-enters the atmosphere to burn up over the Atlantic so the weapon is no longer a threat to the world anymore. How can she do that when her enemies who was about to kill her and James Bond tried so hard to make sure that GoldenEye would be shot over London and bring London totally out of business...but regrettably, could not do it?

It makes any film in the genre looks like a Disney film in comparison. Being said, I don't liked the overall direction of this film.

I also thought it was some kind of satire to the westerns in general, in some deep level. But I don't know. There is some pointless moments in the film, I admit is a bit difficult to stay focused on it. Don't get me wrong, I love slow paced films, I actually dig films who makes every single shot last forever, but it needs a purpose to do so. And in this film there is really no point for such thing. Firstly because they(e.g the train scene is way too long, the 'feast scenes are also way too long) add nothing to the film, I mean, this film would perfect with a few minutes less. I actually liked the editing on the massacre sequences, the scenes got pretty dynamic and actually much better than what it would be if using a generic scene transition... yeah. For me, it totally worked.I frankly don't have a word about the acting or cinematography. Do I? Well, if anything, I think that William Holden was pretty convincing as the bunch leader. The sets in the film were also very good, but the camera work is so...lame and cheesy. The zoom in and out were so amateur, and the texture of the video is typical from a late 60s- 70s film. In other words, bad. The music is good, but it sounds familiar with the magnificent seven(1960) score. Maybe I am just crazy, but I thought the music on both films are extremely similar.Anyway, I think it's a worth experience.

A small self elected clique ruling over the Universe in order to maximise profits is a bad mix of capitalism meets self serving communism .
