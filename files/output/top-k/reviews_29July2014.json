I love it. I also likes the sequels but they don't get any close to the original. I loved the part when Neo and Trinity are fighting all those agents on the rooftop and then one of the Smiths points a gun at Neo and Trinity shoots him saying DODGE THIS. It was so awesome!! After watching this movie i found myself making references of it (i know, nerd!!!!). What i'm trying to say is that this film has some of the best lines of dialog and some of the most remarkable scenes in the history of cinema. For a quick conclusion, if you want to watch a great action flick and complex plot, this is the film you should watch.

It has a surprisingly good script, and a probable story, stretched I guess, a little bit. When spiders feed off this toxic waste, they augment to gigantic proportions, and the whole show town becomes their pray. I must say, the whole spider thing is well staged. The spiders look awesome. If you hated Arachnophobia, then make this one, the last film, you'll never want to see. It's a great starring vehicle for Arquette, who returns to town to his old love, cop, Wuhner, who's arrest of some young teens, mirrors that same familiar scene with cop, Shue, in Piranha. The thrilling action and spiders come in spades making for a great monster flick, with a little bit of sappy romance, which heightens it's quality some. This is much better than a lot of type of monster, pick off victims, flicks. It even has the killer from Manhunter, of all people, as a geeky hermit who has a fascination with, of course spiders, who Wuhner's nerdy son hangs out with. Just leave your brain at the door, sit back and enjoy the guilty pleasure ride and popcorn flick, and let the spiders do their thing.

It was directed by the guy who directed Robocop, which was a bit too violent for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm not morally against the level of violence and bloodshed in Robocop and I'm definitely not saying it should have been censored. It just wasn't for me. 2. The book was okay but it wasn't awesome. I mean, there are better science-fiction books out there, like the Dune series and the Foundation trilogy. I'm not much of a fan of Robert A. Heinlein because he seemed to be more concerned with preaching than telling a good story. I'm sure that even his fans wouldn't say Starship Troopers is his best book. Out of the four that I've read (Starship Troopers, Friday, Stranger in a Strange Land, and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress) I'd say The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is the best.But I saw a bit of Starship Troopers on TV and decided to rent it and see the whole thing. It was actually pretty fun. I know quite a few Heinlein fans hate it because rather than being a direct adaptation of the book, it's a parody of a militaristic fascist society, which kind of implies that the book supported fascism. I know Heinlein was not a fascist. I'm not sure if he ever affiliated himself with any political party, but I think that by the time he wrote Starship Troopers, he was a libertarian, which is about as far from being a fascist as you can get.Still, it's a fun movie. It's got a lot of action. It's suspenseful. The Klendathuan bugs aren't quite as awesome as the xenomorphs from the Alien series, but they are good enough for a movie like this. I'm afraid I must give it 9 stars instead of 10 because, well, I just don't like Denise Richards as an actor. She's almost always smiling in this annoying way. I would have given the movie 10\/10 if Carmen was played by an actress more like...let's see, what actresses were about the same age in the second half of the '90s? Maybe Reese Witherspoon. I don't know. You might be a bit disappointed if you're expecting it to be as good as James Cameron's Aliens, but I'd say Starship Troopers is definitely worth seeing if you like sci-fi action movies.
