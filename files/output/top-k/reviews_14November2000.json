One character even appeared to be shooting cottage cheese at one point as his (or her, the body was so badly deformed I couldn't tell anymore) innards were displayed endlessly.

It's about a run down drunk of an ex bowler (Woody Harrelson) who won a state championship almost twenty years ago, but now he's barely making his rent money.  He no longer bowls because he's missing his hand...so he's left with nothing but a hook.  Thru a series of events, he meets up with Randy Quaid who plays a really stupid Amish guy who happens to be a very good bowler.  Eventually they get together for an adventure thru the country, making their way to Reno, Nevada for a bowling championship.   The movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen, and Harrelson is hilarious.  If you buy the DVD version, it's rated R as opposed to the regular PG13 version, and I must say the R version is better.  I think they have 17 mins of added footage on the DVD.  A lot of people will see this movie is somewhat gross in spots, but I don't mind it at all, and I think it only goes to make it funnier.  Vanessa Angel, who I know from Weird Science the USA series some years ago, is pretty funny in this movie as well.   I think it's a gem, and I'd definitely give it a 10\/10.

As the closing credits started rolling, I knew that I had been cheated and that one had been put over on me.  I think the best way to describe my thoughts about this movie is that if I could add, modify or delete one thing, I would put a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie that it sucks, and that the audience would be best served by walking out and theater hopping to another movie, any other movie. The movie theater would obviously not be too happy about it, but if you bought a few bucks of c**p in the concession line I'm sure they would be willing to look the other way a time or two.  The problem is that with such a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie, most people probably wouldn't believe it and wouldn't do anything about it, but if the disclaimer came at the end of the movie, by then everyone would know it already, and it would be too late to switch movies or ask for a refund.  The movie theaters frown upon giving out refunds for rotten movies as they would quickly go bankrupt. What to do?The story here is a simple one.  Earth is on the verge of destruction because of human's misuse for centuries.  With only a few years left of earth remaining viable for humans to live on, a crew is sent to Mars. Probes had been sent to Mars to bombard its surface with algae which would grow from the CO2 on Mars to produce oxygen.  Then perhaps humans would be able to inhabit Mars at some future time.  The crew being sent is there to find out how the algae is doing and verify if humans will be able to move to Mars.This movie was just plain awful.  I still don't understand what we need all of these space movies for, but Hollywood keeps making them as if we care. This latest version of space exploration could possibly be the worst yet. Most space movies aren't very good, but if you are dead set on seeing one, go check out Rocketman.  It's not the most realistic of space movies, but aside from Apollo 13, it is probably the most enjoyable.  In Red Planet, there is just nothing here at all.  The acting is pretty bad and you will be hard pressed to find a worse screenplay out there.  I don't understand why Kilmer wanted to be a part of this, and Moss doesn't belong here either.

Red Planet is an excellent straight to video production that will hopefully just go away or fade into the reservoir of rotten movies.

First came Halloween in 1978.  Then Halloween 2 comes out three years later.  Halloween, like Nightmare on Elm Street was one of the best horror films ever made.  It was tense, horrific and superbly directed.  Halloween 2 was almost as good. The story was actually furthered perfectly as it took place the very same night right after Loomis shoots Michael off the balcony.Then there was Friday the 13th.  I personally thought that part one was a decent start to the series, but it was the weakest of the first four. Nonetheless, it started the series and when Cunningham passed the reigns over to Steve Miner, to me it got better.  I am not saying that Friday the 13th is anywhere near as good as Halloween or Nightmare On Elm Street, but it certainly is quite well done, which is proved by it's longevity.  Part 2 took a natural progression into the story and introduced Jason Voorhees, ruthless killer, to the film world.  He follows in his mothers footsteps and seeks vengeance for her death.  Makes sense to me.Now, part two of the Nightmare series is not even of the same mind.  There is not a modicum of similarities between this one and Wes Craven's original. Fred Krueger was a sinister, dark, evil character.  When he tried to be funny, he did it so that he could taunt his victims.  When he laughed, you felt chills.  When he told you that his finger knives were God, you somehow believed him.  He was the epitome of evil.  Craven and Robert Shaye did it right in the first one.  In this abomination of a follow up, Fred Krueger is more like a stand-up comedian.  He would rather tell jokes that scare his victims and his audience.  He would rather make us laugh than make the hair on our skin stand up.  And you know what?  That p***es me off.  Perhaps it shouldn't, after all it is only a movie.  But it does.  Why would you mess with success?  Why would you take all that is holy and turn it into a circus?  I guess you can say that the formula worked because the franchise has been awfully good to New Line and Robert Shaye, but that is of no comfort to me.You see, I love to be scared.  I love it when that special film comes along and actually freaks me out.  There are so few films that can do it and Nightmare On Elm Street did to me.  Then it suckered me into the theater back in 1985 and it played a joke on me.  I saw every Nightmare that was released hoping that it would somehow get better.  But they didn't.  Every one of them were bad except for Wes Craven's New Nightmare.  Craven wanted nothing to do with this garbage because he knew that it was a sellout.Perhaps I am a bit of a hypocrite for lambasting this film because I am usually one that understands the bottom line in Hollywood is to make money. Films like Armageddon and True Lies and The Perfect Storm are there to turn a profit.  And they do so by following a certain formula that will almost guarantee then success.  Perhaps Robert Shaye thought that to make a franchise of a character he had to give him more of a personality.  So they made Krueger Jerry Lewis.  But my anger stems from the fact that there are so few films that truly frighten me.  I love horror films but to do it right is a work of art.  Halloween, Evil Dead, Blair Witch Project, Jaws and Nightmare On Elm Street are films that get inside of you.  They twist you and manipulate you.  This one just manipulated my wallet for a few bucks.

Only Ramis isn't in the chair this time (surrendering the honors to sitcom director Allan Arkush), but he did pen the script.The only returning characters are Ty Webb and Mr. Gopher. There were supposed to be more but Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield hated the script and Ramis would not let them make their own changes, which I think was a huge mistake and quite arrogant and out of character for Ramis. Taking Murray's place is Dan Ackroyd as Captain Tom Everett, a mentally-scarred war vet turned mercenary, and Jackie Mason as Jack Hartounian, another boorish, blue-collar millionaire property developer. He's entertaining, but he's certainly no Al Czervik.Ted Knight passed away in 1986, so Judge Smails couldn't return either. Instead we have Robert Stack playing the villainous Candler Young. Again, I like Stack, but he just can't live up to Ted Knight.Hartounian agrees to join the prestigious Bushwood Country Club to please his teenage daughter who is desperate to fit in. The snobs don't take too kindly to his unsavory humor or his connections to the local working class. Together they conspire to shut him down, but Jack Hartounian doesn't give up easily.Almost everything that made Caddyshack so good is dumbed down in this sequel. The R-rating, the raunchiness, the complex character interactions...all gone. Though they somehow still managed to squeeze in a single F-word (courtesy of Randy Quaid's obnoxious lawyer Peter Blunt) in a PG, which is very rare. Caddyshack also had dozens of speaking roles and didn't care if the audience couldn't keep up with it. Those kind of quirks make it endlessly watchable, while Caddyshack II is merely good for a laugh only once in a while.The theme of the working class clashing with greedy snobs who have had everything handed to them might be a little more relevant today, I just wish that they hadn't comprised the film so much. Had there been more continuity with the original we could have had another classic.Not as bad as its reputation suggests, and there are a decent amount of laughs. But just not enough.I do appreciate the Mad Magazine and Root Beer references though.

Oh yes, there's plenty of wild and crazy(but not particularly titillating) sex, typical of these mindless BASIC INSTINCT inspired porn-thrillers, and there are even a few kinky\/gory murders thrown it. There just isn't anything that even remotely resembles a good movie. The film casts Bruce Willis as a psychiatrist(Please!) who becomes traumatized after a very disturbed patient commits suicide before his very eyes. He then suffers another blow(no pun intended) when his doctor-friend(Scott Bakula) is brutally murdered. Willis is then called in to take over Bakula's creepy group, and the mysterious murders continue. Meanwhile, Bruce gets involved with an attractive, but strange fender-bender(Jane March) who has some bizarre connection to the unfortunate chain of events in his life. Bruce is his inimitable DIE HARD-self, and Jane March is pretty in a girlish sort-of-way, but their sex scenes are very difficult to watch because Willis, while undeniably a good-looking guy, still looks every bit of his forty years, while his partner looks all of fourteen, effectively killing any sex appeal this film was suppose to have. But, of course, that is the very least of the movie's problems. Most of the problems can be traced back to the script, a ridiculous combination of BASIC INSTINCT\/FATAL ATTRACTION\/PSYCHO-type cliches. If you are wondering  what the most suspenseful parts of the movie are, there aren't any. The true horror is in the fact that this ugly little number ever got made. This is the price we pay for going to see movies like BASIC INSTINCT. Believe it or not, this movie was directed by Richard Rush, the same guy who gave us the brilliant THE STUNT MAN.
