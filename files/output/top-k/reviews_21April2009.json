[{"date":"21 April 2009","score":"47 out of 82 people found the following review useful","review":" We all know and have seen the bias that is almost always presented in books such as American books of history. For example, many historical books I've read praise America no matter what circumstance they're in (such as during the Revolution or Civil War). Even during such tragic events as the 1833 Trail of Tears Indian massacre, you'll rarely read any criticism of it in the typical history book.Why? Because it's about America. America has built up a false image of itself; America is shown as omnipotent, with no nation able to even hope to match its power, and it shows America to be a pure nation with few if any faults.Obviously, we all know that that image couldn't be farther from the truth, as America has numerous faults, and many nations have the same if not more power than America.But unfortunately, America won't stop brainwashing the public and make them aware that this image is false. The Patriot is a prime example of this propaganda.Basically, Mel Gibson plays as an invincible farmer who has a vendetta against the British, as he does in almost all of his historical movies. Once again he plays the role as someone who despises the British more than any other human on Earth. I didn't watch this whole movie, mainly because I am simply too disgusted to watch it. Though a few parts of the movie are historically accurate, such as the decisive British victory at the Battle of Camden, but the rest of it is nothing but American flag-waving idiocy.One scene that I really despise is when Gibson and his two sons fight a squad of British troops who are taking a prisoner away. His sons have dead accuracy, and Mel displays super-human strength, as he kills over 10 British troops - including their officer - without taking a scratch. Historically, any rebel foolish enough to attack even two British troops would quickly be killed. But no, the directors made the movie as far from historically accurate as possible, so Mel slaughters the troops. Another scene I hate is when the British are shown to burn down a church, trapping the people inside. What were those idiotic directors thinking!!? Great Britain's state religion was Protestantism; even if a British officer ordered a Protestant church to be burned, he would executed for high treason against the church. Burning churches was something the Nazis did, not the British, but apparently the directors were so brain-dead that they decided to make the Britsh do this. Another scene I hate is when Tavington kills an innocent civilian for no reason. Tavington is based on the real-life Colonel Banastre Tarleton, an excellent Britsh commander of cavalry. He was an excellent general, not a cold-blooded killer, and most likely, he never shot an innocent civilian in cold blood.All-in-all, this movie is just plain terrible. The fact that it is so incredibly historically inaccurate simply ruins the movie entirely.

I've watched this film 20 times over and it still touches my heart. I always look for violence in a movie, because I believe it shows reality and this movie does just that with it's gut wrenching brutality. I tell people who haven't seen that they need to watch it A.S.A.P. Not just because of the violence, I'm not like that, but by the completely accurate point of view of the soldiers during and even after the war.I am one of those people that is impossible to make cry, and folks this movie made me bawl my eyes out. The ending Tom Hanks scene is so stunning and heart-wrenchingly sad that I couldn't bear it, yet I still watched the ending. That scene is also surprising considering that the beginning threw me of guard with the old man in the opening scene, I thought he was Tom Hanks. (Sorry for the spoilers) Also, Giovanni Ribisi must be credited for his character's emotional role especially in the church seen when he talks about his mother.Now to the violence, people I was 13 when I saw this film. Do your self a favor if you are a parent, if your child is under 13 do not let them watch it. There are even worse violent movies such as The Thing. But the difference in this movie is that what happens to the soldiers more than likely really happened to them, mostly the beginning on Omaha Beach. I, personally, think the violence was completely necessary because we needed to show what our soldiers fought for and what they gave in order for us to live on as the ruling country of the world. God-bless America and it's men.The language in the film is quite foul, but hey what would you be saying if you were being shot at by 20-cals? I also think the swears were necessary. Why? Well, I believe that swears bring out emotion and how you feel about situations you are in. I mean don't get me wrong if your child swears, by all means put soap in his mouth or whatever you do. But in movies, swears give us an understanding about the stand-point of the characters. It's also pretty funny to boot. The jokes in this are hilarious.Anyway, if you are looking for the greatest movie ever made, watch this. Because I don't think I'll ever find a movie close to being as good as this. Thanks to Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and thanks mostly to those who gave their lives to keep us standing strong with the freedom we have rightfully earned. You will not be forgotten, ever.

","genre":"Action, Drama, War"},{"date":"21 April 2009","score":"","review":" As the boys went off to to fight in the second World War, Harvey Candy Bar owner Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall) decides to create an all-women baseball league.Two players recruited are two farm girls, sisters from Iowa who are in the middle of a sibling rivalry. You have Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis), who the movie centers around as the movie is shown as a flashback of her memories of the days playing in the league, and her younger sister, Kit Keller (Lori Petty), who is unmarried and is overshadowed by her sister in the local softball league.The two are signed to the Rockford Peaches, which is lead by a down-and-out former Major Leaguer (Tom Hanks), whose drinking problem not only destroyed his career, but his knee as well when he jumped from a hotel window to escape a fire he accidentally started in a drinking binge.Despite the problems with the manager, and the initial negative comments from the league's critics and fans who mocked the ladies, the Peaches and the three other teams quickly gained their supporters. They also became another family for each other, giving each other support not only on the field, but in their personal lives like when one of the Peaches got the word from the government that her husband was killed in action.However, that sibling rivalry comes back to haunt Dottie, who the media has flocked around. Especially when, thanks to a miscommunication between team owners and her sister, Kit is traded to the Racine Belles.This movie is a fictionalized story on the creation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was created in 1943 by Phil Wrigley, the man behind many popular gum brands and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. It uses the names of the original four teams of the league, but plays with the history of the league's first season.The movie begins by focusing on Dottie, who is preparing for the league's induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. When the movie flashes back, it focuses on the Peaches from her point of view. And this is done pretty well.We get to meet some interesting cast of characters on the Peaches, including manager Jimmy Dugan (Hanks), former strip club bouncer (her father owned the club) Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell) and All-the-Way Mae Mordabito (Madonna). Now, the only problem with having so many characters is that we never get them fully developed. You get to know a little background on these characters, and see their personalities. But, in my opinion, focusing on everybody was just a little too much. I could not connect with any of the girls, which was needed to feel for one when her life is changed by the war forever.What this movie does right is put together a really good cast. Davis and Petty really made you feel as if they were having a sibling competition with one being athletically superior to the other. Hanks was wonderful as the down-and-out manager who eventually realizes that these girls want what he couldn't have thanks to his drinking problem -- a championship. In fact, the entire fictional Peaches team were all good in their own way.There were three pairings of actors that I loved to watch when they were on screen together. Like I said earlier, Petty and Davis were great as sibling rivals. Davis was also great when paired up against Hanks, and have one of the best comedic scenes when the two have a battle of signals to the batter. Then there was O'Donnell and Madonna, who I wish who had more scenes together. If you ask me those two were the best comedic duo in the cast.Another thing that this film does great is the game action. From a production point of view, many of the plays were staged so they could get the shot. What else made these scenes wonderful was that the majority of the cast (one person had an on-field double) was actually playing. There is one scene where one of the Peaches is having her thigh iced. This particular scene was pretty much unscripted as that injury was legitimate (and one of the nastiest bruises I've seen).The wardrobes for everybody is done very well in this movie. In fact, they appear to be authentic right down to the tiniest stitch.Penny Marshall, who hired not only her brother as the founder of the league, but other cast members from her popular television series Laverne and Shirley (at least two regular cast members from the series appear in the movie), did a good job in the director's seat. She set up every shot nicely, especially the ones during games.One thing that I wasn't really into was the music. I usually don't pay direct attention to the music, although I subconsciously notice it when used to enhance the scene. In this movie, I couldn't tell you any scene where the music helped the mood. In fact, the only piece of music I clearly recall is the song sung by Madonna that was played as the closing credits began to roll.I can't say that this movie hit a Grand Slam home run, but it wasn't a balk or strikeout either. It's a good movie to add to your To Rent list if you ask me.

Now we all know that this is not always true, on either side.

Now, don't you think I ought to remember who I slept with last night, and what color underwear she was wearing? If she wore any at all? The fool in this movie falls for this trick and makes up a lie about the underwear being his sister's. That part was ridiculous.Now, are most men still this stupid? Are they still stupid enough to bring other women into their homes, which they may share with their wives or girlfriends? Have they not seen How to be a player? Did they not all learn that you do NOT bring the sidepiece to the home? Did they not learn that you have to be discreet? The fool apparently didn't.The other thing is, why confront me about something I didn't do?

I found a lot of fault with this movie. Early in the movie, Shante says that if men acted right, women would give them all the love and respect they deserved. Please! Now we all know that this is not always true, on either side. A person could be as compassionate, considerate, loving, loyal, faithful and respectful as ever, and in return they get nothing but hate, disrespect, and a barrage of blows, physical, verbal and psychological.There is more stupidity throughout the film. There is the scene where her friend has a man who is cheating. This is where Shante advises women to plant an underwear somewhere and confront the man with this evidence. Now, don't you think I ought to remember who I slept with last night, and what color underwear she was wearing? If she wore any at all? The fool in this movie falls for this trick and makes up a lie about the underwear being his sister's. That part was ridiculous.Now, are most men still this stupid? Are they still stupid enough to bring other women into their homes, which they may share with their wives or girlfriends? Have they not seen How to be a player? Did they not all learn that you do NOT bring the sidepiece to the home? Did they not learn that you have to be discreet?

The film follows five friends in their twenties and we observe the characters' lifestyle over a weekend period. All of the characters live tedious lives during the week and use the weekend as an opportunity to escape their misery. The group of friends includes Jip (John Simm) who is sexually paranoid. Koop (Shaun Parkes) is suspicious of his girlfriend cheating on him. Lulu (Lorraine Pilkington) is fed up with men following a number of bad relationships. Nina (Nicola Reynolds) is eager to introduce her seventeen year old brother to drugs and Moff (Danny Dyer) is unemployed and dependant on his parents. The characters were well introduced in the opening scenes and as the plot unfolded the story developed their individual traits. All five are very authentic and true to life. Their weekend is not complete without drugs, clubs and parties. I can guarantee you will either know or have met people similar to them, and the five of them have a lot in common which brings them together. The film was written and directed by Justin Kerrigan who is from Cardiff. I can only imagine that the film tells the story of past experience he has gone through. I was very shocked when I discovered this was his first feature length film and even more surprised that he's not done much since. Jip (Simm) is the lead character in this film and he delivers an excellent performance. He has an equal amount of both dialogue and narration. I often feel narration in films is only used because the writer had struggled to put it into dialogue. However, I didn't feel it with this, as the narration from Jipps character felt very real. He constantly had thoughts on his mind and narration worked much better to portray this than the dialogue would have.Human Traffic has a lot of energy in it and has a level of madness which makes the genre a light hearted comedy. I had no idea what direction the film was going in as there were various sub-plots and comedy skits from all five of the characters, which I was very entertained by. The language in the dialogue is very realistic and the actors do a fantastic job as well. My only one complaint is that only one of the main characters actually seemed to be Welsh. The rest of the cast without involving the extras appeared to sound very English. I suppose this is better than them attempting a poor Welsh accent, and maybe they deliberately used English actors to make English people relate to. Alternatively, they probably couldn't find any Welsh actors that suited the role. This isn't something I'd recommend to everyone as it doesn't have a wide target audience. I would suggest young people who experienced the club culture especially in the 90s in Britain would be particularly attracted to this film. However, I was very entertained by it and I could relate to the characters very well. Human Traffic is however a post-modern film and what I enjoyed the most was the authenticity and hilarity.

They are not simply stoic action figures, nor are they a wisecracking Mamet- or Tarantino-ized set of partners in crime. They are a distillation of greed and its adoption of senseless violence. They are completely self-driven, greedy, senseless and content to be so, yet we invest ourselves in following them as protagonists because we identify with their feelings of basic need Survival, thus money, thus violence. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie doesn't even bother to make any effort whatsoever to ingratiate them to us, but in fact the very opposite. We don't want your forgiveness. We don't want your absolution. We will not accept your natural order.There is an obvious but charming symbolic counterpoint to the two main characters in the implicit bond of the bodyguards played by Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt. We are given just as omniscient a probing of these two as of Phillippe and Del Toro, only they seem to come from more affluent society. They may have a more affected look and vernacular (spare though it may be) than the two thugs they mean to dispatch, but they suggest that the troublemaking self-preservation gene is innate. Which pair overpowers the other is a matter of who has less to lose. The result of their actions, and their crossing paths, is an Old West lifestyle wreaking havoc on the modern day. Joe Kraemer's mostly percussive score evokes such a setting. There's even a climactic shootout at a brothel in Mexico.Scott Wilson plays a wealthy man who has made a complacent agreement with his dark side and an underworld economy to afford a comfortable home with a family, no matter how artificial that family may be. Really, it seems no one truly cares about whether or not his unborn adoptive daughter's surrogate mother, played with a persuasive necessity by Juliette Lewis, lives or dies, as long as the baby she carries lives, at least for as long as any one of them feels they need it. Only do Diggs and Katt persist in salvaging Lewis and the baby directly, because it is their job, and the kidnappers Phillippe and Del Toro shot at them. Christopher McQuarrie's exceedingly interesting buried gem, freely sprinkled with the blackest of humor, is permeated with an existential lack of cognitive dissonance on the part of any of his characters. How are the two lead characters morally superior to any other character, or perhaps even equivalent? Why do we concentrate on their intentions? Because they're the ones the movie happens to follow, because they are an unadorned version of what the rest of them are who have put on or been endowed with airs.What does all this mean? Why should we care about the baby due Scott Wilson and his wife named Francesca, who isn't even faithful? She sits comfortably in a high-tech room in her lavish digs as everyone else puts themselves on the line for the baby she's not even having herself. Well, they don't see it that way. Things may work out for her, but not because they care about her or her child by proxy. They have their own needs in line with hers, almost like karma is holding the door for her. Karma's only justice without the satisfaction, muses an older, craggier James Caan, whose character seems to have fully mastered the lifestyle intended by the story's said opposing duos, but only ever seen to anyone else as the bag man. This princess in the castle may not even be touched by the incidents that take place in her favor, but Isn't it how it is, Phillippe laments for more inscrutable reasons.

These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor. It's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when I was 9, has stayed with me to this day. I'm about to explain why.I don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble Zemeckis assembled for this film. Sally Field will always be Mrs. Gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. An Oscar-nominated Gary Sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man Lt. Dan who comes to learn from Forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. Robin Wright Penn is heartbreaking as Forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to Forrest's, and Mykelti Williamson also gives a very touching turn as Bubba, the African-American young man with a heart of gold who becomes Forrest's best friend in Vietnam.But at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, I daresay the acting masterclass Tom Hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting I have ever witnessed. No other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as Hanks does here. Every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his Southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. In the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see Tom Hanks, you see Forrest Gump. Utter perfection.Many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in Eric Roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods Zemeckis deploys here. While we watch Forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see Jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the Vietnam War, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration Forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. When we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. The unconventional methods Zemeckis uses in telling Forrest's story enhance this &#x96; in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of Tom Hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel.Another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s.Forrest Gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. It's a rollicking tapestry of American history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director.

This one was not written by King, but despite this lack of originality it is a fairly good sequel to an excellent movie.The mood is dark, just not as dark as the first film. We have Geoff and his veterinarian dad relocating to rural Maine (and the location of the Pet Sematary) after Geoff's mom is accidentally killed in front of him while shooting a movie. In their new small town, Geoff's dad opens up his own practice while Geoff has trouble adjusting to his surroundings. He befriends another outcast, Drew, who has an abusive stepfather named Gus to deal with at home. One night, out of meanness, Gus shoots and kills Drew's loyal dog Zowie. Drew then gets Geoff to help him bury Zowie in the notorious cemetery in hopes of bringing his dog back to life. It comes back, just different, mean and nasty, like it's mad about being resurrected and now hates everything and everyone (like all things brought back to life in the cemetery act). This starts off a chain of events that leads to the destruction of the lives of everyone involved (and some who aren't involved incidentally). Now its just a matter of who can survive the supernatural terror engulfing the town. The storyline is fun and the acting is good enough. The gore and other special effects are great.I can easily look past the bad points in a film and see the good in it. This film is like that for me. The film also posses qualities that make me automatically like it. It is an underdog film (meaning it's not very popular with most people on this site).

His dialogue is energetic, his camera forcing itself upon us like a rapist. His films have a sense of immediacy, an accessible sort of pleasure, the audience getting caught up in the sheer manliness of his storytelling. In Wall Street characters battle one another over the phone, the lights dim dramatically when deals are closed and enemies face off in Times Square, thunder clouds rumbling ominously above them. With Stone, everything is as direct and forceful as possible. Watching an Oliver Stone picture is like being raped by a big bully. Something its fun, sometimes its disgusting, always its as direct and quick as possible.But the irony of Wall Street is that Stone forces a morality tale down our throats which he clearly doesn't believe in. Wall Street is about a young stock broker called Bud Fox who idolizes a powerful businessman called Gordon Gekko. Gekko represents the sheer joy of ruthless capitalism, and Fox aspires to be just like him. After all, Gekko's power and wealth are seductive and Fox is nothing but a naïve young man. Who can blame the kid? And so, like Platoon, Wall Street is a meditation on the dilemma of a son choosing his father. Will Bud emulate his simple blue-collar father or the charming Gordon Gekko? Fox chooses Gekko, of course, but eventually learns that Gekko is really a soulless monster who destroys family bonds and greedily preys on the weak. Fox thus fights against Gekko and makes him lose millions on a company. At the end of the film, the multi-billionaire Gordon Gekko takes a minor financial loss (it is left ambiguous as to whether he is arrested) whilst Fox goes to jail. The film implies that Fox does the noble thing in challenging Gekko, in choosing his roots and family over capitalist greed, but in reality it says something else.Stone loves Gekko. Stone loves Gekko's far-reaching power, his disregard for morality, the sheer size of his boundless penis. Stone has the same hard-on for Gordon Gekko that he does for Tony Montana in his Scarface screenplay. These are tough, masculine characters who literally give Stone a hard-on. They see what they want and they take it. It's no coincidence that Stone's filmography is obsessed with powerful figures like Alexander, Nixon and Bush. He loves power, even as he pays half-baked lip service to the way it corrupts. And of course the audience loves Gordon Gekko too. He may be named after a lizard, but Gekko is one of the most seductive businessmen in all of cinema.But it's hypocritical for the film to feign condemnation when its very aesthetics align itself firmly with Gekko. Capitalism cannot be fought, it says, don't try to fight it or you will get burnt. Better to stay a country hillbilly like Bud Fox's family and leave money to those willing to lose their souls. What the film really does is present a false choice, highlighting the ideological cynicism that modern man is currently duped by. The formula for describing the operation of ideology today is not, as Marx said, they do not know it, but they are doing it but the modern reinterpretation, they know it, but they are doing it anyway. We know the truth of capitalist greed, but, insulated by our moral aloofness, participate anyway. Any successful ideology always allows its subjects to have and to cherish a conscious distance towards its ideals and prescriptions. And so the film pretends to be an indictment, but in reality is a giant boner for capitalist greed. Condemning the system makes us feel morally better about ourselves, but we know that were we to stand up, we'd be ostracized and jailed like our buddy Bud Fox. Ideology serves a cynical function now, giving us a Big Other to participate in, making us feel ethically better about ourselves, all the while knowing that we're only interested in protecting our own personal piece of the pie. So in a sense, Wall Street is like one of those fair trade Starbucks advertisements stating that their exploited workers over in India receive adequate compensation. We know the truth but participate anyway because the coffee tastes damn good. We pay lip service to the moral righteousness of Bud Fox, but idolize the success of Gordon Gekko.A more interesting film is Boiler Room. Whilst Oliver Stone tried to imbue his film with a sense of the negative consequences of naked pursuit, Boiler Room illuminates how young wannabe Gekko's have interpreted Wall Street as an invitation to achieve their own visions of success. It's a less cinematic film, but far more interesting.8\/10 &#x96; We've seen this story a hundred times before, but it's the sheer masculinity of Stone's film which makes it appealing, particularly to young men. Critics have pointed out how lifeless, how pointless, the Daryl Hannah character is (notice that Bud Fox's mother is absent too) and Stone too has admitted that he handled the film's female characters badly. But isn't her emptiness, her almost invisible presence, acting and direction, symptomatic of the very worthlessness of the film? While Brian De Palma treats Michelle Pffifer as a used sex object in Scarface, Stone completely ignores Hannah in Wall Street. She barely registers. She's a piece of furniture, a worthless character who gets in the way of his male posturing and giant financial libido.Worth two viewings. The film is slick and fun but Roger and Me and Boiler Room are far more substantial.

Condemning the system makes us feel morally better about ourselves, but we know that were we to stand up, we'd be ostracized and jailed like our buddy Bud Fox. Ideology serves a cynical function now, giving us a Big Other to participate in, making us feel ethically better about ourselves, all the while knowing that we're only interested in protecting our own personal piece of the pie. So in a sense, Wall Street is like one of those fair trade Starbucks advertisements stating that their exploited workers over in India receive adequate compensation. We know the truth but participate anyway because the coffee tastes damn good. We pay lip service to the moral righteousness of Bud Fox, but idolize the success of Gordon Gekko.A more interesting film is Boiler Room. Whilst Oliver Stone tried to imbue his film with a sense of the negative consequences of naked pursuit, Boiler Room illuminates how young wannabe Gekko's have interpreted Wall Street as an invitation to achieve their own visions of success. It's a less cinematic film, but far more interesting.8\/10 &#x96; We've seen this story a hundred times before, but it's the sheer masculinity of Stone's film which makes it appealing, particularly to young men. Critics have pointed out how lifeless, how pointless, the Daryl Hannah character is (notice that Bud Fox's mother is absent too) and Stone too has admitted that he handled the film's female characters badly. But isn't her emptiness, her almost invisible presence, acting and direction, symptomatic of the very worthlessness of the film? While Brian De Palma treats Michelle Pffifer as a used sex object in Scarface, Stone completely ignores Hannah in Wall Street. She barely registers. She's a piece of furniture, a worthless character who gets in the way of his male posturing and giant financial libido.Worth two viewings. The film is slick and fun but Roger and Me and Boiler Room are far more substantial.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"21 April 2009","score":"","review":" Welcome to the high-flying stock-trading world of Wall Street as seen through the eyes of Oliver Stone. The Oscar-winning Platoon director's Charlie Sheen follow-up is not so much an insider (please excuse the pun) look at the stock market, but the journey of a young stockbroker through the joys and perils of getting rich the dirty way-- and then ultimately the consequences.The protagonist is Bud Fox (Sheen) who dreams of being a big player in the market one day. He sparks that dream by bagging a rich investor named Gordon Gekko (Douglas), who is so impressed by Fox's persistence and advice that he takes him under his wing and makes him a ton of cash. Although Fox has to get over the slightly obvious illegal hump of sure-money investments, it's not long before he climbs his way to the top and he begins to think differently (and corruptly) about the world.This is a film about the delusion of wealth and the corruption it breeds, about how making money and staying true to certain convictions don't usually go hand and hand -- as Fox learns the hard way when he enlists Gekko's help to turn around his father's employer, an airline company (certainly amusing in a 21st century context).Wall Street boasts an iconic performance by Michael Douglas as Gekko. He really milks the part for what it is, getting to be sleazy, arrogant and spouting off advice like every word is gold. It's really the role that launched him into more serious roles. He certainly keeps the film's intensity up when all the stock jargon can really drag it down to the average viewer. Naturally, people who understand the market better will have more invested (yep, that's two) in Wall Street and like it better. Still, it tells a story that Americans need to hear as a reminder of arrogance of democracy and how if we're not careful, we can fall down the same slippery slopes. If nothing else, the age old idea of money not buying happiness is reinforced.
