[{"date":"23 August 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Promoted to a new station for managing to capture an enemy post single handedly, Captain John Boyd finds himself in a strange outpost where nothing much happens. So when a stranger is found near-starved near the post they listen to his tale of being trapped and running out of food with a group. He tells of how they started to eat the dead before others starting killing for more food and he fled. The men at the command decide to return to the place Colqhorn told them about and rescue\/arrest the other survivors. However it quickly becomes apparent that Colqhorn has not told them the whole truth.When I taped this film I knew very little about it and expected a sort of horror movie with blood through it however I was thrown a little bit when the usual 'meaningful quote' was thrown up to set a serious mood but then a second quote popped up complete with comedy sound effect. This strange mix of tone continued through the whole film and it made it a bit difficult to work out what it wanted me to do. At one point it is close to thrilling as Colqhorn reveals himself for what he is and starts a chase through the woods, but the film uses a fast paced banjo music that makes the scene feel more like a Cajun version of Benny Hill than it does a violent chase. Despite this though it is interesting as a curio if not a great film in its own right with the gore appealing to those that like that sort of thing, the dark humour appealing to others and the silly but twisty plot appealing to others.For me I didn't feel any one element of the film really worked that well but that it was still worth seeing. Production wise the film is better than it deserves &#150; it looks great, the sets look real, the locations are good and things like costume etc all come together. Bird's direction was good but it is just a shame that somebody couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be &#150; even the IMDb listing for genre shows that it is listed as at least 6 different genres. It just about works but the comic touch rather undermines the horror of the story and by the end it is neither hilarious nor scary and has gore for gore's sake. The cast make what they can of it but even they seem unsure of whether this is a comedy or not. Pierce is a good leading man and has presence, playing it straight and to the core of the darkness of the subject. However Jeffrey Jones thinks he is in a tongue in cheek dark comedy and for most of it plays his role with a comic touch. Bird regular Carlyle is better, flitting between the horror and the comic rather well &#150; if only the material had given him more help in this matter. The support cast is mostly wasted (in more than one sense of the word) but the list of well-known faces is impressive; you may not know all their names but you will recognise Spencer, Davies, Arquette, McDonough and Spinella.The gore will appeal to teenage boys; the dark humour will appeal to sickos like me; the cast will appeal to many and the film generally is worth seeing once because it is such a curious little piece. However it isn't that good and the mix of tones doesn't sit very well, giving the impression that nobody knew what they wanted it to be but it was watchable if not worthy of a repeat viewing.

She always strikes me as a drab looking little creature--notwithstanding a certain amount of charm--but nonetheless not a movie star I really care about. On the other hand, JAMES STEWART is terrific here. His restrained skill in romantic comedy is never put to better use than he does with the role as the love-smitten clerk who doesn't realize the girl he works with is sharing his pen pal letters.I had trouble with the clunky screenplay that veered off in the direction of dramatics at unexpected moments--pertaining to the Frank Morgan character. And the Joseph Schildkraut character comes across as a complete puzzlement--never adequately motivated or explained by the script.Frankly, I much prefer both musical versions that I've seen. And YOU'VE GOT MAIL wasn't bad either. At least the musicals played both leading roles for comic effect. Here Sullavan is much too earnest and plain to be appealing in the role.Of course I know this film has its admirers and they're all probably shaking their heads in disbelief at my review. But this is my impression of the film after hearing about it for years. The chief asset is James Stewart's effortless performance and Felix Bressart adding a great deal of warmth as a fellow clerk who avoids offering an opinion to the boss. Frank Morgan is not as lovable as usual in an ill conceived role and William Tracy is completely over the top as an ambitious errand boy promoted to clerk.Summing up Could have been so much better since it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch who was supposed to have that touch with comedy.
