This brings the possibility of many possible wily antics- that could have, if done correctly- in this case AT ALL made an overall better, more enjoyable film. Of course, this was pg-13, so although I said I liked it at 8, it has only nostalgic momentum with little to no replay value with me- today. Too bad huh, they (hollywood execs) make it pg-13 so they can appeal to a larger crowd, but in the longrun- it ends up appealing to no crowd.

Also, to those who said Civil War films usually do not do well, dude!, I say, The movie is about the American Revolution, dude!Anyhow, getting back on track here, I was very impressed with this film. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin have out done themselves.  They've opened the playing field for Centropolis Entertainment by doing something outside the realm of Sci-Fi.  The cinematography was just beautiful, the cast was right on, and altogether, the film makes you loose track of time.  That was 3 hours?  No way!  I heard some people of my generation outside the theater say that the movie was too long.  The people of my generation have a short attention span, folks.

She didn't get too much film time in The Patriot, but she will, and it will be worth it!Brief description  As I'm sure you all know by now, Mel Gibson plays Ben a widower and a father of 6 or 7 children living in South Carolina in 1776. He used to be a Red Coat, but has since then retired due to a dark secret plaguing him.  Despite Ben's vocalized opposition to war, his oldest son Gabriel, played by Heath Ledger, defies his father's demands and joins the war against England.  After many tragedies suffered by Ben's family in this time of war, he joins his son in the war to protect him.  Although I wish to stop here and not give you the entire film, I will tell film is more than just about Ben and Gabriel.  The movie runs much deeper than that.  I will leave you to find your own truths.To sum up  Good script, good acting, and good time!  Any one who even remotely enjoys films, should see this one.  Don't wait for video.

Indeed, all that money can buy has been generously bestowed on it and, if you are willing to disregard certain things, you will probably spend a good evening. But certain things simply cannot be ignored.The problem, as others have said, is one of historical truthfulness. Not that one should be too pedantic about the details history  I see nothing inherently wrong in inventing characters and refashioning events, when this is well-done. What, however, is wrong, very wrong, is to accuse people of the past of crimes they did not commit. Nobody will dispute that there is a streak of ruthlessness in the British character and that, during the American Revolution, history records many instances of confiscation, looting and destruction of insurgentsÕ property by British troops, as well as hangings of people actively involved in the patriotic cause. At the same time, that ruthlessness had limits and to suggest that  atrocities such as those described in the latter part of the film (systematic slaughter of innocent civilians, including the entire population of a village) could have been been perpetrated by British officers, let alone condoned, if only tacitly, by Lord Cornwallis, is a calculated insult to a great nation to which America owes its deepest cultural roots and which remains one of its closest allies. Furthermore, in the film, those scenes of atrocities are utterly useless, for, already within three minutes of his first appearance, Tavington has done more than enough (and within the limits of the harsh rules of war as they were understood at the time) to fuel Ben MartinÕs spirit of revenge for the rest of the film - and a spinoff TV series, if they care to make one.Another major problem with THE PATRIOT relates to the rather dubious brand of patriotism which it preaches. Once upon a time, Hollywood knew how to make films celebrating the love of America in such a way as to infectiously communicate it to millions throughout the world. Think of such fine productions as SERGEANT YORK, ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, among numerous others. Alas, it seems that the recipe has since been lost and that the only forms of expression of patriotism known to contemporary American movie studios are loud, vulgar and unimaginative. Truly, there must be more subtle ways to advertise the love of the US than to wave the Star-Spangled Banner to the sound of blaring fanfares over and over again!...The most questionable aspect of that newfangled patriotism is its utter insensitivity to the feelings of people of other nations, whose lives are presented as expendable (think of the many tasteless jokes about redcoat-killing in THE PATRIOT...), whereas American lives are treated as sacred and infinitely precious - as if only Americans were fully human... Such a view is both offensive and morally repulsive. I suggest that American movie producers make it a priority to look for ways more respectful of human dignity to enhance a national patriotism which can otherwise be so admirable, and especially for the way in which it succeeds in transcending ethnic and racial differences.PS For the record  Lord Cornwallis was not an elderly military genius, as depicted in the film, but a YOUNG man (born in 1738, he was not yet 43 when he surrendered at Yorktown...), who owed his position more to his birth than to his professional competence, as well as a liberal gentleman who, in subsequent years, did much for the advancement of the civil rights of Irish Catholics (THAT should be of some interest to Mr. Gibson!)

Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThere was a time,when I was much younger of course,when I thought Masters Of The Universe was probably the best film Dolph Lundgren could possibly make,and enthusiastically added it to my collection of his films,as I've always thought him superior to Jean Claude Van Damme,despite the latter being more succesful in terms of box office take-in.However,having watched it again last night,I now consider it to be a pretty fundamentally empty film.For what's meant to be a sort of children's based Sci-Fi fantasy ,it would have been good for Mr.Lundgren early in his career to have such a film to back up his CV with.But this film only revels in itself to be 'the most violent family film ever made'.With 101 minutes in which to convey itself,I would have thought some new and original magic could be sparked from it.But this film is just a particularly empty,rather soulless mess.The colourful combination of the good guys and

Can you imagine Chaplin's 'Gold Rush' or 'Modern Times' being out of circulation? No. Well, this is a better overall film than anything Chaplin ever put out and mawkishly undermined with sentimentality, but only film buffs  who go to rare screenings get to see it. It is not so much a laugh riot like Chaplin's best bits as it is extremely clever, to the point of being transcendent. Its tone reminds me very much of Jean Renoir's 1939 'Rules of the Game,' and Bunuel's comedies, although it doesn't have Bunuel's 'cruelty' (as master critic Andre Bazin would put it).  It is just a work of art which most 'non-artsy' people will dismiss as 'just another clever comedy' because works of art annoy them (and they don't see why they should be bothered with applying the energy needed to understand them), while 'artsy' people will overrate it, and rightly so. Overrated or not, Lubitch's film is a joy to behold; you are glad it exists. As you're watching, you know you're being hit with valuable not-necessarily verbal information left and right. You know it's worth reseeing many times because you will get a different blend of perspectives from it everytime (much like a great piece of music).

But, as it is, nobody'll get to see it anyway because it's not out on video, so what the hell am I writing for?

Of the three films preceeding this one my favourite was 'Mallrats', however Mallrats' place on the throne as king of the 'view askewniverse' was anything but secure. I was planning to see 'Dogma' on boxing day, but having been struck with Christmas fever I decided not to join my friends and fellow Kev lovers. That night my friend phoned me to nicely inform me how stupid I had been and how fantastic 'Dogma' was. I was bitterly disappointed and decided to see it the very next day. My friend held it in such high regard he joined me regardless of only seeing it less than 24 hours previous. To my joy I found he was absolutely right. 'Dogma' was an absolute joy to watch. It was the true ruler of the 'view askewniverse', but puns aside this became my favourite of all Kevin's movies. It has so much going for it. Kevin is such a funny man, true most of the jokes in this film include a lot of 'naughty words' but what most people do not realise is THEY ARE STILL VERY VERY VERY FUNNY.If you have ever seen one of his films, you will know how rib splittingly, gut bustingly funny Jay and Silent Bob, the New Jersey stoners are. I can honestly say, they are at their absolute best in this their fourth movie. Jay has never been so funny, you may say this is down to Kev's script and this may be partially true but Jason Mewes has never acted so well, looked so funny and deserves a lot of credit. The best part of watching this film for a second time, is concentrating on Silent Bob even when the focus is supposed to be on somebody else because he is always doing something funny, pulling a face as somebody says something with strong sexual content or doing something with arms, you guarantee he will be doing something. This is different to his other performances, not to say they were not funny, they were very funny, but this is a fresh alternative. Watching this will help highlight how much of a comic talent this man really is.Other highlights of this piece were Ben Affleck, someone I have always been a fan of especially in 'Chasing Amy', who was excellent in this film, he really is a fabulous actor in my opinion. I was also surprised by Matt Damon, a man I have never liked but one who was very sharp in this, after seeing this I was eager to see more of Mr Damon's work and he certainly is impressive. But the master stroke was making the leg quiveringly exquisite Salma Hayek a muse turn exotic dancer, a part she showed a talent for in Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Til Dawn'. Certainly a key scene in this film is her opener. I find it hard to take my eyes off her during this film and she also plays a very entertaining role.Full marks to Mr Smith, he has done it again. He may not have a huge following but he certainly warrants one. This was his most successful cinema outing and deserves to be. People criticise it for it's unholy content, but it has to be said, this is pathetic. It is closer to anti-freeze than anti-christ, and those who protested against it wanted nothing more than a little publicity.

I loved the show as a kid, and still can recite many lines from various characters and skits. I also am fond of the human cast here, and I admire them.Alas, I was a bit disappointed with Rocky & Bullwinkle. It wasn't bad-- in fact at almost any given moment in the movie I would be hard pressed to actually identify a flaw. Looked at in tiny little portions, it was virtually right on and almost perfect as a rendition. But pasted together-- it was slow. It never quite took flight. True, the original series was a brain thing, and not a visual fest, nor a high energy, MTV-like barrage (which didn't exist back in 1960-64 anyway). The original show celebrated its bad animation as an art form, made self-observational criticism, and much of the humor was cerebral, including puns so bad they were extra funny-- So the new movie's many attempts to droll up were noticed and appreciated. Much of that spirit was at least sought, if not actually conveyed. Thus the movie comes across as earnest and good natured. But overall, I must say the total vibe of the original show-- the engrossing entertainment of it-- was missed.

It is true that, in the late 2nd century of our era, there was a wise Roman philosopher-emperor named Marcus Aurelius whom the unfortunate circumstances of his time forced to wage incessant wars on Germanic tribes and that, after his death, near the front, he was succeeded by his son Commodus, a madman who fancied himself the incarnation of Hercules and often performed in the arena. But the connection stops there, and that is a pity, for the true facts of CommodusÕ reign, which lasted some 15 years (A.D. 177-192), would probably have made a much better story than what we have here.As for Maximus, he is a pure invention. The only character by that name in that period of Roman imperial history is the young son and heir of the short-lived emperor Maximinus Thrax (A.D. 235-238). There are, it is true, some similarities between the career of that Maximinus and that the fictional Maximus, for Maximinus was both some kind of a muscle-man and a good general, who won many victories on the German front. However, when you read more about him, you also find out that he was also a brutal tyrant who enjoyed killing large number of people, when he was not busy dispatching bulls with his bare hands - his favourite past-time... (I could never quite understand why Hollywood feels the need to change the facts of history when they are so sensational!)Tons of money were poured into the making of GLADIATOR, and one wishes that the producers would have made better use of those resources. The sets are impressive, but hardly accurate - except for the reconstruction of the Colosseum, which corresponds more or less to the current scholarly consensus on what that extraordinary building looked like. (Notice the awnings on the top-tier. Their purpose was to provide shade to the audience. It is only recently that scholars have begun to work out the complex details of their structure and operation.) But the Roman skyline, full of elegant fluted domes, is all wrong. That is the skyline of SEVENTEENTH CENTURY Rome, as rebuilt by the Renaissance popes and their successors. In ancient Rome, the only large domed building was the Pantheon,  which survives, and it did not at all look like that. Also, as anyone who has been there will tell you, Rome is located in hilly, not mountainous, country.They also botched their Marcus Aurelius. Richard Harris is a fine actor, but a bit old for the part and there is a big problem with his hair, which is long and straight, whereas the hair of Marcus Aurelius, whose features immortalized on his coins are familiar to anyone who knows anything about Roman history, was short and curly. That may sound like an insignificant detail, but it would be like making a film of the life of Adolf Hitler and forget the moustache... For a spitting image of Marcus Aurelius, check Alec Guinness in THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.In my opinion, the best, and perhaps only true good, moment in GLADIATOR is the impressive opening sequence, a graphic illustration of the kind of ruthless and savage campaigns which the Roman emperors of the period had to wage over and over again to stem the barbarian tide on their Danubian border.The rest of the movie is only slightly better than mediocre, with Derek Jacobi looking like if he were a guilty man, very embarrassed to be there and very anxious to take his money and run. I am sure that many people will disagree with that harsh assessment, for this film has clearly been designed as an audience-pleaser.To those interested in more than well-packaged trash, I suggest to go to the nearest video store and rent a copy of Stanley KubrickÕs SPARTACUS, a vastly superior gladiator film, and one that will give you a remarkably accurate sense of the greatness that was Rome, Çan eternal thought in the mind of GodÈ.

Using some computer generated shots as well as a cast of extremely talented actors, Scott beautifully creates a fictional story that shows the start of Rome's eventual downfall.  I don't know too much about the history of Rome, but I didn't need to in order to enjoy this five star movie.  Despite all the action and bloodshed, the humanistic issues are what bring this movie above any Hollywood anti-hype it would otherwise get.There wasn't much to this movie that I didn't like.  Graphically, there were some great matte scenes of the city and the bird's-eye view of the opening battles added to the war-like feel of the movie (however this scene reminded me a little too much of the Gungans- Droids scene in Phantom Menace).  All the gladiator battle sequences were great- brilliantly choreographed and superb in cinematography.  The shots were rapid fire, not allowing the viewer to focus on any one image for an extensive amount of time, but slowing down before the victory.  Thus, the movie felt like it was more action packed, albeit bloody.  The themes of the movie, Strength and Honor, were always in my mind and reinforced the concept of the tragic heroism of Maximus.  Maximus wouldn't be a martyr, nor would Commodus have him that way, so the element of tragic heroism overshadows the movie. Because of this feeling and the intense acting that Russell Crowe puts into his character, the closing scene was extremely moving, almost bringing tears to my eyes.  Adding to the emotion is excellent scoring by Klaus Badelt, Lisa Gerrard, and Hans Zimmer.  The classical music gives movement to the slow scenes as well as the fast paced battles, yet doesn't detract from the story itself.  Maximus deals with human issues such as death, honesty and trust, and loyalty to a cause he believed in.  Gladiator was probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while and although it is rather gory with several heads getting sliced off and a lot of bloodshed, the movie as a whole comes through as something that is definitely worthwhile seeing.  It probably wouldn't surprise me if some Oscar nominations are given to this movie, either to Crowe or Phoenix, but that won't be for another year. Definitely a must-see movie.

Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - this is not an exact science) he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"1 July 2000","score":"531 out of 568 people found the following review useful","review":"  An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case.  He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - this is not an exact science) he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case.

But instead, mid-way through the production, the filmmakers decided that Jefferey Wright's Peoples Hernandez was a more interesting villain (they are right) but they then reduce Bale to a minor part,(eliminating an end scene which was a key to why Bale chose the part)  Bale's reduction is espcially disappointing because they easilly could have worked out a sort of partnership between the two villains. They even suggest it in the film, but never followed up on it. This leaves a week plot which gives Jackson nothing much to do other then ask a lady bartender if she wants the L.D. However much worse then anything I've mentioned so far is the completely idiotic and unsatisfying ending which looked like it was thrown together quickly so Singleton could get this crap done with as soon as possible.

As a lover of old films and literature, not, but far from today's mainstream. That's why my opinion of this movie is different than most. Everbody talked about (and awarded) the art direction, visuals, style etc. But even though I was as mesmerized as anyone with how the film looked, how it looked wasn't what caused me to truly love this film, which I do.The reason is that looks aren't everything. That is, the director succeded excellently with the extremely stylish\/satirical film, Edward Scissorshands; but when I heard Burton was making Sleepy Hallow I thought, Hmmmmm... here's going to be a challenge. For this is a classic 19th century horror tale, therefore traditional methods of approach and application are necessary to accomplish respect for the story and attitudes of the period. In fact, the real satire here is reading the opinions of idiots who went to see Scissorshands II and were disappointed, as if a director should stay true to a narrow form in order to please the narrowminded of his fans.This would be true if the director wasn't capable of broadening. But in Burton's case, he has proven himself quite capable of leaving the cult behind and achieving greater horizons. It's a matter of shedding one's stylistic trappings and allowing the rest of the crew, in this case the writers & actors, to shine. This was done and well to the director's credit.But, there were moments when it was questionable if this was going to be achieved. That's why I frown when repeatedly hearing of the perfect fog effects, set designs etc. We have to pay respect to the director's special talent, but in this film we should also pay respect to how the director has evolved. In Burton's case here, it is a losing of contemporary jadedness\/cynicism and a converse gaining of respect for traditional drama, literature and humane optimism.We may wonder why the story was never before made in to a film? (perhaps it was, but never released) It certainly was worthy of the kind of treatment Yagher and Walker gave it here. On the other side of the muse, however, was a musical soundtrack that lacked the depth of earlier 20th century film compositions. Though Elfman is an extremely talented orchestral composer, one wishes for music more keenly related to Rachmaninoff's deeply subtle chromaticism, from which much of film music is derived. Indeed, the lack of a more deeply Hitchcockian psychological noir\/drama is what keeps this film from reaching higher levels of dramatic quality.The result is a combination of all the beautiful visuals of modern cinematography with a somewhat overly fast moving old English\/New England styled horror\/mystery story. That said, the question remains Do we get the wonderful romantic\/optimistic\/intelligent characters so necessary to this old genre? Yes, we do! But most importantly, do we get the feeling that the detective is an intelligent hero such as Sherlock Holmes? Yes, again! Wonderfully cast, Depp draws us to his intelligence, human imperfections, rebellious\/romantic verve, all the emotions that made the period such a wonderfully important time and place to be a scientific liberal, as in H.G. Wells, Thomas Huxley, Shaw etc. These names are from a later time, but that makes it even more exciting In this story, Ichabod Crane is one of the first! For this was the dawn of the Romantic age, that spawned the great 19th century novel, the detective mystery, and of course Darwin. All of this is about to become the world while the superstition still haunted the age. It seems it was Crane's (Depp's) charge to lead in stamping out the old ignorance while bringing in the new intelligence. Meanwhile, it appears to have been Burton's job to constantly remind us that satanic evil persists; and all the while you're thinking, yes, those stick-like, black & white horror drawings of the period (the Dear Dead Days stuff) is what I love most about Burton's visual personality.All of the great, intricate plotting of a classic mystery was utilized well and Crane\/Depp became the kind of Sherlock Holmes detective hero that makes you want to see a sequel.

Her constant whining voice grated the nerves!  Nolte's accent made Jefferson sound like an ignorant man, rather than a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings on slavery was also underdeveloped, yet his eldest daughter's rebellion (Patsy)is a key event late in the film.  The film was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. On the positive side, the costumes were quite beautiful, and Greta Scacchi played the part of Cosway well.  If you want to watch a film about the revolutionary era and\/or Jefferson, then watch 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.

It's a sad fact about war, bad things are done by both sides and this movie tells you that. The major big battles in this movie really happened and pretty much as this movie shows them too.  The actors portrayals of the characters were a very good performance maybe Mel Gibson's best to date. I really found Tom Wilkinson as General Cornwallis not just excellent, but for the most part historically accurate. His surrender at Yorktown sending his subordinate to surrender his subordinates sword, (I'm not giving the ending away here, that's how it really happened. Read a book!) And the battle fields scenes were so awesome, you could see the terror and bravery of the men on the firing line. You could even see a cannon ball flying around every so often, (the one that came right at the camera made me jump, I was sitting in the center front row, YIKES!!)In conclusion this movie reminds us we need to look at the past to see where the future is going. To quote George Santayana Those who forget the mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them.
