It is the story of a man who triumphs over adversity - pain in his shoulder, etc. - to pitch a last, great game.On the other hand, it's the story of a man who, off the field, becomes involved with a woman who only causes him trouble. She wants him to NEED her, and by the last scene, though he has pitched a perfect game, which is enough to put most men on cloud 9 for the rest of their lives, he tells her that he NEEDS her, they kiss in what is supposed to be a very romantic public kiss, and one imagines that the producers thought that would win over large audiences of middle-aged women.I can't watch this movie as a stereotypical woman - that's not how nature made me. I can only say that, for me, the romance was constantly aggravating, because the protagonist allowed himself to become and remain involved with a woman who constantly wanted him to choose between her and his real passion, baseball.But do many women really expect men to subordinate their non-romantic passions for them and tell them that they NEED them? Not that they love them, which is completely understandable, but that they NEED them? I don't know.So this is what the movie is about, and it keeps going on, and on, and on, with more incidents. The story simply does not merit going on over 2 hours about this.If you're looking for a baseball movie, this is likely to disappoint you. If you're looking for the story of a man who comes to the realization that NEEDING a woman is more important than accomplishing something important in his life, maybe this is for you.

That's true of any war, but this one was different because of the magnitude of new technology. The tank premiered, and made it possible to get across enemy lines into places that soldiers on foot could never go. Most importantly, the motion picture camera, which captured moving images of war for the very first time. It was the first war to have documentation of the actual event and record interviews with survivors who could tell the story of the Hell they endured. All Quiet on the Western Front, like the book,sugarcoats nothing. It charges headlong into battle in an effort to portray a war that was unholy chaos. The soldiers in the film are German but they have American accents. If you took away their uniforms, you'd never know where they hailed from. The movie makes the point that all wars are the same, that war is the same thing over and over and the only thing that changes are the uniforms. Sixty countries were involved in the First World War and they all suffered under the same delusion Young naive boys with wonder in their eyes listened to patriotic speeches in which war was presented as a glorious adventure, that doing one's duty was simply a matter of putting on a beautiful uniform and riding into battle on horseback with a saber flashing in the sun. They soon know the reality that the First World War was a contest of endurance. The film opens in a classroom in Germany where are seated two dozen young men who are being spirited on by a jingoistic teacher who tells pupils You are the life of the Fatherland, you boys -- you are the iron men of Germany. You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy when you are called to do so. It is not for me to suggest that any of you should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads. He concludes boastfully that Sweet and fitting it is to die for the Fatherland. Now our country calls. The Fatherland needs leaders. Personal ambition must be thrown aside in the one great sacrifice for our country. Here is a glorious beginning to your lives. The field of honor calls you. We meet him twice, once at the beginning and again just before the third act. It becomes uncomfortably clear that this man has never set foot on a battlefield. Then again, no one could have understood the magnitude of this war. Recently, there had been The Boar War and the Spanish American War with its romantic tales of glorious battles on horseback with the saber flashing in the sun. No one understood the impact of 20th century warfare, of tanks and bombs and mustard gas.The boys have fantasies about the spoils of war and that's mostly what urges them to join the cause. As they march off to the front, as they fight, as they quickly become disillusioned by the horrors of war they begin to die one by one and their number dwindle. At first, our focus isn't on any one particular soldier but as the body count goes up one soldier, a nice kid named Paul (Lew Ayres) comes into focus. He is more thoughtful than those around him and we see that most especially in one bone-chilling scene in which he finds himself alone in a trench with a French soldier (the first Frenchman he's ever seen) that he has stabbed in the chest. Feeding him water to keep him alive he finds that it doesn't work and as the soldier dies Paul asks his forgiveness and promises to send news of his bravery to the man's wife and daughter when he finds their photograph in the his coat.Paul's growing disdain for the whole mess reaches further than even he can understand. After being wounded he returns home to see his mother and finds that he doesn't fit anymore, that the war has torn something from his soul and that he can't return to his life, therefore that he must return to the battle. During the trip he finds himself back in the classroom where he confronts the professor who inspired his classmates off to war all those years ago. We find the professor again boasting of the glory of battle and the spoils of war to a group of boys who look even younger than Paul and his classmates had been. Urged by the professor to tell the boys about the greatness of fighting for one's country he instead tells them It is dirty and painful to die for your country. When it comes to dying for your country, it is better not to die at all. There are millions out there dying for their country and what good is it?What stays with me about All Quiet on the Western Front are the battle scenes. We see the boys lined up at the trenches, firing out into No Man's Land, not especially at anything but just in case. Then the enemy emerges from the gas clouds, maybe a hundred, maybe a million, charging at the trenches, some are shot dead, some make it to the trench. The boys fire their rifles and machine guns and sometimes they hit something but how could anyone be expected to fight them all off, there are just so many of them?

My Man Godfrey (1936, director Gregory La Cava) is a film formatting many others, made for the 'warm fuzzies' and the amusing silliness. But in the matter of compatibility between the two love interests, the resolution leaves a sour taste in one's mouth. While the story itself seems good, it unfortunately only is on paper. It's set up like a typical screwball comedy with two opposites attracting after being drawn together under extraordinary circumstances, endless mishaps, the knowledge that they'll end up a couple after defeating whatever the conflict is, and several flat characters that help the story move along.In any screwball or romantic comedy, the love interests give the story an inciting incident when they have their meet-cute. This gives the plot a motivation; They are supposed to be the couple to root for. Our main potential (albeit forced) couple is the titular bum-turned-butler Godfrey, who is clever and grounded, and the spoiled, whimsical Irene Bullock. He has his priorities in order and refuses to be distracted from making a life for himself; She has no real concerns besides getting Godfrey to love her and spiting her sister, and her empty head is far from what Godfrey needs in his life.

What happened to her? Skipping a release in Adelaide, my eyes were soon eating up her beauty, a few months later. This movie was penned by David Lynch's daughter, and learning that she was only nineteen when she wrote it, I must say wowed me. Some people will see this movie as just an excuse for actors to take their clothes off, I can tell you, it's much more than that. It's the story of such deep sexual obsession one surgeon (Julian Sands who pops up in a lot of these films, and other R ones, when he's not warlocking) has on this beauty, he spent one night with, he just can't let go. When this daring, live life to the full beauty, who I must admit, really is a b..ch, attends a party, Sands is hosting, she makes quite an impression, attracting the eye of many a crowd, including Sands's very hot wife, in one sense, it will have you thinking, What an idiot? but other scenes will make you think that too, as at times he becomes such a pathetic, sad, pitiable character. As Helena is going away the next day, in a rush to leave, the next day, she realizes she's lost her wallet that has been purposely misplaced, by the jealous angst Sands. This fracas leads to a tragedy with a twist. I use the term twist, so I don't spoil the illusion of the movie for viewers. The tragedy, involving a car, that's knocked her down, and taken her legs with it, leads to the heart of the story where Helena becomes a virtual prisoner in Sands's home, where for the rest of the movie, it's interplay between the two actors, you could knock a play into shape with. For jealous obsessive Sands, this has become his dream. But the interruption of Kurtwood Smith, as an older physician and colleague of Sands, kind of puts a damper on the situation. But the interesting plot of movie with some occasional hot scenes, keeps you absorbed, as here's a tale of a really deep, take no prisoners, obsession. How the accident really concluding, I must say, threw me for a six, the way it deceived us, was very smartly done. New talent, Lynch (where proved here, it runs in the family) has fashioned a really solid adult feature, that like, The Lover, Husbands and Lovers, even Lake Consequence, you shouldn't pass off as just an excuse for sex, or label it, just a dirty movie, as this one definitely isn't.

What happened to her? Skipping a release in Adelaide, my eyes were soon eating up her beauty, a few months later. This movie was penned by David Lynch's daughter, and learning that she was only nineteen when she wrote it, I must say wowed me. Some people will see this movie as just an excuse for actors to take their clothes off, I can tell you, it's much more than that. It's the story of such deep sexual obsession one surgeon (Julian Sands who pops up in a lot of these films, and other R ones, when he's not warlocking) has on this beauty, he spent one night with, he just can't let go. When this daring, live life to the full beauty, who I must admit, really is a b..ch, attends a party, Sands is hosting, she makes quite an impression, attracting the eye of many a crowd, including Sands's very hot wife, in one sense, it will have you thinking, What an idiot? but other scenes will make you think that too, as at times he becomes such a pathetic, sad, pitiable character. As Helena is going away the next day, in a rush to leave, the next day, she realizes she's lost her wallet that has been purposely misplaced, by the jealous angst Sands. This fracas leads to a tragedy with a twist. I use the term twist, so I don't spoil the illusion of the movie for viewers. The tragedy, involving a car, that's knocked her down, and taken her legs with it, leads to the heart of the story where Helena becomes a virtual prisoner in Sands's home, where for the rest of the movie, it's interplay between the two actors, you could knock a play into shape with. For jealous obsessive Sands, this has become his dream. But the interruption of Kurtwood Smith, as an older physician and colleague of Sands, kind of puts a damper on the situation. But the interesting plot of movie with some occasional hot scenes, keeps you absorbed, as here's a tale of a really deep, take no prisoners, obsession. How the accident really concluding, I must say, threw me for a six, the way it deceived us, was very smartly done. New talent, Lynch (where proved here, it runs in the family) has fashioned a really solid adult feature, that like, The Lover, Husbands and Lovers, even Lake Consequence, you shouldn't pass off as just an excuse for sex, or label it, just a dirty movie, as this one definitely isn't.

It Happened One Night is the story of two people from opposing backgrounds having an unlikely meeting on a bus, and how it snowballs into something much more. Claudette Colbert's character Ellie Andrews is fleeing to her husband in New York whom her powerfully wealthy father doesn't approve of, and although she is trying to evade her father's scouts, she is a bit drunk on the idea of finally being on her own. The runaway heiress runs into Peter Warne, Clark Gable's character, who only a few minutes prior to bumping into her had been fired from his job as a reporter (although he pretends that it was he who quit) and needs a story (such as one involving a spoiled heiress throwing a tantrum). They immediately take a disliking to each other, but grow close as they must depend upon each other to reach their separate goals. It's truly very amusing, and the plot's simplicity doesn't affect that, but rather, makes it sweeter. Like with the form of the film, it's better to leave well enough alone and enjoy what it is an aww-type rom-com. It's meant to make the audience feel warm and fuzzy, and maybe like they could be in a situation like it; one where they find true love over the course of a couple of nights of adventure. Trying to pick out a specific meaning for the big picture only leads to testing generic sort of phrases and realizing they all fit the plot; Sometimes you don't know what you're looking for until you find it, opposites attract or really anything other clichéd tagline can be applied to this plot, but to give it credit, It Happened One Night was perhaps the first popular romantic comedy with sound in U.S. cinematic history, so it can't really be clichéd when the clichés are of it. The only real symbolism is the walls of Jericho, which is a blanket folded over a string that Peter put up to separate he and Ellie, which at the very end after their elopement is shown to drop to the floor.The cinematography of It Happened One Night is unsatisfyingly dull. The plot is certainly cute and amusing enough to keep the film enjoyable overall, but the camera doesn't perform anything special to layer it. Being charmed by this classic screwball film is only achieved if you resolve not to look for any interesting type of camera directing. The audience just wants to feel a part of the story and live it out happy ending and all, so the form seems to have been something that was dropped in priority to what is now considered sitcom level. Even the music isn't remarkable. In fact, the only time I noticed it was in the wedding scene that plays Mendelssohn's traditional Wedding March.

Nicholas Hoult is adorable in his role as Marcus, I absolutely adore him, he'll do anything to make his mother happy, he wears the clothes and shoes she makes him wear, eats all the healthy food she makes him eat, sings the songs she likes (Killing me softly-has become an all time classic in my house because of this film); Toni Collette plays his crazy, vegan, hippy suicidal mother, when she makes him that loaf of organic brown bread that he kills a duck at the park- is one of our favorite scenes. He meets Will (Hugh Grant) who is a self-obsessed bachelor; they both become friends in an intricate and funny way, by Marcus practically barging into Will's life, taking over his home after school. Will, being more hip and into modern ways, tries to buy new sports shoes for Marcus, after he sees all the bullying and tormenting that Marcus is enduring at school, Marcus ends up going home shoeless in the rain.

The story sees the Dark Lord Sauron create an evil ring to control middle earth until he was destroyed, 3000 years later the ring has found it's way to Frodo Baggins who along with the fellowship are tasked with the mission of destroying the ring in the lands of Mordor. All the acting in this film is great with Elijah Wood starring as Frodo as he really made us feel connected with the character and make him feel a hero who needed support because he was the underdog. The rest of the group is also fantastic with Ian Mckellen as Gandalf The Grey and he is just so wise and great as the dominant Wizard who is also fun to be around. Viggo Mortensen is crucial with his great performance as Aragorn because his character is crucial to the story and is just like Frodo because we look through this character. Also Sean Bean does a great job as Boromir with him being the character that really struggles to grasp the addiction of the ring and really provide an interesting character. The story is great and I liked how a prologue was used to show the back story, also this film combines character moments, story, heartfelt moments and action incredibly well as this film never feels boring as it is always involved in one way or another. Also it has one of the most dramatic endings in film history that normally almost drives me to tears and also makes you want to just go and watch the second film. The script is also fantastic as it really has a good blend of epicness and humour that really balances it out well. The style is absolutely incredible and I have never seen a film look better then the Lord Of the rings films as it is absolutely breathtaking and helps with the epic tone. Also I think this is the most epic selection on soundtracks ever created and they all fit the films superbly. Overall this film is close to perfection and really builds up the anticipation for the rest of the trilogy.

The minimal budget allotted to Hitchcock made him simpler and more restrained in his film-making.

Janet Leigh is stunning as Marion Crane and ensures that we remember what little screen time she has.

His performance as Norman Bates is one of the most stunning performances of all time. Perkins also hides the film's twist well throughout the entire movie, adding to Psycho's suspense. The score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and adds incredibly to the suspense, especially during the infamous shower scene. That single scene is perhaps the defining scene of Hitchcock's career. It not only serves as the single catalyst for the plot, it also shows the attention to detail he gave to his movies. Psycho is the best horror film ever made for its reliability on every other factor besides gore to create suspense.

I had to take the train into Philadelphia by myself in order to testify about some theft that happened at my school (someone stole my stereo!). I had some free time and I sneaked into a theater for the first afternoon showing of this film. There had been some publicity in Time Magazine with racy pictures, so I had heard about the film. I was amazed that I was able to get in because it was rated X and I had never seen an x-rated film before. I was shaking with guilt and anticipation. There was practically no one else in the theater.As soon as the first note of the soundtrack started and the orange titles began to appear rhythmically with the music I was riveted. I couldn't believe how musical this film was and how the music and images worked as one. Images I had never, ever imagined popped onto the screen. The make-up on Alex, the costumes with the cod pieces, the naked milk figures. Suddenly a naked woman appeared. I had never seen a naked woman in a moving picture before, only in Playboy and Penthouse magazine! Then all of the violence. And all of it choreographed so perfectly to the music. It was a completely foreign world...but so incredibly stimulating! My heart was pumping with absolute joy. I had never seen anything so exciting in my life. The dancing Jesus, the snake and the vagina, the bouncing penis sculpture, the Beethoven statue smashing a face, the scissor stripping of the woman, Singin in the Rain...I was absolutely intoxicated.By the end of the film my life had been changed. This was the first entertainment that I had ever seen that stimulated all of my sense and moved me to the core. For years after I replayed the movie over and over in my head (this is before VCR's) using a book with the script and black and white pictures from the film and the soundtrack LP.Now, over forty years later, I still like the film very much but it is not in my top ten. It really tapped into my adolescent mindset back in the 70's, but as I grew older and focused more on the story and message it was not as interesting. However, to me this film was pioneering, particularly when it comes to music videos which it anticipated and which developed many years later.My first love in life now is classical music. Only music can move me the way Clockwork Orange did when I was a teen. The music in Clockwork Orange helped give it it's power over me and sent me on a lifelong journey into the world of classical music. Kubrick was brilliant when it came to using classical music...but in a way it is cheating. Without classical music, 2001, Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon would not be as great as they are. So I thank Kubrick, Beethoven, Purcell, Rossini, Elgar and Wendy Carlos for A Clockwork Orange.

For years after I replayed the movie over and over in my head (this is before VCR's) using a book with the script and black and white pictures from the film and the soundtrack LP.Now, over forty years later, I still like the film very much but it is not in my top ten. It really tapped into my adolescent mindset back in the 70's, but as I grew older and focused more on the story and message it was not as interesting. However, to me this film was pioneering, particularly when it comes to music videos which it anticipated and which developed many years later.My first love in life now is classical music. Only music can move me the way Clockwork Orange did when I was a teen. The music in Clockwork Orange helped give it it's power over me and sent me on a lifelong journey into the world of classical music. Kubrick was brilliant when it came to using classical music...but in a way it is cheating. Without classical music, 2001, Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon would not be as great as they are. So I thank Kubrick, Beethoven, Purcell, Rossini, Elgar and Wendy Carlos for A Clockwork Orange.

Basically set in 1750's, Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel (Golden Globe nominated Jeremy Irons) enters the South American jungle and builds a mission to convert a Guaraní community to Christianity to Christianity, they are aggressive to any strangers coming into their place, but they are captivated by the music that he plays them and allow him to stay. Mercenary Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro) made his money kidnapping the natives and selling them into slavery, including to Spanish Governor Cabeza (Chuck Low), but following finding his fiancée Carlotta (Cherie Lunghi) and his younger half-brother Felipe (Aidan Quinn) sleeping together and killing him in a duel he spirals into depression, but Father Gabriel offers him redemption, as penance he carries heavy armour over a waterfall, and he settles eventually into the Guaraní community. The mission becomes a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní, and Mendoza is moved to help, he takes a vow and over time becomes a true Jesuit guided by Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding (Liam Neeson), but the missions being safe under Spanish law changes due to the Treaty of Madrid over the land in South America, the Portugese colonials will be able to enslave the natives, and former Jesuit from the Vatican, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano (BAFTA winning Ray McAnally), is sent to survey all missions and determine if they will be allowed to remain or not. Cardinal Altamirano is put under pressure by Spanish Governor Cabeza and Portuguese Governor Don Hontar (The Jury's Ronald Pickup), if he sides with the colonists the indigenous people will be made slaves, if he sides with the mission they will condemned by the Portugese and fracturing could happen within the European Catholic Church, eventually he chooses to close the mission, the Guaraní will be forced to leave, but Father Gabriel and Mendoza will defend the mission if the colonists and plantation owners will try and attack them. Father Gabriel is against military force because violence goes against his religious beliefs, but Mendoza breaks his vow and does indeed use military defence, and against the Father's wishes teaches the natives the art of war, and once again wields his sword, a Portugese and Spanish army do come to attack the mission, with Mendoza being fatally wounded, and Fielding sacrificing himself, and after trying to distract the army Gabriel, the rest of the priests and many of the Guaraní, including women and children, are gunned down, only a few escaping into the jungle. The final scene sees Cardinal Altamirano and Don Hontar meeting and acknowledging the wrongs of what has happened, they agree to work together rebuild the community, surviving young children in a canoe return to the massacre within the mission to salvage some belongings, and while they travel down the river the text of the film says that priests continue to fight for the rights of the indigenous. Also starring Sigifredo Ismare as Witch Doctor, Asuncion Ontiveros as Indian Chief, Daniel Berrigan as Sebastian, Monirak Sisowath as Ibaye and Tony Lawn as Father Provincial. Irons gives a great sincere performance as the religious trying to make positive change for the native people, De Niro is is an interesting choice as the man who makes up for his mistakes and is also passionate toward the innocent people, and young Neeson gets his good moments as well as the other priest trying to help. This is a simple enough story of religion trying to solve terrible woe for a tribes people, the music throughout the film is beautiful, the scenes in the jungle and other sights look wonderful, and the 18th Century period and events are captured well, I agree it may be flabby at small moments, but overall it is enjoyable and moving historical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Ennio Morricone, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Score, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Production Design, Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.
