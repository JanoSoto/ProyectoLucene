Those of you expecting horror, forget it. First of all, there's just not much horror. The three stories told are stories about irony and bad nature of humans than about terror. Sure, there are life threatening situations, but the people getting into this trouble were more or less asking for it. In the first story, a man wants to quit smoking and signs up for a program with a shady company, run by a man who would be better of in a mob family. The man who wants to quit,(of course) expertly played by James Woods, knows the consequences for not following the rules are rather extreme, but doesn't quite take the company serious. At least, not in the beginning. The second story is about a man more or less forced into a bet by the husband of his lover. If he manages to walk around a building on the ledge, he'll get a big sum of money, AND his wife. If he doesn't...well. The third is a pretty weak story about a literally breathtaking evil gnome who terrifies a cute little girl (Drew Barrymore, who is still cute now), and has to battle her cat when he threatens her. The overall message is, when you play with fire, you might get burned. Dark humor, yes. Cynicism yes. Horror? Sorry, no.

I've never seen any of Catherine Hepburn's work before, but have only heard of her once when a biography of Audrey HEPBURN told the story of how the famous designer Givenchy mistook the then-aspiring Audrey Hepburn for Catherine.  Audrey Hepburn has always been a great favorite of mine, and that incident somehow kind of make me resent Catherine, of whom I have never seen.  Then there was Bringing Up Baby on TV, with nothing to do so I just sat down and watched it.  It left me speechless!  Susan (Catherine's character) has left such an imprint in me that I base all of Catherine Hepburn's characters in the rest of her movies on (and Catherine is the model that I've often compare every actress I've ever seen on).Catherine Hepburn was so great that it's as simple as Catherine IS Susan. Why it struck me so was that my image of the classic star is always aloof, unreachable, dignified, and kind of cold.  It actually seems true most of the time in the movies I've seen, and here is Susan Vance, a down-to-earth, unconventional, outgoing, warm, and finds-joys-in-all-things type of girl. The first time I've ever seen a famous star making a fool out of herself and seemingly enjoying it!  It's actually true to Catherine, she is said to be an unconventional woman, never follow rules and care not what people say.Cary Grant also did an exceptional job in this movie, proving he is a great actor in all fields comedy, romance, drama, or thriller.  The scene where Susan stole his clothes and he ended up wearing her furry, lacy, and much too feminine dressing gown is a classic.  I've never seen anything more hilarious.  Watching the two characters interact is like watching a disaster bound to happen, with many funny trips on the way.But what irks me the most is when this movie came out, it received awful reviews and flopped at the box office.  It did so bad that the director was fired and Catherine Hepburn's contract was canceled.  Movie was probably too unconventional for people back then.

Well he was right this poorly made film was nowhere near the quality of Episodes 4-6. What made those films great was the physiological connection we had to the characters. We (at least most of us) knew that Chewbacca was really a man wearing a monkey suit, but at least he was real.Instead we have a character like Jar Jar who offends everybody and instead of Storm troopers we get  pathetic robots that seem to be lightsabre practice for the Jedi's instead of real enemies.  This film stunk of over excessiveness and commercialism, obviously targeted at the 6-13 age group it neglected the age group that made the originals popular. The story did not have any fresh ideas and the acting was so-so. Liam Neeson was alright in his role, but Macgregor seemed bored, Natalie Portman I thought was dressed too bizare to pay any attention to her acting and Jake Lloyd had too many annoying habits like whooppee. I think the stereotyping was overblown, how can you have any sympathy for Jar-Jar if he is so damn annoying.The battle scene between the gungans and those stupid robots was incredibly lame. The light saber duel was the only worthwhile part of the movie, but what about Darth Maul, who  supposedly is the evil guy but has less screen time than an extra.Lucas should have taken a lesson from a movie which came out a couple of months before The Phantom Menace, the Matrix. Not only did the Matrix have an intruguing story but it did not saturate the movie with special effects, it only used them to complement the story.

Screen veteran Roddy McDowell has a chance to flex his acting muscles and his charm as the former vampire killer of filmdom confronting a real vampire.  McDowell's performance is one of depth and worth a look at the film alone.  The vampire in this film is played by Chris Sarandon and he is excellent as a somewhat atypical undead.  Fright Night is a reel treat to see.

And boy did we action fans need it. James Bond was losing his appeal, Rambo was nothing more than a charmless, mono-syllabic walking machine-gun and Arnie was still in the early days of his rise to the top of Hollywood. The action genre needed help. That help came in the unlikely form of Bruce Willis. Oh dear. Since Moonlighting finished, Bruce's big screen output left a lot to be desired up to this point ('Blind Date', anyone?). Some thought it a bit cheeky of our Mr Willis to be demanding a few million dollars to appear as New York cop John McClane. In fact, some US cinema audiences started to jeer and throw popcorn at the screen when the trailer for Die Hard was shown. If only they knew... Basically, Die Hard turned Bruce Willis into a genuine movie star. In a white vest that gets grubbier by the minute, a snappy gag for every villain despatched and injuries that get more severe with each increasingly improbable set-piece, John McClane became the blueprint for action heroes over the next decade. For the first time in a long while we had an action hero who was human (he's afraid to fly, he gets scared when the villains shoot at him, and most importantly, his marriage is a mess). From the moment we meet him, stressed out after a long plane journey, we know this is a guy we can trust. Thanks to the sequels, it's hard to imagine anyone but Willis in the role of McClane but there's far more to Die Hard's success than it's leading man. In films like this there is a tendency to make the villains nothing more than cannon fodder. When they first appear in Die Hard, they give the impression of an expertly trained, highly disciplined and well organised team of guys-to-be-shot-by-Bruce. However, as the film progresses, they actually develop individual personalities. Special mentions should go to Clarence Gilyard Jr as Theo, the excitable Technical expert. Also Alexander Gudonov does a wonderfully snarling chief henchman\/second-in-command. Last, but certainly not least, Alan Rickman as chief villain Hans Gruber shows exactly why he has since developed a reputation for stealing films right out from under the stars' noses. Bruce has to work hard to stop Rickman from overshadowing him but he just about pulls it off (unlike Kevin Costner who, apparently, had Robin Hood Prince of Thieves re-edited so that Rickman's Sherrif of Nottingham didn't wipe Costner's plank Robin off the screen - it didn't work though). It's not just the characters that makes this film work. The action set-pieces are directed with impeccable style and panache by John McTiernan. This is probably the man we have to thank for action movie that practically re-invented the Big Budget 90's Hollywood Blockbuster two years before that decade had even begun. That's not to say that film is perfect. Certain aspects of the plot are painfully contrived - fists with your toes. Yeah, right. The police and other law enforcement agencies are worryingly inept, with the obvious exception of Al, Bruce's buddie on the outside. There's also the old the villain is dead....whooops, no he isn't device at the end which was as much a cliche in 1988 as it is now.Some people might criticise Die Hard on the grounds that it's too far-fetched.

The film deals with the hopelessness of a small Texas town in the mid-1950s.  All the people in the town are down for one reason or another.  The only thing that could bring the town together, the high school football team, is an utter disappointment to all who care.  And now the only shred of hope left in town, the old movie theater, is about to close its doors for good.  Timothy Bottoms is a young man trying to decide what he wants in life.  He has an attraction to classmate Cybill Shepherd, but she's involved with his best friend Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar-nominated part).  However, Shepherd is not sure that she wants to spend her life with Bridges so she gets involved with Randy Quaid, a son of a rich landowner, and his friends.  Bridges has the same thoughts about Shepherd and also struggles with his place within the town's landscape.  Bottoms becomes involved with his basketball coach's wife (Cloris Leachman in her Oscar-winning role), hoping that she will fill the void he has.  This does not work and he still has fixations on Shepherd, who somewhat gives in to him during the film.  All in all, there is no real love in any of the characters and they all suffer due to this fact.

A TV star from a once successful show, unproven as a movie star, demanding several million to star in a big budget action movie - people were booing and throwing popcorn at the screen when only the trailer was showing. Little did they know... Mr Willis may have made a few suspect choices in his film roles over the years ('North' and, Heaven help us, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities'), but Die Hard was probably the best career move he will make. Ever. James Bond was getting a bit tedious, Rambo was nothing more than an indestructable muscle-bound meathead, the Eighties needed a real action hero. Step forward John McClane. When we first meet him, we immediately know this is a guy we can trust. While James Bond would just sit calmly sipping his cocktail, McClane is tense after a long flight - he's not too keen on flying.

From the first moment of the excellent opening sequence until the last fade to white, I was completely engrossed in this wonderful, intelligent & classy horror film. Then, it stayed with me and GREW. Like a great novel that you can't wait to talk about with your friends, this relatively minor piece of entertainment (what the director considers it) inspired me to figure out its open, unexplained ends. As I did so I became even more frightened than I was while watching the film. Maybe it's me, but I just love this kind of European styled filming in a classic satanic thriller.The more I thought about it, the more it reminded me of the famous Nordic folk tale Peer Gynt. Peer Gynt was about a protagonist whose weakness was greed, among other moral depravity, and he travels abroad in a sort of test of his integrity. In that tale there were trolls & wizards & other characters appropriate for the age, whereas in The Ninth Gate (based on Arturo Pérez Reverte's novel, El Club Dumas) there was a legend of Lucifer & a particularly alluring devil's apprentice, played by the lovely Emmanuelle Seigner, Polansky's wife. But the protagonist, played by Johnny Depp, does travel to exotic places abroad and is at the mercy of his own greed.What made the movie so entertaining was Polansky's classy, European styled directing, including many location shots in Spain, Portugal & France that allowed the director to flaunt this style with grace & panache. His affection for Siegner, who played in his 1988 thriller Frantic with Harrison Ford & played the leading part in the 1992 movie Lunes de fiel, is understandable. Her mysterious beauty is utilized wonderfully here as a pivotal character in the quixotic plot. So wonderfully that, at least to this reviewer, she steals the show.My only criticism of this film is for Mr. Depp, and it is only a minor criticism. It's that certain of his lines lacked emotional strength. The director stated in an interview that he was thoroughly impressed with Depp's ability to make the most of every line. I'm afraid I disagree. True, it was in character to remain apathetic and hardened to the others surrounding Corso. But it seems that his character could have been more hard-boiled, something that Depp's rounded face is not easily capable of achieving. And when frightened, there was also a lack of emotion. He didn't seem REALLY frightened. A few angled close-ups might have engaged the distressed scenes a bit more, but this would have been a departure from the director's unaffected style. That kind of thing is Hitchcockian, not Polanskian. That is, Hitchcock used it more often, whereas Polanski saves, saves & saves until the end for the stylishly angled close-ups, if then. Hitchcock's was a bold directing style; Polanski's is a reserved directing style. The combination of this and Depp's round, pretty face makes for a reservedness that borders on the dispassionate, at least for this character study.In the end, however, the story itself offers enough of an intelligent and adventurous mystery to overcome the above weakness. And Polanski's quiet scenes of detailed, yet natural & almost impoverished beauty - the kind that makes a European scene so delicious - works perfectly with the macabre story line. There were cliches, to be sure. This kind of thing is to be expected from such a film. And the director admitted that the movie was not meant to be serious, but instead merely entertainment fun. That it certainly was, and then some. I give it a 10, but with a reserve for the fact that it makes me wish there were more 70s style movie directors still around to compete with him.

Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.So what does the so-called King of the World choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie\/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.This movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.It goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie. Which is kind of eerie, since to me he looks about 12 years old. But hey - some people seem to think he's hot stuff. Oh, and despite a lot of swimming and rain, Leo's hair never seems to move much, but maybe I'm just nitpicking.As for the plot - well, like most of the dung floating on the big screens these days, you should be able to predict it all the way through. Some of the actions of these islanders will leave you scratching your head. If this is what would happen in a paradise setting with so-called 'civilized' people, I'll take savage headhunting tribes any day.I won't lay all of the blame on poor Leo. The acting is absolutely wretched, and the whole time I'm watching this dreck I'm wondering why these infantile boobs were even STAYING on the island. I know, that's a slap at the screenwriting as much as at the acting. But aside from the magnificent scenery, this is a virtually unwatchable movie.Your best bet is to simply skip this yawner and check out Survivor itself. At least there the actions and reactions are a little more realistic - although, knowing how well-staged that show is, maybe not all THAT realistic.

Should he be a dashing hero, or a romantic lead? For any newly minted Hollywood star, the next role or roles are exceedingly crucial. The follow-up to a blockbuster doesn't have to make as bombastic a splash as its predecessor, but it can't get by with just a ripple, either.So what does the so-called King of the World choose to do? This adaptation of Alex Garland's novel about a young lost soul who wants to get more out of life and finds an island paradise in the South Pacific. Remember how Lord of the Flies was? Well, if you had any English in high school or college, you'll remember that the setting there was an island where prep-school boys had crashlanded. And all goes well, until they submit to their base instincts and become savages. When Richard (DiCaprio) and his friends find this island, that movie\/book was the first thing I thought of. It's all there - the rituals, the diversions, the bonding-through-suffering. And it's all very, very well photographed, too. In fact, the more I looked at the island, the more it looked like the one in Survivor on CBS, only with fewer rats and a whole heaping helping of marijuana. Seems the people on the island are basically self-sufficient, leaving the world behind and taking care of themselves, save for occasional forays back to the mainland for goods they can't get on their own island.This movie just solidifies the old theory that says if you take a mediocre actor and put him in a BIG MOVIE, where the BIG special effects are the main draw, he'll do just fine; put him in a movie where he actually needs to ACT, and he's not so hot. DiCaprio's character isn't particularly nice, which is fine; but he's also played in a hopeless, one-dimensional way, with a careless - not necessarily carefree - attitude. I'm sure DiCaprio is a good guy; at least I have no evidence to the contrary. But in this film, there simply isn't any THERE there. His character, essential to the plot, since he's the protagonist, is about as effective as the proverbial puptent in a windstorm.It goes without saying that DiCaprio got script approval, too - coming off Titanic, and all - since he seems to be able to bed down with practically every female in the movie.

Now that I've got that out of my system, I can actually review the movie.Vanya on 42nd Street is pretty much a perfect film, just like its predecessor My Dinner With Andre. Both films have the same three cooperative creators, Andre Gregory, Wallace Shawn, and Louis Malle. Both these films have revolutionary structure. My Dinner With Andre is a film about two people who sit down to dinner and an extended conversation. Nothing else. For nearly two hours, two people talk, interrupted occasionally by a waiter delivering food. It is one of my favorite films, and only two films rival its depths that I can think of offhand, 2001 and Citizen Kane. All three of those films are so layered and have so many levels of interpretation that their value is priceless. Vanya on 42nd Street is a film about the first complete rehearsal of an English translation of the Anton Chekov play _Uncle Vanya_. The camera shows us actors acting on an undecorated stage with their street clothes on. And it pulls us in just as well as if we were sitting in the front row opening night (perhaps even more; I will explain why further down the page). I was entirely involved in the play throughout the whole film, and at one point Vanya (Wallace Shawn) grabs a cup which he wants to put water in. Emblazened on it I <heart> NY. It yanked me out of feudal Russia in a heartbeat. It wasn't there on accident of course. The bright red lettering faces straight on towards the camera, and is in the very center of the picture. This cup is pure braggartry, screaming THERE! You were entirely involved in something that was in no way real. Look just how well we are fooling you! Of course, it didn't take another second before I was completely absorbed with the play. About fifteen to twenty minutes later, at the end of act three, tears were streaming down my neck.Okay, now, my reason for my claim that I experienced this play better in this film than I could ever experience it in the front row of a professional production of it. My reason stems from my fundamental dislike of theater. When one is acting in a play, one must shout (or rather, as a theater teacher might correct me, Project!) for the audience to be able to hear you. People do not shout their deeply emotionaly words. They grumble them or murmur them or whisper them or moan them. Dialogue released in a groan or a grumble does not project all that well. Therefore, all dialogue in a theatrical setting has always seemed, well, phony. Also, the complex facial expressions are entirely lost on every person sitting in the aisles at a play. All except for the most pronounced and overwrought. The same goes for gestures. Gestures are not always large in normal human communication, but on stage they simply must be for them to be communicated. The actors in this film are so, so, so, so so so so good, especially in their facial expressions. You could never get a proper feel for them sitting beneath them in a playhouse. The medium of film allows subtlety, as little as that quality is used in most films. That is why I feel film is superior to the play. Well then, if I believe that plays are awful, and conversely, that films are great, then why don't I believe that _Uncle Vanya_ would have been easily adapted into film. Well, because it was written for the stage, I believe (though I'm not 100% sure why, I'll honestly say). To actually see these actors moving around inside a house, or, even worse (since it's not in the actual play), on a farm would have seemed unrealistic. Normally, plays just feel stagey when they're put to film. There have been few exceptions that I can think of. I can tell almost instantly, when a play is translated into film. The only really great film to be made from a play is Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, easily one of the best films ever made. It never lacks the feel of a film. You can tell it was once a play, but it never feels like it has to be a play like Uncle Vanya would if it were adapted straight from play to film. I attribute most of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'s success as a film to the perfect acting and the superior cinematography by Haskell Wexler.The play to film thing even bothers me when it is Shakespeare. I have seen very few Shakespeare films adapted straight to film that have worked for me. Zafferelli's Romeo and Juliette was the best. But the two Shakespeare works on film which have really intrigued me are direct descendents of Vanya on 42nd Looking for Richard (I cannot believe Al Pacino did not see Vanya) and Shakespeare in Love (okay, maybe this isn't directly inspired by Vanya). Both of those films place the play on an inner level of the film's overall plot, and thus they try to teach us the inner workings of the plays themselves and acting as an art on the whole. Anyway, since I am tired and no longer in control of my thoughts, per se, I will just say 10\/10, goodnight everybody!
