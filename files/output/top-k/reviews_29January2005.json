I've been trying to see a Peckinpah film for quite some time, after hearing quite a lot about his directorial talent. When this film came on TV, after missing it about five showings so far, I decided to check it out. After all, it's got James Woods and Michael Madsen in the cast, both portraying criminals... that can't be all bad, right? Not all bad, no, but certainly not very good, either. The film ranges somewhere between half-bad and almost good. It's somewhat good, but it loses momentum less than half-way through, and it's hard to watch attentively from that point on. Truth is, it just doesn't really have anything we haven't seen before. Couple of criminals get together to rob a place, some of them try to keep the loot for themselves... they all run. So what? We never really get a reason why these particular criminals should be important, why we should care about them. The film ends up just being a decent heist movie with a good cast. The plot is nothing special or even slightly original. The pacing is bad, and even the most patient people will lose interest sooner or later. The acting is pretty good. The characters are somewhat well-written, but they aren't fleshed out properly, and are in the end just dull and uninteresting. The action is OK, but there are plenty of better action-flicks out there. Basically, this isn't really worthwhile, but I guess it's decent for a single, half-attentive viewing. Bonus for those who do muster up the effort to watch both female attractive cast members, Kim Basinger and Jennifer Tilly get naked for some scenes. I recommend this to fans of any of the principal actors, possibly the genre and possibly the director. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 January 2005","score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" I haven't been able to find the original Sam Peckinpah film of '72, though it's not for lack of trying.

It's got a singular flaw which keeps it from being really top rank, but it does a lot of stuff really well. For one thing, it manages not to be self-regarding about it's protagonist. Crabbe fails at everything, is always the passive one, the victim, the patsy. The only action he really takes, at the very end, works because Custer is a whack-job, not because Crabbe has really been effective.It's sardonic and absurdist, but only heavy-handed in spots. unlike say Penn's MICKEY ONE, which is so heavy-handed it's basically camp. Because the whole thing's grounded in the tall tale genre, it comes off light, amusing. Even the twists on the formula, the attempts to make Grand Statements, feel like plays on the genre. Martin Balsam, for instance, the con man who loses a piece of himself with every scam, is obviously in some sense a symbol of The Evils of Capitalism -- but he's also the kind of figure a tall tale might exaggerate, and so he's more acceptable than just some avante-gardey grotesque shoved in there. (The voice-over really works well in knitting that together -- it's one of the more effective uses of voice-over in movies, I think.) Because the movie's in some ways a bleak joke, the performances are fairly one-dimensional. Dunaway is quite soft\/sexy as the church wife and then hard\/sexy as the whore -- Mulligan is way over the top, but this time through I liked him better, mainly because I viewed him not as Custer, but rather as what passes for Evil in an absurd world. Hoffman's doing Hoffman -- you never really buy him as anything but a perpetual outsider, but that's all he's supposed to be, so it works.I think the movie's big flaw is that it gets overly-sentimental about the Native Americans. I think it can't quite keep up it's sardonic tone when we're with them, and I think it throws off the rhythm of the movie. I think the real secret direction of the movie is that there is no moral center to the world, just nihilism, but I don't think consciously it really wants to go there, and so backs away and romanticizes Native American life instead. But it doesn't feel believable -- those moments are heavy handed and didactic and strained. Suddenly what was complex is now simple whites = bad, Cheyenne = good.It's interesting that the movie is at it's best away from the Native Americans.Well worth seeing, although I last saw it in a revival theater and the print, a lousy television print, was dreadful.

Its better than the book because Huston ripped out all the worthless pages and boiled it down to its essence. But without the book there would have been no film, so good ole Dash gets the proper nod too, however the ultimate laurel has to go to good ole John. And Bogart. His best performance, his Spade is much better than his Philip Marlowe. However it is odd how virtually misread this movie has been. Everybody thinks it is about the Maltese Falcon. But if you stop and think a moment you see that that is impossible. The Falcon is not even mentioned until about a third of the way through. Yet Archer is shot within the first few minutes, and Spade is suspected nearly from the start. So the plot is fairly simple. But notice nobody here, or in Cinema mags, or Leonard Maltin, Roger Eb...well you get the idea. Nobody has ever mentioned what is obvious the whole thing from start to finish is Sam Spade trying to CLEAR himself of the murder. Even the cops say so, and in the bargain he has that long great speech to the D.A. telling that particular guardian of the law either to book him or lay off and leave him alone. The Falcon is merely a device to keep things rolling along, like the Cherry Orchard getting chopped down by Chekhov, so he can let his characters talk. Spade was never remotely interested in the Falcon, and only marginally interested in Brigit. Notice in every scene, and he is IN every scene, all he is really doing is listening to lies, trying to figure out who killed Miles Archer even that business at the end which everyone attaches so much attention, when a mans partner is killed he is supposed to do something about it, has nothing much to do with him. At bottom he is waiting out all the liars, until somebody tumbles with the truth and he can turn them in. Of course in the process he gets to listen to some of the most entertaining liars in the history of cinema. A great movie, horribly misread because of the wonderful slight of hand trick of hiding something huge in plain sight. If any film ever deserved a nine out of ten, it's this one.

The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1. Carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carl's mind.It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.

Carl just went into a coma; he has been sick for a long time. 2. His house and the house with his last kidnapped victim are not at the same place. In a way this part of the story is pretty standard.Things are about to get interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine has to go into Carl's mind. This is dangerous for a lot of reasons. In short Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine starts believing Carl's mind is the real world then her mind can convince her body; she could die in the mind of Carl. A tape of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure Catherine will try to get the location out of Carl's mind.It is the journey through this sick mind that makes this film more than worth watching. Director Tarsem Singh, who did music videos before this, in a way goes back to these music videos. Every room in the imaginative world is another short clip that exists out of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me the visual style felt completely new, the way 'Three Kings' had a new visual style one year earlier. If something like that can make you like a film, 'The Cell' will not disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can like this film anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for that. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Still, a very entertaining film with nice ideas that looks terrific.

The film is about the journey, about the world it shows during this journey, the destination does not really matter. In my opinion this journey through the mind gives such beautiful images other things do not really matter as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good.We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How this works exactly does not really matter, but it looks a lot like virtual reality. She and other scientist including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe that this method might work. Catherine enters the mind of the boy and speaks with him there, in a world that is completely created by the boy. She hopes she can let him do things that in the end will give results.The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumped body, Carl can be traced and captured. Two problems occur. 1.

Well, I read somewhere that the director of Glitter had only worked with television before and wow, is this obvious. The cinematography is flat and dull, broken only by about five thousand pan shots over the city--okay, okay, we get it, she's in New York--and the treacly, slow-motion shots of Mariah leaping into her skeevy boyfriend's\/DJ's arms.When it comes to octaves, boy, has the woman got range. But nowhere else. She can't act worth crap, and on a related note, I can't stand to watch her sing. She's always whipping her head around emotionally and pouting. What a voice--why can't she do something worthwhile with it?! ...oh, and don't forget her supposed naiveté and innocence--I loved it!! Mariah is so shy about being dressed in a silver bikini, sniffle sniffle. I loved the scene with her boyfriend (Dice) leaping in to rescue her when she's too uncomfortable with the beefy Chippendale-types crawling all over her in a video shoot. She looks on the verge of tears and totally ridiculous--sort of like she's got bugs under her skin and is trying to squirm them out--but the director is shouting, Yes, yes, perfect! Uh, did he WANT her to look like she was being molested? Later, studly, sensitive Dice decries her publicity photos by sniffing that she looks like a porn star. P--porn star? gulps Mariah, horrified. In almost every scene, though, she's dressed in something short and skin-tight. P--porn star? But I'm so ch--chaste and v--virginal! Mariah sniffles like she's shy and humble and innocent throughout the movie, an act which is punctuated by brief scenes in which she belts out formulaic pop ballads like a woman who's been performing for a decade and a half. Every so often, there is a scene to indicate that she's climbed another rung on the ladder--for example, she's on TV briefly\/Dice sees a headline reading that she's sold out Madison Square Garden--but none of them explain how or why. All we know is that she didn't finish a video. Oh, and she had a song on the radio once. Nice development. They must have cut about a mile and a half of film out of this thing.The best example of Mariah's incredible acting ability can be found in a scene in which Timothy, the music producer with whom Dice has made some sort of secret monetary deal, breaks into their apartment. Mariah is alone, and her expression does not change once during a scene in which he slowly saunters towards her to grab her face and growl, I don't want to hurt you...but I will. It's hilarious to watch her cheeks being squashed while her eyes continue to stare blankly into some void. (Despite being in the kitchen, by the way, she doesn't make a move towards anything that might protect her.) At one point, she asks Timothy how he got into the apartment, and he doesn't answer. Clearly the writers didn't care to figure it out either.The ending is so perfect and wonderfully contrived that I can't do it justice here. Let's just say that Mariah leaves the concert at Madison Square Garden, finds a note from Dice, and goes immediately from NYC to Maryland in her limo. From the concert.

M. Night Shyamalan has become famous by using a very clever gimmick of sorts--he makes films that are largely realist dramas, but that have a twist near the end where it's revealed that the whole film was really a genre film (genre films is a general term that is used primarily for works made that fall under what are normally considered the fan boy genres, especially the fantasy genres, which includes most horror and sci-fi). Director Steven Spielberg's Hook, although structurally the same as a Shyamalan film initially, brings its twist earlier and more literally transforms into a genre film, so that it ends up being primarily a kid-oriented fantasy (partially meaning that it's a bit heavier on the comedy) where the twist is that it is actually a realist drama--it's a kind of reverse M. Night Shyamalan. Shyamalan does horror, or fantasy, or sci-fi masquerading as a realist drama. Hook is realist drama masquerading as a fantasy film.The above fact is probably a large part of the reason why some viewers end up not liking the film very much. The animated Peter Pan by Disney, which is certainly the most famous filmed version of Pan, is manically paced and plotted--it's almost anarchic in a way. It's big on action, comedy and what sci-fi fans used to call a sense of wonder, which is a kind of awe in response to a thoroughgoing portrayal of a captivating fantasy world. Except for small doses and a climax that is very different in flavor from the rest of the film, Hook is not very big on action or a sense of wonder, the comedy is closer to a classical literary sense of comedy, and the pacing is closer to, say, Big Fish (2003). The film is even bookended with material that suggests that all of the fantasy may have been merely a dream. This is really a more adult Pan in many ways. To appreciate the film, a viewer has to slow down and not expect chaotic merriment at every turn.Both of the main characters, Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman, are excellent. Hoffman is almost unrecognizable. For the little bit that she's in the film, Maggie Smith is also excellent. The rest of the cast is good. The only performance I don't care so much for is Julia Roberts', but she is far from my favorite actress. I tend to dislike her as often as not.With the realist drama approach, Spielberg manages to give the performances in the fantasy portion of the film a bizarre turn, as most of the characters in Neverland seem to be bordering on a hammy insanity. That might not work for a lot of viewers, but I love it--keep in mind, though, that I especially love surrealism, camp and absurdism. Some sections of the Neverland material, especially the scenes with the Lost Boys, also have a colorful everything-but-the-kitchen-sink flavor, ala The Wiz (1978) or Batman & Robin (1997), both films that Joel Schumacher was involved with, curiously enough. I also like that approach, and I'm a (rare) fan of both of those films.It's interesting to note that even with the very different tenor of Hook compared with Peter Pan (1953), Spielberg translates almost every major character and plot element to his film in some way, with the most notable (and to me, lamentable) absence being the American Indian characters, who were surely omitted for reasons of political correctness (the 1953 Pan film being now seen as offensive by some people in its portrayal of American Indians).Some of the technical elements are rather nondescript but certainly competent, such as the bulk of the cinematography, and some are rather pedestrian or clichéd, such as the score.

Cairo happens to be one of the best 80's movies Woody actually made - Crimes and Misdeameanours and Braodway Danny Rose being other greats.The reason why I think that Cairo is better than the other 80's efforts is that the idea is really inventive. The movie raises so many questions of reality and fantasy, but does so in a highly surreal fashion. The switching of scenes, from reality to fantasy (movie) made me realise where movies take us as a viewer. Cecelia finds solace in the world of movies and comes up against the decision of which is better - the perfect world of movie, or reality, where things are never certain.Jeff Daniels is so enigmatic in this movie. Not only as Tom, the screen legend, but as Gil the actor. Two very different characters, both played brilliantly. Mia Farrow is great as usual, and shows how broad her talent is (Broadway Danny Rose and Radio Days - both very different characters.

The film is effective without actually showing us anything particularly scary... which is quite an achievement. I don't believe I've seen something like this outside of a Hitchcock film.

The acting was mostly great, but there are one or two performances by the supporting cast that seem... off, somehow. Nothing big, though. The characters are very well-written, interesting and credible. One thing that bothered me a little was how the only truly likable character was Rosemary... even her boyfriend was annoying, I thought. Maybe that's just me, though.

When they get to Paris, they hide in the Eiffel Tower until after hours, then climb the stairs up to the observation deck--Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) plans to bungee jump from the platform. While preparing for the leap, a mysterious, beautiful woman, Serafine Pigot (Julie Delpy) suddenly appears. She climbs to the top of the guard railing, and attempts to commit suicide. McDermott saves her, then pursues her. But she may not be what she appeared to be, and the three friends' lives may be at stake.While this is often thought of as a sequel to An American Werewolf in London (1981), it's really more of a re-imagining of similar material. So it's not necessarily to watch London first. While many viewers' opinions on the two films may be colored by which film they see first and\/or which they are more familiar with, I think both films are excellent. This earns a 10 out of 10 from me just as easily as London did.Paris works so superbly for a similar reason to London. Writer\/director Anthony Waller, along with writers Tim Burns and Tom Stern, has created a seamless melding of comedy and horror. Each genre is fully committed to, and each amplifies the other. There is a different taste to the mixture, making it easily fit into its era (just as London has a late 70s\/early 80s flavor). The humor here more straightforward, and maybe a little more outrageous, while the horror tends to be more fast-paced, epic in scale, and the major effects are achieved through cgi rather than mechanicals. Whether you prefer one or the other, if you do, will probably depend on whether your tastes lie more with the horror films of one era or the other. I like both eras equally, leading to my liking both films (although I have to say that I slightly prefer London, as that's long been one of my favorite films, and for me, you just can't beat the ending).The plot of Paris is captivating, fairly complex, often suspenseful, and there is even an extensive subplot about a gang of Nazi-like skinheads practicing eugenics in their own peculiar way. Pigot is very well-developed, with an intriguing backstory that would make for a good prequel. The cast is almost as good as the cast of London (with Delpy being just as good as anyone in the first film), the film looks good, and the locations are beautiful (although none have quite the eeriness of London's settings). It is also well edited, well directed, and has a nice metal-oriented soundtrack.

While preparing for the leap, a mysterious, beautiful woman, Serafine Pigot (Julie Delpy) suddenly appears. She climbs to the top of the guard railing, and attempts to commit suicide. McDermott saves her, then pursues her. But she may not be what she appeared to be, and the three friends' lives may be at stake.While this is often thought of as a sequel to An American Werewolf in London (1981), it's really more of a re-imagining of similar material. So it's not necessarily to watch London first. While many viewers' opinions on the two films may be colored by which film they see first and\/or which they are more familiar with, I think both films are excellent. This earns a 10 out of 10 from me just as easily as London did.Paris works so superbly for a similar reason to London. Writer\/director Anthony Waller, along with writers Tim Burns and Tom Stern, has created a seamless melding of comedy and horror. Each genre is fully committed to, and each amplifies the other. There is a different taste to the mixture, making it easily fit into its era (just as London has a late 70s\/early 80s flavor). The humor here more straightforward, and maybe a little more outrageous, while the horror tends to be more fast-paced, epic in scale, and the major effects are achieved through cgi rather than mechanicals. Whether you prefer one or the other, if you do, will probably depend on whether your tastes lie more with the horror films of one era or the other. I like both eras equally, leading to my liking both films (although I have to say that I slightly prefer London, as that's long been one of my favorite films, and for me, you just can't beat the ending).The plot of Paris is captivating, fairly complex, often suspenseful, and there is even an extensive subplot about a gang of Nazi-like skinheads practicing eugenics in their own peculiar way. Pigot is very well-developed, with an intriguing backstory that would make for a good prequel. The cast is almost as good as the cast of London (with Delpy being just as good as anyone in the first film), the film looks good, and the locations are beautiful (although none have quite the eeriness of London's settings). It is also well edited, well directed, and has a nice metal-oriented soundtrack.

","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"29 January 2005","score":"","review":" Eight years after a boating accident kills her brother & her father, young Angela Baker is sent to live with her odd ball aunt & cousin Ricky. Now a teenager, Angela & Ricky go off to Camp Arawak together, a summer camp for little kids & teens. However Angela finds her experience there most unpleasant when her quiet demeanour, coupled with her unwillingness to shower with other girls or participate in any camp activities, make friends or talk to anyone but her cousin, puts her under fire by male bullies, her snooty head counsellor & her roommate, the token slut character named Judy & is almost raped by the disgusting paedophile cook of the camp. However someone is none to happy about all this & begins picking off those who have made Angela's life miserable. Has Angela really gotten over the deaths of her family? or has she snapped & taken her frustrations out on these bullies? or could it be Ricky her protective cousin who is behind the vicious killings & accidents? The camp counsellors at Camp Arawak had better find out soon, or all of Camp Arawak will be going home in a body bag. SLEEPAWAY CAMP is one of my personal favourite slasher flicks of the 1980's that sadly is not as well known by many horror fans & in a way missed the curve since it arrived at the end of the slasher craze of the early 1980's. the slasher juggernaut, save for Friday The 13th was all but over upon this films release & that's a shame because a lot of horror fans missed out on a really fun slasher movie, that is miles better than a lot of the slasher film clunkers that did bigger & better box office, that were filled with bad acting & directing, inane almost plot less stories, tons of nudity & buckets of blood. Unlike a lot of the slashers that arrived after the success of HALLOWEEN & Friday The 13th, SLEEPAWAY CAMP was made with heart & it shows. The film-makers clearly had fun making the movie & as a result it's easily one of the better Friday The 13th rip-off's next to THE BURNING & MADMAN. The acting for the most part is pretty mediocre, but at least the cast tries & unlike a lot of slasher movies that cast twenty to thirty year old's as teenagers, the makers of this film actually cast real teenagers, making the characters feel more authentic. SLEEPAWAY CAMP follows the Friday The 13th formula to a tee, we have the mystery killer whom we don't see while the murders are being committed, usually just the weapon they are clutching, we have the opening pre-credits sequence that shows an horrible murder that has gone unavenged that sets the tone for the rest of the film's horrific carnage that is to follow years later. We get the potential boyfriend in Ricky's best friend Paul to the character of Angela, the snooty girl, the jocks, the mean\/slutty female character etc. Surprisingly unlike a lot of it's slasher brethren, SLEEPAWAY CAMP is not bathed in blood or over the top gory kills, in fact director ROBERT HILTZIK focuses on making his characters as interesting as possible & concentrates on the buildups, tension & suspense scenes, milking them for maximum impact before a kill & I feel that's what makes for a truly scary movie, not out & out gore, like a lot of films from that era. Some of the methods of death are inventive & pretty painful, a person is locked into a toilet & stung to death by bees after a bee hive is tossed in through a small window above the toilet, a girl is stabbed right through the back with a knife that tears down her spine while she has her back turned in the shower, an arrow through the throat (which could be looked at as a tribute to Friday The 13th arrow in the throat gag, that now famous actor Kevin Bacon's character Jack suffered before he died, while lying down in a bunk) a drowning, a severed head lying on the beach, a hair curler to a female victims um...well lets just say this kill although done off screen, is none to pleasant & leave it at that. SLEEPAWAY CAMP also is famous for including elements not seen in slasher films at the time, such as a creepy paedophile who & in an equally painful scene, falls to the floor after the stool he is standing on, is pulled from under him & he hits the floor with a giant pot of boiling hot water splashed all over his body & in a rare, even bolder move (as if a paedophile cook wasn't enough) that is rarely seen in slasher movies, even four little kids fall victim to the psycho, when they are chopped up (off screen) with a hatchet. Add to this & the fact that the film also touches upon the subject of homosexuality, as we view a flashback scene, showing Angela & Peter peeking in on their dad & his boyfriend as they lie in bed together, these sequences seem to add nothing when they first play out to the films real plot, but it all tie together quiet nicely when the film ends on a pretty shocking & sick twist ending that I never saw coming & will throw you off guard, since it's an ending that is not only inventive, creepy & weird, but as well it's an ending you'll never forget & one of the best endings to a horror movie, I've ever seen. Highly recommended! Followed by four sequels (actually three since one is an unfinished film shot in 1992, recently redone to feature length using clips of other SLEEPAWAY CAMP movies). Starting with SLEEPAWAY CAMP II UNHAPPY CAMPERS **** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"29 January 2005","score":"","review":" Eight years after a boating accident kills her brother & her father, young Angela Baker is sent to live with her odd ball aunt & cousin Ricky.
