There was nothing redeeming about any of the characters and nothing gratifying about the events other than the pain and suffering which is visited upon the main characters, which they so dearly deserved. The characters were obviously intended to be average Joes, whom we can all identify with, put into a difficult situation.  But no, moderation was not in the writer's vocabulary and everything was taken entirely too far.  The characters came off looking more like heartless, spineless, murderers who draw no sympathy whatsoever from the audience.  In fact, by about midway through the film I was hoping each and every one of them would take a bullet. Now on the flip side of all that, I reluctantly admit that I actually found myself enjoying some of the movie, in spite of myself.  Maybe I just have a sick mind, but if the author intended it to be a dark comedy, he might have at least been headed in the right direction.  I did find myself amused throughout the movie, though often times I wasn't sure if I was laughing because it was funny or because I had no idea what to make of the violence and gore. This is the kind of movie that you will walk away from scratching your head, wondering what it was you just watched.  If you like movies that walk the line between comedy and trash, this certainly qualifies.  But unless you have a ruthlessly sick sense of humor, steer clear of this movie.

The damsel in distress flops her way through every scene, amazing me with exactly how little energy she can have.  I don't even see Godzilla until about an hour or so into the film (yes, I know, that was a marketing ploy for the commercials to make people want to see the movie, but once you're in the theater, they've kind of got you), and I'm in serious pain from the gargantuan plot holes.  Godzilla leaves his\/her home in the middle of the Pacific, swims through the Panama Canal and around Florida to New York because that was the most convenient place to lay eggs???  Matthew Broderick is brought to the group because he specializes in mutations caused by radiation, but when he suggests that Godzilla is perhaps (this is a shocker) an animal mutated by radiation, everyone acts shocked and thinks he's crazy! What???  This movie is just so horrible until the end, so my suggestion to anyone who hasn't seen it is to show up with only a half hour left in the movie.  That's the only possible way I can see someone enjoying Godzilla.

It is only rather hard to say why. Only because it was one of the first good comedies I've seen? What's behind it?The movie is about a character named Buck, who is played by the late John Candy. You might think this says everything to be said. Not really. I hate most movies with John Candy in a supporting role, because these roles are mostly silly and superfluous. The worst example I have seen is his *role* in Brewster's millions(starring Richard Pryor). Not so here, where he takes the lead once again. To my mind, Uncle Buck was the role of John Candy's life.This character is a man who has more faults and weaknesses than you could ever count, but it's clear that he is very warm-hearted and, *surprise!*, can be a good parent in a very inventive way. Of course this is no movie for real depth, neither is it a movie for masterful performances. This is why I was hesitating to give it 10 out of 10, but why not? It  d o e s  achieve well and it  r e a l l y  works.The teenager and both children all do a good job here and they are the perfect supply to John Candy. It was no-one minor to Roger Ebert who argued that the teenager, played by Jean Louisa Kelly, was too angry and too sharp to be sympathetic. I like reading Ebert's reviews and I wouldn't dare try to prove him wrong, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. Why should she not be too angry and too sharp? Why should she be perfect, why can't she be dark, mean and bad? And learn better in the end of the movie. And does this necessarily mean that we don't still like her character?It's kind of comforting to watch a more genuine Macaulay Culkin here, before he had become famous, and Gaby Hoffmann is also very nice to watch. I also like Laurie Metcalf here as neighbour Marci Dahlgreen-Frost, if only because this *role* seems to me like a grotesque exaggeration of her role in Roseanne.

LOTS of movies attempt to put you in outer space and worlds far away, but I can't think of one that has made the creative attempt of exploring our inner space.I first saw Innerspace when I was 11.  I didn't know who any of the lead actors were.  I'd never seen Saturday Night Live.  And I thought it was a great movie.  Twelve years and hundreds of movies later, I still think it's wonderful.
