The excellent film 'Rush more' (directed by Wes Anderson), is so impressive due to the storyline.The film is set in an upper class private school which at first perception sets the scene for another scary teen, high school, heart break\/ throb American Box office certainty.The stars in this film have a large influence on the effectiveness of its dark content in some important scenes. The Star of the film is Jason Schartzman who is not actually a well known actor but crucially has lead role in this film. He shines as a miss fit drummer, who is a small, geeky, quick definitive character whose personality contains obsessive and arrogant traits but also has a weird, creepy side shown in a line where he actually suggests the reason for a missing character is because of alien abduction.Any audience will be drawn to this actor because of his strong on screen presence and acting talents. I think that their will be a minority group within the intended audience of this film which will have things which they could relate deeply to this character, specifically much more than any of the other characters. This is why I think this character is such a success and is the main feature of this film. Schartzman, Character name 'Max Fischer' spends a lot of time organizing extra-curricular activities which affects his grades in a negative sense.The headmaster (Brian Cox) tells him to get his act together otherwise he will be kicked out, consequently he finds himself on sudden death academic probation - fail one more exam and he's gone. He then meets a millionaire Vietnam vet, called Mr Blume (Bill Murray- biggest Star in the film, who plays a strong important role), whose hateful twin sons are also at the school. This man is as disturbed as Max is obsessive. They become friends, until Max discovers that Blume is also infatuated with Miss Cox.This film was directed, written and filmed in a very intellectual way. I feel there were no negative things about this film, I enjoyed it immensely, however it was a long movie, and at times I felt I was daydreaming and loosing attention. I think this was because I watched it so early in the morning!All the characters were very different from each other, which made it more entertaining to watch, also the viewers could relate to the different characters. The actors were all very believable and talented. I am not a big Bill Murray fan; however I enjoyed him in this movie, he suited his character and I found myself laughing at some of the stupid things he did. Some people might find this film slightly unrealistic and a bit over the top, for example, when Rushmore wants to build a fish tank for Miss Cox covering the football pitch of school property and takes it all on board not even asking permission.The ending is dramatic, stirring and completely unpredictable. This movie in my view is rated 4 out of 5 stars.  I hope I have teased you enough into going to see this must watch movie.

Needless to say, this is a noisy film,full of yelling and hysterics and certainly not a good film to lull one to bed.First, I thought the scene where they are fooling around in the hotel room overly long, silly and noisy.  Perhaps I have too much faith in mankind to believe that grown, professional men, at least one of which is a father, could suddenly behave in such a gross way. However, the inclusion of the hooker was believable. The way in which she died was not so believable as the hook didn't look so sharp and therefore would require much force to penetrate the cranium, but I can suspend belief and imagine a sharper, though much less likely on the back of a hotel door, hook. I couldn't suspend my belief enough however to believe that the effect of so much drugs could so quickly be nullified when the security guard showed up and the following activities.Where things got very interesting was Christian Slater's role as a classic and dangerous psychopath.  The point where the psychopath turns from acceptable to unacceptable behaviour is particularly interesting, and Christian Slater managed the change almost too well; given his other roles and the look in his eye in each, I almost wonder whether he himself has psychopathic tendencies or some other moral wasteland within his brain. While his character is abhorrent, he is such an almost perfect study that it is worth the time alone to watch the movie.Cameron Diaz wins me over then loses me with garbage like Charlie's Angels and any other of her butt-wiggling movies.  In this one, like in Being John Malkovich, her part is hilarious as the male vision of the prima donna bride. Her one-track mind as she gets closer to her wedding surely resonates with many women who marry for the wedding and forget about the man (possibly a reason for so many divorces), and one surely does not suspect the ending but are extremely gratified by it - and reminiscent of a Coen movie which elevated this movie somewhat.I am unsure as to how I felt about Jeanne Tripplehorn.  She is so pretty, yet so nauseating as a common house frau - I may have preferred someone more dowdy and believable but perhaps this is the exact effect the director wanted. I will want to see the movie again to study that character.I certainly get Daniel Stern's jump in front of his minivan which is so Tarantino. People are so weird - if this was an amazing car or something, we almost would agree that we would try to stop someone from smashing our beloved toy by jumping in front. But this is a minivan - yuck - but it is what the minivan represents to him that is so symbolic.  The crash was the end of his placid, family life,and he knew it. The fact that he died really didn't do anything but physically push the point home. I think I may have rather seen him complete his descent into insanity after the crash.The story itself is not so unbelievable - especially with the involvement of many weak individuals under the influence of a pyschopath and a bride. The only thing I really didn't like was the cheap Jew reference - really unnecessary as I am not sure that knowing that some of them were Jews (or all of them except for Christian's character) made any difference whatsoever (except perhaps some commentary of the Christian's influence over the Jews or some such thing). Perhaps there was some hidden message from the Director that I am just not getting.  I did take note that the movie had an Asian hooker, a Black security guard, a Christian psychopath, a WASP bride, and a bunch of Jewish bumbleheads totally out of their element. Haven't quite got all that together yet, but while I get the Jewish 'out of element' comedy, the Asian hooker and Black security guard didn't seem to me to enhance the comedic side of this black comedy.I believe that in the hands of the Coen brothers I think this modern take on the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky could have been a real descent into hell and a future requirement when studying ethics or psychology. It is unfortunate that the blood bath took precedence to pander to the mass expectations or for quick and easy acting and filming. I hope that one day it is remade without all the hysterics and swearing, perhaps limiting the deaths of the guys themselves and instead exploring the mental intricacies that were so promising at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie!

I always relate Transformers to everything that was good about my childhood. No matter how bad things were, I could always count on words of wisdom from Optimus Prime, some cynical remarks from Springer, and of course the usual self-serving antics from everybody's favorite backstabber Starscream. Each day I would come home from elementary school (I was probably 6 years old when the series debuted) turn on the television and be whisked away to the far off reaches of the galaxy.I regret that I wasn't able to see Transformers The Movie at the theater. Being from rural Kentucky we only had one cinema and unfortunately Transformers didn't draw enough interest to be shown on the big screen. I saw it several months later on VHS, but it was definitely worth the wait. The plot is fairly rudimentary (good vs. evil), but there is so much more to Transformers. It was definitely the cartoon for intelligent children. I never truly appreciated the complexity of the series until I got older. How many shows of this genre have dealt with topics such as death? The concept of death is sometimes difficult for an adult to fully grasp, let alone the children who were the target audience. In the movie we witness the demise of some of the most popular characters in the franchise (although this was likely done to usher in the season 3 bots). I do believe that the death scenes hurt the overall success of the movie and the subsequent Season 3, but we're very necessary elements to the film. I mean c'mon the Autobots and Decepticons were AT WAR! How many wars have ended without casualties? The series wasn't quite as graphic, but often times Optimus Prime was faced with very difficult decisions (Watch The Ultimate Doom for instance).The animation in the film is superb...as is the soundtrack. With the exception of Dare to Be Stupid there isn't a weak song in the movie. Leonard Nimoy pulls off an amazing voice characterization as Galvatron and I was also pleased as usual with Peter Cullen as Prime, the late Chris Latta as Starscream, and the legendary Frank Welker as Megatron (among others).The only quarrels I have with the movie would be the dance scene with the Junkions (while their friends are being gobbled up by a gigantic moon-gobbling planet), and the introduction of Blurr and Wheelie. In a perfect world they would have been fed to the Sharkticons ). The introduction of the matrix of leadership seemed to come out of thin air. It was never mentioned in the series, but seemed to be the Autobot Ark of the Covenant.

The concept of death is sometimes difficult for an adult to fully grasp, let alone the children who were the target audience. In the movie we witness the demise of some of the most popular characters in the franchise (although this was likely done to usher in the season 3 bots).

Personally, I don't think that is quite true.  To me, it's the ones with Nicholas Meyer involved that are better.  Meyer brings a much needed outsider's viewpoint to the project; but, one that has a reverence for the source material.  Meyer had shown that he could expand upon a great concept with his novel the Seven Per Cent Solution, an updating of Sherlock Holmes.  Here, he tackles the world of Star Trek.Meyer dives right in by showing that these characters are aging and getting closer to retirement.  He presents a crew that is a step slower, but far more experienced.  They are surrounded by younger crew members who look at them with respect and awe, and, in some cases, bewilderment.SpoilersKhan was the perfect antagonist.  Here we have an epic character, more anti-hero than villain.  He is a genetically engineered superman, but with an arrogance to match.  His people were exiled in the original series, but given a chance to form their own world by Kirk.  Unfortunately, tragedy has struck them and only a few have survived.  When the USS Reliant stumbles upon them, Khan seizes his chance at revenge, for what he perceives Kirk has done to him.Meanwhile, we discover that Kirk has a son, a brilliant scientist who has helped develop a device which can engineer planets.  This becomes Khan's weapon to strike at Kirk.Kirk must face a son who hates him, and come to terms with the fact that the feelings are justified, as Kirk wasn't there as he grew.The film climaxes in a spectacular battle between Kirk and Khan, via their spaceships.  This was the first time that large scale ship-to-ship combat had been portrayed with great creativity.  The ships play cat and mouse through a nebula, taking their shots when the moment is right.  The Reliant is mortally wounded, but Khan launches one final blow, by activating Genesis.  The Enterprise has been crippled and cannot escape.  The Kobayashi Maru scenario has become reality for the crew.  Spock finds a way out, sacrificing himself in the bargain.The performances are great, with some tendencies towards ham.  Montalban recaptures the fire of Khan and exudes charisma.  Shatner is at his subdued best when directed by Meyer.  In commentary, Meyer has stated he would shoot take after take to get Shatner to settle into a performance that was right.  It works quite well, as it serves to keep him in check. Nimoy presents a Spock who has come to terms with his mixed heritage and has become a mentor.  Kirstie Allie was a tremendous addition.  She captures the personna of a Vulcan and brings a new mix to the Kirk\/Spock relationship.  Merritt Butrick gives a fine performance as David Marcus, Kirk's estranged son.  The rest of the cast are given their moments to shine.The effects were top notched, thanks to the addition of ILM to the production.

Not only was it the first appearance of the now infamous Kane Hodder as Jason, but it was also supposed to be the installment where Jason Vorhees was pitted against Freddy Krueger of the A Nightmare On Elm Street series. But, as things go, New Line couldn't get along with Paramount (who distributed the first eight Friday films, until passing the torch to New Line in 1993 for Jason Goes To Hell). That particular film (Freddy Vs. Jason) wouldn't be seen for another 15 years. Instead, the studio basically deleted Freddy from the story and replaced him with a teenage girl with telepathic powers by the name of Tina. Tina is returning to Camp Crystal Lake with her mother years after getting her father killed by accidentally utilizing her abilities. She is assisted by a psychologist by the name of Dr. Crews, whose intents turn out to be rather mean-spirited. As luck would have it, there is a group of teenagers\/young adults partying non-stop next door, and when Tina accidentally awakens Jason from his watery grave, he has his fun, yet again, slashing his way through the crowd. For a series that should be on it's last leg by the seventh installment, The New Blood (and it's predecessor, Jason Lives) does a good job of keeping things fresh and livening up the party a bit more. Special effects wizard John Carl Buechler does a fantastic job at directing, his passion for the material shows through, and even though the movie fell victim to heavy editing, it still stands strong as one of the best in the whole series (aside from parts 1 & 2, it's my favorite). The characters have much more personality than in previous installments, and there are new dynamics added that make the movie all the more interesting. For example, this is the first Friday The 13th where a fully-functional love-story is put into play, and that we actually want to see the hero and the heroine survive the disaster. The Jason make-up is just flat-out gnarly. Yes, as I said before, much of it was cut out, but this is easily the man's best appearance so-far. And it doesn't hurt matters to have stunt-guru Kane Hodder behind the mask. This is the movie that started the Kane\/Jason phenomenon, as Hodder would return for three more sequels, and is one of the few actors to have actually spoken out about how proud he is of his work. Overall, it's a great film. It's flaws can be overlooked because A. At the time it was released, these movies were coming out annually, and B. most of the outrageous effects were massacred by the MPAA. But not to worry, there is a Friday the 13th box-set being released by Paramount in the fall (obviously only containing parts 1-8) and not only has Buechler recorded a commentary track, the cut scenes and uncensored clips and expected to surface as well. I suggest this movie to anyone with even a casual interest in the slasher genre.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2004","score":"","review":"  Friday the 13th Part 7 The New Blood is perhaps the Friday installment with the most historical significance.

Shandling (who co- wrote the sharply funny screenplay with Michael Lesson, Ed Solomon & Peter Tolan), is the chosen cloned eunoch from a race of male aliens from a distant planet making final plans to invade Earth with his sole mission of achievement to get the wheels greased and running to impregnate a woman.Seen in an assembled display of how to react to an Earth woman's conversations (the reliable and ubiquitous response of a barely interested `uh-huh'), he clearly has his work cut out for him, particularly with the fact he has to have his sexual appendage attached for said close encounter (giving an all new meaning to `alien probing'). With a few words of wisdom by his leader Graydon (Kingsley) he is beamed aboard a commercial airliner and winds up in Seattle as the assumed identity of a Harold Anderson and walks into an unsuspecting bank as their awaited new accounts manager.  Met by the smarmy Perry Gordon (Kinnear oozing oily malfeasance with canny glee), his soon-to-be rival, he quickly attempts to find his mate to be (only after several hilarious attempts from the airplane to his new job and the fact his member noisily vibrates whenever he's aroused).At an AA meeting (Perry explains it being one of the best pick-up spots in town for vulnerable women), he is taken by a recovering alcoholic named Susan Hart (the beguilingly sublimely funny Bening) and sets his phaser for stun.After hooking up with her in an unlikely situation and one date he explains to her in no uncertain terms that he wants to have a child. Susan, thinking finally  a real man in touch with his emotional core, succumbs to his sweet yet eager charms and accepts his impromptu marriage proposal the next day.  From there they honeymoon in Vegas with a marathon of sex (`126 times' he says matter-of-factly upon returning to work much to the amazement of Perry) figuring the seed has been planted and to just wait it out. What next comes is a series of truly unsettling changes in his being namely emotions and finally realizing just what will become of his only child.Shandling - who has already become an icon with his pitch perfect accuracy of skewering the world of show business in the classic HBO series `The Larry Sanders Show' and his self-deprecating sexual hang-ups - scores big laughs as the alien with a heart (despite his overachieving goal of surpassing his horniness to save his race!), and makes this heavily trodded hybrid genre (heck go back to Robin Williams in `Mork & Mindy' or all the way back to Jerry Lewis as a misfit extraterrestrial in `Visit To A Small Planet') a welcome return.  Getting his smart alecky alien to parallel the real off-balance of the sexes with men roles as being piggish louts who'd rather watch the game on the tube than actually talk to the women in their lives is one large step he attempts and neatly dispatches, as well as the well-timed deflations of pick-up lines he uses apparently circa 1965 with much hilarity ensuing.Bening proves to be a truly giften comic actress (hell her first big role in cinema was the John Candy\/Dan Aykroyd romp `The Great Outdoors' and has shown up more recently in her acclaimed Oscar nominated turn in the pitch black comedy\/drama, `American Beauty') and matches Shandling step by step as the confused 12 stepper attempting to find some footing in her second chance at some sort of life; she gives the film its soul.Goodman is in fine form as well as Roland Jones, the FAA agent who seems to be channeling Fox Mulder from `The X-Files' (hey one small quibble, why the HELL didn't Shandling even attempt to ask his good buddy David Duchovny, so furiously funny for his guest star shots on `Sanders', in a little piece of stunt casting??), who is hell bent to prove the alien exists when he's not busy trying to save his marriage to the suspicious Nadine (Aaron, a fine comic character actress best remembered as Woody Allen's sister in `Hannah And Her Sisters') who has many of the film's best lines (after accusing Goodman of eyeballing a female co-worker GOODMAN `She's in a wheelchair, Nadine!' AARON `Yeah, and don't think she doesn't play that for all it's worth!') Kinnear is proving to be a fine comic actor in his own right as the pompous skirt chasing Perry (although I found it unlikely since his spouse Helen is played by the incredibly hot Fiorentino - who also gets one of the film's best lines; after hearing Shandling's audible arousal  SHANDLING `It's my penis.it hums'.  Beat. FIORENTINO `Guess it doesn't know the words.')

She struggles with societal norms and biases encountered while trying to come to terms with her identity. The audience witnesses one family's struggle in accepting their daughter as female, not as the little boy, Ludovic, whom they believed she was. The family has trouble accepting Ludovic as a little girl because of the pressure from society, more specifically their neighbors. As the neighbors become surveyors of Ludovic and his family, the family internalizes being surveyed and change their nature towards her on account of this; the basic premise of a theory by John Berger. The application of panopticism, a feeling that one is always being watched, by the neighbors creates a pressure on the family to reprimand Ludovic for her own acceptance of the guidelines set by society of what it means to be a little girl. To Ludovic, being a girl means wearing dresses, marrying boys, putting on make up, and a number of other stereotypical concepts of femininity. The film addresses the problem with the inflexible gender lines in modern day society, and society's reinforcement of stereotypes that have come to define femininity. Ludovic believes she is a girl, which she claims repetitively in the film. She believes that to show everyone else that she is a girl she must play the part and to do that she must accept the symbols of femininity set by society. It is society that classifies gender, and it is society in this film that tells Ludovic that she is not a girl but a boy.  In the film, the community involved exemplifies the inflexible gender lines by ostracizing, harassing, forcing Ludovic to leave school, and even forcing the family out of the community. The film does an excellent job of demonstrating that gender is not something assigned at birth but rather a construct of society. It shows that children are taught to think that blue is for boys and pink is for girls. This is not a natural thought pattern, but an accepted one.

The plot is about Ludovic, a young boy who believes he is in actuality a young girl, and the difficulties he encounters in his middle-class suburban neighborhood as he attempts to life out that life\/reality.  One of the important things to note about the movie (and which makes it a easy and enjoyable watch) is that it is highly unsexualized; Ludovic is not gay, but rather wishes to express his inherent femininity through pretty dress, makeup, jewelry and `girlish' gestures, because this is what the young child has been taught girls should do.  One of the Berliner's movie touches upon is the commoditization of women, though the fact that Ludovic is a boy seeking to commodity himself into a female product is one of the movie's humorously ironic touches. His dream-sequences of his idol, the Barbie-figure Pam, address this issue of femininity-as-spectacle\/performance, and give the movie a lighthearted, fantastical feel that helps to buffer the dreary social realities Ludovic inevitable clashes against.  At its heart, `Ma Vie En Rose' is a critique of gender stereotypes, as it successfully draws out gender as a mere performance one puts on in response to societal `norms' and conventions (a nod to the theories of Judith Butler).  While Ludovic's expression of his chosen gender reflects these societal `norms,' his being a biological boy shows that notions of `male' and `female' are not 'norms' at all, but are rather rigid systems of categorization and binaries imposed on us, and are rather limiting to one's identity.  There is a naturalness and aesthetic pleasure in the movie, that successfully conveys and naturalness and ease Ludovic feels in his satin dresses and high heels.
