[{"date":"2 December 2014","score":"","review":" The original story of this movie came from a novel published in 1978 by Richard Matheson named What Dreams May Come. This is a fantasy drama film starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Robin Williams plays a doctor who is a loving father and husband named Chris Nielson. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a spirit that Chris knew in life as Albert Lewis a doctor, friend, and mentor from his medical residency. Annabella Sciorra plays Chris's wife Annie Nielson an artist who is a loving mother and wife. This movie makes me want to believe in the afterlife. Here are some details to make you watch the movie.At the beginning of this movie everything seems to be normal in the world of the Nielson family. As the movie continues tragedy strikes the family suddenly. The movie shows incite on how families change after losing one of their members. When you lose someone that you are close to it makes you feel like giving up. You can be depressed and full of hopelessness. In the movie a family member gets checked into a help clinic so they do not hurt themselves through troubling times.After the tragedy in the family the movie takes a twist into the afterlife. In the afterlife part of the movie it is just like some of the other ways we have all heard it described. People end up being healthy and live forever in eternity. Some of the scenes in the afterlife part of the movie seem really cool. If you think of something you want to see or have happen all you have to do is choose for it to happen. The Afterlife part of this movie is by far the best part. It will make you wonder what you would do if you were there. There is heaven and hell in this movie just like in different religions there are ways to go either direction. Resurrection is mentioned in the afterlife for those who are in the heaven side.The acting in this movie was exactly what the director wanted perfection. The emotions shown by the actors and actresses were very realistic. The visual effects in this movie were one of the best out of any drama movie I have ever seen. In the afterlife the scenery in the background is a must see. It won an academy award for best visual effects in 1998. Usually in a movie that has tragedy there is someone in the movie whose performance is not acceptable compared to the others. This movie is not like that you have to see it to know how good they did.What Dreams May Come is kind of a chick flick but at least this one has some good visuals to keep us men entertained. Robin Williams is the best actor in this movie it is a shame that he will not be making anymore. People will miss his vibrant energy that he shows in a list of movies that he has been in. If you have not seen this movie you should rent it first like people always say. Once you have seen it though you will end up buying it. This movie is kind of emotional and it will probably make you tear up. The ending of this movie is one of the best parts but the whole movie is great.

The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (a great title) is another Fatal Attraction, Single White Female, etc, kind of film\/thriller, but what's so good here, is the believable revenge scenario, that really follows through, with good planning in it's catalyst, and acting talent, De Mornay, our new revenge driven femme fatale, proves she can play bad, good. We can't help feel a bit sorry for her, in light of her very damaging tragedy, brought on by her lover's suicide. It was something, that came back to bite this late gynocologist, whatever, with his unlawful advances towards patient (Sciorra) who's character just happens to be asthmatic, but hey, it can happen top the best of us. Wait till you see who her gynocologist is (another familiar face, from another popular daytime soapie, who's always used in small roles. She was gonna report him to the police, so he took the easy way out. Now we have a new psycho nanny, under a smiling, loving facade of normalcy, that bellies a hate driven woman, determined to see Sciorra suffer, by taking what she has, because of what she herself, has been robbed of, which includes Sciorra's husband (Matt Mccoy, a very underrated actor). It was a surprise top see hi turn up in this. This whole retrieving angle, all makes sense, when you see it from our flip a switch character, Mornay, where we know, what her ultimate intention is, all too clearly. De Mornay, really has a a screw loose alright, and her character is fun to watch. She even gets physical with a little boy who's bullying Sciorra's little girl, and that dire and clear as crystal threat she gives to that retarded green keeper of Sciorra's (versatile Ernie Hudson) is dialogue I'll never forget. This is a solid driven thriller all the way. The movie sets out what it intends to do, it's intentions never clearer, though we really wonder what's playing around in the diabolical mind of De Mornay. But she's set a new score with her unforgettable and scary performance in a thriller, you must see at least once once.

I also watched the movie with subtitles (I don't know French, German, or Italian). I feel the need to provide others with an opinion that differs from the high rating it has received so far.The movie starts off promising with a few interesting characters, such as Prokosch and Lang, along with the gorgeous Camille and the interesting movie-in-a-movie premise (which is less consequential as the movie continues). Without any explanation, Camille takes on the character she will be the remainder of the movie; an enigmatic and flippant wife who misinterprets a transportation hiccup (or correctly interprets her husband's conniving) and inexplicably stops loving him. In fact, the synopsis ought to have a spoiler alert because he only figures that out at the end. Her husband tirelessly (to me, it's past any realistic level tirelessness) tries to get any response out of her. This continues for the whole movie and only slightly differentiates as the movie continues.Lang and Prokosch are not developed much more and become static elements to the story, which I find lazy. The soundtrack is maniacally repetitive and is applied almost disjointedly from the action in the film. To me, it feels like they had only two or three melodies composed and recorded and decided to use them over and over again regularly without much regard for plot. The ending gave me no emotion except for the relief that was over.I'm not sure if this movie is considered good (7.8 rating at the time of my writing) because of some social or historical importance or the allegorical references regarding Homer's Odyssey, but those pluses are far too subtle to me. While I find Hollywood movies typically too explanatory, this is same magnitude on the other end of the spectrum. The characters are irrational and one dimensional, which eliminated my empathy for them and the movie became annoying.If annoyance is the point of the movie, then the director succeeded. I think the director, producers, and crew wanted to make this movie their vacation so they could go to some villa by the seaside, drive around in a nice Alfa Romeo, film Bridgitte Barot and other women naked, and flex their cinematography muscles in that conveniently planned apartment.

He is one of the very few directors working today who can genuinely be called a master director. Magnolia is considered to be one of his best films and I decided to check it out. It involves a huge ensemble cast. There are a large number of characters all of whose lives are tangentially connected. They deal with their lives in their own ways, while the spectre of melancholy hangs in the air.Like all other Anderson films, Magnolia is thematically very deep. There are a large number of themes that are at work like parental ignorance, parental abuse, sins of the father affecting the child, how a traumatic childhood can have long-lasting and mentally scarring effects on a person even during his\/her adult life, the torturing effect that your past can have on you, forgiveness, achieving some form of redemption, searching for a deeper meaning out of random coincidences and last but by no means least, what can be forgiven and what can't.As expected the movie is visually vibrant. The colour blue plays a great role and sort of chases every character as a mark of pain, suffering and melancholy. Like There Will Be Blood, god is very much present in Magnolia. Like humans, god also makes decisions regarding what actions are worth forgiving and what actions aren't. The film is 3 hours long. But due to the fast nature of the screenplay, the time just flies by without the viewer noticing. The film boasts of tour de force editing. Anderson's love for Scorsese is again very much apparent in the movie with the long tracking shots.The acting is good from all the actors. Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman deserve a special mention.While watching I thought there were some scenes which went a bit overboard and crossed the limits of theatricality. However on retrospection by considering how the film ends, I think a film dealing with such larger than life themes has to include some overly dramatic elements. The movie ends with a scene which I consider to be one of the most awe-inspiring moments in cinematic history. That scene has both visual brilliance as well as thematic potency and relevance. That climax alone makes the film worth viewing again and again. The film has religious undertones, but Anderson never allows the characters to get drowned under the weight of the religious themes. He loves his characters. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 December 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I am a huge Paul Thomas Anderson admirer.

So out of curiosity I decided to give the original a watch, and all I have to say is... What in god's name is this?I've seen people call this a horror movie, and I'd say it's very very VERY far from that. This movie seems less like a horror film or a thriller and more like a crappy exercise at trying to unsettle you. As I watched this I felt less unsettled and more weirded out, even more weirded out then when I watched the remake. The plot sounds intriguing and starts off very strongly, but as it goes on and you see more of the people on the island it just seems stupid, preachy and even a little pretentious at that. Also something else I really, really really have to complain about is the music score. For a movie that tries so hard to be creepy and bizarre the music score doesn't fit the movie at all.

Sure there's still 2 hours and 30 minutes left after that but it only makes the film better. After the battle tom hanks and several men are assigned to a mission to retrieve Private Ryan un harmed and return him home due to his two other brothers being killed leaving him the last son alive. So now there is a good story for a war film and plenty of movie left for various battles, subplots, and all sorts of things.The film even without the battle sequences would probably still work thanks to the great emotional and raw scenes but it just wouldn't be a 10.

This inspirational film gives examples of hardships teenagers go through on a daily basis and it consists of six characters of whom only five are the main objective. These characters play roles from being popular to being a criminal and shows a great perspective on the true aspects of lives for teenagers. The demographics of the film gives a realistic point of view expressing each character's home life as being unsatisfying and emotionally undetached, creating a way for teenagers to cry out for help.The setting of the movie takes place in a high school library where the characters are being punished with Saturday detention for not following school rules, each having different situations. Each character plays a role that some might say fits the teenage image and is described as the brain, the athlete, the basket case, the princess, and the criminal. This film gives the audience an inside view of adolescents with different aspects of themselves; however, they come together with a common issue of emotional neglect from their parents. They start off enemies and by the end of the movie are bonded on an emotional level that surpasses the anger and insecurities they had in the beginning.Brian, played by Michael Anthony Hall, shows an example of what life is like as the brain, but is completely withdrawn from himself as his parents push him for perfection. Perfection is expected from the Athlete in Andy, played by Emilio Estevez. His father beats into him the macho, narcissistic world of high school sports, and Andy is lacking in constant approval. Parents fighting against one another puts Claire, played by Molly Ringwald, the princess, who is constantly seeking her parent's approval as they pin her against one another due to their anger towards each other. John, played by Judd Nelson, is criminalized in school as the delinquent to get attention other than the anger and physical abuse of his parents. The void and despair of feeling alone of being forgotten about by her parents, Allison, played by Ally Sheedy, is a basket case trying to fill the absence of acknowledgement by creating her own world where she is recognized and spoken to.Seeking approval from the parental role model is the main issue in this movie that each teenager is facing. However having a principal that is an antagonistic role model towards these teenagers shows the true reasoning on why teenagers react the way they do and seek the approval they desire to show their importance in life. Mr. Richard Vernon, played by Paul Gleason, was the hardcore shell of a principal that made it obvious that he expected more out of the popular teenagers of the group and bullied the criminal. Many teenagers today experience the same aspect of this movie by feeling it to be close to heart facing the many difficulties in their own lives. This film shows people that bullying and finding approval for themselves has always been an issue in today's world; however, teenagers are less likely to reach out to others to find the help they deserve and consider committing suicide to be the only way out. Bullying is a huge issue today not just by other children but from adults as well.The true inspiration of this movie is to not see the funny side of it or the fact that cliques do exist, but to see that all people including teenagers seek approval for being who they want to be. Each character of the film shows a different type of person who does play a real role in humanity and who feels the everyday pressure of wanting to feel accepted by anyone. My personal experience as a teenager is expressed very highly through this movie. I had constant worries about being considered in the clique that I so desired to be a part of. I lived with fear daily of letting down my teammates on the cheer squad I worked hard towards to be a part of to an extinct of being someone that I really was not. In my teen years, suicide was not mentioned nor an option, and I learned to stop seeking approval by becoming the person I am today.

One small slip up one night causes him to be sent briefly before the commandant. There, he catches news of the war off the German radio. Soon, tall tales begin to emerge around what Jakob heard, and that even he possesses a radio of his own. Initially reluctant, Jakob uses the lie to help bring hope to the desperate residents of the ghetto. While it may be slow and not walk as fine a balance as say, 'Life is Beautiful', this pseudo Holocaust dark-dramedy can still be admired for trying. Certainly another strong dramatic turn from the late Williams is a major note of importance, and probably his best performance from his 'sap years' (though his acting wasn't the issue with either 'Patch Adams' or 'Bicentennial Man'). He's very toned down and dour, but not without levity or a certain gusto to him that does make him endearing. In supporting roles we have the likes of Liev Schreiber, Alan Arkin, Hannah Taylor Gordon and Armin Mueller- Stahl who all turn in solid work, with Stahl being the highlight as the wise old doctor.Production wise, it's solid. Peter Kassovitz' direction is graceful and simple, allowing the foulness of the ghettos to speak for themselves, which are rather well recreated, and Edward Shearmur's score has an underlying whimsy though it can get morbid and sombre a number of times. Really, the faults lie more with the writing; there's a missing intensity, a missing gravity to this whole affair. The film just lacks the punch or viscerality or 'The Pianist' or 'Schindler's List', never feeling as horrifying or shocking as it can be, and none of the characters are as compelling as they should be. Not flat, but again, that lack of power does often leave things feeling a tad hollow. It's like Murray's 'The Razor's Edge'; a lot of the right components are here, yet it never muster up full emotion to become as powerful as it needs to be.

It never gets old for me. In 1977, Spielberg created the sci-fi masterpiece Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which perfectly balanced aliens and reality. Unfortunately, 1977 was also the year of what many believe to be the best sci-fi flick and the biggest movie at the time Star Wars A New Hope. As majestic as Close Encounters was, Star Wars was easily the better film...by a long shot. Five years later, Spielberg tops Close Encounters with what was sure to be his best movie E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Guaranteed a Best Picture or Best Director win, Spielberg loses both to Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. Attenborough always felt that ET was the superior movie, and many people these days think so, as Gandhi has not been able to stand the test of time. As A David Lean-esque film, Attenborough directs a marvellous film, but as a narrative picture there's very few layers that make some scenes dry and boring and the overall product dragged out. Without the character of Gandhi, the movie is nothing. ET is original, fun, shorter and touching. It follows the story of ten-year-old, Elliot (Thomas) who's parents are divorced, is non-comparable with his siblings (Barrymore, McNaughtan) and friendless. That is until a lost alien arrives and rebuilds him, and helps the alien. ET is not a kiddie or immature film. Everybody can see this and feel emotionally connected with is, as it is about feeling lonesome and how friendship can heel someone.

Investigating their claims is Detective Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) who suspects the assault claims may be a conspiracy involving the teacher and the two girls to try and get at Kelly's trust fund money. And Bill Murray is in this. I throw this information in at the end of the plot summation so it can be as arbitrary as his appearances in the film.The film gives us a little glimpse of Kelly's decadent Upper class family situation and Suzie's plight as a member of the under-class, but the film is not trying to say anything about this, simply underlining the differences between the two girls and also getting us to pity both women.There are a lot of twists and turns in our story, and they do come together quite well at film's end end and it all makes sense on a second viewing.

Legends abound about moviegoers who ran screaming from the theater and needed psychiatric counseling after the experience, but those who refuse to revisit the film (or who avoid it completely) are missing the reasons that the film works.Friedkin takes this bizarre story seriously and grounds his characters in absolute reality so the horror of the possession bubbles up out of their lives and doesn't come into the film as a stunt. Their reaction is much the same as ours would have been. I revisit the film about every five years or so and I always notice something different. This last time I was struck by the film's leisure pace. It takes a long time before we get to the actual possession itself and in that time, we get to know the characters whose lives will be torn apart by these horrible events.I appreciated the slow passages early on in which little Regan (Linda Blair) is taken to doctors who subject her to medical treatments, MRIs, spinal taps and finally hypnosis. I liked a brief moment in which her mother Chris wakes up and finds her daughter lying next to her. The child moans My bed was shaking. I appreciated the moment when the mother tells Father Karras that her daughter might need an exorcism. His reaction is completely reasonable as his eyes widen and he says Excuse me? He then tells her The best way to obtain an exorcism would be to take a time machine back to the 16th century. He informs her that the church doesn't grant exorcisms without strenuous investigation because information about psychiatry and mental illness have long replaced such rituals.There's something else I noticed upon revisiting the film recently there is never an origin or purpose given for the possession. The demon has possessed the body of this young girl, but we are never told why. There are several theories there's the reappearance of a strange statue of Pazuzu (a Assyro-Babylonian demon) that Father Merrian finds in the Iraqi desert; there are some early scenes the suggest that Regan has been communicating with a certain Captain Howdy through a Ouija board; but we are never given an explanation of what exactly has taken place. We only see the results. I think that's wise because it give the movie a slant of unpredictability and doesn't waste time bogging down the plot in overwrought exposition.The climactic scene, which has become movie folklore, is where the special effects and makeup come to light but not in a showy way. The scenes involving the actual exorcism are so unpredictable because up until that point, we've been kept mostly in the dark about what this demon is capable of. We've seen the head swivel, the crucifix masturbation scene, we've heard the graveled voice of the demon, but it is only setting us up for the pure battle between the priest and the evil the dwells within this little girl.The Exorcist is a horror movie that got it absolutely right and spawned a generation of worthless imitators who believe that the best way to make a horror film was to hurry along to the scary stuff to give the audience its money's worth. Friedkin wanted to make a film that made sense, a film that found a foothold in order to make the material much more terrifying.

I picked this up on DVD years ago, because it was cheap. To be perfectly honest, I've never really cared for this movie. It's never boring, but it's far too brainless to truly enjoy. Most of the time, I can put my brain aside, but I couldn't in this movie. You'd think that evil vehicles wreaking havoc would be fun, right? Not really. This movie doesn't make much sense! There is not enough info for my liking! I wanted to know much more than what they gave us. There are many plot holes as well. Why did the trucks take almost 90 minutes to attack the diner inside the truck stop? I get that the trucks wanted to toy with the characters, but it was a really silly plot hole. Quite frankly, the characters that survived had no business doing so. I did enjoy the mind games from the machines, but it got incredibly stale after a while. The first half is actually rather fun. It begins with a chaotic scene on the bridge, and it's awesome! It cons you into thinking that you may have a good time. It's near the second half when things start to truly unravel. It started to drag and run out of tricks, to the point where I no longer cared anymore. Even the ACDC filled soundtrack begins to get boring. There is plenty of gore! These machines have a mean streak. Kids are killed in bloody fashion (Ouch!) Soda cans destroy people. People are run over by trucks in grisly fashion, and more! That Happy Toys Truck didn't play around. I hated most of the characters in this movie, except for two! Emilio Estevez has that boyish charm in spades! He's one of the characters that I sympathized with. He was a lot of fun and you know what you're getting with him. Pat Hingle plays the prick well, but he goes overboard with it! I got sick and tired of his Hey, Bubba! routine. Laura Harrington plays a likable love interest and I dug her for the most part. She felt like a real human being. Yeardley Smith is fine, but annoyed the crap out of me as Connie. Her nagging made me wanna smack her. John Short is OK, but not much more. Holter Graham is actually non-annoying as the kid! It's great to see a kid character that is enjoyable to watch. Stephen King did an average job of directing. He later admitted that he was really high on coke while directing this movie. Stephen King films are always a mixed bag. I'm pretty positive this movie is a reason Stephen King hasn't directed much since. It has moments that are enjoyable, especially the first half!

Some of them were groundbreaking (Fatal Attraction), some of them were a little bit exploitative (Basic Instinct), and some were just a load of old cobblers (Consenting Adults), but they had the same narrative structure, and they made there most, until the sub genre was bled dry.This is probably one of the last high profile psycho films we had, and despite the cast being perfectly perfunctory, you knew what was going to happen, the minute Leigh came into the scene.And this is the films problem, when you watch it, you'll have an awful sense of déjà Vu, because it was done so many times in such a short space of time.But it suffices, the ending is suitably creepy, and like all Hollywood thrillers from the early nineties, it's all about the big earrings and flashy jobs.I just wish she got threw into that washing machine come the end, the door was open for crying out loud!!...

But Grace not only survives the attack but kills her would-be murderer in self-defense. Now Ray changes gears and tries to make it look like Grace staged the whole thing and really murdered the man in cold blood. Police Inspector John Williams sees through Ray's lies but the problem is how does he prove it?Often imitated but never duplicated, it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's best color thrillers. Filmed in 3D, no less. Grace Kelly is at her most stunning and sexiest in this movie. Robert Cummings is fine in a bland uninteresting role. John Williams is great as the clever Inspector. Creepy-looking Anthony Dawson is memorable as the hired killer. The star of the whole thing is Ray Milland, who gives one of his best performances. His character is conniving and quick on his feet. The way Hitch sets the whole thing up I actually found myself rooting for Ray to get away with it. I didn't care for the lovebirds very much. Hitch's direction is brilliant (of course). Frederick Knott adapted his own play for the screen and the result is well above average for such an adaptation. It's exceptional Hitchcock, taking a relatively simple plot and crafting something remarkable out of it. A definite must-see.
