It's not great in a Schindler's List or Gladiator way, though.  It's different.  It's moving.  It touches the audience's emotions like no other movie could.  Well, here I go...Happy Premise Number 1  The characters.  This is my favourite part of the film.  Leon is a simple man.  He doesn't ask for much.  He drinks milk in place of beer or liquir, he doesn't smoke, he loves children, and he goes to see old musicals like Singing in the Rain in old theatres.  Oh, and he's a hitman.  His personality is the exact opposite of what you would expect a hit man to be.  He is a sweet and gentle man who goes to work everyday. That's how he sees it.  It's work, business.  Someone has to do it, and he has a gift for what he does.  Okay, so what he does isn't legal, but he is the best in the field, so he has to do it.  The other characters are good, but Leon is terrific.Happy Premise Number 2 Great acting.  I don't think the word great really portrays what I mean.  I know a lot of people say Natalie Portman to be great, but I found her performance to be average.  Gary Oldman gives one of the best villian performances I've ever seen.  His rage and insanity is brilliant.  Jean Reno, one of my favourite actors, stars as Leon.  He pulls off the gentleness perfect.Happy Premise Number 3 the action.  This is an ACTION movies.  Don't let anyone else tell you different.  The action, while not the centre of the movie, is great.  every action scene is choreographed perfectly.  The explosions are the best.  There is an explosion near the end that made me jump.  It looked so real!  People were only a few feet from this gigantic blast.  To this day, it still amazes me.Happy Premise Number 4 Luc Besson.  This is his best film to date.  The Fifth Elemnt was fun, but a little over board.  Everytime I see that movie I see a large TILT sign hoveing over my TV.  I never saw The Messenger, but it was trashed by just about everyone and tanked at the boxoffice.  This film truly shows him at the top of his game.  The cinematography ,the direction, the writing, it's all good my frined, it's all good.Okay, lets seep into some negative things.Depressing Premise Number 1  The film's American release.  When the movie was brought to America, they cut the movie drastically.  They even changed the named from Leon to The Professional.  If you are going to see this film, please rent the DVD called Leon The Professional.  It features the original movie.  The box says that the new scenes were considered too violent for American auidences, but that's an advertising ploy.  There's nothing violent added to Leon.  They are mainly character build up scenes and a great scene were Leon takes Matilda to work.  It is sad that most of us Americans have never seen the true film.   But the cut version is good anyway, so if you can only find the cut version, it's still good.Depressing Premis Number 2 Ummmmmm, can't think of anything.  This film is perfect.  There is nothing wrong with it whatsoever.  Like I said, it's not an epic masterpiece like Gladiator or Hamlet, but it is an extremly good movie none-the-less.Conclusion SEE THIS MOVIE.  It should please everyone.  There's action for guys, a touching story for gals, and a great combination of both for we film people.  It is worth the money for a rent.  PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE.  You will like it.  You may not think it was that special, but you WILL like it.

That's about all I can say. I expected historical inaccuracies, but this movie outdid those expectations. Moviemakers seem to think they have the whole problem of anachronisms licked now that they have complex, expensive wardrobes and CGI. But that doesn't defeat anachronistic, bad, hammy dialogue. Statements like It's a free country, and general manner of conversation are completely inaccurate for the time.Another reviewer brought up the point that the women in this movie are horribly portrayed. I agree, but they are horribly portrayed in a way many people don't recognize. It's not that they weren't given anything meaningful to do or say - that's true of all the actors. The simple fact is that, at that time, no woman would have stood up in a church and verbally berated the men of her village. It just wouldn't happen. Sure, it makes everyone feel good and gets the women cheering, but it just wouldn't happen. If you're going to portray a period, you must portray that period as honestly as possible.As for the concerns with the villainy of the British - believe it or not, that was rather accurate. I suggest the doubters read some of the documentation of the way British settlers behaved at the time. They were absolutely brutal. So that was an interesting element. But the way the filmmakers used their brutality - senselessly burning a village full of people in a church just to reiterate how evil the main bad guy is - that was pretty shameless.What else is there to say? Oh, there's the standard cliche of the villain who gets mortally wounded, then the hunky hero (Heath Ledger - Mel 2.0) decides to stand unnecessarily near to his obviously undead enemy, and gets impaled. It's made even funnier by the fact that the villain then jogs away and gets into an even more intense battle. And Mel beats and stabs some people with an American flag, which actually caused my beverage to shoot from my nose.I don't care if you see the movie, but I urge you not to pay for it. Stand outside your neighbor's living room window or something. But don't fork over your hard-earned cash for what is essentially a Braveheart expansion pack.

Most of the film sank faster than the Titanic. The acting just sent me into a grave.AVTAK wasn't all bad. The action was great with the car chase that led to the hunt on the Effiel Tower and the plot was believable with Max Zorin wanting to take over Silcion Valley, but it wasn't enough to save me.Roger Moore had problems in the film with his age. The guy was 57 years old for God's sake and it was about time to move on. He was a decent Bond from LALD till FYEO, but when Roger went into Octopussy, the funny and very charming Bond died. It truly was sad for me.Christopher Walken played Max Zorin and despite an Oscar to the resume, Chris was a dork with the weird bleached blond hair and freeky kind of personallity.Tanya Roberts just made it into the worst bond girl hall of fame with her pathetic preformence as Stacy Sutton. She was the main reason why AVTAK sunk, with her Oh James!. Anyone have ear plugs?Grace Jones was a little too butch and rugged for a Bond girl. When I think of Bond girls they are helpless and unprotective, but she the complete opposite.The worst part of the movie was when Stacy said something and when Bond was bedding May Day (ewwwwww).AVTAK. From a movie to a kill.  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2000","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  After seeing AVTAK, I was crushed.

While they were quiet with proper etiquette and table manners, we were animated and boistrous with a minimum of two arguments per 15 minutes.  I turned to my mother and said It's just like the Halls and the Singers.  You can tell that Annie Hall was one of Woody Allen's older movies based on the character he plays.  As Alvy Singer, Allen plays a short neurotic Jewish New Yorker who is obsessed with death.  Sun's bad for you.  Everything your parents say is good for you is bad for you.  Sun, milk, red meat, college... By contrast, Diane Keaton plays the title character, a pretentious WASP who is obsessed with life and her favourite expression is La-de-dah.  Oh yeah, she just happens to be Allen's girlfriend.  The movie serves as an introspective commentary on the evolution of a relationship, and how Alvy Singer perceives his rapport with Annie Hall.  For instance, is her family truly a clan on anti-Semites, or is that just how Alvy envisions them?  The movie costars Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, and Paul Simon, with a guest appearance by Marshall McLuhan as himself.  One can see that it had a profound affect on the postmodern entertainment industry, as many aspects of the relationship between George and Susan on Seinfeld can be traced back to Annie Hall.
