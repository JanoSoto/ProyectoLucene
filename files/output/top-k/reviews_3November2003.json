He is best remembered for the man behind the screenplay for Chinatown, the highlight among his other reputable projects. He displays a keen eye for characters and dialogue in Tequila Sunrise, but the film suffers from boredom. There's no explanation for the boredom--it just is.Too bad, really, since most of the time films like these have great pacing and badly developed characters. If Towne had contributed a bit more action and interest into the film it really could have been much better. It suffers from dead weight and uninteresting subplots that have become almost expected of Towne. Unfortunately, they're not needed in a story like this.Mel Gibson plays Dale McKussic, a retired drug dealer living in Southern California who lives on a beach with his young son. By establishing many scenes with Gibson as a caring father figure, he is ultimately presented as a likable character--a script trick not hard to fall for since Gibson is a generally amiable and enjoyable actor.But maybe that's the problem Towne manipulates the audience with his script. A lot. I'm willing to ignore this since all the characters are lovable and nice, but it does hurt the film's impression. Anyway, I'm digressing...Dale is afraid that he will lose custody of his son to his ex-wife--since he is no longer making big bucks. As the critic Roger Ebert pointed out, Only in Southern California would you lose custody because you'd stop selling drugs.Dale has fallen for a fancy restaurant owner named Jo Ann (Michelle Pfeiffer). So has his best friend, Nick (Kurt Russell), who also happens to be a cop. The plot intracicies extend even further when we find out that a big figure in the drug business, Carlos (Raul Julia), is coming to town with a stash of cocaine.So in the midst of both falling desperately and hopelessly in love with the same woman, Dale and Nick must also confront each other in regards to their differences. Will Nick become angered and arrest Dale? Which man will Jo Ann pick to be her future love interest? When will Raul Julia stop choosing bad co-star roles? Oh, too late. Sorry, Raul.Mel Gibson is one of the most likable and easy-going film stars of all time, Kurt Russell is always a good bet in any type of film, and Michelle Pfeiffer is a very beautiful and talented actress. Their interaction, however, seems watered down and pretty dull in Tequila Sunrise, which has good characters but the actors, quite understandably and visibly, have a hard time getting into their roles. Can you blame them? There's something wrong here--it's not a very bad film, but it's not a very good one, either. It is lacking something vital. It's just bleak. Even though the characters are given good introductions and stories, the movie isn't nearly as interesting as it should be.I'm not quite sure what the primary problem of Tequila Sunrise is, I'm not even sure I want to think about it. This is a movie I have sat down to watch twice but have both times become downright bored past the half hour point. It rambles on too long, lacks the hard punch of action, dramatics and humor of Gibson's earlier cop film Lethal Weapon (1987), and is basically a showcase for Towne's ability to craft interesting characters and intriguing subplots given a basic outline of otherwise cliched material. But this is all Tequila Sunrise feels like--a showcase--and that, I suppose, is its biggest fault.2.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"3 November 2003","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Tequila Sunrise is the first film from Robert Towne since 1982's Personal Best.

It did this not by trying to defy its humble origins but indeed it played on them in the most effective way;  it used its amateur feel and low budget appearance to make it look all the more real and this was backed up by hyping people into believing that it was indeed real (at least for a time).Even when they realised that they had been `duped' so to speak they were intrigued (as was I) to find how this had been done to so many people so effectively.  The film came out very late in Australia (so we could cop the 2nd hand prints from the US) but I had purchased it on DVD from the US about two months before its theatrical release and had read a great deal about it and the hype surrounding it before even I saw it.It was intriguing to note the trickle of broken information that made it even here, others had heard this or that about this new film and many even believed it to be real - the thing was everyone wanted to see it very badly.Not everyone who saw it was effected by it - some didn't get it, some didn't like it, some weren't scared by it (one friend of mine borrowed the DVD and she watched it at midday with the lights all on and the windows open cuddled up with her border collie on the sofa;  she deliberately tried to minimise the scare impact, I tend to show it with all the lights off and around midnight!).Others had heard too much real information for the hype to have worked properly - but that's ok, I watched the film to see what they had tried to do and how they had tried to do it and I was enormously impressed by how someone took what they had and used simplicity and ingenuity to make something work so well.This is a film that is special in many ways, like Orson Wells' radio play of `War of the Worlds' and even Ghostwatch (1992) on the BBC, this film can lull the viewer into a sense of what they are seeing is real and even if you know it isn't in the proper environment it can still send chills down one's spine and leave the shattered illusions in their mind for days afterwards. It works on a minimalist approach not widely seen for a long time and they do it very very well;  indeed this was the first DVD I ever purchased and it is still one of my favourites.Not only is it a different type of horror film - it's a different type of film all together (from almost everything else I've seen) and in this day and age of repetition that's quite an achievement.It's a shame the sequel was just so bloody awful, it had none of the feeling or atmosphere of the original.

This movie is a good example of  why John Wayne is a true American icon. He may not be revered as a great actor, but nonetheless he is a real piece of Americana.Right from the beginning, The Searchers seems to be a pretty good movie, and it is for the most part. John FordÕs direction is good and the story line flows fairly smooth without too many gaps. The landscape shots and cinematography were fantastic, and probably the best part of the piece. With these great things in the movie, one could see why the American Film Institute put it on their 100 greatest American movies. It was a good movie up until John Wayne stepped onto the screen. Everything went downhill from there.John Wayne isnÕt a terrible actor, but heÕs not well known for his acting abilities(and rightly so). As soon as his first lines were spoken, the mood and feeling of the movie completely changed. It was no longer a desperate search for a relative, but a John Wayne vehicle. It felt almost staged, like it was no longer possible for these events to happen. No matter  whatÕs going on in the scene the focal point is always Wayne, this not a good thing. ItÕs really hard to follow the story when John Wayne is the main part of the movie.Also, the campy humor and pointless subplots detracted from the deep and meaningful story.

I have every one of his seven movies and think they are all amazing in their own ways. Granted The Wild Life doesn't have a lot to it, there is still some good stuff with the characters.  My two favorites are Crowe's last two, Vanilla Sky and Almost Famous.  I know Vanilla Sky isn't Crowe's writing but I still think he did a good job of remaking Abre los Ojos.  I have the original and have seen it about 10 times.  It gets criticized a lot for being a simple copy but that's what I like about it.  I like how Crowe remade a brilliant movie but for the American audience.  We don't usually get to see a movie like this and Crowe exposed us to this.  Almost Famous is another amazing film.  He basically chronicles Crowe's early life when he worked for Rolling Stone.  I love the relationship that William has with Penny and the relationship with Russell.  I also love Jason Lee.  He is an amazing actor on so many levels.  His lines are great in both Vanilla Sky and Almost Famous.  I also like the fact that Crowe uses many of the same actors in his movies like the obvious Cruise and Lee but then the guys who don't have big roles like Noah Taylor and Eric Stoltz.  He also has a great soundtrack for every movie, using music to create the most memorable scenes including the boombox scene from Say Anything, the tiny dancer scene in Almost Famous, and basically every scene in Vanilla Sky.  I just wanted to say that I love what Cameron writes and I hope that he continues to produce brilliant movies. They may not always have box office success and they may get some negative criticism.

And it is. So there.This movie could have been a trap so easily. Self-absorbed Gen X losers whine about losing their perfectly toned girlfriends because they can't focus on how good they have it as they lounge on their Ikea sofas wired to their Bang & Olafson stereos smoking unfiltered Camels. Boo-hoo. But the central character rivets you in, sad-eyed and begging for your sympathy. John Cusack shows himself to have evolved into quite a professional actor, moving beyond the pleasing if callow roles of his youth with a performance that makes great use of his expressive eyes and his spot-on phrasing. The way he answers the phone the first time Laura calls his character Rob at Championship Vinyl, with the start, the stop, the door close, the pause for a puff of his cigarette, and then his matter-of-fact hello, without seeming to miss a beat. Very surface, yes, but in a practiced, disarming way that makes you feel left in, not out. He shines like that throughout; never too showy, just there when you notice it.As he explains his situation to the viewer in a series of personal narrations, he makes matter-of-fact lines breathe with the understatement of a Robert Benchley bon mot. More important, he reels the viewer in with the same sense of emphathetic desperation that Michael Caine employed in the similarly single-callow-guy-confessional-themed Alfie. At times, you even think of Olivier in some of his juicier, more sinister confidences in Richard III. You find yourself not liking Rob much of the time, but even at his lowest (whining about Laura's inevitable resolution with Ian after Rob just sampled the pleasures of Marie DeSalle) his confessonary character pushes such quibbles away.Cusack is the central performance, and I love Jack Black's star-making second-banana role as well as the many great cameos, from Tim Robbins to Sara Gilbert, but without even looking at all the people who wrote before me, I'm rashly predicting nearly all ignored Iben Hjejle. I don't know how to pronounce that either, except if we were in Copenhagen it would roll off our tongue like Julia Roberts. (The female lead, despite her excellent English, is from Denmark, and apparently went back there after just this one great role. We did manage to get rid of Brigit Neilsen after Cobra, too, but it still seems like the Danes got the best of the bargain.) Hjejle makes such an impression as Laura. From reading the screenplay, you might think of her as a bitch just given how she leaves poor Rob flat, but no. Instead, because of her careful line readings, the humble shafts of vulnerable humor she uses to (almost absently) puncture his bleak half-catatonia, and that glorious half-moon smile she shoots while simultaneously defensive and sincere, you really root for her and Rob to come together again, and because you do, the whole rest of the picture works. Hjejle puts over a delicate balancing act. Just imagine Shannon Doherty in the role instead. It's what I mean about the film avoiding the callow trap. You care too much about the people involved, and your caring invests the picture with the sort of meaning that elevates it to real art.Reading the book, one is impressed by how well the screenwriters did by not veering too far from the veddy British Nick Hornby's story. The four screen scribes (including Cusack) take nearly every cue Hornby gives them, starting with the Top Five list of women\/girls who dumped the hero, capturing the record store in much of its written form (even with most of the same pop music references, as we've been on much the same page musically with the Mother Country since the Beatles went on Ed Sullivan). There's not much missing from the book, but since the book's such a fine tight read, and Hornby keeps the plot zipping along, that's a good thing. Still, if you enjoyed the movie, you won't be disappointed. The book fleshes out some things and amplifies others.Finally, the dialogue is so crisp and effective, funnier and snarkier than a season's worth of Saturday Night Live, and I love SNL. My favorite line this week is Dick describing Marie DeSalle She's a little Sheryl Crowish, crossed with a post-Partridge Family, pre-L.A.

Because if Death's plan was altered, well, he could just shrug like most of us when our plans go awry and turn away.

At the time of its release, Saving Private Ryan was the talk of the summer. It introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before. The acclaim was virtually unanimous, I'd never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the year-end-best list. Five years later, SPR has suffered a minor critical backlash, not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump or even Titanic (two movies that I largely adored as well). It's now considered the most overrated war film. Forget critics or the Razzies, immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in droves.The question is how good is this movie? I've seen it three times. Twice in theaters and another time on DVD, after it became a perennial punching bag for Spielberg haters, who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director. For me, nothing's really changed. It's still a harrowing experience, I still find myself quivering and shaking by the film's conclusion, but I'm not unwilling to concede the film's faults. Five years (of which I've become a more demanding, even pickier, moviegoer) and three viewings have made that clear enough to me.Most people probably know the film's basic premise, so I won't go into a detailed explanation. Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, a WWII captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a Private James Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in combat. Their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately. Unsurprisingly, many obstacles hinder their search, to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach him.The central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre. It's rare to see a war film driven by plot when it's usually a random series of events, typically battle scenes, that hold these movies together. The premise is simple, but it's effective. Whether eight lives are worth risking to save one is enough to spark a debate that probably won't reach any satisfying conclusion. Everyone's got their own opinion on the matter, myself included, but it's to the film's credit it at least made me question the topic. Viewers should at least be open-minded enough to absorb the film's moral quandaries, they're partially the glue that holds the film together.The camaraderie and interaction among the eight soldiers is that other piece that completes the film. There's an equal mix of humor, tension, respect, and pathos between these men. Robert Rodat's script lays out each supporting character nicely, they may initially read like stereotypes, but the performers bring them to life. With that said, SPR boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Among the eight soldiers, there's not a single weak performance in the lot. Even the annoying Jeremy Davies comes through, mainly because his character's supposed to be annoying (and, at one point, the lone voice of sanity in, ironically, a world that deems his actions cowardly)(spoiler oddly enough, the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended, what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions, I'm not entirely sure, other than war can lead to extenuating circumstances).That's not to say I liked every aspect of the film's storytelling. I'm not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends, but while they weren't grating, I'm not sure they're necessary, either. I even see the point of those scenes, Spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past. In that sense, the scene works, and you do question who the old man is in the beginning, but one gets the feeling it's somewhat superfluous.  Spielberg's greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality. SPR is no different, there's a bit of emotional manipulation in the final moments, but to say it didn't affect me would be a complete lie. I was endeared to the characters, and their deaths were shocking, sobering, and saddening.The battle scenes are virtually without peer. The furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me. Prior to SPR, Platoon was the most intense war film I'd ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here. It's gritty, bloody, uncompromising, and disturbing, exactly the way war should be. The level of violence has been repeated over the years (most recently in 2002, when Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism), but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here, a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and character.In the lead performance, Tom Hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a U.S. captain. For some reason, I keep picturing Harrison Ford in this role (and who knows what he could have accomplished with it, especially after seeing his interesting work in K-19), but Hanks is fine. For all intents and purposes, he delivers a great performance, perhaps the most powerful one of his career, but Rodat's script puts a few too many John Wayne-ish tendencies into Miller. The man achieves three-dimensional characterization mostly because of Hanks' touches.The ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds Ryan; I think I would have preferred not knowing that going into the film, might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot. Matt Damon's performance as Ryan is quite good, but yet again, Rodat's script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character. But Damon is convincing enough that some of his more one-dimensional actions didn't bother me much.First-rate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies, and while Rodat's script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film, it's still a well-written story of well-developed characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man, but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days. Lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes. Maybe not intentionally, but it's undeniable that the men who fought were braver than I could ever hope to be.

It's rare to see a war film driven by plot when it's usually a random series of events, typically battle scenes, that hold these movies together. The premise is simple, but it's effective.

Everyone's got their own opinion on the matter, myself included, but it's to the film's credit it at least made me question the topic.

Robert Rodat's script lays out each supporting character nicely, they may initially read like stereotypes, but the performers bring them to life. With that said, SPR boasts one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Among the eight soldiers, there's not a single weak performance in the lot. Even the annoying Jeremy Davies comes through, mainly because his character's supposed to be annoying (and, at one point, the lone voice of sanity in, ironically, a world that deems his actions cowardly)(spoiler oddly enough, the film later goes on to show him kill the man he earlier defended, what this is supposed to speak out about his previous actions, I'm not entirely sure, other than war can lead to extenuating circumstances).That's not to say I liked every aspect of the film's storytelling. I'm not sure whose idea it was to give us those flashback bookends, but while they weren't grating, I'm not sure they're necessary, either. I even see the point of those scenes, Spielberg clearly wants to tie in our feelings in the present and connect us to the past. In that sense, the scene works, and you do question who the old man is in the beginning, but one gets the feeling it's somewhat superfluous.  Spielberg's greatest criticism has been his need to display sentimentality.

I was endeared to the characters, and their deaths were shocking, sobering, and saddening.The battle scenes are virtually without peer. The furious intensity of the combat footage surprised me. Prior to SPR, Platoon was the most intense war film I'd ever seen and the battle scenes in that film almost look plain in comparison to the work accomplished here. It's gritty, bloody, uncompromising, and disturbing, exactly the way war should be. The level of violence has been repeated over the years (most recently in 2002, when Black Hawk Down, We Were Soldiers, and Windtalkers all aimed for the same level of graphic realism), but has never been quite used as effectively as it has been here, a lot of that having to do with attention paid to plot and character.In the lead performance, Tom Hanks feels like an initially odd choice to play a U.S. captain. For some reason, I keep picturing Harrison Ford in this role (and who knows what he could have accomplished with it, especially after seeing his interesting work in K-19), but Hanks is fine. For all intents and purposes, he delivers a great performance, perhaps the most powerful one of his career, but Rodat's script puts a few too many John Wayne-ish tendencies into Miller. The man achieves three-dimensional characterization mostly because of Hanks' touches.The ads and trailers clearly show that the platoon finds Ryan; I think I would have preferred not knowing that going into the film, might have added to the suspense and certainly would have given an extra edge to the moral questions surrounding the plot. Matt Damon's performance as Ryan is quite good, but yet again, Rodat's script makes him into almost a cartoonishly unselfish and honorable character. But Damon is convincing enough that some of his more one-dimensional actions didn't bother me much.First-rate direction and acting go a long way in covering script deficiencies, and while Rodat's script is definitely the most flawed aspect of the film, it's still a well-written story of well-developed characters who risk and sacrifice their lives not only to save a man, but so that we could enjoy the freedom we almost take for granted these days. Lauding heroism in war movies is an easy sell to mass audiences but tough to win over the critics who generally hold the opinion that war produces no heroes. Maybe not intentionally, but it's undeniable that the men who fought were braver than I could ever hope to be.

At the time of its release, Saving Private Ryan was the talk of the summer. It introduced a new gritty style of war filmmaking that was only occasionally glimpsed at before. The acclaim was virtually unanimous, I'd never seen so many critics place one specific film at the top of the year-end-best list. Five years later, SPR has suffered a minor critical backlash, not too dissimilar from Forrest Gump or even Titanic (two movies that I largely adored as well). It's now considered the most overrated war film. Forget critics or the Razzies, immense popularity can do more damage than those two combined ever could in droves.The question is how good is this movie? I've seen it three times. Twice in theaters and another time on DVD, after it became a perennial punching bag for Spielberg haters, who came to see it as all that represented what was wrong with the popular director. For me, nothing's really changed. It's still a harrowing experience, I still find myself quivering and shaking by the film's conclusion, but I'm not unwilling to concede the film's faults. Five years (of which I've become a more demanding, even pickier, moviegoer) and three viewings have made that clear enough to me.Most people probably know the film's basic premise, so I won't go into a detailed explanation. Tom Hanks stars as John Miller, a WWII captain who leads seven men into enemy territory to search for a Private James Ryan, whose three brothers were killed in combat. Their orders are to relieve him of duty and bring him back immediately. Unsurprisingly, many obstacles hinder their search, to the extent the men question whether finding the private is worth the sacrifices it will take to reach him.The central premise is what keeps the film standing out from the rest of the genre.
