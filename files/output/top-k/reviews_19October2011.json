The conclusion to what has to go down as one of the best film trilogies of all time, a sentiment made even more prominent following recent additions to the respective Terminator and Die Hard franchises, carries with it an uplifting air of pomp and conclusion juxtaposed with a sense of heartbreak in that the only way to experience time travelling adventures with these characters, whom we love a great deal, is to sit through a rerun. There is genuine heart to proceedings here, and we sense the director, a certain Robert Zemeckis, of whom has been responsible for some great work over the years, is genuinely trying new things and attempting to push the franchise down different routes. What isn't happening is what often occurs with certain other sequels belonging to certain other franchises; that is to say, simulacrum-imbued romps of previous entries following that same lead character, of whom was never particularly interesting in the first place, trudging through the same locations and doing the same act with nothing registering and not much of it particularly interesting.The film continues the adventures of Marty McFly, but it veers more away to his faithful partner in time, Emmett Doc Brown, in the fashion the last entry alluded it would Doc's favourite ever era in history was the old West, while at one point in Part II, he stated his intent to dismantle the confounded time machine built out of a Delorean and focus his attentions on the one other mystery of the universe women(!). We begin in 1955, and following events of the second film, Marty crash-lands back into Doc Brown's world; he of whom is only just recovering from the events of the very first film. Marty still has that letter from the end of Part II, a letter addressed to him from Doc although written in 1885 having spent several decades with a courier company. It's worth pointing out that the incarnation of Doc that is trapped in 1885 is he of the year 1985, and as you watch and struggle to sync it all up to see if it makes sense, one must battle the wave of nostalgia washing over one on top of listening and working it all out. Blowing up the entrance to an old mine near a graveyard, so that Marty may travel back to the 80's, they stumble across no ordinary grave Doc's grave from the nineteenth century, and they take it upon themselves to alter the plan by sending Marty back to save him.When Marty arrives back, it is as magical as it is when he respectively crash lands into both the 50's and the 2010's; that trademark-of-the-series crane shot over the town-general is like a friend of old rearing up after not having previously seen them for several years, whilst the gag about encountering his mother (or a descendant of his mother) very early on after travelling is still funny. Initially, Marty struggles; falling afoul of his untamed Western surroundings by very nearly coming a cropper to the local wildlife, natives and the soiled water a nearby rancher gives him. There is some early, if unwelcome, instances of humour revolving around a baby urinating on him and his treading in horse manure, but the general idea is he's ill-suited to his surroundings. The Tannen's are back, Thomas F. Wilson returns as an incarnation of what is arguably the most famous school bully that's ever been put to film; here playing Buford, an ancestor of Biff and Griff et al. and a gunslinger whose reputation is built up through still images and newspaper reports prior to his arrival on screen. When he does arrive, the first we see of him is his holstered pistol filling the screen as he walks through a saloon door, thus inferring the danger and the sense of conflict synonymous with him.Where it is established Doc has but a few days left to live, complications in their plan to save both of them arises when Clara Clayton (Steenburgen) bursts onto the scene; a woman destined by history to perish over the side of a cliff but saved by Doc, in what is an event which alters both history as well as Doc's life. Their coming together is the aforementioned wholesome substance, while providing with Doc with as much of the limelight as McFly is good value. Back to the Future Part III works through its sense of there constantly being something at stake - we are aware of what the characters have to do, that is to say, something wholly scientific that is yet to have been tried which unfolds in a pre-modern era. If we look back upon this third Back to the Future film, and to a degree the second one as well, with a differing sense of fondness, then it is because that sense of the fire still going as a mainstream franchise hits its third film has all but dissipated from series of the more recent times. We enjoy the places the film take us; specifically, its covering of two people coming to form a relationship away from the core dynamic of McFly and Doc - if there were criticisms directed at the second film for thrashing around too much as it travelled and darted through time, then this is the entry that is grounded in one place and burns slowly as two characters come together and connect. As a result, we are required to hark back to films such as these made at a time when you actually felt filmmakers were trying new things and were out to enthrall as well as touch emotions, rather than proceed with a going through of the motions.

With the help of a very good friend, a veteran of the industry, we went to one of Bristol's (England) out-of-town multi-plexes and, for the grand total of £0.00 (or, if you like, $0.00!!!), sat back and waited for the fun to begin! The film is big, brash, colourful, and total predicable of course. Rightful pretender to the throne is framed by nasty old Scar, leaves, meets good friends, is persuaded to return, fights nasty old Scar, and Simba takes up his rightful place as King of the Pride. All very Disney, very good triumphing over evil, good guys getting their rightful dues, baddies getting their due comeuppance etc. What raises this above the level of most other animated films of this kind is the quality of the animation - quite superb - some great characters (the farting Warthog is fantastic, Scar suitably nasty, Simba proud and upright, etc), and some excellent songs - Circle of Life has, of course, become a children's classic song! The version I took my mother to see was the newly released 3D one, and I have to say that I was very impressed with how Disney had turned a 2D film into a film with great depth and scope. It did not always work as well as it could have, some scenes still looked a little flat, but certainly when the birds were flying overhead, or the camera was swooping down onto different characters, then the effects were excellent, and really added to the enjoyment of the film.If you have yet to catch up with this film then I would highly recommend you go and watch the 3D version - it is very well done, and worth the admission price - unless you are like myself and know the right people to gain free admission!!!

This film, however, made me raise an eyebrow and wonder if it had gone too far.As a film, it's quite good. The acting (with possible exception of Judas) was superb, as long as one is able to accept the unorthodox choice of accents. I particularly enjoyed Willam Defoe as Jesus (though I had to force myself not to think of him as the Green Goblin). The storyline was well-written and really gave outstanding weight to his last words, It is accomplished. Theologically, a number of things rubbed me the wrong way. You're free to take this or leave this, but I have to say it to give an honest review. Jesus spends the first portion of the movie tortured by voices in his head and is unsure if it is God or Satan. I don't remember if it was ever stated who it was, so I inferred that it was the devil. However, merely showing Jesus blaming God for it was treading dangerously close for me.Early on, he is also convinced that he is guilty of a great many sins for which he seeks forgiveness. While it is conceivable that, while being sinless, he could believe he had sinned, this was taking it too far.I was initially off-put by the overtly sexual content but, now that I've thought about it, I wouldn't list it as a criticism. I would, however, strongly warn anybody wanting to view this about it and the discomfort it can easily cause.The scene in which Jesus meets Paul (in the last temptation, of course) went on unnecessarily long, diving into some weird concepts about how Paul created the image of Jesus as resurrected Lord because it's what people need. In addition to my own preconceptions running counter to this, I simply did not understand what sense it made to portray Paul like this *in the same film where all the things he claims to have invented are true*! For some concluding thoughts, the portrayal of Judas' betrayal as reluctantly following Jesus' orders struck me as blatantly inaccurate, the murder of Lazarus (shortly after his resurrection) was unnecessary, and the baptism scene looked like a rave.All-in-all, an interesting film and I certainly don't regret watching it. However, I would certainly never recommend it to another theologically conservative Christian (unless they were really open-minded) though, for everyone else, I'd say go for it, as long as you understand that it doesn't capture the biblical Jesus.

It's funny how incredibly diverse most of them are and this is also the greatest power of this David Lynch movie.

So it's basically pointless to read or hear other people speaking about Mulholland Dr., since chances are you'll get something totally different out of the movie. So yes, also my opinion about it is also of course completely irrelevant.To be fair, it isn't unique for a director to tell his story in such a way that it leaves almost everything completely up to the viewer's own imagination and interpretation. But David Lynch is the only 'mainstream' director at the moment that still makes movies this way. It's the reason why he has such an huge following and every time a new Lynch movie gets released people go nuts over it, even when they have no idea what they have just seen.And no, I also really have no idea yet what I have just witnessed. Who knows, maybe I'll understand it better on repeated viewings but understanding it is not the key to liking or appreciate this movie, fore I regardlessly really liked and appreciated the experience that this movie offered me.Great thing is that the movie always keeps on fascinating you and is forcing to keep paying attention and search for clues that are hidden in it. The movie is basically a mystery, in which different story lines and different characters get followed, that seemingly have very little to do with each other but at one point do come together or are relevant to each other. It keeps you glued to your seat, even though you might have no idea what is exactly going on. The movie forces you to put things together for yourself, since the actual movie itself offers very little explanation to anything. As a matter of fact, the last few minutes even make the movie all the more confusing, instead of wrapping things up and explaining to you what the story was truly about and what exactly was real in the movie and what wasn't.Personally my theory about the movie is that it's all about alternate realities, coexisting with each other, that at one point got somehow mixed up (due to the accident?). Every time the blue box gets used, a new alternate reality get opened, which explains why some of the characters in the movie switch identities and certain events seem to have changed or never even happened. But who am I to explain a David Lynch movie to you, while David Lynch himself is probably the only one walking this Earth that truly knows what the movie is all about or perhaps he himself also doesn't. He just loves to mess with people's minds, so it isn't even completely unthinkable that some elements of the movie were never supposed to make any sense at all and he's laughing at all of us for trying to explain his movies.But really, this is a movie you could talk about for all day long but in the end it really is something you have to experience for yourself and form your own judgment and interpretation on it.

It sets us up with a generic story and stock characters then pulls the rug out from underneath us. The hero is not only African-American but is clearly the smartest and most capable character in the picture.

Unfortunately,he is kept back by the ambitions of the young namely Joey Zaza and hungrier gangsters. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster in both Don Licio Lucchesi and Don Altobello,who are seeking to upset the existing mob order.Aside from that,it also involves Vincent Mancini,a young protégé's love affair with his daughter,Mary.The movie also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events&#x97;the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981&#x96;1982&#x97;and links them with each other.Director Francis Ford Copolla said the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. In his audio commentary for Part II, he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of New York Stories compelled him to take up Paramount's long-standing offer to make a third installment.Coppola and Mario Puzo,author of The Godfather, requested six months to complete a first draft of the script with a release date of Easter 1991. Paramount agreed to give them six weeks for the script and, lacking a holiday movie, a release date of Christmas Day 1990. Given the conditions together with the casting of neophyte actress and the director's daughter,Sofia Copolla,whom many fans have vehemently criticized for her poor portrayal of Mary Corleone,I still believe that Part III is still a great film. Part III still has great acting from the cast except from Sofia Copolla,whom I must really say deserved the Razzies he got from this film.Worthy of mention is of course,Al Pacino,Andy Garcia and Eli Wallach.Also,the movie's story still works despite missing Robert Duvall and his character,Tom Hagen,whom I believe was really essential in story as he plays an important role in the family. The screenplay was also good BUT one cannot fully comprehend this movie without watching the first two.And of course,other great features from the previous Godfather movies are still present in this movie like the great writing of Copolla and Puzo,the music of Carmine Copolla and Nino Rota and the direction of Copolla.Overall,it is still a great movie although not a masterpiece as compared to the first two.After viewing The Godfather Part III once again after so many years before writing this review,I would say that if The Godfather is the greatest film ever made and The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made,this movie is definitely the greatest underrated film ever made.It is a great movie although it may not be comparable to the first two in terms of critical and commercial success.The Academy Award nominations it got attest to that.

The screenplay was also good BUT one cannot fully comprehend this movie without watching the first two.And of course,other great features from the previous Godfather movies are still present in this movie like the great writing of Copolla and Puzo,the music of Carmine Copolla and Nino Rota and the direction of Copolla.Overall,it is still a great movie although not a masterpiece as compared to the first two.After viewing The Godfather Part III once again after so many years before writing this review,I would say that if The Godfather is the greatest film ever made and The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made,this movie is definitely the greatest underrated film ever made.It is a great movie although it may not be comparable to the first two in terms of critical and commercial success.The Academy Award nominations it got attest to that.

Unfortunately,he is kept back by the ambitions of the young namely Joey Zaza and hungrier gangsters. While he attempts to link the Corleone's finances with the Vatican, Michael must deal with the machinations of a hungrier gangster in both Don Licio Lucchesi and Don Altobello,who are seeking to upset the existing mob order.Aside from that,it also involves Vincent Mancini,a young protégé's love affair with his daughter,Mary.The movie also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events&#x97;the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981&#x96;1982&#x97;and links them with each other.Director Francis Ford Copolla said the first two films had told the complete Corleone saga. In his audio commentary for Part II, he stated that only a dire financial situation caused by the failure of New York Stories compelled him to take up Paramount's long-standing offer to make a third installment.Coppola and Mario Puzo,author of The Godfather, requested six months to complete a first draft of the script with a release date of Easter 1991. Paramount agreed to give them six weeks for the script and, lacking a holiday movie, a release date of Christmas Day 1990. Given the conditions together with the casting of neophyte actress and the director's daughter,Sofia Copolla,whom many fans have vehemently criticized for her poor portrayal of Mary Corleone,I still believe that Part III is still a great film.

Hence also the ridiculous portrayal of both Indians and Americans. The American characters are handled with all the subtlety of a propagandist, being uniformly cruel, stupid and close-minded. The Indians meanwhile are, beyond the token bad Indian (played by the same amazing hawk-faced Indian that always plays this role), wise and tolerant to a fanciful degree. There is absolutely no complexity to either side, nor is the story put in any kind of historical context.

Then Corleone has this words that I perfectly remember It wouldn't be justice, your daughter is still alive *** This brief exchange illustrates the 'eye for an eye' notion, and constitutes the primal basis of my personal contempt for Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood's 'masterpiece' of revisionist western, and the Best Picture of 1992.Basically, I have a philosophical problem with Unforgiven from the start of the plot. A group of prostitutes offers a $1,000 reward for the killing of the two men who 'disfigured' one of their own. The premise is fallacious from the start as it deliberately condemns even the younger and more sympathetic one who tried to stop his friend from attacking the girl. Secondly, considering the small scars she would carry after that, the line she ain't go face left has absolutely no meaning at all, as you would expect to see her without an eye or a part of her nose. She's still good looking, and the movie fails to emphasize the gravity of her wounds.The prostitutes' reaction was out of proportion and I don't buy the whole Those were the times comment. Either you kill for money or for revenge and this could apply to any era, but the contract put on these two dudes wasn't even an eye for an eye, it was basically two lives for a face And it's even sadder when you consider that the younger one tried to give the girl a horse to say he's sorry, the hysterical burst of hostility he faced showed that he had already signed his own death warrant and these women, supposedly weak and powerless, didn't know at all the meaning of forgiveness. I guess those were the times and we have to accept that the two guys had it coming This is why the movie couldn't emotionally engage me. It was all wrong, the whole premise of killing two men for a face, is philosophically unacceptable. Did Munny have a choice? Yes. If you're supposed to be a retired gunslinger, it should take more than a 'disfigured' face to get back on the road. Yes, but it was all about money. Then, William Munny is no better, no worse than Little Bill Daggett, Gene Hackman as the official villain, and just because his best friend is Morgan Freeman doesn't make him any good. Even as an antihero, he's not a 'vigilante', not even a 'punisher', except if he really considered the two guys deserved death, but then we're back to the same problem.I understand that Munny is not necessarily sympathetic, that Unforgiven is about a redemption's failure. But the manipulative aspect of the film is to make us believe that Munny became a bad man, when he learned about the death of his friend and came to avenge him. Ta-da! Here comes the bad Eastwood, the killer, who'll 'pull a Dirty Harry' on the whole town. No, he was a bad man from the start because he killed for money, and the climax highlights the true motive of the film, to work as a patient build-up to a bloody massacre, to show the calm and wise Munny to better emphasize the incarnation of the Devil he became.And again, I didn't even expect him to be the kind of noble-hearted antihero who was going to protest  Hey come on, these guys didn't kill anyone?! What's the matter with you sisters, you ain't foolin' no one !, he did it as a job, for money, fine. But then the whole Hell of a thing killin' a man was probably the most disgustingly hypocritical cinematic speech ever. Munny was talking as if he had no choice killing the man, as if he couldn't use his free will to realize that what he was doing was wrong, that he could refuse the job. No, he had to terminate that guy's life because he didn't deserve a second chance... and we were supposed to be ecstatic toward that blatant lack of justice, even Dirty Harry never got that philosophical.No revisionist western ever featured cold-blooded killers even as antiheroic protagonists, and Unforgiven's depiction of Munny in a positive light is one unforgivable case of narrative manipulation, something that apparently fooled the Academy. I guess all it takes is a great cinematography, a fine editing, these kind of introspective moments and of course, some twists like the kid admitting he never killed anyone. I saw that one coming by one mile, he was so cocky, so un-Eastwood, it was obvious he never did the 'hell of thing' thing.*** And speaking of the 'hell of a thing' I'll end up like I started, with another movie reference. There was a scene in McCabe & Mrs. Miller where John McCabe was chased by three ruthless killers, he had no chance. What did he do? He chickened out and tried to escape, the movie doesn't end here, but I just want to highlight that this man was the 'hero' of the film, and his reaction doesn't need words or a a pseudo meditative speech about life's value to make you get the point. *** This is true realism, real revisionist western, Unforgiven is just a Western with a reverse and manipulative classicism. And if one movie about a character legitimating a certain form of violence should have been the real winner that year, it was Malcolm X.

But the manipulative aspect of the film is to make us believe that Munny became a bad man, when he learned about the death of his friend and came to avenge him. Ta-da! Here comes the bad Eastwood, the killer, who'll 'pull a Dirty Harry' on the whole town. No, he was a bad man from the start because he killed for money, and the climax highlights the true motive of the film, to work as a patient build-up to a bloody massacre, to show the calm and wise Munny to better emphasize the incarnation of the Devil he became.And again, I didn't even expect him to be the kind of noble-hearted antihero who was going to protest  Hey come on, these guys didn't kill anyone?! What's the matter with you sisters, you ain't foolin' no one !, he did it as a job, for money, fine. But then the whole Hell of a thing killin' a man was probably the most disgustingly hypocritical cinematic speech ever. Munny was talking as if he had no choice killing the man, as if he couldn't use his free will to realize that what he was doing was wrong, that he could refuse the job. No, he had to terminate that guy's life because he didn't deserve a second chance... and we were supposed to be ecstatic toward that blatant lack of justice, even Dirty Harry never got that philosophical.No revisionist western ever featured cold-blooded killers even as antiheroic protagonists, and Unforgiven's depiction of Munny in a positive light is one unforgivable case of narrative manipulation, something that apparently fooled the Academy. I guess all it takes is a great cinematography, a fine editing, these kind of introspective moments and of course, some twists like the kid admitting he never killed anyone. I saw that one coming by one mile, he was so cocky, so un-Eastwood, it was obvious he never did the 'hell of thing' thing.*** And speaking of the 'hell of a thing' I'll end up like I started, with another movie reference. There was a scene in McCabe & Mrs. Miller where John McCabe was chased by three ruthless killers, he had no chance. What did he do? He chickened out and tried to escape, the movie doesn't end here, but I just want to highlight that this man was the 'hero' of the film, and his reaction doesn't need words or a a pseudo meditative speech about life's value to make you get the point. *** This is true realism, real revisionist western, Unforgiven is just a Western with a reverse and manipulative classicism. And if one movie about a character legitimating a certain form of violence should have been the real winner that year, it was Malcolm X. But I guess, a bad-ass 'cow-boy' killer is more cinematically acceptable than a Black Muslim leader preaching self-defense.

Yet, an accident causes Phibes to become disfigured and can only speak through a speaker with some innovation and brilliant technical skills. With him, is a beautiful girl named Vulnavia. A woman who is as mysterious as Phibes is. Yet nobody knows where she comes from or when. In the middle of the killings, Scotland yard investigates further to try and catch Phibes before he kills again. Now with a new resolve, Phibe's finally makes his point by creating the same scene with the operating doctor's own wife. Doctor Vesalius must try and free her by operating on her body to retrieve a key which is buried inside her. But with a catch, above her is a six minute timer with tubes of acid ready to cause a new face lift like Phibes. With this mounting pressure, it gives Phibes a way to escape before Scotland yard can make a move. I thought this film was brilliant, lots of killing, ingenious ways to make a point, wonderful music to match the films eccentric look of the roaring twenties. Vincent Price is in my view, one of the most legendary actors of all time. A true passionate man of his craft. But his most impactive role was Baka in The Ten Commandments. He will be sorely missed by his fans. A wonderful talent. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2011","score":"","review":" What a classic horror film.
