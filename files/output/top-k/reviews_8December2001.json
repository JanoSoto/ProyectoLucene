I'm not here to rehash all that.Let me start out by saying that you'll read no spoilers here. Also, to each his own. While the overwhelming number seem to enjoy the film (as did I), others did not, and some of them make objective sense.That said; this is a truly clean movie. I am not one of those people who can read SEX into smoke plumes, but I detected no 'signals' (hidden or otherwise) of any sort. Adult themes do not come into play here, save the usual kissy stuff that may have offended a century ago, but not today. I would recommend the show to almost any age without reservation. This is a movie that (on the basis of suitability alone) should feature a prominent place somewhere on your video shelf.Next, the storyline. I liked Shrek, mind you, and Pixar's previous movies. Lord of the Rings is on my 'must watch' list as well, but Monsters, Inc is good enough to appeal on several levels at the same time. It is something new, although you might catch on to the 'most powerful' energy source (untapped at the beginning of the show) as soon as it is featured. If your children liked it at 3, they'll like it at 13, 23, and 30, but for more and different reasons.I have a heard a great deal about Harry Potter, prominently from the Christian fundamentalists who thoroughly disapprove of the entire concept. I'm a Christian fundamentalist-type myself, but don't let me put a crimp in your enjoyment. Never did like the chap, even when I first heard of him. Personally, I would prefer David Eddings' books be made into movies, except the gentleman doesn't want to do so. At any rate, Monster, Inc will never suffer that kind of adverse 'publicity', and I strongly doubt its effects will seem dated 50 years down the track (which will happen to Harry Potter, believe me!) Animation had its privileges; I still love Mickey Mouse and he's fairly old for a house rodent.Many shows require you to suspend your disbelief, and turn your brains off. Monsters, Inc doesn't require you to do so - at least, it does it for you very subtly. Just watch it. This show is a keeper.

But before I display my perspective, I'd like to address those of a few other people. For those of you who criticize The Breakfast Club, you're obviously not looking at it for the right reasons. If you see the characters as flat and the plot and its issues as mundane, you're analyzing the movie in an incorrect way. Maybe in viewing the movie you seem to have lapsed over the fact that the movie was a Teen movie dealing with Teen issues. (For the few who might suddenly think that this label turns all the characters into Alicia Silverstone look-a-likes talking about their hair, think of such movies as Rebel Without a Cause or even Cameron Crowe's older films, for example). The Breakfast Club manages to combine all it's character's into one setting (Shermer High School\/Shermer High School Library), without any major change in setting, character addition, or sudden abrupt plot twist and yet still manages to stay interesting. In such situation, one must assume the dialogue would hold the movie together, and for the most part, I'd say this is the case in The Breakfast Club. The steady humor (usually good) was very important for leveling out the (countering) occasional seriousness of the film. Some of the dialogue was filled with some rough phrasing; however, in my opinion, it could almost be considered intentional. When a group of teenagers, seemingly cast in completely different molds, are thrown together and suddenly find themselves talking about their own appropriate, deepest problems to these (formerly) strangers, would it honestly come out in the most articulate of speech? This is why I feel you shouldn't blame The Breakfast Club for its amateur psychology (as some have phrased it), or more more appropriately, I think it should be awarded for managing to deal with some issues of high school and teenage life that it did without creating some ludicrous, unbelievable situation inorder to achieve it. Even so, one should not dissect and scrutinize every single line; you can only appreciate the movie by absorbing it as a whole of its parts. To me, the gift of the The Breakfast Club is not one certain thing, but surely through it all we can find positive. The movie was very well acted by everyone of its characters and if one of them had gone astray it easily could have failed. However it was teenagers addressing their issues on their own terms, supplemented by laughs, that made The Breakfast Club into a great 80s movie, a great teen movie, and just a plain, great movie as well.

The feet in the lemonade stand made me laugh out loud, as did the ring and run doorbell scene, the multiple, Grouchos, the Groucho drawn on the vase, the people kicking their hind legs in the air in unison, the he's not here \/ it's for you routine, and several others.Having said that...The best comedy EVER?  Wow, your sense of humor is different from mine.  I know I laughed harder at almost all of the other Marx Bros movies.  This one was the one I remembered as a disappointment as it tried so hard to lampoon musicals and instead generally just looked stupid doing so.

In this case, it is Bruce Willis who stars as the grumpy older adult who, through some kind of miraculous intervention, is able to finally come to terms with his inner child - thereby rescuing himself from the emptiness of his emotionally cold, tragically loveless adult life. Russell M. Duritz is a successful image consultant so traumatized by being a picked-upon, bullied `dweeb' in his childhood that he has managed to block out virtually every memory, pleasant or unpleasant, of his scarred boyhood.  In his current life, Russell attempts to compensate for all his previous `faults' by becoming a career-driven, hardnosed cynic who is unable to connect with other human beings on anything close to a meaningful level.  Then, right on the eve of his epochal 40th birthday, a strange supernatural phenomenon occurs  Russell is suddenly confronted by a mysterious, soon-to-be-8-year-old tyke who, it turns out, is actually Russell himself 32 years earlier.  As the relationship between Russell and Rusty deepens, the older Russell learns not only to reconnect with his own past, but to absorb all the lessons little Rusty has to offer &#150; lessons that he, big Russell, in his race to adulthood, managed to forget along the way.`The Kid,' despite the fact that it is based essentially on a one-joke premise, manages to remain fresh and entertaining for most of its running time thanks to a clever and witty script by Audrey Wells, breezy direction by Jon Turteltaub and, above all, first class performances by Bruce Willis and Spencer Breslin who, as Russell and Rusty, achieve a winning rapport in their many scenes together.  Happily, the filmmakers have, for the most part, resisted the temptation to over dramatize the fantasy elements of the scenario &#150; which could easily have led to a great deal of lowbrow slapstick antics &#150; preferring, instead, to let the scenes between the two main characters play themselves out with a quiet naturalness, thereby allowing us to penetrate to the basic human realities at the core.

This fantasy thing is too wild for more realistic and grounded people who can only relate to cops and robbers movies or war movies. Fantasy movies require a bit of suspension of disbelief. That being said, if you're not the type that enjoys high spirited action\/fantasy, stay the hell away from this film. But if you ARE the type who enjoys rolicking sword play and a healthy dose of fantasy fun, accept no substitue, Highlander I is as good as it comes. The sequels were all horrible without exception, mainly because the original was written as a standalone work. Lambert plays a tragic character originally born in the Highlandes of Scotland centuries ago, made immortal by a little known accident of genetics that is never truly explained, and the mystery works here. MacLeod is cursed to have the loves of his life grow old and die while he lives on, making for a very lonely man. The movie is a little hard to comprehend at first, switching time periods from 15th to 20th centuries, but have faith, that much is explained.

But, if you went into the theatre looking to watch cool Hollywood stars put on a cool movie where each and every one of them gets at least 1 or two memorable scenes\/lines, then you exited the theatre with a big ol' smile on your face. Oceans 11 is fun, right from the very beginning when Danny Ocean is asked what he would do if he were released from prison right on through to the end. Clooney plays Danny Ocean as the straight up cool guy, the undisputed leader of the pack, who you yourself would follow into this caper just because the guy LOOKS like he knows what he is doing. Pitt is equally cool, suave, and kinda plays his character of Rusty as the old sage, even though he is obviously very young. You almost get the sense that while Clooney's character is the ring leader, the best thief\/con-man, may in fact be Pitt and there is never, ever a moment where you feel like Pitt is in danger of losing anything.Matt Damon does a good job as the youthful thief new to the big score (see the seventh gunslinger in the Magnificent Seven for a reference) and is given some good moments, especially with Barnie Mac. Cheadle, I thought, did a wonderful job as the British born, cockny accented thief, but the strange accent and the strange words used made it hard most of the time to pick out exactly what he was saying. Affleck and Cann are VERY funny as feuding brothers and have some of the funniest moments in the movie and rival only Carl Reiner as a movie stealer. Reiner is GREAT as the old Saul and brings is wonderful to watch on the screen.Now, my only contention with this movie comes in the form of Julia Roberts. I understand she is in this movie because she is a huge star and she wants to come hang out with all these cool guys in Vegas. She seems like a very nice woman, even though she can come across as a little fake, but can anyone tell me they believe she really is a great actress? I mean, come on, she plays the SAME character, herself, in every movie, and in every movie it gets older and older. Now, I understand in this movie you are not looking for Lady McBeth, but can anyone really tell me she looks AMAZING? Lets face it, this role is designed for one thing, the glamourous, gorgeous woman who takes your breath away. Julia is a really cute soccer mom, not Grace Kelly re-born. The introductory scene of her coming down the steps? It looked like she was having a hard time walking in her shoes. All I could imagine was a Catherine Zeta-Jones or even a Michele Phiefer, graceful, glamourous woman who would take the audiences breath away walking down those stairs and, in the end, Julia just comes up FAR short. She doesn't ruin this movie by any means, but I guess I just have a hard time seeing the obsession with her.But that being said, this is a fun movie. It never seems to sit still for too long, it blends all of the stars together nicely so you don't have that somewhat nagging feeling like, oh I wish so and so would have had a scene together. To me, this will forever be a modern version os The Sting. Is it laugh out loud funny? At points yes, but not all the way through. Is it tense and suspenseful? Yes, at certain times, but not all the way through? Is it cool and fun and well shot, well directed, and well acted? Absolutely, throughout the whole thing.

Okay, so it wasn't exactly Oscar material, but I think the film reviewers were very unfair to it. I mean, think about it, if this movie starred perhaps Susan Sarandon and Robert DeNiro people would've adored it. Because the films morals were based around friendship of a young generation, I don't think many critics older than these people really understand. Myself been around that age, I can see where the writers are coming from. Their goals are good, they achieve them and the script is very well organised. The film is also not too far-fetched, unlike I expected. The plot is different and interesting, and it's a mystery the way the movie turns out. Brokedown Palace's premise wins it over because of how well developed and atmospheric the movie feels. Claire Danes gives another stunning performance, her best since William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet in 1996. She is one of the most underrated and most talented young actresses in Hollywood today, and her performances are well chosen. She gets into her character and chooses the right ways to descriptively put across her characters anger or happiness or whatever feeling. Usually Claire chooses to play complicated characters, and she plays these excellently. I just really enjoy her acting style and wanted to put that across! Kate Beckinsale also does well, and it is impressive the way she has moved from Brokedown Palace to one of the most anticipated films of all time, Pearl Harbour. Kudos to all actors who participated!Of course, there are some faults that bring this movie below 8\/10 or 9\/10 material, and one of those things is the ending. I felt like it just left the movie on a bit of an unfinished note, although it was not at all predictable. Some scenes are pointless and the court sequences are a bit repetitive.

I enjoyed the plot of eleven men trying to rob five casino's (Flamingo, Sands, Desert Inn, Rivera, and Sahara) at the same time on New Year's Eve.  The problem is that the movie took about an hour to get started talking about the heist and once it was done it was like, ho-hum.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie more the more times I watched it, but seeing Ol' Blue Eyes, Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Pal Joey pulling pranks on the Russian boss who is put together the heist and and playing pranks on each other, it reminded me of party crashing someone's party, or watching a party that happened eons ago.  I thought that a remake of OCEAN'S 11 would be a great movie, if it is done in a caper-heist style.  Steve Soddenberg thought so also, and now his latest film is the remake of OCEAN'S 11.      Instead of a modern Rat Pack Soddenberg casted well played actors for his version.  Replacing One Take Frank is George Clooney as Danny Ocean.  That is a perfect casting choice, I can't think of another actor out there who is super-cooler than Clooney.  Ocean is just released from a minimum New Jersey State Prison after serving five years.  He immediately violates parole by seeing his old partner Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) in Hollywood.  Danny suggests to Dusty to not rob one but three casinos in Las Vegas (Belliago, Mirage, & MGM Grand), the three biggest money making casinos all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).  Danny wants to get revenge on Terry because Terry is engaged to Danny's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) which Danny is still in love with, and Danny wants to win Tess back.  Danny and Dusty put together a team fianced by Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) a former casino manager, who's casino was bought out by Benedict to have it be demolished in a ground-breaking ceremony.  The team includes Danny, Dusty, Ruben, Frank (Bernie Mac) a blackjack dealer, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) a demolitions expert, Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck & Scott Cann) two screwball mechanics, Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) a gambler, a electronics expert (Edward Jenison), a carnival trapeeze artist (Shaobo Quin), and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) a master pickpocket.  Together these 11 men try to pull off a heist that has never been done in Las Vegas, up against a man who will not only ruin the lives of those trying to rob him, but also the lives of the would-be robber's family.      OCEAN'S 11 is a film that Soddenberg made only for entertainment purposes.  OCEAN'S does pull something off that has never been done in Hollywood in a long time IT'S BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!!  This movie is fast, funny, exciting, and entertaining all at the same time.  I just watched the original OCEAN'S 11 again last week, I think it will be a while before I can sit down and watch the Rat Pack again.  This version I have already seen twice and plan on seeing it again!        Soddenberg chops out all the slow romance borning parts of the original, and the sub-plot involving Ceaser Romero and makes this version very enjoyable.  I was amazed that Soddenberg got permission to shoot this movie inside the Belliago casino, since it is the target of getting robbed in the film. The shots of Las Vegas are beautiful (like Dean Martin sang in Ain't That A Kick In the Head.)  There is one shot in the movie of a Las Vegas blackout that blew my mind away, how many of you could imagine a complete blackout in Las Vegas?        The acting and dialogue between the actors is another major standout.  Lines like, Ocean Does he (Terry) make you laugh?  Tess He doesn't make me cry the way I use to.  Ouch!  Sharp dialogue even from the heroine, that is very rare.  The dialogue between the 11 guys, Tess, and Terry are all enjoyable, it's the kind of dialogue that made PULP FICTION and JERRY MAGUIRE well liked and famous movies that are still being quoted today.  Clooney and Pitt do stand out with their acting from the crew, but Gould and Reiner also do impressive jobs also stealing the show from Clooney and Pitt that it shows that old dogs still have what it takes to run the show.      Is OCEAN'S 11 the best movie of the year?  No, is it the most entertaining?  You betcha!  This is the kind of popcorn movie that I enjoy big stars, flashy locations, sharp dialogue, and wonderful plot twists.  Now I think Michael Bay, Simon West, Jan De Bont, and Stephen Sommers need to all sit down and watch this movie.  That way they can get an idea on how to make a big budget entertaining film that works, and not fizzles (i.e. TOMB RAIDER, MUMMY RETURNS, THE HAUNTING, etc.)  Classic film, no, enjoyable and watchable more than once? definitly! ***** (out of five)     ","genre":null},{"date":"8 December 2001","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"       I watched the original OCEAN'S 11 about six years ago when I was in my Las Vegas kick.  I enjoyed the plot of eleven men trying to rob five casino's (Flamingo, Sands, Desert Inn, Rivera, and Sahara) at the same time on New Year's Eve.  The problem is that the movie took about an hour to get started talking about the heist and once it was done it was like, ho-hum.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie more the more times I watched it, but seeing Ol' Blue Eyes, Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Pal Joey pulling pranks on the Russian boss who is put together the heist and and playing pranks on each other, it reminded me of party crashing someone's party, or watching a party that happened eons ago.  I thought that a remake of OCEAN'S 11 would be a great movie, if it is done in a caper-heist style.  Steve Soddenberg thought so also, and now his latest film is the remake of OCEAN'S 11.      Instead of a modern Rat Pack Soddenberg casted well played actors for his version.  Replacing One Take Frank is George Clooney as Danny Ocean.  That is a perfect casting choice, I can't think of another actor out there who is super-cooler than Clooney.  Ocean is just released from a minimum New Jersey State Prison after serving five years.  He immediately violates parole by seeing his old partner Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) in Hollywood.  Danny suggests to Dusty to not rob one but three casinos in Las Vegas (Belliago, Mirage, & MGM Grand), the three biggest money making casinos all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).  Danny wants to get revenge on Terry because Terry is engaged to Danny's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) which Danny is still in love with, and Danny wants to win Tess back.  Danny and Dusty put together a team fianced by Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) a former casino manager, who's casino was bought out by Benedict to have it be demolished in a ground-breaking ceremony.  The team includes Danny, Dusty, Ruben, Frank (Bernie Mac) a blackjack dealer, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) a demolitions expert, Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck & Scott Cann) two screwball mechanics, Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) a gambler, a electronics expert (Edward Jenison), a carnival trapeeze artist (Shaobo Quin), and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) a master pickpocket.  Together these 11 men try to pull off a heist that has never been done in Las Vegas, up against a man who will not only ruin the lives of those trying to rob him, but also the lives of the would-be robber's family.      OCEAN'S 11 is a film that Soddenberg made only for entertainment purposes.  OCEAN'S does pull something off that has never been done in Hollywood in a long time IT'S BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!!  This movie is fast, funny, exciting, and entertaining all at the same time.  I just watched the original OCEAN'S 11 again last week, I think it will be a while before I can sit down and watch the Rat Pack again.  This version I have already seen twice and plan on seeing it again!        Soddenberg chops out all the slow romance borning parts of the original, and the sub-plot involving Ceaser Romero and makes this version very enjoyable.  I was amazed that Soddenberg got permission to shoot this movie inside the Belliago casino, since it is the target of getting robbed in the film. The shots of Las Vegas are beautiful (like Dean Martin sang in Ain't That A Kick In the Head.)  There is one shot in the movie of a Las Vegas blackout that blew my mind away, how many of you could imagine a complete blackout in Las Vegas?        The acting and dialogue between the actors is another major standout.  Lines like, Ocean Does he (Terry) make you laugh?  Tess He doesn't make me cry the way I use to.  Ouch!  Sharp dialogue even from the heroine, that is very rare.  The dialogue between the 11 guys, Tess, and Terry are all enjoyable, it's the kind of dialogue that made PULP FICTION and JERRY MAGUIRE well liked and famous movies that are still being quoted today.  Clooney and Pitt do stand out with their acting from the crew, but Gould and Reiner also do impressive jobs also stealing the show from Clooney and Pitt that it shows that old dogs still have what it takes to run the show.      Is OCEAN'S 11 the best movie of the year?  No, is it the most entertaining?  You betcha!
