I never saw anything coming, everything was very scary and surprising. The film starts off the bat with the whole concept of the film, teenagers and their interactions with each other, especially with Carrie White. I feel that Sissy Spacek was THE actress for this job, I don't think anyone could have pulled it off quite as good as she could have. She is a grown woman, and yet she totally looks like a young girl. I love her country-ish accent, and her looks in general fit the part. How can I put this? WHen she wanted to look angelic, she could with very little effort, but when she wanted to look scary, she could do that, too! It's magic! Honestly, I think the whole cast was perfect, and this is probably why this movie is probably my favorite , all generas combined. The girls were truly vile towards Carrie, and it felt real. The mother played by Piper Laurie was brilliant, too. WHile she was mean to Carrie, it seemed she was more over the top with her than actually beating her up or anything. (Like dragging her into the closet, throwing her drink into her face when they are at the dinner table.) She is just so wrapped up in her religion(which by the way she has it all out of proportion!) that she forgets everything else, I think. Of course, Carrie getting her period was the ultimate sin (to her) and everything gets weirder from there. WHat an ingenious mind for Stephen King to come up with this tale. A group of kids throwing pig blood on a girl they hate (wrongfully)at the prom? They had it all worked out, and thought they were so brilliant. Carrie sets them straight, though. Maybe that's why I love this movie so much is that the person you feel the most for actually gets back at her attackers in the most heinous ways, in ways in which they deserve. (Example..the little kid saying Creepy Carrie! Creepy Carrie! gets knocked over on his bike for his offense,which wasn't nice, but wasn't really a big deal. The pig blood thing was a much bigger deal, thus payback was MUCH worse.)After everything is said and done, Carrie goes home and realizes, perhaps, her mother is right about everything after all, and after she bathes, she is with her mother, saying, Momma, hold me, and she does, and then her mom stabs her, literally in the back! This was one of the weirdest parts of the movie to me, because I think after the prom thing Carrie would have been more apt to go along with her mother's views, no matter how wayward. I guess her mom was just around the twist by this time, though. I find it eerily ironic that she dies in the same pose as her psudeo-savior statuette in her 'prayer closet'. The end was one last little freaky thing, when the hand comes out of the rocks. Of course, I was 10 the first time seeing this, it was dark and I was already scared out of my wits from the previous scenes. Of course, MY mother jumps out at me when the hand comes up, when that scary music is going, and I fall off the end of the couch! It was the greatest!This is one of THE classic stories and movies of all time,psychological,thrilling, suspenseful,everything! Highly recommended!

Rather than be gratuitous on the gore, atmosphere and shocks front, Don't Look Now simply presents it's story and the horror almost seems like an afterthought. Usually, films like this annoy me because they obviously want to portray the horror, but skirt around it in order to not be put in with the less intelligent offerings from the genre; but this one clearly cares about it's story and characters, and never really sets out to scare. The film, therefore, comes off as being assured and well handled throughout, and even though the plot is slow; the film can never be described as boring because there's always enough bubbling under the surface of the immediate goings on in order to keep the viewers' interest. The plot is shrouded with mystery and follows a father who finds his daughter drowned in a nearby lake. He and his wife then move to picturesque Venice, but the memory of their daughter cannot be laid to rest after a blind psychic tells the woman that she has seen her daughter may still be alive.I love the horror genre, but I admit that a large proportion of it can't be compared among the true classics of cinema due largely to a lack of production values, good acting or a decent script that is coherent with the story and characters. Don't Look Now, however, often appears on film lists amongst the classics because this is one of the films that is strong in those areas. The acting is first rate, with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie giving brilliant brooding performances that are in line with their characters and the film's plot. Sutherland can be something of a one-note actor, but when a performer is given the right material it allows them to shine and his role in this film fits him like a glove. One of the main compliments that this film gets is the cinematography, as the film expertly captures the beauty of it's central location. Venice's canals and dark alleys are as much a part of this film as the plot itself, and it is testament to Nicolas Roeg's directorial talent that this has been expertly captured in a way that helps the film. On the whole, this is a fine horror film that will be enjoyed by anyone that is willing to put time and effort into it. It's also worth noting that this film pays it's viewers at the climax with one of the best twist endings in the horror genre. Highly recommended!

The film was entitled 'Predator' and I remember the catchphrase of the film being, 'nothing like has be seen on earth before' which was quite fitting seeing how I had never seen a horror film before (I was only 8!). Little did I know but by watching this film I would be creating an expectation in me that I would use to benchmark other films, of a similar genre, for years to come. As it happens I am still waiting for a film to better 'Predator' of course the Alien series comes close, with maybe Aliens coming in on an even par, though with 'Predator' being my introduction to sci-fi horror it still has a slight edge.One of the things that impress's me the most about this film, is the direction given by the director, John Mc Tiernan. Within the action movie genre there is a tendency for the films to rely heavily on the gun fights, explosions and violence to provide the audience with the gratification they need to enjoy the film. Things like plot, script and character development are usually neglected or in some cases ignored completely (anyone seen DNA!!). This is a complete contrast in the film 'Predator', which I feel is the driving force of the movie. For example the character Hawkins, the funny guy, who is continually telling jokes. This character is much smaller then the rest of the group and also looks less threatening, which is maybe why the predator kill's him first. As a result Hawkins uses his humour to gain acceptance from the group. This is portrayed in the scenes where he is telling Billy his jokes. In relation to Billy here is another interesting case, his Indian American sixth sense is used to fantastic effect, within the context of the film it is used to create tension and fear amongst all the other characters. This can clearly be seen in the conversation between him and Poncho. Billy say's that he is 'scared' and Poncho replies 'you ain't afraid of no man'. Emphasising that Billy is one tough mother and is scared of know body, but when it comes to the thing hunting them, he knows that their days are numbered.As I have already stated this film set down a bench mark for me and probably for this movie genre in general. The whole concept of the film, the action, suspense, horror and originality makes this film not just one of my best films of all time but one of the classic sci-fi horrors as well.

The film was entitled 'Predator' and I remember the catchphrase of the film being, 'nothing like has be seen on earth before' which was quite fitting seeing how I had never seen a horror film before (I was only 8!). Little did I know but by watching this film I would be creating an expectation in me that I would use to benchmark other films, of a similar genre, for years to come. As it happens I am still waiting for a film to better 'Predator' of course the Alien series comes close, with maybe Aliens coming in on an even par, though with 'Predator' being my introduction to sci-fi horror it still has a slight edge.One of the things that impress's me the most about this film, is the direction given by the director, John Mc Tiernan. Within the action movie genre there is a tendency for the films to rely heavily on the gun fights, explosions and violence to provide the audience with the gratification they need to enjoy the film. Things like plot, script and character development are usually neglected or in some cases ignored completely (anyone seen DNA!!). This is a complete contrast in the film 'Predator', which I feel is the driving force of the movie. For example the character Hawkins, the funny guy, who is continually telling jokes. This character is much smaller then the rest of the group and also looks less threatening, which is maybe why the predator kill's him first. As a result Hawkins uses his humour to gain acceptance from the group. This is portrayed in the scenes where he is telling Billy his jokes. In relation to Billy here is another interesting case, his Indian American sixth sense is used to fantastic effect, within the context of the film it is used to create tension and fear amongst all the other characters. This can clearly be seen in the conversation between him and Poncho. Billy say's that he is 'scared' and Poncho replies 'you ain't afraid of no man'. Emphasising that Billy is one tough mother and is scared of know body, but when it comes to the thing hunting them, he knows that their days are numbered.As I have already stated this film set down a bench mark for me and probably for this movie genre in general. The whole concept of the film, the action, suspense, horror and originality makes this film not just one of my best films of all time but one of the classic sci-fi horrors as well.

ARCANE (LOUIS JORDAN) steal the formula, but not until an accident occurs that sees Alec covered in the material & set on fire. Jumping into the swamp, Alec appears to be dead, but nothing could be further from the truth, as he re-emerges as SWAMP THING (DICK DUROCK) after the swamp water & the chemical he created & was dosed with, combined together. From there, he sets out on a blind path of revenge, taking out all of Arcane's men one by one. While Arcane learns the secret of the formula itself to help him transform into a creature that's determined to kill Swamp Thing, before Swamp Thing can get him. SWAMP THING is a highly entertaining monster movie, that despite it's comic book connections, bares little resemblance to a superhero movie & more so to a Horror\/Sci-fi film. Upon release, many fans kicked that the film strayed to far from the original source material, like changing Agent Cable from a man to a woman (Played by the former Mrs. Carpenter ADRIENNE BARBEAU) in order to have a love interest for the hero & changing the diabolical Arcane from an ageing magician, to a crazed & jealous scientist & the films lack of dark moodiness of the source material. I on the other hand enjoyed the picture, true it could have been better in a lot of areas, in particular the plot, which is paper thin at best, but the atmosphere is cool & the soundtrack is okay (By Friday The 13th composer HARRY MANFREDINI) although I agree with most that Harry was probably the wrong guy to try & score this movie, since it sounds to much like a Jason movie than a superhero one. Dick Durock plays Swamp Thing well, able to display all the right emotions the script called for the creature to go through. While Louis Jordan is a little to hammy for my liking as Arcane. RAY WISE plays Alec Holland well & Adrienne Barbeau made for an interesting love interest, I really liked her character. On the down side, aside from the minor things I mentioned like the score, & Jordan's role as Arcane, the only thing that bugged me was the plot, which after the opening twenty minutes, merely is a paper thin, as we view scene after scene almost of Barbeau's character running from the villains, being caught by the villains, having Swamp Thing save her & then going through the motions all over again after she is caught & the monster costume used on Arcane at the end after he transforms, is so fake looking it's laughable, thankfully Director WES CRAVEN shows less of the creature in close ups, since I think even he knew how silly the monster suit looked, so it's really not that hard to take. But the fight scenes are lacking any kind of excitement & that's really to bad, since there are several scenes in the film that have a decent modicum of suspense. Director WES CRAVEN seems like an odd pick to helm such material, since his background was mostly in horror & not superhero's, but he fares very well behind the camera. Definitely worth a look for fans of the comic, or all around horror fans from which this film has a horror movie feels to it, rather than an action movie feel. Followed by two TV series, one live action & the other animated & a sequel THE RETURN OF SWAMP THING.**** stars ","genre":null},{"date":"19 September 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In this adoption of the popular comic book series, RAY WISE stars as Biochemist ALEC Holland, who has created a formula that can regenerate organic matter, however a break in one night at his lab sees his rival, the diabolical DR.

I think so.This is one of Sylvester Stallone's forgotten movies where he reminds you of Al Pacino as Serpico at times with his benevolent nature and the facial hair. He doesn't slur his monosyllabic sentences, or act as if he has lost more IQ points. Until this film came out, I didn't think there was much more to Stallone. Sadly, I was too young to see this all by myself in the theatres and saw it a year later on cable. And when I saw Rutger Hauer, I was amazed at how creepy the man was!

Billy Dee Williams's character was bland that I didn't find myself rooting for nor hating him. Lindsay Wagner is expendable and I wish the late Persis Khambatta was able to stretch her role a little more. She was Hauer's perfect, plausible counterpart (and spoke some wicked French and German). Nigel Davenport is the typical foreign expert on the subject that gives the film an interesting transatlantic angle.I found myself bored by the end of the first forty-five minutes, until the montage of Stallone and Williams looking for clues to the dead flight attendant at the various discoteques. And then when this movie came on TV, they changed the two songs in the disco Brown Sugar from the Stones and I'm a Man from Keith Emerson to seventies stock tunes. Must of been a lawsuit pending. Suffice the music, there is a brutal, ten-minute-long chase through subway tunnels, a station, and then on the train itself. Afterwards, there's some downtime, but Wulfgar (Hauer) is at the point of no return now that the po-po has a physical description of him. So much for the plastic surgery. You can now sense the desperation he has, and he already knows he's not going to get a happy ending so that's why he decides to air-out Stallone's ex-wife (played by Wagner in two or three brief snippets). So you know that he's gonna lose, it's just HOW he is going to lose makes you watch the rest of it. You can also see that Stallone's character struggles with himself on how he'd rather bring Wulfgar in than kill the terrorist (he's got those law-enforcing ideology and beliefs going on overtime).But the problem about this film is that it is so dated and by-the-numbers judging from today's standards, that it's almost a flat-out documentary. The formula is typical seventies where the exposition is gradually set up until the middle of the film- and by then the viewer is bored- but the action and suspense takes place throughout the rest (you'll notice from the Dirty Harry, Rocky, and Star Wars movies, the later Indiana Jones flicks, along with Serpico, The French Connection, etc). However, Nighthawks was clearly ahead of its time, and I could see a remake or something like this being done down the road from now. See, NOW it might sell because we've seen it in our own front yard. Get Vin Diesel to play Stallone's role; Tyrese Gibson to play Billy Dee Williams; Lindsay Wagner's character's axed; Cillian Murphy will be Rutger Hauer; Clive Owen can play Nigel Davenport's role; Milla Jovovich can be Shakka, and Michael Clarke Duncan will play their Lieutenant.But leave in the I do not enjoy killing, but it's my job-line.Still good for its time !

Worst&#133;casting&#133;ever! And Judi Dench is a great M and Samantha Bond is a fantastic Moneypenny. Although I have to say that I'm always distracted by Samantha Bond's nose. Its got a life of its own. Take a look when you watch it next. (I've seen this film too many times&#133;) The only negative is that Desmond Llewelyn seems to be reading his dialogue from cue cards. He seems to be looking beyond Bond in their scene. I guess he must have had trouble remembering the jargon-heavy lines. But I still find it rather distracting. (Again, I've seen this film far too many times&#133;) But I guess what most people judge Bond films by, is the action. Well, in that regard, it's more than adequate. The opening stunt has to be the highlight. Stunts are so much more impressive when you're allowed to believe your eyes, when they're actually done for real. And the dam jump is possibly the best stunt I've seen.After that you have the plane sequence. This bit is silly as hell. Bond rides off a cliff, catches up to a free-falling plane &#150; despite it falling under both the force of gravity and its engines &#150; and pulls it out of its descent into a mountain. It's ridiculous, but hey, that's Bond. Since when have the laws of physics and plausibility bound this immortal? Better, though, is the tank sequence. It's a novel spin on the obligatory car chase and it's well done &#150; although whoever was responsible for the Perrier product placement should hang their head in shame. But my favourite piece of action, aside from the dam jump, is the fight between Bond and Trevelyan. It's just a good no-frills, no-holds-barred piece of fighting between the two main characters &#150; usually, at the end of a Bond film, Bond has to stop some bomb or some device, or kill loads of faceless henchman or some effete villain. Therefore it's nice just to have a straight up fight end a Bond film. Sure you have a bit of extraneous detail to tie up the plot, but, as ever, it doesn't matter. It's just background noise. But although I like the fight, there's still more silliness. After falling a few hundred feet, Trevelyan is not only still alive but only has a slightly bloody nose. I'm sure it was a concession to the censors, but it's quite amazing how indestructible movie folk are.But watching the film back I was quite impressed at how intelligent the film is, certainly compared to subsequent Bond films. There's some good stuff about the end of the Cold War and Russia's transition from communism to capitalism. And the scene between Bond and M intelligently addresses the fears that Bond, as a character, is too dated. Quite rightly the film ensures that it's only the world that changes &#150; Bond remains the same. And there are references to Stalin, the Second Word War and Roman mythology. It may just be a Bond film, but at least it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. (It's also a nice detail that Bond and Alec meet up in a Soviet graveyard full of communist relics.) But the film also has an excellent sense of humour. There are some real corkers How do you take it? Straight up&#133;with a twist, I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank and She always did enjoy a good squeeze. Add all of this to a fantastic score (which I'm unusual among Bond fans in liking), some excellent miniature work (always better than bad CGI&#133;I'm pointing at you Die Another Day) and a superb Bond in Pierce Brosnan, and you have one of the best films in the series.

It's just a good no-frills, no-holds-barred piece of fighting between the two main characters &#150; usually, at the end of a Bond film, Bond has to stop some bomb or some device, or kill loads of faceless henchman or some effete villain. Therefore it's nice just to have a straight up fight end a Bond film. Sure you have a bit of extraneous detail to tie up the plot, but, as ever, it doesn't matter. It's just background noise. But although I like the fight, there's still more silliness. After falling a few hundred feet, Trevelyan is not only still alive but only has a slightly bloody nose. I'm sure it was a concession to the censors, but it's quite amazing how indestructible movie folk are.But watching the film back I was quite impressed at how intelligent the film is, certainly compared to subsequent Bond films. There's some good stuff about the end of the Cold War and Russia's transition from communism to capitalism. And the scene between Bond and M intelligently addresses the fears that Bond, as a character, is too dated. Quite rightly the film ensures that it's only the world that changes &#150; Bond remains the same. And there are references to Stalin, the Second Word War and Roman mythology. It may just be a Bond film, but at least it doesn't insult the audience's intelligence. (It's also a nice detail that Bond and Alec meet up in a Soviet graveyard full of communist relics.) But the film also has an excellent sense of humour. There are some real corkers How do you take it? Straight up&#133;with a twist, I like a woman who enjoys pulling rank and She always did enjoy a good squeeze. Add all of this to a fantastic score (which I'm unusual among Bond fans in liking), some excellent miniature work (always better than bad CGI&#133;I'm pointing at you Die Another Day) and a superb Bond in Pierce Brosnan, and you have one of the best films in the series.

None of the subsequent films have been as fun, as well written or as memorable. In fact, they've all been disappointingly bland. The franchise has regressed rather than moved forward.But GoldenEye was a welcome return to form in 1995 (although I like the previous film Licence to Kill) and it still stands up. The action scenes are superb, the dialogue is pithy and it has quite a few memorable characters, which makes the film stand out even more considering how forgettable most of the characters have been in subsequent films. I mean, who can forget that blonde bloke from Tomorrow Never Dies? Or the nuclear physicist with the large rack in The World is Not Enough? Or the bald geezer out of Die Another Day? They were characters for the ages&#133; But like I say, GoldenEye is stocked with great characters. Just take Xenia Onatopp. How can you not like a woman who crushes men between her thighs? Plus she also has a penchant for fascistic leather military uniforms and a desire to shoot people while moaning like a whore. I dig that. Then there's Alec Trevelyan &#150; a plumy, lecherous, traitorous former MI6 agent who says things like, You know, James&#133;I was always better. I dig that too. And there's Zukovsky, computer geek Boris and General Ourumov. Out of these, Ourumov has to be my favourite, largely because he has a hip flask and a huge nose. Always a good combination. (I also have to mention that I love how camp his stance is when he 'executes' 006. All I'll say is, I'm a little teapot.) And Jack Wade is good too. Sure he's a concession to American audiences, but he represents them well &#150; he's an overweight loudmouth.Even the token totty stand up well. Izabella Scorupco is a fine looking woman, but, get this, she can actually act. And the fact that she can act makes it easy to overlook the fact that she's far too attractive to be a computer programmer. The same can't be said of Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough. Worst&#133;casting&#133;ever! And Judi Dench is a great M and Samantha Bond is a fantastic Moneypenny. Although I have to say that I'm always distracted by Samantha Bond's nose. Its got a life of its own. Take a look when you watch it next. (I've seen this film too many times&#133;) The only negative is that Desmond Llewelyn seems to be reading his dialogue from cue cards. He seems to be looking beyond Bond in their scene. I guess he must have had trouble remembering the jargon-heavy lines. But I still find it rather distracting. (Again, I've seen this film far too many times&#133;) But I guess what most people judge Bond films by, is the action. Well, in that regard, it's more than adequate. The opening stunt has to be the highlight. Stunts are so much more impressive when you're allowed to believe your eyes, when they're actually done for real. And the dam jump is possibly the best stunt I've seen.After that you have the plane sequence. This bit is silly as hell. Bond rides off a cliff, catches up to a free-falling plane &#150; despite it falling under both the force of gravity and its engines &#150; and pulls it out of its descent into a mountain. It's ridiculous, but hey, that's Bond. Since when have the laws of physics and plausibility bound this immortal? Better, though, is the tank sequence. It's a novel spin on the obligatory car chase and it's well done &#150; although whoever was responsible for the Perrier product placement should hang their head in shame.

I didn't believe the characters' personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives. The play within the play is very much dated and would not, I think, carry it's own weight in a real time production. But that's beside the point. What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about.

Firstly, there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple the lead actor, who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer, becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial (with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience) with her pants off. He trashes the place and chases them all out. I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach. The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high-school rendering of Death of a Salesman, i.e., not well. Please stop hitting me over the head with this high-handed significance. The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who, eventually, turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays-corrupt Church. Why. Why does she sleep with this guy. It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain. Ah, the saintly whore and the lovable old coot.

Near the end, when London's character expresses his dissatisfaction with his current state of affairs as a football jock\/king at school, you get the impression he's in for a brutal wake up call in the next decade. Then again, he might have become a stockbroker or something (oops, didn't a lot of them jump out of windows in the next few years?).It's an interesting mind game a viewer can play, guessing where all these dazed teens will end up in the eighties and onward. But, the main thrill is just immersing yourself in that time frame, which the film just oozes out of every frame. I still remember a T-Shirt I had towards the end of that decade; it read the fifties were grease; the sixties were grass; the seventies are gross.

Near the end, when London's character expresses his dissatisfaction with his current state of affairs as a football jock\/king at school, you get the impression he's in for a brutal wake up call in the next decade. Then again, he might have become a stockbroker or something (oops, didn't a lot of them jump out of windows in the next few years?).It's an interesting mind game a viewer can play, guessing where all these dazed teens will end up in the eighties and onward.

This is THE movie for anyone who went to high school in the seventies, say from 1974 - '79, if you're looking for some nostalgic trip back to your high school years. And also, anyone curious about those years, say to compare to your high school years in the eighties. Director Linklater put together a super cast, most of whom went on to at least fine character role careers. Hauser, here as the charismatic Benny (also a bigot in a deleted scene) is only now attempting to jump start a leading man career. We all know what Affleck & McConaughey went on to (lousy leading man careers). Both play creeps in this pic, and these remain possibly their best roles - something of a revelation now. Jovovich & Posey came close to being big time starlets years later. Cochrane & Goldberg provide most of the biting humor, as they would continue to do in other films. London, in the central BMoC role, enjoyed a girlish fan following for several years. One exception is Sasha Jenson, for some reason, who sort of disappeared, despite a standout performance. This film has developed into the American Graffiti for the seventies grunge generation and has by now attained near-classic status.The pic captures the aimlessness, the grungy feel of the teenagers back then. This was at a time when many parents were pursuing their own interests, whether at work or play, mostly leaving the kids to their own devices (as opposed to previous decades, when the typical nuclear family was composed of stay-at-home moms and working dads whose focus was somehow 100% on the offspring).

The first time I watched this (September 2005), I had no idea why the party brothers made me watch this film. I thought it had nothing really worth going out of your way for.

This story was very well crafted.The ending (I won't reveal it) was very predictable and incredibly cliché. At least, part of it was. But there's one minor twist that will surprise you and make you want to watch it over again. I had forgotten it from the first viewing and it struck me hard.This film was ranked one of the best horror films of 2000-2009, and I think that's fair. Granted, some people think Jeepers Creepers is great. But this one really was overlooked, despite being pimped out by the likes of Stephen King and Sam Raimi.

Basically Robin of Locksley (Kevin Costner) started out as some kind of hopeful guy who wanted to help his local town of Nottingham with his friend Azeem (Morgan Freeman). He later sets up the Merry Men team, including Christian Slater as Will Scarlett, Michael McShane as Friar Tuck and Nick Brimble as Little John. But he also meets his beautiful love interest, Marian Dubois (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). The only person trying to stop Robin from stealing from the rich and giving to the poor is the really, really mean Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Also starring Brian Blessed as Lord Locksley and a very brief Sir Sean Connery as King Richard. What most people remember about this film more though is the 16 week number one single, Bryan Adams' (Everything I Do) I Do It for You, which was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Number One Singles, but also number 14 on The 100 Worst Pop Records, why?

Still, there are a lot of silly horror flicks that were released in the 90's debut year, and, surprisingly, this one isn't all that bad. It lacks all the elements that make great films great films, of course; things such as brains, coherency and any whisper of characters has been neglected in favour of monster special effects and a few nice death scenes; but seriously, that's all you want from a film like this, so to say that Graveyard Shift does it's job isn't wrong. The film is based on a short story by Stephen King. Nearly everything that King has ever touched has been turned into a film, with a lot of mixed results. I would put this one in the middling category, which isn't a bad place to be in considering all the failed adaptations. The plot is typically thin (it is a SHORT story!) and it follows a man who gets a job in a cotton mill. The place is infested with rats, and after being charged with cleaning the place up, our hero finds a trapdoor and soon he and his team are up against the reason rats have made their home in the mill...One thing that really stands out about this film is the atmosphere. Director Ralph S. Singleton delights in presenting a fetid and disturbing aura around the central location, and this helps the story massively and gives the film an almost 'odyssey' approach when the characters finally make their way underground. I don't find rats scary, personally, but many people do and this film could easily be a reason why! The way that the rats surround the characters is brooding and frightening and provides the film with one of it's key elements. Acting definitely isn't a key element of Graveyard Shift, but the appearance of popular cult actor Brad Dourif will please many of this films' audience. I'm not a massive of fan of Dourif personally, but I respect his ability to shine in campy productions. The story doesn't offer anything in the way of a point, and it's incoherency will annoy many - but if you go into this film with the right sort of expectations, and don't think you're about to see a horror classic, Graveyard Shift really shouldn't disappoint.

However, I respectfully submit that Mr & Mrs Corrington (with input from Seltzer, Sagal & Heston) knew that most visions of the far future are going to appear deficient with the passage of time. See Soylent Green. Accordingly, they set the film in roughly the same time period that Matheson used in I Am Legend. In the novel, the story covered the period of 1975 to 1979.In this way, the 1971 film is best viewed as a kind of alternative reality for the way American culture was evolving in the turbulent late '60s\/early '70s. When so viewed, the film is not only clever, but is really inspired. *** SPOILER ALERT****Matheson's concept was to try to use science fiction to give some credibility to the vampire legend. That had been tried, to a point, in House of Dracula, when the scientist isolated a microorganism that had infected Dracula. Matheson went further and in so doing over-extended the premise. The novel is very poignant in parts. However, its primary problem is that tried to create a kind of moral equivalency between Neville and the vampires. That weakened the strength of the narrative. In the novel Neville drank canned tomato juice, like the vampires drank blood? Parts were just silly vampire women disrobed to lure Neville outside after dark; the head vampire resembled Oliver Hardy. By the end, Matheson was apparently trying to persuade the reader that the vampires were just an alternate form of life, infected with vampirus, that was just trying to survive and deserved pity. For, in different circumstances, normal is relative and Neville became the fearsome legend for the new breed of humanity, i.e., he became the new Dracula. Not so for the 1971 concept; no relativism here. The world war to which Matheson only alluded was made explicit. Neville became a high-level military scientist (who better to have access to a potential vaccine?), not Matheson's layman who was trying to teach himself about microbiology.The victims of the virus became vicious, homicidal, collectivistic, anti-technologists, beyond reason and compromise. Colonel Robert Neville, US Army Medical Corps, became the object of their fury. His antagonist Jonathan Matthias, TV newsman\/pundit, adept at influencing an audience. Media Monster. He is the fallen one, who creates the Mansonesque Family, rejecting all traditional American values. It is the counter-culture. Colonel Neville, by contrast, is the establishment. Hard-drinking, exceedingly well-armed (thank you, NRA!) and not averse to zapping the zombies. However, he is compassionate and enlightened. He falls for an Afro-American woman (the late Rosalind Cash) and tries to help her (Heston also marched for civil rights in the early '60s with Rev. King).By the end, we realize that He is the savior. If we partake of His blood, we will be saved. Christians call that the Eucharist. Ultimately, he sacrifices Himself for the good of humanity, so that the normal world, America, will be re-born. The little girl survivor senses it, He is God, or at least a man chosen to be God's agent on Earth. He is, of course, also a soldier, one who is willing to lay down his life so that others might live. No relativism here.Very nice fusion of ideas, Mr & Mrs Corrington.
