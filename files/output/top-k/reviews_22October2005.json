You know what I say? Stick 'em in concentration camps. That's what I say. Ah, the wisdom of Death Wish.However, not everyone thinks that way. Paul Kersey certainly doesn't. At the start of Michael Winner's vigilante wet dream, Kersey is a 'bleeding heart liberal'. He even has sympathy for people who aren't fabulously wealthy. What a fool! Death Wish starts with Kersey on holiday with his wife. Everything is idyllic &#150; the sun is shinning, waves are lapping on the beach and Kersey's wife poses for several snapshots. Then they go back to their hotel room to have sex. What a mistake &#150; you never have sex with Paul Kersey and live to tell the tale.But despite this well-known fact, the Kersey's are oblivious. They just finish their holiday and return to New York. Then five minutes later Kersey's wife and daughter are attacked by the monster that is Jeff Goldblum (playing 'Freak #1'). The rape scene that follows, if it weren't filmed by a filmmaker that is wholly incompetent in the art of movie making, should be hard-hitting, but instead it's hilarious. Basically you have a skinhead, a Jew and a moron in a bandana raping and pillaging while spouting lines like, Don't jive, mother. Has Winner ever met anyone that doesn't drive a Rolls-Royce or anyone who doesn't dine at The Ivy? His idea of 'punks' is so quaint, so out of touch and so naive that all the hard-hitting scenes are extraordinarily camp &#150; bandanna has an obsession with spray-painting things (Let me paint her ass). I guess this is what criminals do in Winner's world. They're children who have to paint swastikas everywhere.After the rape, Kersey's wife dies (Goldblum beats her around the head while spouting the best dialogue in the film, dialogue that I can't quote here) and Kersey's daughter is reduced to a catatonic mess after being forced to taste the delights of Jeff. But how does Kersey react to this news? Well, he shakes a little bit, but he hardly seems fazed &#150; Bronson is such an expressive actor. However, there's a deeper change in Kersey. He realises that to be a liberal is to be a fool. He realises that to have sympathy is to have weakness. And he realises that the only way you can make the world a better place is to blow large holes in the heads of goddamn punks. In other words, liberalism gets you nowhere; fascism gets you everywhere.But Kersey doesn't immediately become a killing machine. First he walks the street with a cosh &#150; he fills a sock with coins. But although the effects are desirable, heavy sock killings are time consuming, energy sapping and far too messy. What any good vigilante needs is a gun. And Kersey gets his gun on a business trip to Arizona.The Arizona sequence is actually one of the funniest. There's one bit where you have a long close-up of a noose. Do you see what those do-gooders have done to us? There was a time when you could just lynch a man. There was a time when you could string criminals (or suspected criminals) up by their neck and get instant justice. But then people had to come along with laws and courts and foolish notions like 'innocent until proved guilty'. Look what they've done. But then Kersey watches a fake cowboy stunt show. He positively glows when he sees men shooting themselves in the streets. What a much better place the world was back then you could settle everything with your fists and a gun. Those were the days.And so, tooled up, Kersey returns to New York (or that toilet as one character says). And no sooner has he landed than he's confronted by his son-in-law. How's his daughter? She's almost a goddamned vegetable. Possibly one of the best lines in cinema.So, with this news, Kersey is in the mood to start killing. However, after his first killing, like the pussy liberal that he is, he pukes. But he soon gets the hang of it (he gets plenty of practice; in the space of a ninety minute movie he gets mugged four times). Soon he's shooting black men in the back with great aplomb. And he enjoys it so much that he redecorates and starts listening to chirpy music. Killing is a great cure for depression.Pity, though, that the police aren't impressed. For some reason they want to apprehend Kersey, even though crime rates are down. But we soon understand why. They fear that Kersey is too effective. They fear that there will be a wave of vigilantism and that the public will no longer have need for the police. What scumbags. They're denying us a utopia, a utopia where muggers, perverts, poor people and people who look at you funny are shot on sight by squinty-eyed madmen. The world needs more Kersey's! However, the film doesn't broach the subject that if there was widespread vigilantism that the criminals would become more desperate, more ruthless and more dangerous. That would be too sensible and would require too much thought. Plus it would get in the way of a great wet dream, one where the pampered middle classes can shoot punks at will.

So when he directed his first feature, he had to be in the spotlight. It's not like he wanted to, but it was a matter of fate. Maybe Scorsese's fans still feel disappointed today and maybe this is isn't the greatest film in history, but it is at least a proof to show Redford was a gifted director from the beginning and that he chose a very strong and interesting topic for his first piece Ordinary People.The fact that the characters of the film are so palpable and human makes me think. And it's not the first time with this movie; today, each time I catch a movie about real daily lives, I pay attention to all the elements I want it to be real, because those are the films I like more. When this picture commences, you can perfectly listen to a Canon. It is not original music, but even when there's a composer, music is what this movie uses less. The opening credits are also seen with the sky as a background, quickly, desperate for the movie to start. The passion for making films can be felt.Now the story is being told, in the words of Alvin Sargent, screenwriter who based his thing in a novel by Judith Guest, and his adaptation is remarkable, because the tension can be felt, the chats don't seem fakes. There's no intention of complexity or poetry in some words, but that's exactly what had to be done. I was eagerly thinking, although, in today's screenplays of these type.

He knows that, and he also knows he is violent, boring and a little dangerous. He begs for control and the one who'll help him is Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch), during sessions of very well written talks. Sargent analyzes this relationship and the one Con has with Jeannine and other people comparing each word, each position, with cameras and settings.And it doesn't work only with Conrad; it works with the other main characters. Calvin Jarrett's (Donald Sutherland; a fine performance but not as strong as the others) life involves friends reunions and encounters, his relationship with his younger son and the memory of the elder's dead, and the most powerful element maybe of the whole film, his relationship with his wife Beth (Mary Tyler Moore); who also has to deal with her brother, her now only son and everyone in the society.The screenplay doesn't miss a thing, and hits hard when Beth tries to talk with Conrad outside, or when he tells her his good grade in a test, or the disturbing moment when Cal wants to take a picture of his wife and son together, and she refuses to stand still, asking for the camera. She can't hug her son for the photograph, her smile is faked. With a lot of noise and movement that keep Cal from taking the picture, Conrad suddenly shouts Give her the f***in' camera!. Then there's a family discussion about family caring She never went to the hospital to visit, because she was in her trips to Europe, Conrad tells his father referring to Beth.

Warren Beatty was ahead of the times and that means financial failure, but a visionary of the future nevertheless.Today, we are so concerned about CGI, rendering, fidelity of comic book adaptations, more so than the story itself. There's a simple explanation most movie goers are mostly fans of the comic strips.For me when I first watched the story was bad, it was hard to follow the movie had few black holes that just makes you feel there is not much excitement. Story has far too many character. Technical excellence, terrible story.Most movies today are like that, no plot, no story, just video games. For example Doom was rated better than A Sound of Thunder. Doom has hardly any story line. In fact I can make the entire movie straight out of a shooting exercise from a computer video games.For anyone who will enjoy the story more than the effects needs a certain amount of concentration as to whether it provokes you to question, make you think, effects your thought, get you interested to look further, makes you wonder, shock you in someway having a lasting influence, and most of all, the desire to watch again and again.

The plot is nothing new to the vampire genre a guy picks up a hitch hiker who turns out to be a vampire slayer, the main guy gets bit and they go about trying to hunt down the master vampire, along the way they find a girl thats been bitten by the master vamp and bring her along with them using her to lure the master vamp to them, much like what happened in the John Carpenter flick Vampires. The only scene that stuck out in my mind is the car chase other than there's nothing here you couldn't see by watching Vampires or Near Dark.

You cannot talk about this film, whether in conversation or in any review, without placing this actor on the tip of your tongue. He is the epitome of the madness that surrounded the power-hungry Invisible Man. In this day of modern cinematic wonder, most full-fledged actors would want their faces to be in front of the camera, showcasing the entire film. Directors would want this fledgling star to promote their film, get kiddies interested in spending their money, and for financiers to see the profits of their contributions. Let's face it, if Brad Pitt is in a movie, typically most audience members are actually going to see Brad Pitt. Thankfully, we have directors like James Whale and his interpretation of H.G.Wells' classic The Invisible Man. Whale took a powerful story, expanded it, breathed life into it, and followed up with quite possibly one of the most sinister villains in movie horror history since Hannibal Lector. He is crude, he is heartless, and he wants nothing more than world domination &#133; he is Claude Rains &#133; and yet, until the end of the film, we never see the white's of his eyes.There are several reasons why I just fell in love with this film, outside of the cataclysmic performance of Claude Rains. Ohhhh, Claude Rains. I loved the way that this movie was filmed. I loved the scope of the Invisible Man's terror. Whale could have kept his antagonist to committing just single murders of friends and family, he could of just kept it confined to just one single town, he could have kept our focus directly on the turmoil of Rains, but instead, he decided (amazingly!) to open the entire can of worms with success. When I first began this film I was expecting the classic images of angry villagers with pitchforks storming the house that the Invisible Man lived within, but instead, Whale gave us this sort of random chaos that truly created fear around this character. Whale is able to give us the true terror of this madman by perhaps expanding his budget and showing us how big the terror of the Invisible Man is. For example, I never foresaw the horrific train accident, nor the random worker push off the mountain, and when Rains explained to Kemp what the human impact of falling down a ravine would be like, it literally sent shivers down my spine. Whale created a madman better than some modern horror films could ever accomplish.For a film created in the 1930s, the special effects were spectacular. Sure, CGI was just a glimmer in Lucas' mother's eyes, but James Whale did a superb job of giving us these rare glimpses into the future of special effects. The way that he created the Invisible Man surprised me. I did not expect to ever see the creature without his bandages on, but within ten minutes we are shown the full scope of Whale's creativity. I thought the use of snow, dust, and even the early stages of the overused green screen was original for its time. To see Rains smoke as the Invisible Man put a smile on my face. This is a perfect example of a film that used just enough special effects, in the right way, to make the audience forget for a brief time that this was in fact a film &#133; not real life. While the special effects did have one or two flaws (see the Invisible Man riding the stolen bike &#150; were those wires?), I must credit Whale for pushing the envelope for the time. It was surprising to see such quality from such an older film.If there would be anything that I would change about this film would be the subtext concerning the relationship between Rains and Flora (played by Titanic star Gloria Stuart). I thought this was nearly unnecessary. I understand the value of trying to give a human element to this monster, but I thought that it could have been done without these random scenes. There wasn't really any connection between the two, and we were left with very little information of them prior to the start of the film. Perhaps if there had been a stronger pre-story it would have congealed better. The same can be said for the chemistry and reasonings for the plot points surrounding Rains and Kemp. I could understand why they occurred during the film, but there had to be something more prior to the opening scene. I wanted to know more. I think that is a good sign for a film, when you are left wondering what was the story before this one &#133; and even what was it afterwards.Overall, I thought this was an exceptional film. I now have this newfound respect for Claude Rains, a man I knew nothing about prior to watching this film. He carried this film and honestly successfully pulled off one of the most frightening madmen this world has ever seen. I think what scared me the most about him was the fact that he actually, unlike some villains, actually followed through with his vile plans. He was evil, whether the invisibility did it or not, he was pure evil, and I loved every minute of it. The special effects were delightful, with a small subplot that this picture could have gone without. Amazing, and a perfect treat before Halloween!

It didn't have the shock and anguish of the The Exorcist, a movie with plenty of humanity under its still impressive special effects. It didn't connect with me in the way The Paper Chase related to the subversive in all young people share. Chinatown wrapped itself around its audience like a sad song, and Cabaret chilled us with its disintegration of life as we know it. The Sting was impressive but it was like that work behind the glass untouchable, and yet something worth admiring. I look back and can't help thinking how Paper Moon brought back an era, with its flaws, humanity, and spirit quite intact.What works The screenplay is rather dazzling, a labyrinthine construction of twists and turns, executed with almost clinical perfection. The players play others, get played, get bullied, and titter on the edge. It is like reading a book people recommend and never quite getting into it. Sometime its dazzle prevents us from looking at its heart.Both Redford and Newman are downright amazing, with terrific costumes and million dollar smiles. They're both attractive and carry the film very well, especially Newman who brings forth the qualities of wisdom and experience to the part. Redford is competent and does a decent job, sometimes coasting on Newman's powerful acting. Years later, Tom Cruise would give one of its best performances in The Color of Money, once again trying to keep up with Newman's expertise. In a minor role, Gould shines as the team player who must adapt chameleon qualities to survive. Brennan, Durning, and Walston fit in nicely.The score helps with the feeling of nostalgia for those who might have lived in the period. Its simple and belongs to the classes the movie portrays; there are no airs of culture, but a sassy quality, with plenty of attitude.What is a little problematicThe film feels directed, cold, and uninvolving, keeps winking at us, telling us how good and clever it is. Hill's direction is never relaxed, but calculated and precise. Directors are like painters, showing their personality in their work. Less admired works, such as the drama in Titanic might show less directorial expertise, but more human sentient, allowing its actors and audience to bond. Earlier this year, another potential masterpiece was ruined by a filmmaker that has already proved himself quite capable of directing a safe bet of a film, keeping himself away from taking chances in Cinderella Man. Much is to be learned from directors who take chances such as Peter Jackson in the three LOTR efforts, films that could have collapsed by his choices to show exhilarating and extended scenes showing us the passion and energy he felt in the prose of the novels. His amazing displays of technical knowledge worked well because he wasn't afraid to take it further. His actors showed charisma and made us care, with the rest of the canvas finely structured to support the overall effect. Chinatown still haunts us because its portrayal of the lower qualities in every human being were raw, uncompromising, part of the film noir atmosphere Polanki tried to recreated. In The Sting its photographic is at best pedestrian, and one can't help feel as if we're watching a TV production, rather than a work of art.Yes, The Sting is a finely crafted work, but its heart is not big and strong; as a matter of fact, it might be its weakest component, surrendering to the powerful brain that keeps trying to impress us.

In a minor role, Gould shines as the team player who must adapt chameleon qualities to survive. Brennan, Durning, and Walston fit in nicely.The score helps with the feeling of nostalgia for those who might have lived in the period. Its simple and belongs to the classes the movie portrays; there are no airs of culture, but a sassy quality, with plenty of attitude.What is a little problematicThe film feels directed, cold, and uninvolving, keeps winking at us, telling us how good and clever it is. Hill's direction is never relaxed, but calculated and precise. Directors are like painters, showing their personality in their work. Less admired works, such as the drama in Titanic might show less directorial expertise, but more human sentient, allowing its actors and audience to bond. Earlier this year, another potential masterpiece was ruined by a filmmaker that has already proved himself quite capable of directing a safe bet of a film, keeping himself away from taking chances in Cinderella Man. Much is to be learned from directors who take chances such as Peter Jackson in the three LOTR efforts, films that could have collapsed by his choices to show exhilarating and extended scenes showing us the passion and energy he felt in the prose of the novels. His amazing displays of technical knowledge worked well because he wasn't afraid to take it further. His actors showed charisma and made us care, with the rest of the canvas finely structured to support the overall effect. Chinatown still haunts us because its portrayal of the lower qualities in every human being were raw, uncompromising, part of the film noir atmosphere Polanki tried to recreated. In The Sting its photographic is at best pedestrian, and one can't help feel as if we're watching a TV production, rather than a work of art.Yes, The Sting is a finely crafted work, but its heart is not big and strong; as a matter of fact, it might be its weakest component, surrendering to the powerful brain that keeps trying to impress us. If you want to feel moved, refer to the other pieces of the 70's exploring the early 90's. There are much finer twists in Chinatown, much heartfelt cons in Paper Moon and more clever displays of talent in Bugsy Malone.

It was 1980's film Friday the 13th that ushered in a new age of horror. Slasher films were nothing new, with John Carpenter's Halloween being released two years earlier, but Friday the 13th set the tone for violence and opened the door for several copycat films.The film begins in 1958 where two Crystal Lake camp counselors were ruthlessly slaughtered while making love inside a barn. These grizzly murders led to the camp being closed down for over twenty years and caused the community to assign the moniker of Camp Blood to the area. Now, someone has decided to re-open the campground and soon the memories twenty years removed become a harsh reality for the new camp counselors. One by one, these youngsters get murdered in extremely graphic fashion and it's up to the sole survivor to fend for herself when the killer is finally revealed. SFX master Tom Savini provided the gore effects and Sean Cunningham did a good job directing the film. In my opinion, the gritty look of the film made it look almost documentary style and it really added a lot to the movie. Another thing that makes this movie so good is the pacing. Unlike most of the sequels, the killer in this film stalks the victims and watches them long before disposing of them. Let's not forget the music and the ki-ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma-ma.The only negative I can draw from this movie is the acting. Of course, with the small budget it had they couldn't exactly hire the upper echelon of Hollywood talent. Then again, none of them would have liked the script. Also, there was not a lot of character development. In a movie like this, people just go to see kids being murdered with any kind of garden tool\/weapon available. I always wanted to see Jason kill somebody with a squeegee (Heck, he used a party favor in Part 6). I'll give this movie a 7\/10. Definitely worth owning on DVD.

Aladdin is a Walt Disney production. It in general is usually classified as a movie for children. In this movie there are a lot of main characters. Aladdin, Jasmine, and their friends. The story line goes something like this There was once a poor man who lived off of stealing bread and finding a place to sleep each night. He dreams of living in a palace and having the things that he doesn't have. This character is Aladdin. On the other hand there is a princess who wishes she was normal and could leave the palace walls to be treated like an everyday person. So she does. She sneaks out of the palace one day and bumps into Aladdin on the streets. Neither one of them know each other's identity, but they finally find out. Through a lot of hard times throughout the movie they finally meet again and fall in love.And who is to blame for them meeting up again? The Genie, of course! Aladdin finds a genie in a bottle that can grant him his every wish. One of which is to cast the evil Jaffar out of the palace and into a genie bottle so he cannot take over and marry Jasmine. She is not in love with him; she is in love with Aladdin. And so the story goes. To find out all of the adventurous details in this movie, go rent it, or buy it. Trust me it will not be a waste of your money!! )My opinion of this movie is that it is a GREAT movie for any age! It is exciting and fun to watch. This movie will keep you going and on your toes to see what will happen next. It also has a small love story plot to it, too. Now, of course, fairy tales aren't true. But if they were this is the just the sweetest thing ever! A magic carpet ride, being a princess and meeting that special someone just by coincidence. This is a great movie that I have enjoyed my entire life and I know you will enjoy it just as much as I have.
