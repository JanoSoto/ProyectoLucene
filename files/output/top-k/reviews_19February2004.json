It neatly and cleverly captured much of the social climate of the late 60s. Though not without its antecedents, it certainly has to stand as one of the more important social commentary films posing as sci-fi. Burton's remake, however, doesn't even seem to have a coherent story line. I first saw the Burton film upon its release and found it sorely lacking then. But I worried that my reaction might be too colored by my affection for the original. Remakes are frequently hated by fans of the original, and I didn't want to spout off with an unexamined emotional outburst. But I just sat through it again (this time on TV) and my loathing hasn't diminished. Wahlberg's performance still strikes me as wooden and lacking in purpose. From the very moment of his arrival to the ape world, his only objective is to escape from the planet. So why did he travel out to the planet in the first place? Heston's character of more than 30 years past at least went to explore (to see if there was anything better than man out there). Baker's ape makeup in the remake was good, but effects alone can't make a movie. The humans were no doubt the worst characters in the remake. Like Wahlberg they lacked any depth, and their passivity to ape domination produced more annoyance instead of sympathy. In the original the humans were primitive mutes whose mannerisms were bestial. They brought on pity one might feel for a hunted animal, which they were supposed to be. Another strikingly annoying element in the Burton film was the strange love triangle formed by Helena Bonham Carter as a chimp (albeit a very cute chimp), the collagen-lipped Estella Warren as a primitive human, and Wahlberg. I have no idea what Burton was going for there. While Burton's early films didn't wow me, they nonetheless didn't annoy me. My first impression was simply that he could churn out glitzy Hollywood pablum. Then he made Ed Wood and I suddenly wondered if I had overlooked a film genius. But the profound lack of substance in Apes convinces me that I was right the first time. (And Big Fish hasn't caused me to alter that view).

Knowing this, one should find it surprising that the average person knows little to nothing about what actually goes on during the production of a movie, nor does he or she understand how much backbreaking work is put into even the most abysmal features.  For the uninitiated, Tom DiCillo's 1995 feature Living in Oblivion will serve as a both an education in filmmaking and a wake-up call to better appreciate an art form many of us take for granted.  It can also be seen as a light-hearted warning to those who are considering a career in the movie industry, or as a refreshing, close-to-home satire to those already involved.To briefly summarize, Living in Oblivion is a film about the making of a film--an independent, low-budget drama with the same title.  Steve Buscemi plays Nick Reve, the film's hopelessly frustrated, strung-out director who's just trying to make it through the shoot in one piece.  The many hurdles--both technical and personal--that come with the territory of shooting a low-budget picture are depicted in a way that is unnervingly realistic, yet absolutely hilarious at the same time.  We learn right from the get-go that filmmaking is one of those ventures where anything that can go wrong will, and Nick Reve's movie is certainly no exception.Aside from just being well-acted, the characters in Living in Oblivion are very original and complex.  I found such depth in character to actually be somewhat surprising, since the movie's premise is relatively simple, and much of the character development isn't really needed for the jokes to work.  But the fact that DiCillo has incorporated a distinct personality and back-story into all of the main parts really helps add to not only the believability of the characters and their actions, but to the viewer's emotional attachment to them as well.  Even though we're laughing, we can feel Nick's aggravation as take after take is blown by one minor difficulty or another, and by the time he finally cracks and vows not to finish the production, the audience shares in the disappointment of the onscreen crew, who have been giving their all to make sure that this film makes it to completion.  As viewers, we can see that Nick's production is really nothing more than a tacky romantic drama, but because it is a labor of love, we develop a relationship with it anyway, and are therefore genuinely saddened during those few moments when all hope is lost.Living in Oblivion is also rife with imagery and visual effects that help to punctuate its mood as well as the characters' relationships with one another and with Nick's movie itself.  The first third of Oblivion (Nick's dream sequence) is in black and white, while the scenes of his production are shown in color.  To me, this represents Nick's total devotion to the project.  This movie is everything to him (it is `the light', so to speak), and showing its scenes in color juxtaposed with the stark black and white shots to represent reality help illustrate his passion for his work.  Conversely, Nicole's (the lead actress, played by Catherine Keener) dream sequence uses the exact opposite technique, showing the movie's scenes as black and white, while reality is in color.  Again, this helps to justify her relationship with the picture-reluctant and detached.Living in Oblivion may appear simple and unremarkable on the surface, but appearances can be deceptive!  Hidden within the film's straightforward storyline and seemingly pessimistic humor lies a very clever look at the human need for involvement, power, passion, and triumph.  It may be difficult to pick up at first, but repeated viewings will tell you that this is undoubtedly more than just a `movie about a movie'.

Jackson cast in the lead of this 'remake.' He's got all the cool and attitude that Richard Roundtree's Shaft had. Unfortunately, this cool and attitude is only found in his other films and not this one. Shaft 2000 is a decent film if you've never seen the original. It's just too serious.

That is exactly the situation I found myself in after watching Sam Raimi's third installment of the Evil Dead series, Army of Darkness.Army of Darkness picks up where Evil Dead II left off 5 years earlier. Ashley J. Williams (or 'Ash' as we have come to know him) has been transported back to 1400 A.D. where he must continue to fight for his survival and deliver the people from the evil Deadites. Armed with a shotgun and a chainsaw arm (this may sound incredibly ridiculous if you have not seen the second installment), Ash is prophesized to deliver the Necronomicon, or Book of the Dead, which will rid the English townspeople of the walking dead and return Ash back to 1993 so that he can continue as a clerk at the local S-Mart.As odd or downright foolish that the plot may sound, Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) does a good job of keeping us entertained with a balanced mix of slapstick comedy and outlandish gore. Bruce Campbell (Ash) doesn't take himself too seriously and the results include such laughable quotes as 'Oh you little b**tards! Alright, I'll crush each and every last one of ya! I'll squash you so hard you'll have to look down to look up!'. These types of verbal exchanges definitely lighten the tone from the heavy blood soaked Evil Dead I and II entries.But what ultimately makes Army of Darkness so sinfully enjoyable is watching all the fun Campbell and Raimi seem to be having with the character and the notion of a self-centered fool using his 20th century knowledge in 15th century Europe. Whether it is Ash building himself a new arm or uttering modern day witticisms ('Gimme some sugar, baby.'), the movie never takes itself too seriously and that is most of the fun.In terms of special effects, the movie has both the best and the worst of what technology had to offer in the early 1990's. A scene where the army of the dead storms the castle is an ode to Jason and the Argonauts and the splendid work of effects master Ray Harryhausen. It is well crafted and choreographed and hi-light of the films effects. On the very opposite end of the scale is the scene in which Mini-Ashes run amok over the full sized Ash, jumping into his mouth, sticking him with a fork.you get the idea. The Mini-Ashes look like they were from a completely different film and the whole chapter on the DVD should be avoided if possible.So now I come back full circle with my initial statement. I enjoyed viewing Army of Darkness, and am embarrassed because of it. The humor is definitely adolescent, but you feel like a diabetic enjoying a chocolate bar, savoring the taste and hoping no one witnesses your satisfaction. Sam Raimi, who also helmed Darkman, does his best with an $11 million budget (his later $139 million budget for Spider-Man showed his true genius), and you can image by the energy exerted in such a preposterous storyline, that the cast and crew had oodles and oodles of fun during production.

But in examining this film, I feel there are still some areas upon which we might expand.1) Free Enterprise is as much about Los Angeles and a particular culture as it is about Star Trek and its fans. LA is simply full of guys just like Mark and Robert -- lower-to-middle level in the film industry, always hoping to get the chance to make the film they've always wanted to. They love film, but are struggling to maintain that affection in the face of the hard realities of the film biz (having seen far too many associates become jaded and bitter.) They hang out in cafes and all-night restaurants, and bars take the place of the living rooms they don't have because their apartments are too small. Most of them have unpublished manuscripts and screenplays, their conversation is dialogue, and they automatically pepper it with pop culture and film references new and old. In the case of Free Enterprise their focus is Star Trek and SF films, but it could just as easily be Hitchcock, James Bond or (for the coming generation) Kevin Smith. This film perfectly captures these guys, a dead-on representation of those living and working in the midst of The Dream Factory. Sure, the folks in the film are prettier than some might expect, but that's show biz -- movies are a glossed-up version of reality.2) Speaking of expectations, much of the reaction to this film seems to orbit around not the film itself, but rather around how folks think the film addresses the stereotype of the Star Trek fan. Which shows that everyone needs to take another look at that stereotype as they hold it. So, Mark and Robert are not the fanboy extremists given such colorful treatment in Trekkies (which came out about the same time as FE, got much wider release, and actually kept some people away from FE because they assumed it was more of the same.) Our boys don't wear Star Fleet uniforms (well, not as adults), they aren't unusually shaped, they date... So some people label the characters as unrealistic. I say, re-examine your own assumptions. Life is a continuum -- people do not always gravitate to extreme poles.3) I have several times seen Robert Burnett and Mark Altman perform in person, and I can assure you that the semi-autobiographical characters in the film are in no way an exaggeration -- they are just as witty off-the-cuff as their characters are in the script, just as reference-saturated, just as opinionated.  Think of the screenplay as excerpts drawn from a constantly-running tape recorder present when they are together with friends the greatest moments. Trust me, the characters in the film are dead on -- these guys talk like that.4) Far from being the poor example of indie production some have labeled it, I feel FE *very* successfully overcomes low-budget considerations. Excellent use of practical lighting, imaginative usage of sets (and re-dressing of sets), and the LA-is-our-whole-world feel all add up to a veritable handbook for the low-budget director. (The excellent commentary track supports how carefully thought out these elements were, especially the discussion of overcoming lens restrictions.)5) FE is also very successful for having overcome a very shaky release, to enjoy new life on DVD. Partly this is due to word-of-mouth, and partly it's due to the excellent usage the producers made of the DVD format. The alternate reference track is great fun, and the commentary track is one of the best out there. I think the longest break in the discussion is 8 seconds -- the rest of the time the guys are falling over each other to reveal details in the rich background they have created. It would be a crime to watch this film without also watching the commentary.6) Many have pointed at the love story as the weakest element in PE, and I must say I agree with reservations. Right off, I'll say that I often feel that love stories are spliced into films -- you can almost hear someone say It won't sell unless there's a love story in it. And there's a bit of that here. But the love story does serve to help us examine the bonds between the guys; their group unity is challenged, their stability threatened.-- POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD --Some folks feel that Claire is too pretty to be a comic book fan -- again, with the stereotypes! -- and that her character is unrealistic. The only main problem I have with the Robert-Claire relationship is when she takes him back, saying, I don't care about all your negatives, I love you because you will risk everything to achieve your dream! (This is the point where my wife and I always turn to each other and chorus, 'Fantasy Alert'!) Well, actually, Robert does not risk everything to achieve his dream of making a movie -- he in fact screws off and gives up and relies on the charity of his friends to keep him afloat, and no sensible Claire would dream of putting up with him. So this bit must be chalked up to Happy Hollywood Ending and the fact that this is Mark & Robert's movie and if they want to indulge in a bit of wish fulfillment then they can do so.My wife and I discovered this film for our friends, and have turned so many people on to it that we could fill a theater. Most folks have been *very* enthusiastic about it (their most common response Why haven't I seen this before?). We have watched it going on 2 dozen times, and it just keeps getting better for us. Partly because we know these guys, these types, know the LA settings and atmosphere. But mostly just because it is a very well made, heartfelt, and entertaining production.I have to say a word here about Shatner. Back to stereotypes, and assumptions... I have to admit that I, like much of the world, had come to believe that William Shatner was egocentric, vain, and condescending to his fans. And in my defense, a case can be made for each of those points. (See Meeting of Minds for some indication of how genuinely clueless he is regarding why his costars might resent him.) But Free Enterprise turned my (our) head around -- Shatner's willingness to lampoon himself shows a whole new side of the man. His admonition to tear me down! (view the commentary track) shows a sincere desire to examine the nature of hero worship and stardom (as does his appearance in the film in the first place), and his it was then I realized that I'm not Captain Kirk monologue is actually quite touching. One comes away with a new respect for the man as an actor, and as a man.I can see why some people might not find Free Enterprise to their taste.

But Free Enterprise turned my (our) head around -- Shatner's willingness to lampoon himself shows a whole new side of the man. His admonition to tear me down! (view the commentary track) shows a sincere desire to examine the nature of hero worship and stardom (as does his appearance in the film in the first place), and his it was then I realized that I'm not Captain Kirk monologue is actually quite touching. One comes away with a new respect for the man as an actor, and as a man.I can see why some people might not find Free Enterprise to their taste. But for those who do frequent this kind of restaurant, it is mighty tasty indeed.

He knows Robocop is too good to be true and has fun raising his status to king of men, even having him walk on water as he extracts his revenge on the men who 'killed' him. The real twist for me is that in order to dispense with the man who masterminded the criminal activities he has been investigating, Robocop has to break the rules.

Robocop wants to kill him, he needs to kill him, and the only way he can escape his tomb is to destroy the man who put him in it.

An investigation reveals that the crew has been decapitated. In the cargo hold, a mysterious box from South America has a final destination of Chicago itself, the Natural History Museum. The box is delivered to Dr. Margo Green. (Penelope Ann Miller) The box contains several artifacts from a South American tribe that was thought to be extinct. The box also contained a special leaf that is beyond the understanding of the museum authorities. A security guard is gruesomely killed that same night, decapitated. Police Officer Vincent D'Agosta (Tom Sizemore) orders the museum closed until investigations can ensue, but is overruled due to a new exhibit opening the next day that traces the evolution of superstition. Knowing there is a monster inside the museum, an investigation shows why the monster decapitates people it feasts on a special gland found only in the human brain. The red carpet reception is going smoothly until a monster arrives, attacking the police officers that are combing the tombs of the museum to find the answer to the mystery. After numerous attacks, D'Agosta and Green manage to trap and kill the creature inside the museum, and learn that the monster is a combination of the leaf, an insect, and the scientist who sent the crate in the first place.    The Good News Being a monster movie, the main thing that comes to mind is gore, which this film provides a great quantity of. The quality is also good, as most of the severed heads look realistic. As another reviewer mentioned, the creature itself is completely realistic, and Winston should have gone home with the Oscar. In all of it's scenes when we finally see the beast, he looks impressive. I have read the novel that inspired this movie, and I thought the movie is better. The novel was all right, but I could never get into it the way I got into the movie. It hooks you fast and never seems to let go, as the filler scenes fit the movie perfectly, adding back history or explanations for the creature. Aside from Miller, though, the acting is horrible. She is the lone bright star in acting, and turns in a credible performance. The main thing that won this movie over for me, though, was the judicious use of suspense. I don't care how good a horror film is, without suspense, it has to work twice as hard to win me over. There are several quite good examples. The first is the killing of the security guard. He is killed inside a urinal. As he walks in and sits down, he goes into his pocket and pulls out a joint. Opening a window to blow the smoke out, he lights it up and takes a puff. A strange noise gets his attention. He stops and calls a couple of times for the thing to show itself. Ignoring it, he continues to puff away. The creature takes the cue and pulls his leg out and him into another stall, never to be seen again. What makes the scene great is that it takes about a minute to fully go through, from his wandering in to his demise. The timing is remarkable, as the final cut down to his leg mere milliseconds before the lizard hand juts forth is a fantastic payoff. The second best example is towards the end of the movie. D'Agosta and Green are moving through a flooded sewer tracking the creature. They wade through for quite some time before reaching a sewer grate. Attacking a piece of meat to the grate, D'Agosta backs away, expecting the creature to appear on the other side of the grate. Instead the creature appears behind Green, forcing D'Agosta to fend off its attack. Unlike the first scene, this one works due to the atmosphere of the setting. Inside a dark, damp sewer is a perfect setting for something to go `boo.' However, Hyams did something unusual in that he had both Sizemore and Miller silent throughout the whole scene. This makes only the trickling water the only thing heard on the soundtrack. The final stage is the monster itself, erupting up on their side of the fence.The Bad News The movie has almost no regard for logic. How can a ship without any people driving it manage to go from South America up through the Great Lakes into a Chicago harbor? I don't know how, but in here it can. Like I said above, only Miller does a good job in the acting department. Sizemore wanders through the movie with a stone sour expression that never tends to change, even in the action sequences. He must really have needed the work or wanted to work with Miller.The Final Verdict Put aside some small suspension of disbelief, and you will find a highly enjoyable and entertaining monster flick.

It was one of my first 'art' movie, though I digress to refer to it as so. It was more than a wonderful artistic movie; it was a masterpiece.**SLIGHT SPOLIERS**Whenever I watch a movie I would rather NOT recognise the actors because this attitude leads to expectations. This was one of those movies, and their acting was simply brilliant. So was the cinematography. I still can see the moment when Hunter was left at the shores with the piano, looking very small and alone save for her oblivious daughter. The way Hunter sort of recoiled when Keitel touched her for the first time was as abrupt as the music itself... even I was jolted.And who could forget the stark contrast between Paquin's innocent costume and the climactic event that transpired between her mother and his stepfather? Against dark background, in pouring rain, she screamed as her mother reeled around in pain. It seemed to me now that she screamed *for* her mother, not at the terror of seeing her hurt.For those who scorn at this movie, I pity you. You had missed (or rather, ignored) the best 2 hours of your life. This movie is not hard to follow, nor it is plodding. It simply is, just like life.Someone here said that this movie is not to be watched with rationality in mind. I agree. This is not a rational movie at all. Why would Paquin, who all along had been supportive to the Hunter-Keitel relationship, change her mind while taking the key to Keitel? Why wouldn't Hunter say a word?

His younger brother Michael Myers killed his older sister on Halloween night when he was six years old and she was sixteen. He has been in the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) for the past 15 years, and has developed a cold, murderous personality. He escapes on the 15-year anniversary of the crime and returns to his hometown, Haddonfield, Ill. At first, he stalks Laurie, keeping his distance from her and her friends, Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Linda, (P.J. Soles) never fully showing himself. Then, that night, he strikes, killing Annie, Linda, and her boyfriend in the neighboring house. Laurie herself is babysitting in the house across the street, which unbeknownst to her is Michael's house. Finally tired of the lies that her two children are telling her, Laurie goes across the street to see if the boogeyman really is there. She finds all of her friends murdered and a madman, Michael, after her. She manages to escape and flee back to her house. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is valiantly trying to find Michael with the Chief of Police, Sheriff Brackett. (Charles Cyphers) Combing the streets, they are unable to find Michael. After Laurie makes it back home, she sends the two children out to get help, and run into the Sheriff and Loomis, who direct them back to Laurie, who is having a hard time trying to kill Michael, as he relentlessly tries to kill her as well. Loomis arrives at the nick of time, putting several bullets into Michael and sending him over a balcony. After checking on Laurie, he goes outside to find Michael has survived the bullets and the fall.The good News Where do I start? First of all, the music. Those notes have become one of the spookiest sounds in all of horror movie history. Add those notes to any other movie, (drama, action, porno, etc.) and that movie instantly becomes creepy. Like `Jaws' and `Friday the 13th' they will forever live on in the hearts and fears of movie lovers as horrors greatest signatures. The suspense in the movie is almost as effective as the score. The way the scenes build up to a monumental moment is staggering. The beginning, for instance, is one of the most original and shocking openings ever, as a young child, apparently, selects a clown mask, then a giant butcher knife, then walks up a flight of stairs. We hear music playing, and we enter the room of some teenage girl getting dressed up for a date. She spots the person in the room and alerts him, then he convienently stabs her. We then see that whoever did that was a young boy, but the whole scene transpires without us knowing who it is, or without a word of dialogue spoken. It comes as a giant shock to those who have never seen it, as we expect that the transaction was done by a man. The film does have some fantastic action scenes, including the whole last half-hour in the house. From one scare to the next, we are treated to a series of logical and well executed scenes that build up to a nerve-wracking climax. For the time, the acting is passable, and there is no hard gore, but there are a few scenes of blood-letting. Also, Michael has a small sense of humor in this film, as in the scene where he wanders upstairs to find Annie in bed after having dispatched her boyfriend covered in a towel. Her remark is pretty funny, but Michael steals it by simply standing there, then finally moving when he knows he might be caught. The strangling over the phone has become a scene that has shown in numerous horror films since.The Bad News Unfortunately, like my review for `Phantasm,' this is a film of its time. The clothes, the coloring, and the conversations are very distinctly 70s. Also, ever other film in the series has had more gore than this movie, which is a disappointment for those seeking to see a ton of blood from Michael's killings. However, Carpenter was working on a small budget, so he can be forgiven.The Final Verdict With knock-out scene after knock-out scene, `Halloween' is recommended viewing for horror fans of all ages, audiences, and tastes. No one should miss out on the chance to see the film that has launched more than 80 sequels, imitators, and homage's.

Taken at face value Resident Evil is an enjoyable but highly derivative zombie movie that seems slightly hampered by a 15 certificate and a poorly realised soundtrack. On the subject of the derision I can offer the fact that upon drawing up the character of Rain the script writers appears to have picked up his brightly coloured safety-scissors and Pritt-stick and clumsily cut and pasted in Vasquez from Aliens. Others are as - if not more - two dimensional to the extent that the ambiguous Main frame computer known as the Red Queen (rendered first as a hologram and later as simply a voice) is the most interesting character in the film. There is also a scene that confuses me greatly that involves a corridor and lasers. The Director and cinematographer state proudly that the lighting and style of this scene is a subtle homage to 2001. Very well gentlemen but what they fail to mention is that the ENTIRE sequence is ripped wholly from the beginning of The Cube! A conscious double bluff perhaps? The action sometimes seems disjointed. Characters appear in different places in adjacent scenes with no explanation as to how they travelled between them. In one glaring example two characters are alone in a room talking quietly at the end of one scene and at the very beginning of the very next scene they are depicted running full pelt down a corridor chased by hordes of hungry zombies. The special effects, especially Zombies, are very well realised and I reject the arguments that they are Romero rip-offs. The argument goes that because these zombies are wearing suits and other normal clothes that they MUST have been stolen from Dawn of the Dead. My argument goes that the film takes place in an office building, what do you expect them to wear? Shell suits? The soundtrack made the mistake of  ditching the superb industrial sounds of a Clint Mansell score in favor of the childish and cynically noisy songs of the likes of Korn and Marilyn Manson. There is in fact so little in the film to tax the brain that you cannot help but enjoy it on purely popcorn level as you would The Fast and The Furious or Erazer. You also cannot help but wonder, when you know the secret of the film, if this no-brain exterior isn't just a clever smoke screen, a façade, a two-way mirror that the audience is on the wrong side of. Resident Evil is a virtual vehicle for massive succession of Alice and Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass references. I will not list, or attempt to list, all these references and asides here but they are many. From the virtually unnoticeable Some illustrations on the face of a clock. To the down right blatant The Red Queen character or the central character being named Alice (Despite NEVER being referred to by her name in the course of the film.) Nearly all of these cameos are well realised and never seem forced; they are a fascinating aside to the film and lend it an air of intelligence and thought that are in no way apparent in the body of the piece. My favourites among them include a secret entrance behind a mirror, the way Alice first fall asleep and much later wakes up again on a chequer-board floor and the Red Queen repeatedly screaming `KILL HER' as Alice holds an axe to Rains' neck. I challenge any-one armed with this information to not find themselves theorising about what could and could not be a subtle reference, keeping count and seeing who amongst friends spots the most. Expect DVD extras by the bucket load to blow the cover for this interesting semi-secret but such is the modern market that nothing goes un-dredged to fill spare CD space.
