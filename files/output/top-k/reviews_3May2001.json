[{"date":"3 May 2001","score":"","review":"  Dinosaur has perhaps the most riveting special effects I've seen in the movies so far. It took them well over 12 years to make this film and the results do show. If only they had created a strong story to back up these effects, Dinosaur might have been a heck of a movie. But the story is inaccurate and silly and the movie suffers as a result.There is one truly spectacular sequence in the movie the meteor shower which is plausible and suspenseful and lasts about 12 minutes (just a ballpark figure) There are other great set pieces also such as the fight between Aladar and Kron near the end (no, this is not a spoiler; the trailers hint at this) and an escape sequence reminiscent of The Ten CommandmentsIf only Cecil B.DeMille were still alive. He would have definitely tightened the screws on this screenplay. You would think that in a span of 12 years, they could have researched and found that there were no lemurs in the prehistoric period? Worse yet, they have to do bad jokes with the lemurs in a pathetic attempt at comedy relief? It is unnecessary in a strong dramatic premise such as this. If they had taken their time and done some simple research, this film would have been a masterpiece. But, sadly, they didn't even bother.Yet....those effects are so vivid and memorable, I find myself recommending this mess, against my better judgment. My defense could be that there are worse things a parent can show their child. After all, doesn't the great Disney classic Bambi have scenes of violence?*** out of 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2001","score":"","review":"  Dinosaur has perhaps the most riveting special effects I've seen in the movies so far.
