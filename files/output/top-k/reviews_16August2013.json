While the film does fail with some aspects of the film, it also has its strengths and brings new ideas to the Jurassic Park franchise.Jurassic Park is one of the films that I see that does not need to have a main antagonist. There are some films I feel like that where it is done well like Aliens or Platoon, but The Lost World does not do this. The main antagonist of Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) is a stereotypical businessman who has no idea of what to do. While John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) was like this in the first film, he was not a stereotype, let alone an antagonist. The only thing done right is that he is the opposite of Hammond, being in it for the money while Hammond was in it just to bring something new to people.With the main antagonist comes the problem with the main character, Ian Malcolm. I have no problem with Jeff Goldblum and I loved the character in both the novelizations of Jurassic Park and The Lost World and the first film. This is still the case with this movie but I do not think that Malcolm is a good main character. In the first movie, he was more of a foil character to oppose Hammond instead of someone who was main character material. Also, he still seems to be the designated guy who brings the comic relief. While I was okay with that in the first film, he should not of been like that this much when he was a main character. There were a lot of things I liked, though, as well. The characters are still somewhat interesting as opposed to the blank slates they are in Jurassic Park III. Plus, the dinosaurs are fleshed out a little as shown being caring parents and not just giant monsters. Along with the fleshing out of the dinosaurs, there is another aspect of the film that I like involving the dinosaurs. The herbivores are dangerous, like they would be in real life which is glossed over in the first and second film. Stegosaurus attack Sarah, a Pachycephalosaurus attacks the mercenaries cars, and the herbivores trash the mercenaries camp. Yes, it is more of a dinosaur attack film but it does show us more of how the animals really would be and not the simple herbivores are nice and safe while the carnivores are mean and dangerous like the other two films do.Taking the pros with the cons, I liked this film and found that it was a good addition to the Jurassic Park trilogy. The effects were good, the story was interesting, and the action was superb and tense. While there are some pretty big flaws with the characters, they do not hurt the film a lot.

Now I understand why there is so much affection for this film. It's really a bundle of contradictions. It's a gay movie, but its flavor is ultimately very much old-fashioned rom-com. It is sexy and very out, but surprisingly chaste and tasteful. It is not focused on AIDS, coming out, or angst, but acknowledges these things without being defined by them. The comedy is effective but largely because all of the actors play their emotions totally straight-faced, drawing humor from recognizable human reactions under pressure, not because of one-liners or gags. The cast has unknowns and at least one star, but the casting doesn't feel lopsided as they are all terrific and have great group chemistry. Coco Peru would threaten to steal the movie as the evil drag queen if the rest of the cast were not so uniformly stellar. The iconic Tori Spelling and the fabulous but unknown Lori Bagley seem to be two flavors of screwball adorable. The two male leads are just knockouts. The director has coaxed two very memorable performances out of them. One thing that must be said is how fully the characters have been directed to use their bodies and inhabit them (or not inhabit them) to make us feel their unease or their confidence. Just look at hand acting in this film. When Gabriel doesn't know where to put his hands whenever they are not set at a piano keyboard or when Marc peels his shirt off with one unthinking hand as soon as he enters the club, it says volumes about their back history so economically. This is outstanding acting and outstanding direction. SPOILER AHOY Finally, the interesting thing about the film is that it is structured as a brutal series of instances of coitus interruptus. The boys keep getting sooo close to finding a place to hook up and keep getting interrupted so cruelly that an hour and a half of this should feel intensely frustrating. However, instead, it feels like the most exquisite foreplay and the most skillful teasing. By the lovely end of the film, which ends in just one chaste, but soulful kiss, you don't feel cheated, you don't feel teased, you feel COURTED, and when was the last time a movie made you feel like that?

Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken.These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from Paths of Glory. Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

Also a very nice performance by Claudine Longet. Two of the funniest scenes are in the beginning, when, as a bit actor in Hollywood, Peter Sellers refuses to die on cue in a Gunga Din-type scene, and then accidentally steps on a detonator that prematurely blows up a fortress before the cameras are rolling.

I've never been a fan of David Koepp and all you could expect from him appears here . Some cliché , some stupidity and some predictability mixed together . For example &#x96; the three thugs . From the first time they appear you now that they are three cliché &#x96; one innocent saint , one bad psycho and one neutral idiot . It's not strange who will kill who long before the movie will end. It's also not strange who will make a sacrifice and who will be an almost indestructible killing machine.The stupidity &#x96; When you're robbing a house , even an empty one , you should wear a mask .

The first scene establishes Melvin (Jack Nicholson) as a cold asshole, the second reveals his OCD, establishing him altogether as a guy you wouldn't normally find in a romcom, while also getting people who are bummed about being forced to see the film on board. In the third, however, we find Melvin writing romantic literature, pointing out the direction of the film. Shot from behind some shelves, we are told that his sensitive side is hidden only deep beneath, but as the camera moves to the other side of the shelves for the next shot, we also know that this side will be uncovered eventually.The grittiness of the film is pretty much limited to Nicholson's unusually bad behavior and allowing the actors to curse, which is hardy enough to subvert genre conventions. Other than that, there's not much originality in the unlikely love trope or the gay supporting characters. But as always, just because we know A and B does not mean there isn't any fun to be had getting there.There's a really weird pacing to this film. As described above, the protagonist is presented very economically, as is his counterpart Carol (Helen Hunt), but then it feels like the film noodles around for like an hour, which only feels partly necessary for developing the characters and their relations further. In any case there is really no need for this film to be more than two hours long. Once the unlikely trio Melvin, Carol, and Melvin's gay neighbor Simon go on their trip, though, the film becomes a lot of fun. Comedies rarely make me laugh when I'm alone but both I'm afraid he might pull the stiff one-eye on me and something about whether crabs were in season now made me lose it. The film also delivers in the sweetness and romance department; You make me want to be a better man is one of the most heartwarming lines ever.I think one of the measures of success is if you want the lead characters to get together at the end of the film. As an incurable cynic, I wouldn't have minded if the only victory was the suggestion that Melvin's ailment was improving (by him forgetting to lock his door and finally stepping on some tiles), but the mere fact that I wasn't bothered by the happy ending was a small victory in itself.

Comedies rarely make me laugh when I'm alone but both I'm afraid he might pull the stiff one-eye on me and something about whether crabs were in season now made me lose it. The film also delivers in the sweetness and romance department; You make me want to be a better man is one of the most heartwarming lines ever.I think one of the measures of success is if you want the lead characters to get together at the end of the film. As an incurable cynic, I wouldn't have minded if the only victory was the suggestion that Melvin's ailment was improving (by him forgetting to lock his door and finally stepping on some tiles), but the mere fact that I wasn't bothered by the happy ending was a small victory in itself.

The relationship between the main character and his on and off girlfriend plays a central role in the film which differs from the book. The book is definitely worth a read for anyone who enjoys the film.Fever Pitch does a brilliant job of portraying all the emotions a football fan goes through, how it can affect every aspect of your life and how non football fans don't understand it. Therefore even people with no interest in football could also relate to this film and enjoy it. The whole cast were great in their respective roles and all brought a realistic element to it which is what I love about British films. I liked seeing Colin Firth in this role as it was an early film of his and probably not something most people would expect to see him in. I thought the whole atmosphere created in the scenes at matches was really authentic and it was also interesting to see how football has changed in certain ways.

In fact the dialogue is so lame it drags the plot line through the mud whilst dragging this underdeveloped story at a snail's pace.But why are these sequels made? My answer is that they are deliberately made, regardless if they are bad or good, in order to substantiate and draw closer attention to the original. If one sees The Fly 2 in the company of those who had seen the original he will be faced with commentary from those viewers that they should not compare the lousy sequel to the original, which is far superior. What this does is give the movie goers a false set of choices. They'll think, Hmmm, well I never saw the original, but if it's better than this illogical nonsense it must explain why it's such a good movie worth seeing and understanding. I've figured out Hollywood's scam. This trick and ploy has been played by Hollywood numerous times and it only gets more insidious and crafty as time goes on.Now, back to my review of The Fly 2. Even though it is a shame these movies are confused, you cannot omit one without explicating the other. The Fly 2 has wooden and sometimes amateur acting. Eric Stoltz and Daphne Zuniga were overrated B-list actors who managed to have a fairly lengthy run in their career stints. Here, their on-screen chemistry is almost non-existent and their friendship looks very forced and awkward. The obligatory sex scene was intended to set the tone for the Fly 3 which thankfully never happened after this abomination. The characters throughout are unsympathetic, unlikeable without having any character development or clear motives. I was surprised to see an acclaimed actor as Lee Richardson lowering himself to be in this drek. Some veteran actors need the money.While the first hour just drags on the plot doesn't kick in high gear until Martin (Stoltz) undergoes his genetic mutation. Then things get ugly. People die gruesome deaths, two of which turned out to be quite gnarly and brutal. While I was hoping for an interesting plot twist, all we get is a boring sequel that denigrates into silly gross-out antics. What a waste. I feel that good Science Fiction thrillers have the proper balance of both science and fiction with the former element taking precedence. But in Fly 2 all we have is farcical and grotesque fiction with very little science. To the film's credit, the technical merits are impressive and are the only redeeming qualities to this poorly directed, poorly written film.

Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ?Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word what, which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

Things are looking up after a series of successful fights, but can Jake control his temper and his possessive streak ?Raging Bull is a movie I both admire a lot and simultaneously don't really like, which I think was partly the intention of the filmmakers. It's a mixture of frenetic, intense boxing scenes, which leave you gasping and are among the best ever staged in all cinema, and blunt, drab, kitchen-sink domestic squabbles which are beautifully played but stark and squalid. They deserve kudos for depicting Jake's life with unflinching honesty, but his suspicious, intolerant, violent nature goes on and on for about three times as many scenes as necessary. If you watch the 2004 animated children's film Shark Tale, there's a great scene where a puffer fish (voiced by Scorsese) and a shark (voiced by DeNiro) argue about what each other meant by using the word what, which is basically all the drama in Raging Bull condensed into thirty seconds. Where the movie really scores though is in the style, and particularly in Michael Chapman's fabulous black-and-white photography. The fights are all beautifully shot, with dazzling cuts and different approaches for each of them - the rings seem to stretch out to eternity at points and close into tiny arcs at others. Every conceivable angle is used and the horrific bloodbath of LaMotta's final 1951 showdown with Sugar Ray Robinson is particularly stunning. I'm not quite sure what to say about DeNiro's Oscar-winning turn as LaMotta, which some cite as one of the best performances of all time. As an actor disappearing into character it's most definitely an amazing piece of work (DeNiro famously gained sixty pounds for the fat scenes and learned to box to a professional level), I'm just not convinced that's what an actor's job is. The film does a terrific job of evoking the period and recalls the stylish pictures made by Martin Ritt or John Cassavetes; it reminds me of a comment the latter once made citing a great compliment was when someone said they didn't like his movie but they couldn't get it out of their head. Featuring great sound design and an inspired use of period source music - Jake's main theme is the beautiful Intermezzo from Mascagni's one-act opera Cavalleria Rusticana. Scripted by Mardik Martin and Paul Schrader, based on the book by LaMotta, who is still alive (aged 92) at this time of writing, and lovingly dedicated to one of Scorsese's film professors, Haig Manoogian. Boxing movies tend to be formulaic, where the protagonist is a moral man who triumphs over adversity. If nothing else, Raging Bull rejects both of these ideas and gives us someone who survives his harsh environment through sheer tenacity alone.

Jurassic Park and The Lost World excelled at the premise of dinosaurs on an island and then along comes Jurassic Park III to cause the film, let alone the entire franchise, to go down the drain. Within this film are fatal mistakes that destroys the movie as a whole.The film is just a dinosaur attack film. Yes, The Lost World is like that too, but Jurassic Park III can not even do what its predecessor did to make it work on some note. The Lost World had the herbivores also be dangerous. Jurassic Park III made it so the carnivores are dangerous and the herbivores are friendly to humans. With that in place, the humans go running through herds of dinosaurs that are actually just as dangerous as the raptors that are chasing them. To add to the annoyance of the dinosaur attack film, the first thing that happens when the group settles down is that plane is attacked and two people are eaten by the Spinosaurus.Nothing new is added to the film. The entire reason there is a film is because someone got stuck on the island and the group goes to rescue them. If I recall correctly, that is the same reason there was a plot in The Lost World. Even minor moments are stolen from the other films like Billy has a lucky bag, same as Sarah. The plane crashes because of the main dinosaur, the trailers are destroyed by the main dinosaur. And so on. Actually, the nothing new thing is a lie. They had new dinosaurs and new dinosaurs attack. They redid the raptors, replaced the T-Rex with the Spinosaurus, and added Pteranodons as another dinosaur to attack. The writers spent little time working on an original story that was not done in the previous movie and instead spent time adding and changing the dinosaurs.The film is poorly written, complete with comical and one dimensional characters, dinosaurs that bring nothing interesting, and has no tension because there are no twists on who will make it or what the dinosaurs or the characters are going to do. All in all, Jurassic Park III is the worst film of the Jurassic Park franchise and a bad movie altogether.

Basically Low-Down-Dirty Shame is a boring clichéd movie that is just full of black jive. This is a movie where the cool black dude is not just stereotypical, but everywhere. Not only is Shame (Keenan Ivory Wayans) a cool black guy, but so is his secretary Peaches. What really annoyed me is that at the end those two got together and basically it was a relationship that just didn't seem right. When I create relationships, there is just something about them that make them seem right (not that they will work, rather just seem realistic).Low Down Dirty Shame is about an ex-cop who has become a private detective but his work is a little slow and he has a habit of losing his pay because he causes too much damage. The down and out detective is just too clichéd to be believable. Yet even though he is almost bankrupt, somehow he still has a cool car, heaps of guns, and a nice suit. Seriously this movie is just stretches the imagination too far. The plot is also too clichéd. He is after a Mexican drug-lord which seems to be the focus of every pointless cop movie these days. The twist is that this drug-lord is supposed to be dead, killed by Shame a few years earlier. Not only is this clichéd but the annoying Lieutenant is just as bad because he keeps on telling Shame off for just being there. He even tries to arrest Shame but Shame is just way too cool for that. As far as I am concerned, this movie can stay on the shelves.
