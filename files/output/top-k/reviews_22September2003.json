But I still cannot for the life of me shake this impression of it being a Geek Flick. I'll give it a 3 out of 5 stars if someone asked me to. What really makes me want to divert from stepping foot into a theater to see this and that other waste-of-time Harry Potter, is witnessing the way adults go around parading themselves on trains and buses with those colorful novels and celebrating their return to childish innocence which I call the return to childish freedom to be and do whatever one feels so as to convince oneself that the world is safer than the one they've known lately as adults-a fantasy to bury themselves in, I think it is only appealing to those adults who haven't been getting any bedroom action. I am reminded of Comicbook Guy on the Simpsons, so is there a little bit of him in every adult? Not me, and not any other respectable adult. But unlike that visually beautiful filth known as Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings doesn't try too hard, the plot (although cliche) is a representation of human\/dwarf struggle at its very roots. Its about working together with our strengths combined by friendship in order to face the deadly unknown, being straight from the depths of the imagination are creatures of strange and clumsy form who may or may not threaten us. In that way I guess the movie brings people together by the common act of being human (I had not however noticed any diversity in the banding of the merry men). But I assume that anyone who knows what a real struggle is like knows that this is fantastic filth\/garbage. A movie like this only appeals to those of us who are sheltered, suburbanites or are urban individuals caught in an urban struggle and want to escape through some loser's imagination (I forget the loser's name, nor would I ever care to have it).

We've been conditioned to remember the sex, violence, explosions -- things that have big impacts on the consciousness.This film has almost none of that at all, however.  The story is held together by little details.  If one can hold onto the memories of the details long enough, then one can also figure out the end of the story about halfway through the film.

It set a high water mark for anime and along with films like Macross and Vampire Hunter D; was very instrumental in anime crossing the pacific to enjoy widespread popularity in the U.S.The only complaint I could think of at the moment is that much of the plot was toned down from the even more adult themes of the comic book anime that this was based on.  Although many people think that the original dubbed voices were poorly done, I think that they gave the movie some extra character and charm.

But what bothered me more were the obvious comparisons to the 1986 TV movie The Worst Witch, in which many of the main characters of this work seem to have appeared. Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall are obviously different sides\/aspects of Diana Rigg's Hardbroom. Professor Dumbledore, an obvious male version of Miss Cackle. Harry is Mildred, and Ronald Weasley is Maud. Furthermore, Draco Malfoy can be found in the Worst Witch, in the form of Ethel Hallow. Hardbroom gives Mildred nothing but a hard time in potions class, Miss Spellbinder (Madam Hooch to the HP fans) is trying to teach the first years how to fly, and they're all getting ready for a visit from Tim Curry's Grand Wizard (the HP's Minister of Magic). And, while this group of young witches plays terror tag rather than Quittich, and it is an all girl school instead of going co-ed, the obvious comparisons are still staggering.But ah, well. No one has sued, so what are we to do?Harry Potter is a young survivor of a dark crusade to silence those in opposition to an ancient evil. As a baby in his crib, he was spared by the Grace of his mother's love. Although of Wizarding blood, the attack on young Harry has left him with certain gifts and abilities he otherwise would not have had. As puberty strikes, so does Hogwarts in the guise of multiple invitations to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry's subsequent shopping trip to Diagon Alley is very entertaining, and rich with detail to which you otherwise would not be privy, concerning the back-story and succeeds in accomplishing character depth and setting the mood for the rest of the story.The direction by Chris Columbus is creatively wonderful. The cinematography is outstanding as great attention has been paid to detail. Details, no matter how small or inconsequential, enrich any creative work, regardless of the medium. I just hate the fact that Columbus (as Exec. Producer of this and subsequent HP films) could not find the time to read ahead through the second book to determine that there was a pumpkin patch, rocky crags, and a second room on Hagrid's hut! How much more beautiful would the PoA have been without having to stomach the sudden changes to accommodate the TRUE layout of Hogwarts grounds?!) The train ride to Hogwarts introduces the main supporting characters; Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).As the first years (new students) arrive by boat to Hogwarts Castle, the look of wonder on all their faces is absolutely believable. When I first saw this production, I was a bit full of wonder myself. Hogwarts is beautifully done, every little component of architecture and design was perpetrated with an intense caring, and great eye for detail. The acting by these young thespians is honest and genuine; truly professional performances by all involved. Let me also add here that the casting was top row. They got just the right people for just the right parts. In my opinion, there was not a single character that was mis-cast. (I absolutely detest Tom Felton's character, Draco Malfoy...his acting is brilliant, to elicit such a gut reaction towards his character.) Maggie Smith is a joy as the hard-lined Professor McGonagall. I've always loved watching her demonstrate her talents, and her performance in this production was no exception. Her character is like a roasted marshmallow...hard and tough on the outside, but with a heart that can be soft and sweet on the inside. Her treatment of young Harry demonstrates the love her character felt for his parents, now deceased; murdered in the dark crusade waged by Voldemort, one of the darkest wizards ever produced by the House of Slytherin (one of the four Houses at Hogwarts), and his many followers. Emma Watson positively shines as Hermione Granger. Her performance is quite believable and lends so MUCH to the movie. Her character was one of my favorites from the book, and her personification lives up to my every expectation. She plays the well-(self-) educated neophyte Witchling VERY well. I cannot wait to see where life leads her in the future. Robbie Coltrain's character; however, was my favorite among the teachers. Rubius Hagrid, who says repeatedly, I shouldn't have said that, has a heart of pure gold, and the demeanor of a true gentle giant. No one could've portrayed Hagrid, like Robbie Coltrain. The scenery and mountain footage shot and shown in abundance is absolutely breath-taking, the direction giving this effort the professional quality for which I had hoped it would possess. The effects were stunningly clever and extremely well perpetrated, brilliantly demonstrating Rowling's extraordinary imagination and creativity, and perpetuating the magic of her original literary work. I was pleased with this movie; though not as pleased as I was in reading the book.Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a marvelous job with the monsters in this movie. Better than I would have expected from Brian (Jim's son) when you compare his Muppets From Space to the earlier Muppet films done by his dad. Impressive work on Fluffy and Norbert, Brian.

The train ride to Hogwarts introduces the main supporting characters; Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson).As the first years (new students) arrive by boat to Hogwarts Castle, the look of wonder on all their faces is absolutely believable. When I first saw this production, I was a bit full of wonder myself. Hogwarts is beautifully done, every little component of architecture and design was perpetrated with an intense caring, and great eye for detail. The acting by these young thespians is honest and genuine; truly professional performances by all involved. Let me also add here that the casting was top row. They got just the right people for just the right parts. In my opinion, there was not a single character that was mis-cast. (I absolutely detest Tom Felton's character, Draco Malfoy...his acting is brilliant, to elicit such a gut reaction towards his character.) Maggie Smith is a joy as the hard-lined Professor McGonagall. I've always loved watching her demonstrate her talents, and her performance in this production was no exception. Her character is like a roasted marshmallow...hard and tough on the outside, but with a heart that can be soft and sweet on the inside. Her treatment of young Harry demonstrates the love her character felt for his parents, now deceased; murdered in the dark crusade waged by Voldemort, one of the darkest wizards ever produced by the House of Slytherin (one of the four Houses at Hogwarts), and his many followers. Emma Watson positively shines as Hermione Granger. Her performance is quite believable and lends so MUCH to the movie. Her character was one of my favorites from the book, and her personification lives up to my every expectation. She plays the well-(self-) educated neophyte Witchling VERY well. I cannot wait to see where life leads her in the future. Robbie Coltrain's character; however, was my favorite among the teachers. Rubius Hagrid, who says repeatedly, I shouldn't have said that, has a heart of pure gold, and the demeanor of a true gentle giant. No one could've portrayed Hagrid, like Robbie Coltrain. The scenery and mountain footage shot and shown in abundance is absolutely breath-taking, the direction giving this effort the professional quality for which I had hoped it would possess. The effects were stunningly clever and extremely well perpetrated, brilliantly demonstrating Rowling's extraordinary imagination and creativity, and perpetuating the magic of her original literary work. I was pleased with this movie; though not as pleased as I was in reading the book.Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a marvelous job with the monsters in this movie.

Story is about Carol White (Moore) who is married to Greg (Xander Berkeley) and they live in the San Fernando Valley of California in a very neat and sterile looking home. Carol spends her days going to the gym, functions, dinner parties and shopping. Her life is very organized and clean. Carol does not come across as a deep thinker and at times has difficulty finishing sentences. One day she starts to feel ill and goes to the doctor to get checked. They run tests but they show nothing. As time goes by and Carol gets worse she finally figures out that her immune system is allergic to things in our environment. Car fumes, hairspray, perfume, pollution, ink from newspapers and many other things. She discovers a spa in New Mexico that caters to people that have this affliction and Carol moves there. The spa is run by Peter (Peter Friedman) who acts like a new age, self help guru and preaches that all the patients made themselves sick with their mind. Todd Haynes has always sought out the best cinematographers that he could find and found Alex Nepomniaschy (Narc) for this film. One of the most impressive things about this film is how beautifully shot this is. Their are so many shots that are just stunning to look at and the use of colors is important as to how we respond to certain scenes. Haynes did this also in Far From Heaven which is one of the most beautiful films ever shot. This was a very important role for Moore and her performance is so vital to the film. Moore lost about 10 pounds for the role and later in the film she does appear gaunt. This performance was so well received that it launched her career to even better roles.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The script has many ironic points to it and the one glaring piece of irony is how we see Carol at the beginning and the end of the film. At the beginning we see her in her clean and sterile home in California. Then at the end we see her in her Safehouse. A totally sterile environment and still not much of a life to live. An interesting point that the film makes is that the condition of these patients is caused by their mental status. Their bodies react in a truly sick manner and can even cause death but its all caused by themselves. In the cast of the film is Jessica Harper who is not in enough scenes and I was happy to see her pop up in a role. I've always been a fan of hers and I wish her role was larger. And Brandon Cruz (The Courtship of Eddie's Father) has a small role also. The pacing of the film is slow and deliberate and some may find this to be a fatal flaw. It is a slow running film, especially when the film shifts to the spa in New Mexico. If your a fan of Haynes (Like me) than you should definitely check out this early feature from him.

This performance was so well received that it launched her career to even better roles.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The script has many ironic points to it and the one glaring piece of irony is how we see Carol at the beginning and the end of the film. At the beginning we see her in her clean and sterile home in California. Then at the end we see her in her Safehouse. A totally sterile environment and still not much of a life to live. An interesting point that the film makes is that the condition of these patients is caused by their mental status. Their bodies react in a truly sick manner and can even cause death but its all caused by themselves. In the cast of the film is Jessica Harper who is not in enough scenes and I was happy to see her pop up in a role. I've always been a fan of hers and I wish her role was larger. And Brandon Cruz (The Courtship of Eddie's Father) has a small role also. The pacing of the film is slow and deliberate and some may find this to be a fatal flaw. It is a slow running film, especially when the film shifts to the spa in New Mexico. If your a fan of Haynes (Like me) than you should definitely check out this early feature from him.

Story is about Carol White (Moore) who is married to Greg (Xander Berkeley) and they live in the San Fernando Valley of California in a very neat and sterile looking home. Carol spends her days going to the gym, functions, dinner parties and shopping. Her life is very organized and clean. Carol does not come across as a deep thinker and at times has difficulty finishing sentences. One day she starts to feel ill and goes to the doctor to get checked. They run tests but they show nothing. As time goes by and Carol gets worse she finally figures out that her immune system is allergic to things in our environment. Car fumes, hairspray, perfume, pollution, ink from newspapers and many other things. She discovers a spa in New Mexico that caters to people that have this affliction and Carol moves there. The spa is run by Peter (Peter Friedman) who acts like a new age, self help guru and preaches that all the patients made themselves sick with their mind. Todd Haynes has always sought out the best cinematographers that he could find and found Alex Nepomniaschy (Narc) for this film. One of the most impressive things about this film is how beautifully shot this is. Their are so many shots that are just stunning to look at and the use of colors is important as to how we respond to certain scenes.

As an adult viewer, there are four obstacles to enjoying this movie pace, believability, believability part 2, and the Harry Potter Drinking Game.The pace of the movie was fairly slow. For a movie this long (152 min.), that's typically because they didn't edit it down to a manageable length. (The other excuse, that the story demanded it, doesn't apply here.) We watch as Harry is conveniently abandoned by Hagrid at the train station with a ticket for platform 9-3\/4. This signals the start of another little puzzle that Harry must solve in order for him to go on. Of course Harry, the bright lad he is, figures it out. Unfortunately, this sequence doesn't add to the story, and neither do many others.There are too many unbelievable\/convenient elements in the story. Hermione just happens to know the spell to fix Harry's glasses. Ron just happens to do well at chess in time to win the Wizard's Chess Puzzle. Harry just happens to have special abilities he inherited from his mother which are only revealed when he battles Professor Quirrell. Harry just happens to accidentally make the winning play during his first Quidditch game. This goes on throughout the movie, turning most minds into cabbage jelly.The adults, as portrayed by the movie, are completely out of touch with the school and its students. Despite the faculty of Hogwarts having great experience with all kinds of tricks that budding wizards like to play, nobody says anything about Harry's very public cursed broom episode during the Quidditch game. As in many other episodes in the film, the adults either look down upon or ignore the students. Of note, this theme has been given wide treatment in many other teenage angst films, but without the benefit of being so unreal and heavy-handed.Every time Harry is introduced to someone new, that person has to act surprised, intrigued, and in awe (it's in their contract). Harry's 'name recognition' scene was played approximately one thousand times too many. I quote from my still-burning memory cells Potter? Harry Potter? _THE_ Harry Potter?. By the middle of the film, I was cringing at the sight of any new character within shouting distance of Harry. Perhaps someone will revisit the Bob Newhart Show drinking game with the Harry Potter movies.Overly long, contrivances galore, and the Harry Potter Drinking Game were the only major faults I could stand to learn about. Other than that, watch till ya' drop.
