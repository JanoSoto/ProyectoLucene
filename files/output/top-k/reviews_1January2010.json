Both good. But Aliens has a striking maturity to it, due mostly to Sigourney Weaver's performance and the gritty, military environment.Aliens will always be one of my all-time favorite films. The first film introduced us to the alien species, and features excellent direction by Ridley Scott, but THIS is the film that really established this universe, its technology, and who Ripley is, and it's THIS film that all the other Alien sequels have been compared to. James Cameron, who has proved himself a great director and science-fiction writer, took what Scott created and made his own epic.It's hard to explain why Aliens is loved by so many. It has a strong human element, brought about by the Ripley-Newt relationship. Most action movies try to tack on love stories, that usually feel clichéd. The mother-daughter angle was a surprisingly nice touch, yet it is done without being overly sentimental or hokey. Carrie Henn gives a fine performance, while Sigourney fully deserved her Best Actress nomination.The visual effects are so good that you often are unaware of them. It was not until recently checking out the DVD features that I realized many of the sets are actually miniatures. The score by James Horner (despite the off-screen tension between Horner and Cameron) is one of his best. The Sulaco is a beauty to look at, as is much of background of this film. The supporting characters really establish a family of marines. Part of the reason this film holds up to repeat viewings is how colorful each character is, even the ones that die early in the film like Apone and Frost. The humans are truly the focus of the film, not the aliens. In fact, it is over an hour before the aliens even first appear.But for anyone who complains this pacing is too slow, don't worry, you'll get your money's worth of action in the last 40 minutes. The tension in the final sequence when the Queen Alien is first introduced always raises my blood pressure. This would be the peak of the series.The only real criticism I've ever had of the movie is that the title is a bit plain and generic. Every time I say I love the movie Aliens I feel a little silly, and I usually have to clarify by adding you know, the James Cameron movie so the other person knows what I mean.Well, rest assured, Aliens (you know, the James Cameron movie) is actually excellent film-making with an iconic and complex heroine, and one of its kind a war movie in outer space.

A writer (Billy Crystal) has his idea for a book stolen by his ex-wife who turns it into a major hit. He wishes he could kill her but his student (Danny DeVito) takes his talk serious and kills her in exchange that the writer kills his nagging mother (Anne Ramsey). With the talent involved this film should have been a whole lot better and even though there are countless flaws, in the end I can't help but find the film mildly entertaining, if disappointing. I think the biggest problem with the film is that there's way too much plot for a 88-minute comedy. We have so many double-crosses, plot twists and side plots that you could take them and use them in two or three movies. I think the film would have been a lot better had some of the plot been taken out and replaced with more laughs, which is one thing this comedy could have used more of. What does work is the chemistry between Crystal and DeVito. Both men really dig into their roles and turn in fine performances but they are both letdown by the screenplay. One of the first scenes involves Crystal suffering from writer's block and trying to complete the same line over and over. This scene goes on way too long. What does work is the early banter between the two actors as DeVito's character is constantly showing up at bad times wanting to know if Crystal enjoyed his bad stories. There's a very funny sequence when the two are discussing the so called plan that was only in DeVito's mind. Ramsey, who many will remember from THE GOONIES, turns in a nice, foul-mouthed performance and you can't help but love to hate her. Her relationship with DeVito, while mean-spirited, is also quite touching in a few scenes. Again, there's a lot wrong with this film but I think the three leads have enough going to carry the weak screenplay a lot further than it deserves.

Never a truer statement has been made about one of the most popular films to have ever been made.The Plot is a simple one that has since been regurgitated and trundled out almost yearly it feels like. James Stewart plays George Bailey, an all round swell fella, who because of a number of life's circumstances finds himself forever a resident of Bedford Falls. Here he is the principal guy in the running of the family Building & Loan business. When a substantial amount of money goes missing during the run up to Christmas, Bailey finds himself at the mercy of family nemesis, and nefarious town banker, Mr. Potter Lionel Barrymore. But George, tipped over the edge by an incident involving the bank funds, has an idea that taking his own life would greatly improve the fortunes of his family and the family business. But as he stands at the precipice of death by suicide, George is saved by his guardian angel Clarence Henry Travers and given the chance to see what Bedford Falls would be like having not had George Bailey's influence.Few, if any, directors have rivalled Frank Capra when it comes to successfully portraying the human heart on screen. It's A Wonderful Life is Capra's masterpiece. Rightly so, it is unashamedly sentimental, but also it's rich with the directors faith in community spirit and a belief in the strong bond of family love. The story is loosely worked from The Greatest Gift, a Phillip Van Doren Stern story that he had sent to his friends as a Christmas card. Aided on screen writing duties by Frances Goodrich & Albert Hackett Dalton Trumbo is in there sometimes too, Capra fashioned an ultimate feel good movie that is flecked by sheer darkness and disconcerting life is tough undertones. It's most likely that the more dark side of the film, and the wait for Christmas cheer, is what made It's A Wonderful Life a flop on its release. The film made a huge loss, tho not quite as gargantuan as many today believe, and was quickly consigned to the forgotten bin. But annual yuletide repeats on television over the following decades garnered it a cult following. A cult following that eventually swelled to a near universal one, to the point that now Christmas just wouldn't be the same without it. It is by definition, the ultimate comeback movie.Tho all the cast are superb special mention to Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary it's Stewart who leads the way in the class stakes. As he drifts from homely, lovable dreamer, a man sacrificing those dreams for others to benefit. To his descent into despair and the undertaking of a nightmarish odyssey, Stewart captivates in every frame, and more telling is that he is believable with each transformation of George's state of mind. However, when all is said and done, it's with the ending that basically the film rewards those who have trusted in Capra and Jimmy. It's an ending warm enough to melt the coldest of hearts. So see it with someone you love always nice to have someone else to cry with or introduce it to the poor souls who haven't seen it yet. Either way, it's here to stay forever the timeless classic that it so most certainly is. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 January 2010","score":"14 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" I once read that It's A Wonderful Life is the holiday gift for all time.

What they don't expect is a cook, Stacey Ryback(Steven Seagal), interrupting their grand design at making millions from foreign clients..what Krill couldn't discover until after Adams' removal was that this annoying, pain-in-the-ass cook was an ex-Seal with martial arts, weapons, and bomb-making skills. Even with about 30 men at his disposal, working throughout the Missouri, Strannix can not seem to halt Ryback's abilities to move about at will, taking them out little by little. Ryback has an unlikely ally in a Playboy model, Jordan Tate(Erika Eleniak, who was a major babe during this period)who he finds by accident, popping out of a cake intended for Adams. Together they free some trapped sailors, and attempt to thwart the efforts of Strannix, Krill, and their goons, hoping to stop the transmission of missiles, as well as disrupt their methods.The film alternates between the Missouri and a secret building within the Pentagon where Ryback will communicate with the military and governmental suits, such as Admiral Bates(Andy Romano), keeping them apprised of the ongoing situation. Meanwhile, we see how those in the Pentagon react as Strannix and company go about to threaten possible global terror. Those in the Pentagon plan, if they must, to send an air strike in order to keep the Missouri from destroying civilizations.Having previously worked with Steven Seagal on Above the Law, director Andrew Davis knew what to expect..let's face it, Seagal isn't gonna captivate us with some sterling performance. Stevens lets Seagal do what he does best, wipe out the bad guys in various ways, such as gunfights and knife battles. Anyone who comes within close proximity of Seagal is mincemeat, plain and simple. This was one of three films Stevens worked with Tommy Lee Jones, and the second where he's a villain and killer. Under Siege has plenty of personality to compensate for Seagal's lack thereof(..though, his silent calm is part of what makes his characters effective, the way they go about their business, not letting too much emotion take away from their abilities to take out those who wish to disrupt the peace, unleashing fury on the hostile and base). Stevens, for instance, allows TLJ to let it all hang out, going into any direction he so wishes, giving him every opportunity to go completely off-the-charts psychopathic. Busey, his side-kick, is also given carte blanche to chew as much scenery as he so desires(..he even has a scene in drag where he asks Strannix, Do I look like I need a psychological evaluation?). While TLJ is made short work by Seagal at the end, it's not about their final dueling of blades that he's used, but all the time before this. He's used as entertainment while Seagal obliterates his men, it's a balance I think that works exceptionally.I just love the way Stevens shoots the action set pieces throughout the ship, following Ryback and the few he has to help him..Stevens gets every bit of value he can from the ship setting(aboard the USS Alabama, in actuality), and the way Ryback goes about his business actually doesn't seem too far-fetched. Sure, he's a Rambo archetype, but I figure there are many like me who find great joy in these one man army movies. I like, though, how Ryback requires assistance from others in order to stop Krill from fixing a damaged wing(..Ryback bombed)on the sub and the many scumbags firing at them throughout the Missouri. I like the decision to alternate between the ship and Pentagon, establishing the importance of successfully upending Strannix or else risk doom to the civilized world. I imagine Seagal looks back at this movie with pride, it's easily one of his best to date.

What they don't expect is a cook, Stacey Ryback(Steven Seagal), interrupting their grand design at making millions from foreign clients..what Krill couldn't discover until after Adams' removal was that this annoying, pain-in-the-ass cook was an ex-Seal with martial arts, weapons, and bomb-making skills. Even with about 30 men at his disposal, working throughout the Missouri, Strannix can not seem to halt Ryback's abilities to move about at will, taking them out little by little. Ryback has an unlikely ally in a Playboy model, Jordan Tate(Erika Eleniak, who was a major babe during this period)who he finds by accident, popping out of a cake intended for Adams. Together they free some trapped sailors, and attempt to thwart the efforts of Strannix, Krill, and their goons, hoping to stop the transmission of missiles, as well as disrupt their methods.The film alternates between the Missouri and a secret building within the Pentagon where Ryback will communicate with the military and governmental suits, such as Admiral Bates(Andy Romano), keeping them apprised of the ongoing situation. Meanwhile, we see how those in the Pentagon react as Strannix and company go about to threaten possible global terror. Those in the Pentagon plan, if they must, to send an air strike in order to keep the Missouri from destroying civilizations.Having previously worked with Steven Seagal on Above the Law, director Andrew Davis knew what to expect..let's face it, Seagal isn't gonna captivate us with some sterling performance. Stevens lets Seagal do what he does best, wipe out the bad guys in various ways, such as gunfights and knife battles. Anyone who comes within close proximity of Seagal is mincemeat, plain and simple. This was one of three films Stevens worked with Tommy Lee Jones, and the second where he's a villain and killer. Under Siege has plenty of personality to compensate for Seagal's lack thereof(..though, his silent calm is part of what makes his characters effective, the way they go about their business, not letting too much emotion take away from their abilities to take out those who wish to disrupt the peace, unleashing fury on the hostile and base). Stevens, for instance, allows TLJ to let it all hang out, going into any direction he so wishes, giving him every opportunity to go completely off-the-charts psychopathic. Busey, his side-kick, is also given carte blanche to chew as much scenery as he so desires(..he even has a scene in drag where he asks Strannix, Do I look like I need a psychological evaluation?). While TLJ is made short work by Seagal at the end, it's not about their final dueling of blades that he's used, but all the time before this. He's used as entertainment while Seagal obliterates his men, it's a balance I think that works exceptionally.I just love the way Stevens shoots the action set pieces throughout the ship, following Ryback and the few he has to help him..Stevens gets every bit of value he can from the ship setting(aboard the USS Alabama, in actuality), and the way Ryback goes about his business actually doesn't seem too far-fetched.

Stuck in a rat infested flat and under expensive therapy, Nina's grief is suddenly stopped in its tracks when Jamie comes back into her life as a ghost. Just as Nina meets Mark, a potential suitor.For his first feature film, director and writer Anthony Minghella chose this touching, and often funny, tale of bereavement and learning to love again. Written in the main for Stevenson to showcase her talents, its strengths lie in the actors performances, the sensitive writing and its low key moody production ethic. Often it's been tagged the British answer to the Moore\/Swayze movie Ghost. That's a lazy link and a touch misleading, as this is, if anything, the anti blockbuster movie, while the respective plots bear little resemblance. And besides which, this was made quite some time before Patrick and Demi were playing slinky round the pottery wheel.Stevenson is marvellous, she gives Nina real depth, and in one grief stricken scene she delivers one of the most believable enactments of that emotion ever put on to celluloid. Rickman shines as he gets his teeth into something outside of the bad guy roles he was still is known for. Watch out for a poem (La Muerta) segment shared between the two, pure class. And as Mark, Michael Maloney is hugely effective in what is the tricky third wheel role. While the impressive acting on show is boosted by Barrington Pheloung's poignant, rhythmic musical score.There are a number of interpretations put forward as to what Truly, Madly, Deeply is about. But really it has to be down to the individual viewer to make their own deductions. What isn't in doubt is that for anyone who been deeply in love or has lost a loved one to death, this film can't fail to ignite a number of emotions. Even as the comedy takes a hold, comedy which sits nicely within the structure of the tale I might add since some critics were baffled by the blend, one just knows we are being guided to a telling point where the story finishes for the protagonists, but goes on for us viewers long after the credits have rolled. To first time viewers I say, banish any hope of Hollywood histrionics and flourishing visuals and let Minghella and his wonderful cast take you by the hand.

I consider the film brilliant in all ways.Starting with the performances. Kristofferson is outstanding as a man raised in a world of the privileged, who leaves Harvard upon graduation to focus his youthful idealism through law enforcement, helping immigrants who have come to the U.S. looking for a better life. He is doomed to return to his roots and wealth, but only as an empty shell of man whose life ends with the death of his true love in Wyoming. I have seen Kristofferson in several other movies, with this being the only one suggesting acting ability why this ability surfaced in this movie, never to be seen again, is an interesting mystery - anyone have an answer? John Hurt is magnificent as the oratorically gifted intellectual whose inclination for self-indulgence wins out over his awareness and conscience of the injustice around him. We've all met someone like Hurt's character in this movie, and been both saddened and disgusted at the wasted potential.Christopher Walken is excellent in a complex role that stirs feelings of revulsion, sympathy, and admiration.

Trust me, I've seen more than my share of films and this one was unique to me, even thought provoking. It was yes funny and sad, sometimes at the same time the closer you get to the end. I think that had Cage not gone so over-the-top that the film would have been far too heavy,typical, and one-sided. Truly he does offensive things, but in his mind they aren't, and right or wrong I think it was a refreshing perspective. Secondly, I am not a Nick Cage fan. I don't think that you have to be one to enjoy this movie. I think that he works for this part, and it doesn't have as much to do with talent as it does with fit. He was good for this role.I like that the true plot isn't revealed right away. I think it would take away from the film to have everything handed to you. The truth is, the character doesn't understand what's happening to him, why should we right away. And as for the accent, yes, it will drive you crazy at first, but when you think of his switching persona toward the end when he's talking to his therapist. I think that it all makes sense, he's acting the way he's thinks a person should act. Even the hammy gestures during his transformation then make sense. He's acting how he thinks a vampire should act, the way he's seen it in the movies.I truly enjoyed this film and find myself enjoying even more in retrospect.

An outrageous, blasphemous freak of nature which shocked disgusted, and oddly reflected the times. In 1971, John Waters would perfect his B-movie making skills with his colorful, flamboyant, mean-spirited epic that would ultimately ensure Divine as THE cult icon of the 70's, and push the boundaries of bad taste as far as they would go. This is your worst nightmare made into the greatest cult comedy of all time. This is Pink Flamingos, the undisputed filthiest piece of filth in the history of film.I bought this atrocity of a film years ago. Even as an obsessive fan of B-cinema, I was completely oblivious to it's reputation, I mean, I seriously had no idea what I was about to watch. I'll never forget those first words uttered,  It's 1030, Babs, Babs, why isn't the egg man here? At that moment, I hadn't the vaguest idea as to what was next. All I knew was that the possibilities were endless. There was no telling how the next hour and 40 minutes could have gone. I just stared in awe, with jaw firmly on floor, and witnessed an epic battle. A battle of filth vs. evil.Through the ages, certain questions have plagued humankind. Questions like, where do we come from? What the hell's the deal with the Bermuda Triangle? And, Who's filthier, Divine and her entourage, or Connie and Raymond Marble? Actually, no one has ever asked that. Everyone already knows the answer.A random, and might I add, a rather unrealistic story, where a lot of things go shamelessly unexplained. Things such as, why would the Marbles assume they are filthier than Divine just because they kidnap girls and have them impregnated by the butler and sell the babies to lesbians? That's not that filthy... it's just plain mean.Of course, there's much more to it than that. Soon, the Marbles set they're sights on Divine and her entourage. Once they get under Divine's skin, we are forced to sit through castrations, public exposure, incest, cannibalism, shrimping, unhealthy obsessions, bestiality. The list goes on, and on... and on.Not exactly an organized contest, mind you, but rather a not so well-thought-out, yet devious plot by 2 jealous perverts, to dethrone a Queen. This time, Waters holds nothing back, and Divine is the very definition of outlandish. There is truly something to offend even the crudest of individuals. I love this movie.Once or twice every decade, a B-movie director comes along and creates something either so bad, so hilarious, or in this case, so disgusting, that it transcends B-entertainment all together. Pink Flamingos is just not what you would expect. An understatement? Of course, but true, nonetheless. A look into the mind of a demented man-child with a rebellious streak, a sick, yet unique sense of humor, and some seriously odd friends. Pink Flamingos is more than just the Waters masterpiece. Pink Flamingos is John Waters, which is kind of an intimidating thought. I don't care if you thought Combat Shock was funny, or that Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive could've used more blood. If you haven't seen Pink Flamingos... then, you just haven't seen Pink Flamingos. Nothing could have prepared you for this one. Some years later, John Waters would write a script for a sequel, entitled Flamingos Forever. A movie which was to be distributed by Troma, and would see the return of Divine, Cotton, Crackers, and Miss Edie. The unfortunate death of Edith Massey, among other problems, would forever prevent this dream come true from happening.

It's what you have seen 4 times already but just with different characters. There's not much new here, except for a few new 'creative' ways of killing someone. That's all there is really.For fans of Friday, this is of course enjoyable, but it's not really recommended for fans of horror films. They can stop after Friday I and II, in my opinion.5 out of 10 stars, but probably more for the fans of the Friday series.

Which is really a shame, because they started out so well.So what story do we have this time? We follow Tommy, our fearsome hero from the prequel, as an adult who's badly traumatized by the events that took place in Friday 13th part 4. Which is understandable.

His character, the Tramp, is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early 20th century, but something all of us can overcome.In one of his first roles with this character, he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan, who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family. Taking himself and this very talented young boy, Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote, directed, starred in and composed the score for this film.Here, Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another. The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own. He hasn't got much but he does have love, which is more than can be said for the child's mother.Flash forward five years, and now the mother wants her son back. Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion. Even so, the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful. This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks, things not used much at the time in the movies. Using these little tricks and ideas, Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the story.However, at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent\/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in. It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh, sometimes in the same scene. This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it.

I mean, none of the characters garner a single laugh(they aren't even entirely consistent; early in this, from one scene to the next, one of the leads behave in a manner that directly contradicts everything we've learned about him up to that point), and they are all one-note cardboard cut-outs, but you'd at least expect the dude they titled this after to be worth watching(yes, he is pretty smooth with the ladies, however, that's all; he's not charming). The plot is completely predictable. Gags and jokes are uninspired. OK, we get it, they are undisciplined, fine... if we laugh at it, will you move on? Martin and Aykroyd are hilarious... elsewhere. Tanks aren't that effective in combat anymore; they're slow, useless against the air and too easy to disable. The concept of a type that can hover is a worn-out sci-fi idea.
