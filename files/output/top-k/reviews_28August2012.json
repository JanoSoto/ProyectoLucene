I think the weakest point of the movie was its human characters, I liked Billy and Kate, but the rest of the human cast felt very underdeveloped and the majority were very two dimensional, I certainly would have liked to have seen the mother and especially the father develop more, he certainly had a story to tell that wasn't touched upon enough. The best part of the movie is, of course, the Gremlins themselves, particularly Gizmo, they can be lovable, terrifying, charming and outrageous, they're certainly one of the most memorable characters in film history.

This is the third of the original Pink Panther movies series (omitting the oddball fourth one from 1968 that didn't have Mancini, Sellers, or Edwards), and it comes over a decade after the first two. Was the public interested? Yes--it did well. It was a great formula. Is it still a good formula in 2012?Good question. It depends on your taste. But surely the names repeated above are all cinema greats that, like Chaplin, rise above their time. But of course, Sellers, as terrific as he was, was no Charles Chaplin. At his best, the comedy is hilarious. And that makes the movie worth watching for sure. But he is sometimes a bit off in his timing, or is stuck playing a stunt that isn't worthy of him. There's also a lag in the filler material, the scenes between the great stuff. Some marginal characters (including the leading woman, who is totally a late 60s type, not a 1975 type, and she feels oddly unnecessary) don't command their parts, or their scenes. The drift begins to drift. And then you realize there isn't much of a plot. The whole recovery (sort of) of the famous Pink Panther diamond after an elaborate theft isn't really the driving force of the movie. What takes its place is a slow interplay of the characters all stumbling over each other trying to trick the perpetrator into revealing the gem. So then you are back to the stumbling as comedy, and sometimes it's great. There are so many ridiculous moments with Sellers being a bumbling fool like no one, you are sure to laugh. And that's what you're here for. The Pink Panther is the original, and at times also a bit sluggish, but it's the first. And A Shot in the Dark is the best of the three, I think. But if you like them, you'll be just fine here. If you haven't seen any, you might go in order, since the sets and music are really spot on in the first two, and a bit more transporting. There is something a little off kilter here that make it an awkward, but decent, third.

Watching the film on its own, without any knowledge of the manner the characters were constructed or themes Thackaray tried to convey in his original novel, I regard it a solid effort. While Kubrick's body of film work is small yet memorable, I haven't seen all of his movies, but of those few that I have seen, Barry Lyndon seems like one of his better works. The film is an engaging and entertaining character study of an Irish rake who, through guile and luck, rises from a point of low social standing to become one of the members of the English aristocracy, only to fall again through his prodigal nature. Some critics have felt that Ryan O'Neal played the role of Redmond Barry (later titled Barry Lyndon after he married an aristocratic widow) in an uninspired and emotionless way. I disagree O'Neal was certainly not effusive with his emotions, but neither was he dull or lifeless. He played the role credibly Barry is more a subtle schemer than a demonstrative dandy. His background as an Irish farm boy who lived by his wits rather than his charm or book-smarts makes his understated character very believable; Barry is the strong silent type who will use guile to get what he wants, or, should that fail, his fists. The movie did not seem overlong; it is more a character study than a plot-driven drama. The movie is like a slow-moving stream that takes its time to explore every twist and turn in the reprobate Barry's life. It is fun to watch how Barry lifts himself up to a life of fortune, then lose it again. The film makes it easy to determine the character arc by dividing the story into two parts (and title cards explicitly describe the arc) part one is on Barry's rise to the top of the gentry, part two is on his fall. It is engaging to follow along, and is seldom dull or plodding. While O'Neal makes a positive impression as the protagonists, the other characters are fun to watch, too. The antagonist of the second half, Lord Bullingdon, is a great contrast to Barry bitter, emotional, and quick to act in a clumsy or demonstrative manner. His hatred for Barry is easy to understand, and no doubt will gain some sympathy from the audience, though this sympathy is tempered a great deal by Bullingdon's dandyish, dull-witted and vindictive demeanor. Less interesting is the character of Lady Lyndon. She says almost nothing in the movie, and merely reacts to situations in a passive manner. Her character is dull and uninteresting. Lady Lyndon would have been more interesting if she spoke more often to either Barry or Bullingdon, and there was some visible anger or conflict towards either for their disgraceful behavior.With Barry Lyndon, there is no doubt that Kubrick could make a beautifully-crafted yet subtly engaging character study that was just as good--if not better---than his shocking satires, like Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange. I understand some may balk at the apparently pat morality expressed in the movie--which seems like nothing more than a film version of A Rake's Progress. Nevertheless, Kubrick has crafted a wonderful three-dimensional character in Redmond Barry, and watching his triumphs and failures are entertaining to watch, even if the protagonist is himself ultimately unsympathetic. Kubrick also proved that he had an eye for detail when making a period piece. The sets and costumes beautifully evoke the decadence of eighteenth century Europe. In all, Barry Lyndon lives on as an unsung masterpiece by Kubrick, and it deserves a reputation far better than has currently.

From this point of view, this is a nice movie. At last we can see Hannibal in the real world, free to act as a fugitive might be free. We can see his mastery and genius. There's the whole emotional component about Hannibal's relationships with others, with the people he meets. It's an extremely complex character and a very charming one. It's one of that villains that terrify you because they're so attractive. He is so fascinating and clever that he is able to attract the sympathies of all even if his manners leave a slight sensation of dangerousness and mystery. It's the kind of man I could fall in love with just to ending with him eating my tongue. Anthony Hopkins did a great job with Hannibal in all the movies he plays as him. His face, his piercing gaze and all his charme are reflected in the character. There are some moments in the movie where Hannibal is very frightening because of his magnificent interpretation. His icy calm and the little smile when he attacks someone, not a smile of a mad man but something like true satisfaction and happiness. It's a character that makes you cheer for him. For me was like that. I was on his side from the beginning. And I know I'm not the only one, like I'm not the only one who wanted to see a deeper relationship between Starling and Hannibal. I found myself wanting morbidly to see the two of them together, something that would be insane at least, but I could not help it. If you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about.The biggest difference, for me, between this movie and his predecessor, not counting the absence of Jodie Foster, was the different kind of tension it has created. This, in my opinion, is the main reason why people didn't like this like The Silence of the Lambs. In the first movie the tension was completely a psychological matter. The feelings were created by the obscure nature of the movie, from the dark spaces and silent and from whispered words. From the ambiguity in the relationship between Starling and Lecter, from the great emotion that was created when the two characters were on the screen together. There was not a big action component in the movie. It was all darkness and psychological tension. In this movie they tried to add an action component that, unfortunately, went to defuse psychological tension. And another fundamental thing that is missing is the ambiguity in the relationship Starling\/Hannibal. In the first movie, the two of them got closer each other in some way and, they had a mental contact in a certain sense, a strange sort of affection. I don't know how to describe it, but you could feel it while watching the movie. In this movie this thing is missed at all. He tries to get closer in some way, but she is a wall. You can say that this is because of her experience, and her new maturity and this can justify all the matter objectively, but not emotionally for the audience, o for a part of them. I'm not saying that I wanted a true sentimental relationship between the two of them, and I think that no one wanted to see in openly. The great thing, the perfection of their relationship was actually in its ambiguity that had left space to the audiences fantasies without forcing in any direction but leaving the possibility of imagining. In the first movie this balance was perfect, on the contrary in this one all was lost due to her coldness, which has left many viewers dissatisfied. And then came the end. Create a great end, I think, was not the most simple thing to do. They've decided to put a wall between Starling and Hannibal, so, the kind of final they did was the only possible. Having Hannibal taking another decision would ruin the idea (I) we had of him. But it still leaves unsatisfied. I have to say that, if they had taken other choices, finish the movie like the book would have been dangerous, always for the matter of ambiguity. When I was reading the book, I've desired an end similar to the one that indeed was, but was the very fact of desiring it to make it special. In fact, when then the end arrived, I realized that I didn't want it to end like that.Now, despite all the paragons between the two movies, in this one there was the right balance of action and dialog and the tension never goes really down. There was some moment when I came up with exclamations like HOAA!!!. For instance, when Starling received the letter, or when she called Pazzi and find Lecter answering the phone. Or when Hannibal met Pazzi and his wife after the play. In that moment something came to me, a feeling. Because of this I can't reject this movie, because i make me feel something, and, at the end, I think this is the purpose of a movie, or anyway, this is the reason why I watch a movie. I also enjoyed so much the flashback sequence about what happened to Mason. I love the way the scene was shoot and the colours. It was very creepy. I was also pleased of the interpretation of the italians actors, in particular about Giancarlo Giannini, an actor I always loved.So, the movie was well structured and enjoyable if you think at it like a single movie. The problem was that you could not do that because this WAS a sequel and was inevitable a paragon with the first one. He missed Jodie so much and missed the relationship between the character even more. He suffers his condition of a sequel of a movie that made history.

Suffice to say, I was left pretty disappointed. I'll start with the mechanics of the film. I must say that the animation is very well done for the time the film was created. Of course, modern animation (whether two or three dimensional) is much more dynamic by today's standards, but context is everything. Visually, it was pretty impressive, especially the action scenes, and the detailings of the setting. It fully captures the essence of dark, grim, and futuristic, dystopian Tokyo on the verge of an apocalypse. So, on to what I didn't like about the film. I felt as if most of the characters very one-dimensional and dull, even the main characters Tetsuo and Kaneda. Tetsuo and Kaneda's relationship could've been a lot more developed, but they failed to do so. Immediately, we are thrust into a major plot point where Tetsuo gets injured. There was no time for the development of their relationship, which only could've taken a few scenes to animate. Instead, I felt as if there were a lot of unnecessary scenes with irrelevant dialogue throughout the film, dragging the film out longer than it should. Later on in the film, we find out that Tetsuo is struggling with his identity and role in his friendship with Kaneda. There is obviously a difference in status and lack of balance in power within their relationship. Again, these concepts are implied and underdeveloped. I felt that Kaneda's bike gang didn't have much development as well. Rather than a close-knit and loyal gang, it felt more like just an ordinary gang that was just there to fill in spots for characters. Also, the plot of the story was not difficult to catch on, but it took awhile to fully grasp the big picture, since the film is dragged out longer than it should. It got confusing at times and even convoluted, leaving the audience with many unanswered questions. Overall, AKIRA was not that bad. It was sort of decent, just highly overrated. I do understand why AKIRA may have been hailed as a classic, as the animation, plot line, and overall themes of the film were pretty original and groundbreaking material for anime during that time, as well as the fact that it was introduced to the Western audience when anime was not very common and popular.

I prefer the film Labyrinth to this one, but this one is rather good too as it is a fantasy film and there are still so few good ones even with the addition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one has its own mythos, its own creatures and its own story. One could say it may have been influenced a bit by J.R. Tolkien's books, but this one most certainly does not borrow heavily from them, unlike other stories in the fantasy realm.This world is at a state of unrest. Seems some sort of event took place 1000 years previous that brought two new species to this world. One species is the Mystics. A peace loving tribe of creatures that keep to themselves. Then there are the Skeksis, evil creatures that have all but taken over the world and have laid waste to a species known as the Gelfings because it has been foretold that the Gelfings will end the reign of the Skeksis and bring about a major change to the world. Jen is one of the last of the Gelfings, raised by the peace loving Mystics. He is charged with the task of restoring order to this world.The puppetry in this film is great, but I prefer Labyrinth because while most of the characters are puppets, the addition of real actors amidst the puppets works better for me. However, that is not to say this film is bad, it is a good film. It looks set in a real world, while Labyrinth looks more like one set piece after another. So while overall I like Labyrinth better, this film trumps that one in this regard. The Skeksis look really good as do their horrible bug like tracking creatures, but like I said nearly everything looks grand. It is amazing how good this looks, better than a lot of the CGI monsters and such of today.The story is a bit inspired by lord of the rings, in that a young small creature known as the Gelfing must make his way into the enemies territory with an object. However, all the monsters and such are unique. As a child, though, I must admit I had no idea what was going on. Now everything is rather easy to understand and I feel rather foolish for having a hard time understanding it.So in conclusion, while old, this fantasy film from 1982 still looks rather impressive.

I prefer the film Labyrinth to this one, but this one is rather good too as it is a fantasy film and there are still so few good ones even with the addition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one has its own mythos, its own creatures and its own story. One could say it may have been influenced a bit by J.R. Tolkien's books, but this one most certainly does not borrow heavily from them, unlike other stories in the fantasy realm.This world is at a state of unrest. Seems some sort of event took place 1000 years previous that brought two new species to this world. One species is the Mystics. A peace loving tribe of creatures that keep to themselves. Then there are the Skeksis, evil creatures that have all but taken over the world and have laid waste to a species known as the Gelfings because it has been foretold that the Gelfings will end the reign of the Skeksis and bring about a major change to the world. Jen is one of the last of the Gelfings, raised by the peace loving Mystics. He is charged with the task of restoring order to this world.The puppetry in this film is great, but I prefer Labyrinth because while most of the characters are puppets, the addition of real actors amidst the puppets works better for me. However, that is not to say this film is bad, it is a good film. It looks set in a real world, while Labyrinth looks more like one set piece after another. So while overall I like Labyrinth better, this film trumps that one in this regard. The Skeksis look really good as do their horrible bug like tracking creatures, but like I said nearly everything looks grand. It is amazing how good this looks, better than a lot of the CGI monsters and such of today.The story is a bit inspired by lord of the rings, in that a young small creature known as the Gelfing must make his way into the enemies territory with an object. However, all the monsters and such are unique. As a child, though, I must admit I had no idea what was going on. Now everything is rather easy to understand and I feel rather foolish for having a hard time understanding it.So in conclusion, while old, this fantasy film from 1982 still looks rather impressive. That is the thing about a fantasy film, do it right and set it in the right place and it never gets outdated.

I loved the film. It's great, it's fresh, if Godard's Breathless brought the new wave, well 8½ is a cinematic tsunami on the field of inspiration, how about that?- You're an idiot if you try to compromise your feelings just in order to please a crowd that doesn't even care about you think in the first place, if you do so, then you're taking a major step in the road that leads to mediocrity, so you better express what you REALLY thought of Fellini's film. - Well, I remember, it was my first Fellini's experience, and it turned out to be disastrous. I didn't hate the film but didn't hate myself either for not grabbing the geniality beneath the story, or as a matter of fact, its absence of story. I &#x96;honestly- thought it was a cinematic mess lacking in both structure and profundity. But somewhat I felt guilty about this gut-reaction, because many movies I loved owed their self-referential approach to 8½, and it would have been unfair to judge the milestone more severely than the imitators. Dammit, am I artistically obtuse, can't I see the genius even when it hits me? - You can't see the genius, it's something to be understood, it's an abstraction to be caught, a concept to be grabbed, yet it can't be an emotion, because people are easy to manipulate when it comes to emotions.- But it was not an emotional film, on the contrary, it was full of visual imagery, of childhood, nostalgia, guilt, hurts, grieves, passions, everything that cements one man's memories &#x85; I think the genius is that Fellini was able to depict the content of his own mind while chronicling the process of his own creation, confronted to a major mental block. I was impressed by the way these mental blocks were invaded by all these subconscious elements, at one part, it's real, then it's fantasy, the film itself is pure mental escapism &#x85; but I guess, everyone got that. - Even those who disliked it.- Sure, the essential lies elsewhere in my opinion. I read Roger Ebert's review and he was right when he said that cinema is an art of imagery, and the talent of Fellini as a film-maker is to privilege images over ideas, I'd go even further by saying he privileged images over emotions, in 8½ anyway. Remember the character of the writer, the Marxist guy who condescendingly describes the flaws in the script, it's obvious that Guido, Marcello Mastroianni as Fellini's alter ego, despises the guy and can't wait to get over him and make things his way. And Guido is man of images, not concepts, his vision offers an extraordinary kaleidoscope of different aspects of Italian culture, Latin lust, Mediterranean machismo, Catholic quest for redemption, Childish perversion with the fat prostitute dancing the rumba on the beach &#x85; it's less about what these imagery suggest to us, but the way they condition an author and interfere in the process of his art&#x85;- Wait a minute, now you're analyzing while you were just talking about visualizing, you're being intellectual while the seen lasts longer than the meant? You see what I mean?- You nail it perfectly; your point leads me to my biggest problem with the film. Although I was mesmerized by some scenes, especially the extraordinary harem sequence where he's surrounded by all the women that counted in his life, his wife (Anouk Animée), his mistress (Sandra Milo), the prostitute, the French actress, it starts like a luscious fantasy and then turns into a hysterical and frenetic orgy of violence and domination, I thought this was the highlight of &#x85; wait, I also loved the climactic sequence with the producer and the journalists &#x85; the exchange with Claudia Cardinale, the ideal woman, figure of purity, was unforgettable too, the typical Fellinian parade ... Well, there's nothing wrong in the film except that I didn't find the whole experience enjoyable. - Even with Nino Rota's music, the creative costume design, the cinematography, the symbolism, it didn't impact you?- I thought it was a little bit overdone and extremely puzzling. I could tell the difference between reality and fantasy but the fantasy sequences were just too chaotic and confusing.- But maybe that was the only way to convey the apparent confusion of the director's mind, since he was victim of a mental block. Maybe it was the only way to remain faithful to his own vision even if it would puzzle the viewers, as you say. And at least, the use of music, the creativity of the imagery, the episodic structure, made it more cinematically viable, it's like the best film about a non-film, the best film about making a film.- Funny, you remind me of what I said about some other movies such as Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey and John Cassavetes' Husbands. One was slow and full of nothingness, the other was unpredictable, childish and frustrating but they had to be these ways in order to illustrate the core of their message and the reason to be of their story. They are what I like to call movies victims of their own greatness, they're great regardless of their enjoyment or not.- I think it's a good compromise. But you can appreciate 8½ but still wish that Fellini made it more accessible to the average viewer. It's even pointed out by the writer in the film, you remember?- Yeah, but it's better this way.

I had already seen and enjoyed the original 1961 movie but was quite impressed by what I had seen in the trailer. Unlike many of the remakes that are coming out these days, this looked quite refreshing and an unexpected hit from Disney. So when I finally saw the film two times in the theater that August, I couldn't have been more impressed. Yes, this maybe the only movie to date that I viewed in the theater twice and for my vote, it was for good reason.This is a fun, witty and sweet little movie that I continue to enjoy. A lot of this is due to Disney getting Nancy Myers to co-write the screenplay and direct the film. She had been writing screenplays for years by this time and even had a few hits in her resume, Father Of The Bride Parts 1 and 2 being the most successful. To make her directorial debut, she agreed to helm a remake of the classic 1961 film for Disney. They couldn't have hired anyone better. A tremendous talent in screen writing and directing and deserves to be placed with Frank Capra, Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder. While this is you could say a children's film, Myers provides enough class and wit that people of all ages can enjoy it.As for the cast, everyone did a great job and bring a lot of humor and sensitivity to the characters. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson was amazing casting and both play the mother and father roles in the most believable way. I enjoy their scenes together. Of course, there is the delightful Lindsey Lohan. I really don't know what to say about her personally but as an actress, she is a remarkable talent and this movie shows it. I remember being impressed by the trailer at her capabilities to pull it off. She's quirky, fresh and fun to watch in both roles as Hallie and Annie.Dean Cundey was the cinematographer on this film who is known for his wide variety of work, from Halloween (1978) to The Thing (1982), from Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) to Jurassic Park (1993), from Apollo 13 (1995) to The Parent Trap. Because of his brilliance, he was brought in for the film's amazing technical work. Montion control had been used before many times and even Nancy Myers herself has said that she wasn't sure how it works but it is used to astonishing effect here. With Lohan's talent to play the wisecracking Hallie and proper Annie, motion control allows you to appreciate the differences in the two twins and also, the similarities. My favorite shot in the movie is when Lohan as both Hallie and Annie are looking in the mirror after Annie gets her hair cut. A one shot that gives the young actress a chance to walk in and out of frame as well as give lots of dialog.All in all, this is a great movie in my opinion. It's a feel good movie with a lot of charm and as I say class that I highly recommend it. Rent it or better yet, buy it if you ever get the chance.

However, I am not one of those who says that any adaptation that doesn't stick to the original setting and such is immediately rubbish. I do find that approach unfair, and have always thought considering that we are talking about different mediums here that adaptations should be judged on their own terms. Because on its own terms, this Richard III is excellent, not as good as Olivier's film but then again it is always a tough act to come up with something equal to film as amazing as Olivier's.The only things that I didn't like so much were that Edward's speech being cut meant that John Wood had literally nothing to do and Rivers' death scene for me didn't make sense. Also, Robert Downey Jnr's role is small and important, but at the same time I did find him too American and this jarred.However, the updated setting I had no problem with.

Basically Marty Piletti (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Ernest Borgnine) is a large thirty four year old Italian-American butcher, just your ordinary average guy living in New York City in the Bronx with his mother (Esther Minciotti), but despite his good nature he is socially awkward, getting constant persistently pestering him to find love, get married and have children, like his brothers and sisters have. He is not opposed to the idea of marriage or finding romance, he has just been disheartened by his lack of confidence and sure that he will be rejected, so he become used to the life of a bachelor, and despite not meeting someone he can care for he continues his optimistic outlook on life, often uttering the words Perfect! and Fantastic!. His mother one Saturday night insists that he should go to the Stardust Ballroom in the hope of meeting a girl he can get acquainted with, and after witnessing her getting dumped by a blind date and walking out to weep on the roof he meets modest schoolteacher Clara (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Betsy Blair). They spend the evening together dancing in the ballroom, walking busy places such as the streets, and they go into a diner and talk a lot, sharing their feelings, ambitions with encouragement from the other, and conversation about relationships, not having found someone special and such other things, and they find a bond with each other while doing this. They awkwardly express some feelings for each other when Marty takes Clara to his house, and just before his mother comes home, and delighted to have met her he takes her to the bus stop to go home and promises her that he will call her the next afternoon after Mass, at two o'clock, she is happy to do this, and after she leaves he punches the bus stop sign in joy. Marty's nosey and cantankerous Aunt Catherine (Augusta Ciolli) has come to live with him and his mother, she warns his mother that she doesn't want to be a widow with all the children married and living their own lives, and knowing he has feelings for Clara, she bad-mouths his love interest. Marty's friends have some envy towards him, and they don't say many nice things about Clara as well, because of her plainness and try to encourage him to forget this girl, remain part of the gang, don't marry, and with these words getting to him he has second thoughts about calling her. Marty realises though that he is in love with this woman and he is giving up the chance to find true happiness, and against the opinions of his friends, and ignores anything his mother said as well, and he dashes to the phone booth to call Clara, who is sitting alone hopelessly unhappy in front of the television waiting for the phone to ring, and the moment does see him talk to her. Also starring Oscar nominated Joe Mantell as Angie, Karen Steele as Virginia, Jerry Paris as Tommy, Frank Sutton as Ralph, Walter Kelley as The Kid, Robin Morse as Joe and Beauty and the Beast's Jerry Orbach as Ballroom Extra. Borgnine is perfect in the leading role of the butcher with low esteem who you can feel sympathy for and hope that he does find happiness, he deserved his Oscar, Blair is also very good as the woman he falls in love with and vice versa, it is a simple story of two lonely souls who find a bond because of their loneliness and true affection for each other, it is a really sweet romantic drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Delbert Mann and Best Writing, Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source.

Over the years, I've heard a lot about 'Midnight Express' and how it's one of the most disturbing films. The film was at the centre of controversy mainly for its portrayal of the Turkish people and corruption and the graphic violence.However, in all fairness, Parker's intention was to depict the prison as a harsh place (by portraying the policemen and wardens as cruel and even sadistic at times) and thus he took some liberty. I don't think he was thinking about how to make the Turks look bad but at the same time there were places he could have avoided this. For example, one can question whether all the Turkish inmates hated foreigners. The use of washed out colour certainly gives the film a grittier look but was it also necessary for the scenes outside the prison? As a result, they look very similar which might give ignorant people the impression that the entire country looks like a prison. I'd like to stress again that it doesn't imply all Turks as barbaric inhumane pigs (the judges were portrayed as sympathetic), maybe just the ones working in prison.Putting that aside, 'Midnight Express' tells the harrowing story of Bill Hayes, who was arrested at a Turkish airport for the possession of drugs and locked up in prison. Parker does a fine job of telling this story through the protagonist's perspective. It couldn't have been an easy movie to shoot but Parker and his director of photography Michael Seresin get it done. I only found two sequences to be a little over the top. One being Hays's outburst in court to which the judges respond sympathetically when in a real courtroom he wouldn't be allowed to go this far, swearing and cussing. The other scene was the death of one of the policemen which was unintentionally funny.

On a side note, the use of Maltese as Turkish was quite funny.The score deserves special mention.

One being Hays's outburst in court to which the judges respond sympathetically when in a real courtroom he wouldn't be allowed to go this far, swearing and cussing. The other scene was the death of one of the policemen which was unintentionally funny. Saying more would be giving out spoilers.'Midnight Express' has got solid performances from the American and British cast. Brad Davis does a superb job with a difficult role. John Hurt and Randy Quaid are great too. The actors playing the policemen and Turkish inmates were either wooden or caricatures. On a side note, the use of Maltese as Turkish was quite funny.The score deserves special mention. The instrumental tracks are simply amazing and they contribute brilliantly to the scenes.Parker's 'Midnight Express' is gritty, harsh and even uncompromising to an extent showing that the filmmaker can handle almost any complex subject.

It's the perfect balance of historical accuracy and artistic license. While I enjoy Kurt Russell, I thought Kevin Costner made a better Wyatt Earp overall. Russell does a great job showing the human side of a legend though. Val Kilmer gives a great performance as Doc Holiday, and Dennis Quaid did an equally fine job in the Wyatt Earp film.Tombstone has all the things you'd expect in a classic western film-- action, romance, some comedy, etc., but it's played in a way that steps out of the box. Not, perhaps, as much as something like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but you won't be disappointed. The good guys are clearly the good guys, but they are also human. The bad guys are clearly bad guys, and they are human, but evil.This is an R-rated film, but is not overly violent. It does contain some language (only one f-bomb), so it's actually decent for the older kids. A very enjoyable film with some fine performances.

Artistic works that discuss the clashes between labor and capital during the Gilded and Progressive Eras will undoubtedly include a discussion of radical political beliefs that those with conservative tastes in 2012 may find offensive or un-American. Nevertheless, the clashes between workers and the owners of companies are an important part of American history, certainly as much as the Civil War, World War II, or the tumults of the 1960s, and it is important for writers and filmmakers to mention them now and again. In this sense, a quality movie like Matewan is an exception rather than the rule with regards to period dramas related to important events in American history. The sensitive and poignant way by which John Sayles tells the story of West Virginia coal miners and a labor strike which culminated in bloodshed make the audience engaged in the plot and, by extension, the real life events described in the movie.The film itself is seldom boring, and the protagonist characters (Chris Cooper, Mary McDonnell, and Will Oldham) are sympathetically credibly portrayed. The harsh realities of the West Virigina miners of the 1910s and 1920s is portrayed in such a graphic and grim manner that the audience has an actual stake in their struggle as it portrayed in the film. The antagonist characters--the thugs hired by the Baldwin Felts Detective Agency to put down the strike by any means necessary--are less interestingly portrayed they are evil to the core, with nothing in their portrayal that would make them redeemable or three-dimensional. Some viewers will not like that the antagonists are not treated as realistic persons, but rather as monsters. There are few shades of grey in Sayles' movie the miners are the good guys, and the mine owners and their hired thugs are the bad guys. Notwithstanding the dual morality depicted in the movie, the film is stark in its realism, and there is little to take away from it that will leave the audience with a warm feeling. While Matewan ultimately comes across as a polemic film with an obvious message about the struggles of the working man, it is still a powerful and well-made drama that viewers will find involving. The real Battle of Matewan and the West Virginia Miners' Strike of the early 1920s are obscure events in American history, but are nevertheless important as part of the greater trend of social unrest inherent in America's Industrial Revolution. John Sayles shows courage by making a film about a seldom-mentioned and uncomfortable part of America's history. Highly recommended.
