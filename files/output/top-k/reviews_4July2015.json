Let's freedom ring with this movie! Directed by Peter H. Hunt, the movie tells the story of John Adams (William Daniels) on his pursuit to get his fellow Second Continental Congressmen to vote for American independence by signing the Declaration of Independence. Without spoiling the movie, too much, it has a very unique storytelling style. I never thought, once, that somebody would have made, a musical version of this historic event. Written by screenwriter, Peter Stone and based on the 1969 stage musical of the same name. The movie was very entertaining. While, the songs by song writer, Sherman Edwards weren't that memorable; most of them, work within the story. I love the opening song, 'Shut up, John' as it establish who John Adams is, and how driven, he is, for the cause. Songs such as, The Lees of Old Virginia, But, Mr. Adams and The Egg', were fun to watch, due to its light-hearted nature. It gave me, a few chuckles. Other songs like Mama Look Sharp and Molasses to Rum weren't so fun, but it shows, the real life struggles of the times and were very powerful. Then, there are the songs that, in my opinion, serve little purpose. Honestly, did we really need a song about playing the violin? What a waste of good screen time! Then, there is the controversial song, 'Cool, Cool, Considerate Men' which depicts Revolutionary War&#x96;era conservatives as power-hungry wheelers focused on maintaining wealth. The song got so much, backlash that U.S. President Richard Nixon requested to have the song removed from the film. Further complaints about the song, came from others, like historians; whom view the song, as incorrect, due to the terms right and left in politics being used. They argue that those terms weren't coined until after the American Revolution. The producers did cut the song, from the movie, but later, restored it, in future releases. While, only about half of the songs originally written made it to the final production. I think the movie could have, cut so much more. All the songs between John Adams & Abigail Adams (Virginia Vestoff) were pretty mediocre. Yes, it help humanize, John Adams, but I really didn't want to hear songs about pins and saltpeter, at all. For the most part, I think the movie could had work, better as a historical stage play, than a musical. The movie's songs are so spread out, that, it felt like I was watching two different films. If you take away, the music, the movie still works. The political debate wasn't boring, because the movie has some very clever fun dialogue to work with. It was assemble so well, with great effect. It had some really funny and powerful moments. Since Continental Congress was held in secrecy and there are no contemporary records on the debate over the Declaration of Independence, the authors of the musical created the narrative based on later accounts and educated guesses, inventing scenes and dialogue as needed for storytelling purposes. Some of these dialogue was taken from words written, often years or even decades later. The movie also took a lot of artistic license to the film's budget. Many historical figures were dropped from the production, as the entire complement of the Congress would have been too big of a cast to portray. They did make a halfhearted attempt to explain, why there were so many absent members. Most of the actors that play the supporting characters were pretty good. My favorite had to be, Howard Da Silva as Ben Franklin, Ray Middleton as Thomas McKean and Ron Holgate as Richard Henry Lee. Man, did they hammed it up! They seem, more like cartoon characters, than real people, with their odd delivery. While, they're not the best actors, they truly stand out! I loved it! Still, I kinda hope, for a more accurate depiction of these real life men. William Daniels as John Adams was amazing. This guy work his butt, off. Although, the film, makes Adams into one of the most-hatred characters in the film; in true life, he's one of the most respected members of Congress. After all, you have to be, if you're going to become President, one day. The only character that wasn't needed in the film was Martha Jefferson (Blythe Danner). I really felt that the time, spent with her, really ruin the film, because how historic inaccurate, her visit was, and because it took away, focus on how Thomas Jefferson (Ken Howard) wrote the Declaration of Independence. The movie awkwardly, moves from first draft document to presenting his masterpiece in quick movie pacing. When, watching it, I thought, I miss a scene or two, but no, that's how the movie was presented. Do warning, some versions of the film, has been brutally cut. A lot of the raunchier scenes was badly chopped, but if you want the best version of the film. Try to get Jack L. Warner's DVD restore version. It's the best copy, out there. Overall While the movie ends in a bittersweet note. It's still a great movie to watch on the Fourth of July! So check it out! You will like it.

I had read the Caspary novel first, and knew I had to see the movie when it first came out in the late 1940s. (I was in high school and was a life-long avid movie goer.) The film starred two of my favorite actors, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews. I was already an artist who loved fashion, and the wardrobe in this film really impressed me and still does on repeated viewing. Tierney standing there in the white raincoat and that marvelous rain hat was stunning! Bonnie Cashin won much acclaim for her hats for Laura.It is nearly impossible to talk about the plot without committing spoilers so I won't. Just know it is one of the best of film noir mysteries with puzzlers, plenty of drama, and surprises at nearly every turn. The dialogue is witty and revealing and the actors handle it superbly. The haunting musical theme enhanced the romantic drama and later became a major song hit with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. I guess my biggest problem with the story is how Laura, apparently a beautiful, bright, capable girl, could have taken up with so many losers and a such a shallow group of friends.Another problem for me was the casting of Vincent Price as Laura's fiancé--I could never imagined him as a leading man. He was also Tierney's fiancé in a later film, 'Leave her To Heaven', but the role was brief and without romantic scenes. And of course, Clifton Webb is also very obviously a man unlikely to fall for a woman--but if you consider that the much older Waldo was simply controlling and obsessive it works. This film turned out far better than anyone might have supposed, since at least two prominent directors turned it down because they didn't much care for the script. Gene Tierney worried her part would suffer because she wasn't in the film right away and then only as a recollection. The studio first considered Laird Cregar as Waldo, but Preminger said no-- the audience would see him as a villain the moment he appeared because he had played so many villains. Instead, Preminger wanted a middle-aged stage actor who had no movie experience, Clifton Webb, which at the time seemed a chancy choice. But he was perfect and the part made him a star. His waspish tongue and effete delivery did Waldo to a turn. In the book there is a scene where Waldo and Mark go into an antique shop where Waldo admires and wishes to buy a vase. It is not for sale says the shop owner, and somehow before they exit, the vase gets tipped and shatters to the floor. Considering Waldo's pattern of disposing of Laura's men and friends, it is a telling moment. (The moment is not in the film.) He seemed to feel he created her, owned her, taught her all she knew--that is his obsession with the exquisite creature that was Laura. It is easy to see Mark becoming drawn into that fascination as Waldo obssesses. That gorgeous portrait over the fireplace was not actually a painting--it was a photograph which was touched up with oils to look like it was painted. The studio had commissioned a painting, but it didn't satisfy them. After all, much is focused on that portrait, so it had to be right. Once you have seen the film, you may want to read the novel. Oh, and the movie won one Academy Award--not sure what for. Likely the camera work which is evocative film noir.

I avoided seeing any of the Furious movies for over a decade and maybe it was because of the teaser trailer. Maybe it was because it didn't show anything about what the movie was about or maybe it was because the movie itself wasn't aimed at me as an audience. I was almost thirty at the time, but I have enjoyed other movies that were not aimed at my age group like the first Spiderman movie which was released around the same time.What I dislike about the first movie is the stupid dialogue. Yeah, yeah. I know it has something to say about loyalty and whatever but mostly sounds like it was written by a 13-year old. Spiderman was goofy in places but there is a weird kind of tone throughout this, especially in the scenes between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker.There is one particular scene that I didn't get for the life of me. Diesel's thuggish best friend accuses Walker of being a cop and the two of them is ready to kill Walker, but the scene ends without a payoff what so ever. It just cuts to the next scene. What the f...! The friend does inspire one of the funniest scenes in the whole thing. The friend is about to cause trouble because he is incensed that Walker has been accepted so easily by Torreto (Diesel's name in the flick). Diesel loses his temper and says something like I didn't know you either and accepted you. The friend then replies We were 3, you idiot. Priceless, even though it's not totally verbatim. I honestly can't remember if I reversed the dialogue, but it is still funny as hell.One more scene I have to mention which is unintentionally hilarious. Walker blows his pistons in the first race. Diesel says something like Oh, we better get that repaired. The car is steaming and 2 seconds later Walker's car is fine to drive. What did they do?

They are in a real wilderness, facing a real bear, not a CGI monster looking to destroy everything in it's path. The story also allows for strong character development throughout, as Charles puts his theoretical knowledge into more practical use. With Bob is a tad different as we slowly see his evil ways as the story progresses, but ultimately leaves being somewhat of a resurrected 'good guy' after his plans to kill Charles backfire. Stephen just seems to be the likable character with a few funny jokes to keep himself in the loop of the movie, but was always ultimately going to die in the movie. It also truly shows the motif of the panther and the rabbit shown in the movie. We are to believe that the symbolism refers to the bear and the three men, but it is more deeply referring to Charles and Bob. We see this in the end where Bob is ready to carry out his plans and end Charles, however Charles in the face of death comfortably smokes his invisible pipe and turns the tables on Bob. A forgiving man he is as he spares Bob's life and helps him in the end. A sad ending where it seems that just when all was forgiven, Bob decides there is no more left for him in the world and dies.

Such an asinine claim can 'never' be true, as 'NO ONE' has that much time to blow by endlessly watching movies 'every' night and day. Lookee at all the superlatives? Such clap-trap.As far as LIS is concerned, what a humongous disappointment it was, indeed. My friend and I both felt cheated yet again at the cinema, just as yet another 'miss-the-boat-completely re-boot\/remake had the same year, Roland Emmerich's equally-disastrous, Godzilla.But let's look at this version of LIS, as a totally-independent entity and on its own merit. There is no merit, other than the hefty 80 mil price tag for its production. The casting may have worked had there been effective direction, but the 'who-cares?' script and ensuing plot developments squashed that. Jack Johnson, as the young Will Robinson, was the only believable character I cared a tinker's cuss for in this whole mess. Gary Oldman's weird Dr. Smith seemed just weird for weirdness's sake, like he was so bizarrely in The Fifth Element. William Hurt and Mimi Rogers might as well have phoned in their performances as Mr. and Mrs. Robinson (maybe they did, come to think of it), and Penny, played by Lacey Chabert, was the snotty and sassy teen we all love to hear bemoan the suckiness of everything. Matt LeBlanc's Don West was...Matt LeBlanc, and his interactions with Heather Graham, as the oldest Robinson sibling (does the name matter?), had no chemistry, whatsoever. What efforts were put into these characters' performances seemed misguided and pointless (except for Will's), most likely from the inept direction.The wacko monsters were a fun part of the TV series, but the creatures in the movie fell flat as a pancake (the CGI spiders and that stupid and god-awful pet thing, whose appearance tolled the death knell of this flick's fun potential). Any resemblance to the TV series and this movie appeared to be entirely coincidental...The Jupiter 2 was cool, so I've rated this movie a 2, out of respect for the best 'character' of LIS.

So, for me, The Silence of the Lambs is a childhood favorite. Some would say I had an unusual childhood, in this age where some people actually avoid R-rated movies like the plague. The fact that I saw Something Wild, which Jonathan Demme directed five years before The Silence of the Lambs, as well as the original Alien (alone at that), at the same age probably indicates that they were okay with me watching pretty much anything that wasn't rated X, though, honestly, I've never had any interest in that stuff. It was probably due to the fact that, like the movie's protagonist, I don't spook easily, and many so-called scary movies, including this one, never scared me, but (many of them) definitely thrilled me. Granted, I'd seen Saving Private Ryan a few months before, which probably gave me a strong stomach. Well, enough about my wild, albeit fun, childhood. How does The Silence of the Lambs hold up all these years later? For me personally, The Silence of the Lambs is every bit as good as it was the first time I saw it at five years old.On the off chance you don't already know the plot by now, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a rookie FBI agent with a degree in psychology who is called from training by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) in the middle of a string of murders by a man nicknamed Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, all of whom happen to be women. Crawford tells her to interview the psychotic Dr. Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison, hoping he might have an answer of some kind. Lecter brushes her off. After Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of a senator is kidnapped, Lecter agrees to give Starling information about Buffalo Bill on the condition that she tell him personal information about herself.If I had to pick the greatest Best Picture Oscar winner ever, it would most likely be The Silence of the Lambs. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, it's definitely my favorite.Let's look at the acting to start. Jodie Foster, unsurprisingly, won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as Starling. Foster plays Starling as a little scared yet strong at the same time, definitely not a coward as Julianne Moore later played the character in the movie Hannibal, and definitely not someone who would turn cannibal as Thomas Harris wrote the character as doing in the novel Hannibal. Movie or novel, in my honest opinion, the Clarice Starling depicted in Hannibal is an insult to what this Clarice Starling stands for. As we find out about what's been nagging Starling since childhood, Foster plays it especially well where another actress may have overdone it. Anthony Hopkins, like Foster, won an Oscar for his performance as Lecter, and I speak for a lot of people, if not everybody, when I say it was also well-deserved. Hopkins plays Lecter as brilliant yet insane, making him one of the more interesting villains in movie history. Scott Glenn plays Crawford very well for the time he's on screen. Ted Levine plays Buffalo Bill as straight up crazy, and does a very good job of making us hate him. Brooke Smith is only supposed to play Catherine Martin as scared and she does - with dead-on accuracy.Ted Tally won a well-deserved Oscar for his screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris' novel of the same name. Tally doesn't feel the need to focus on violence and gore, which is one of the movie's strengths. Instead he focuses on the characters, and I'd be lying if I said he didn't flesh them out very, very, very, well.Jonathan Demme also won an Oscar for his directing and he does a very good job of it. The Silence of the Lambs is relentlessly thrilling and it holds me to my seat until the last frame every time I see it, all without relying on excessive gore. I've already mentioned that The Silence of the Lambs doesn't scare me, so it may - or may not - scare you, depending on what you're afraid of. Admittedly, there are a few creepy things displayed on screen so I can see why it would scare some viewers. Either way, I can't recommend The Silence of the Lambs enough, and everybody should see it at least once.The Silence of the Lambs is a childhood favorite of mine, and it holds up very, very well almost 25 years after its release. It's relentlessly thrilling, flawlessly acted, flawlessly written, flawlessly directed, and one of the few movies that actually deserved all the Oscars it won.

This is because the movie distracts you from the stupidity quite well. For Example, the effects in this movie are great! The aliens are original and the explosions are quite believable, even if they are CGI. The plot is just another alien takeover. Just think of War of the Worlds meets Top Gun. The characters are&#x85;&#x85; OK. That's the nicest things to say about them. Jeff Goldblum plays&#x85; JEFF GOLDBLUM! That's it. The only actor who's trying is Will Smith, but he makes everything he's in awesome! The movie is just&#x85; OK. The movie is silly, but harmless. It has plot holes, but the action distracts you from them. The movie's stupid, but it is so hilarious in its stupidity. So, yeah. I have a spot in my heart for cheesy blockbusters. And this movie is no exception. Have a happy Independence Day, and watch Independence Day!!!

Basically naive American tourist Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) from Des Moines, Iowa, who works at Blockbuster Video, has travelled to London, England on his birthday to spend time with his brother James (While You Were Sleeping's Peter Gallagher). James is happy to spend time with Wallace, but has business guests coming to dinner and needs something to distract his brother so he doesn't sour the evening, so he sets Wallace up with an interactive improv theatre business, the Theatre of Life, which promises to treat the participant as a character in a crime drama. But trouble begins when Wallace unknowingly answers the phone to a real hit-man and in is mixed in a case of mistaken identity, the criminals believe him to be a CIA spy, and he gets tangled in a plot to kill Russian dignitaries who will be signing an important peace agreement. Wallace is completely gullible and goes along with this, even when people are being killed, criminals are chasing him and newfound femme fetale Lori (Joanne Whalley) and a bomb is ticking down, he thinks it is all an act, part of his experience with Theatre of Life. Also starring Alfred Molina as Boris 'The Butcher' Blavasky, Richard Wilson as Sir Roger Daggenhurst, Little Britain's Geraldine James as Dr. Ludmilla Kropotkin, John Standing as Gilbert Embleton, Four Weddings and a Funeral's Anna Chancellor as Barbara Ritchie, The Fast Show's John Thomson as Dimitri, EastEnders' Cliff Parisi Cliff Parisi as Uri, Dexter Fletcher as Otto, J.E. Freeman as CIA Man, Maxwell Caulfield as British Agent, The Fast Show's Paul Shearer as TV Reporter, Going Live's Sarah Greene as TV Presenter and Top of the Pops' Mike Smith as TV Presenter. Murray is very convincing as the idiotic slow-witted ordinary man caught in the middle of a dangerous predicament, so much so that it almost becomes annoying, the supporting stars all do well being more amusingly serious, the bumbling dimwit formula does create laughs, but it does a little kick eventually, and the assassination attempt stuff wears a little thin as well, becoming slightly predictable, overall though it is a funny enough spy comedy. Worth watching!

I found it again by mistake, and had a deja-vu, i was like, hmm I'm pretty sure i saw this movie(after watching the trailer), first thing what came in my head was the name of my father when i looked at the trailer, then i knew it, its the movie that i couldn't understand when i was little.

It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment; everything that brings me to the cinema. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason.
