I like horror movies, but not scary ones. It has a very clever idea, and it is set mostly at that time of the day which is near dark, hence thy name. It is not dark, it is not light, it is not in between. Just those few moments before they sun is finally swallowed by all encompassing darkness. I suppose I was so scared by this movie as this has always been the time of day I was most scared of. Me and my bro Andy when we were younger both hated this time of day. Day time was okay because there were only wasps to worry about, and at least you could see any spiders that were trying to get you. Night time could be bad as you couldn't see any spiders, and night time is when all the baddies come out. This was compensated by the fact that once it was dark we would go to bed, and when you hid under the sheets nothing could get you. But being Near Dark- ARGGGH! The baddies could sneak out and get you before you went to bed and the spiders are hungriest around that time. I decided to watch this film to overcome my fear of this hour and when I heard it was about vampires I thought it might be enjoyable.This is a film about a cowboy who meets a family of gypsy vampires romping through the deserts of New York. One of them is a sexy feline girl and they fall for each other. He decides to join the vampires so he can be with the girl, but doesn't realise that being a vampire has consequences- you have to kill and eat people's brains; you can't have garlic on your pizza; you have to wear black or you look like a tool; you think you can fly but really it's your vampire mind playing tricks on you, and when you try throwing yourself off a building you always land in a bush and get nettle stings; you smell like dust. He decides that he can't be a vampire and wants to change back with the girl. Naturally the rest of the family aren't happy. In fang, they are biting back! They vant blood! Hudson, Bishop, Vasquez, and Short Round are the real vampires and they hunt the pair down, killing innocent people and creating scary moments I couldn't watch; Someone hears a scratching at a window and looks out- phew it's only a rat. They turn round only to see the vampires inside their house! BOO! The main guy is watching TV, he sees Bishop (the matriarch of the family played horrifyingly by Lance Armstrong) on the news commenting on a local tragedy. The main man is concerned. Suddenly Bishop jumps through the TV into the living room! The main guy's little sister is being chased by Short Round in a mine cart throwing stones at her and biting at her neck, just missing by millimetres. She escapes when his cart tips over and she runs home. She closes the door, locks it, sprinkles holy water over it, sets garlic all over the door, puts crosses on it, and gets her dad to stand beside her with a shotgun. They turn round only to find Shorty (played with real vengeance by Data) in their living room! These moments were about as much as I could handle. Suffice to say there is a big battle scene where all the cowboys and vampires fight through the desert, into a local bar, and finally the survivors face off in the living room. There are good special graphics used here, the best since Lords Of The Ring, but not quite as good as The Land That Tim Forgot. Seeing thousands, perhaps even hundreds of vampires and cowboys clashing is truly a sight to behave, but I had to watch it from behind my book and through my fingers. The bit with the pub was quite intense, very much quite. Hudson dances with a corpse and stalks his victims with a smile before kicking their throats open and impaling them on his long, hard, pool cue. This is not for the faint minded or open hearted and I found it quite upsetting. He quips the whole way through 'chicken lickin' good!' he shouts, and 'no way man, no way!' and of course when speaking of his vamp biting skills he comments 'I could suck start a leaf blower!' Luckily it all ends OK because the vampires see the error of their ways and set themselves on fire in the motel living room, and the dad makes his son and the girl drink a cup of anti blood to make them better.Best Scene When the sun finally rises at the end and we know it's safe to get out of bed.

Small actors (Susan Sarandon became the massive A-lister after), low budget, niche target audience and what was then a crazy concept, a musical parody of 50's and 60's b-movies and horror films that didn't take itself seriously. This is quickly establish in the opening credits, featuring a dark background with blood red credits along with the track Science Fiction\/Double Feature (which is reminiscent of the main theme from Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust, suggesting TRHPS may have struck a chord with horror fans worldwide). Going into the film all I wanted to do was dislike it, expecting it to be a tacky, camp musical thats just agonising to watch. Sadly (or not on the other hand) this was not the case. All the factors for which it could be disliked blend together beautifully to create a masterpiece. Its hard not to sing-a-long (even if it is in your head, as in my case) to such upbeat perfect songs such as The Time Warp and Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me and Meat Loaf's Hot Patootie. Throughout the film, you'll struggle to conceive what is going on and by the time Dr.Scott comes, along with the ending the film goes beyond silly. But that just makes you love the film even more, particularly the scene where Dr.Scott's wheelchair becomes attracted to a magnet operated by Frank N Furter(A rather convenient name, as its a phallic object and pokes fun at his androgynous look) and goes all around the house including Magenta in a bath tub twice, as she fails to bat an eyelid, furthering the comedy of the film. After the camp and kitsch ending where Riff-Raff kills Colombia and Frank N Furter with what is quite clearly a TV Ariel, you cant help but feel that the film was silly and ridiculous but also a comedy and masterpiece. For this reason, I'm going to have to agree that the film is worthy of it's cult classic status and is also quite possibly the greatest musical film ever (In my opinion Phantom Of The Opera (2004) and Mamma Mia are 2nd and 3rd respectively).

Inarritu has created a film that interweaves several different characters on the harsh and brutal streets of Mexico City to create a gut-wrenching look at love, life, death, and redemption.Amores perros follows several unique individuals from all across the social ladder. The first is Octavio (Gael Garcia Bernal) who has a hopeless crush on his sister in law Susana (Vanessa Bauche). Octavio enters the world of illegal dogfighting with hopes of making enough money so that one day he and Susana can run off. The second story tells of Daniel (Alvaro Guerrero) a magazine editor who ditches is family for a beautiful, yet disturbed supermodel named Valeria (Goya Toledo). When she gets into a car accident and her dog is lost in the floorboards of their apartment, it soon becomes apparent that their relationship is getting strained. The final story tells of an ex-guerrilla El Chivo (Emilio Echevarria) who takes care of a wounded dog while planning an assassination and trying to connect with his estranged daughter.What interests Inarritu are his characters, and it shows here. Amores perros is a thoroughly character driven story with overtones of pain and sorrow. What works here is that Inarritu allows the emotions and themes to play out low key and naturally, they're not shoved in your face or overdone. The main point of interest in the film is the relationships between the characters; these are relationships that feel real. The most interesting for me were the relationship between Octavio and Susana and the relationship between El Chivo, the dog, and his daughter. The Octavio and Susana is the most engaging to watch, but the El Chivo story is the most artistically satisfying as it manages to create a complex, emotional story using little dialog. The weakest story was the one between Daniel and Valeria. Daniel's back-story, unlike the other characters, is never fully fleshed out, we're only given glimpses of his married life, and these scenes do not explain much about why he would want to leave. Plus he comes off as an obnoxious prick instead of a full three-dimensional character. Valeria on the other hand is a thoroughly engaging character who doesn't need to have a fleshed out story; the audience understands what she's going through and why. Despite some flaws, Amores perros carries a powerful story that grabs you and never lets up for two and a half hours.The acting is as expected superb; the actors do a fantastic job of bringing their characters to life. My favorite actor was Emilio Echevarria who plays El Chivo. Since his story is one with little dialog, it's amazing to watch how he carries himself using facial expressions. There's one scene where he sneaks into his daughters house and steals a picture, this is a scene that doesn't require words, just facial expression, as the pain and loneliness of Echevarria's character just seeps through. The next best actors were Gael Garcia Bernal and Vanessa Bauche who played Octavio and Susana. The make the relationship between the two feel convincing, because they act like real people instead getting all starry eyed and overacting. The weakest link is once again Alvaro Guerrero who plays Daniel. His performance is great, but because of the limited range of emotions of his character we never get to see him do much. Overall Amores perros is a film that boasts a great cast giving some fantastic performances.Aesthetically, Amores perros is shot in a very gritty style lending to the urban setting of the film. Inarritu is a director who knows how to use color to his advantage, and Amores perros makes great use of color to give an added boost to the gritty and melancholy atmosphere. This is one of those films where you could turn off all the sound (well subtitles to be exact) and still enjoy what was going on, because Inarritu has created such a visual masterpiece. Like any great director though, Inarritu understands how to mix visuals with sound, and early on in the film there are some well-done musical montages set to Mexican rock and later on the Rolling Stones. The montages are handled well because they correspond well with the soundtrack to give a nice feeling to it all. Amores perros really is an aesthetic masterpiece.By now you've gotten the idea, Amores perros is a masterpiece and one that needs to be rented right now. It's a film for anyone who loves well drawn characters and thought provoking themes. I have yet to see 21 Grams or Babel, the other two films in Inarritu's Death Trilogy, but after seeing what he is capable of they've moved to a high spot in my Netflix queue. Amores perros is a beautiful, if flawed masterpiece.4.5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2009","score":"","review":" The English title for Amores perros is Love is a Bitch, and indeed that's the central theme here in Alejandro González Iñárritu mosaic masterwork.

There's one scene where he sneaks into his daughters house and steals a picture, this is a scene that doesn't require words, just facial expression, as the pain and loneliness of Echevarria's character just seeps through. The next best actors were Gael Garcia Bernal and Vanessa Bauche who played Octavio and Susana. The make the relationship between the two feel convincing, because they act like real people instead getting all starry eyed and overacting. The weakest link is once again Alvaro Guerrero who plays Daniel. His performance is great, but because of the limited range of emotions of his character we never get to see him do much. Overall Amores perros is a film that boasts a great cast giving some fantastic performances.Aesthetically, Amores perros is shot in a very gritty style lending to the urban setting of the film. Inarritu is a director who knows how to use color to his advantage, and Amores perros makes great use of color to give an added boost to the gritty and melancholy atmosphere. This is one of those films where you could turn off all the sound (well subtitles to be exact) and still enjoy what was going on, because Inarritu has created such a visual masterpiece. Like any great director though, Inarritu understands how to mix visuals with sound, and early on in the film there are some well-done musical montages set to Mexican rock and later on the Rolling Stones. The montages are handled well because they correspond well with the soundtrack to give a nice feeling to it all. Amores perros really is an aesthetic masterpiece.By now you've gotten the idea, Amores perros is a masterpiece and one that needs to be rented right now. It's a film for anyone who loves well drawn characters and thought provoking themes. I have yet to see 21 Grams or Babel, the other two films in Inarritu's Death Trilogy, but after seeing what he is capable of they've moved to a high spot in my Netflix queue. Amores perros is a beautiful, if flawed masterpiece.4.5\/5 ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"23 June 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Three generations of great actors, the old Marlon Brando, the established Robert DeNiro, and the new Edward Norton. Three of my top actors in a movie together? I couldn't resist renting the movie at all, didn't even read what the movie was about. But I hate to say this, I ended up being disappointed. The Score is definitely by no means a bad movie, the acting is decent and the story is something different from every clichéd heist movies that we've seen with a lot of violence or car chases. This was more of a character study vs. your typical action movie. The main problem though is that it's a bit slow paced, as incredible as these actors are, even they didn't look to interested in this film. They looked tired, which what I was after I saw this movie.Nick Wells is a top of his game heist man, he performs his last heist and barely escapes. When Nick presents his stolen jewelry to Max Baron, his employer and fence, he learns that the money man who was supposed to pay him for it is now deceased. To make matters worse, Max does not have a replacement buyer. What he does have is an inside contact at the customs house where a rare, centuries old scepter is stored that would fetch enough to pay Nick $6 million for stealing it. Nick is ready to retire from the business in part because his flight attendant girlfriend Diane will not move in with him unless he quits his criminal escapades. She makes it clear that she will not be worrying about having to talk to him through a glass partition. Brian is Max's inside contact, who works as a janitor in the customs building. He has the building blueprints, including the underground sewer system, and knows where the scepter is being held. Brian has people overlook him because he assumes the role of a mentally handicapped worker. Because of this the guards and co-workers tend to dismiss his odd behavior, which includes being in certain places where he does not belong. Brian and Nick don't get along and when Nick sends his bodyguard to teach him a lesson, we find that Brian is not the lightweight bozo that he appears.Now I wanted to love this film, I really did, like I said, you see this cast you automatically assume that it's going to equal gold. Sometimes I guess that's not always true, you really do need the script that's well written and the actors really have to embrace the movie as well. I would say that if you want to see The Score, be prepared for more of a drama vs. a typical action heist movie. I think it should have just been trimmed down a bit and Frank Oz, who is a great director when given the right script, I'm not sure if this was a movie that was meant for him to make.

We do have the serial killer, and the new technique of profiling. But it is still not entirely squared out. The FBI man is still relying on his instinct, his sixth sense, his intuition, his inner eye to understand the feelings and the thoughts of the killer and capture him by being able to foresee what he is going to do. But that paranormal element is not convincing, though it is commonly used in some detective TV series. Thomas Harris is going to get to real profiling only in the next volume. Even the great visionary power of Doctor Lecter will become the unavoidable logic of the mind, of the psyche, of the deranged mental power of the insane doctor only then. He is a genius in his psychiatric field and his derangement gives him the capability to know no limits. But that is still to come. Here though Thomas Harris settles some accounts with journalists and has one burnt alive. He also settles some revenge with story telling and twists the story line in some unforeseen ways now and then. These moments are magic in a way since they are unexplained and they restart the dynamic of the tale that could have become humdrum. The story seems to settle some accounts with a couple of commonplace if not trite ideas. The whole logic of the killer is to think that his being seen over and over again by a women during the last five minutes of their lives as if their eyes were silver mirrors would lead him to be loved and to come to terms with his desire to kill. His last victim actually loves him in a way and\/but she is blind. She loves him because she is blind and he kills her out of no reason and she will not be able to see him when she dies. Of course that victim will survive because our FBI man-hunter will come into the picture unannounced. Thomas Harris also deals with the idea that all serial killers were boys who were mistreated when children, probably by their parents, even more probably somewhere by their mothers.

But really, it's so audacious and funny and tragic and ironic, who can say what is what, and why, taken whole?What you can be clear about about is whether it succeeds, whether it stirs you. I know I'm moved and tickled every time, even if I groan sometimes, too. George C. Scott's performance is sometimes just too much, but then he does a backflip and my faith is restored. Hayden is such a stiff actor at his best, he is cast in the role of a lifetime here and comes through with dark absurdity. And Peter Sellers? Which one? Hilarious.Made the same year as Fail-Safe (both are from 1964, the height of the Cold War), Dr. Strangelove, shows the further evolution of the insane directing genius of Stanley Kubrick. This is the first of his three great breakthrough movies that seem to be shamelessly new and fresh--2001 and A Clockwork Orange followed--and it really is breathtaking for its audacity. Dr. Strangelove is so utterly different in tone and yet so parallel in intent and background to Fail-Safe, it's just weird. Does it make light of annihilation? Does the military, and the President, look foolish? And Peter Sellers? Which one?

ID has Will Smith & Jeff Goldblum in nice quirky roles with some humanity, but Armageddon has no character depth at all and the 'humour' never gets above the potty level.If either Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi or Peter Stormare are proud of this then I would be astonished. I even expect better from Michael Bay the director of such junk as Pearl Harbour & Bad Boys. Why? Well he has done the flawed but OK 'The Island' & the stereotypical but entertaining 'The Rock'.Many modern action flicks are flawed in their portrayals of countries & cultures but stereotypes about Germans & South Africans aside 'Die Hard' & 'Lethal Weapon (2)' still manage to outweigh this with their charm, wit & pace.

And is it any wonder? When Tobe Hooper's 1974 opus was released, it quickly became a mainstream hit. I specifically remember it becoming 'The film to sneak into' for kids. This automatically robbed it of any following it had with indie film fans despite being one of their own circuit's films. They instead dismissed it as a pointless exercise in graphic gore(there's actually very little), while praising lousy later films like 'Blair Witch' to the skies because of so-called deeper meanings. A shame they could not see that Hooper had crafted perhaps the ultimate statement on post '60's America, and one that remains unmatched in it's power.The film makes no doubt about what state the country was in Decay. Everything in the film reeks of death. From the prologue with the corpse 'art'(not as much a stretch considering the kind of art produced in this era), the Dead Armadillo in the film's opening; a Texas national landmark, it would seem, to the dried up 'Ol swimming hole, to the heroine's once-thriving home now populated with spiders and rats. It doesn't take sides, either. The 'Good 'ol ways' represented by the homicidal Sawyer clan as a nightmare parody of the American bible-belt family are obviously the villains, but the 'new' generation, itself dying out since '68, isn't presented as any more desirable. Both are mercilessly ridiculed. Even the heroine survives only by sheer luck. She's not the intelligent, feminist heroine(despite being of the 'free love'generation)that Laurie Strode of 'Halloween' is, she survives because of the killer's(s) incompetence. It's almost as if the film is saying that the ignorant, rebellious youth have emerged scarred from the real world they ran off unprepared for(The doomed protagonists are all jaded ex-hippies), and are all limping back home(Sally does visit her old house as a form of shelter)to the comforting arms of the 'old folks' who warned them; who react violently and vehemently, telling them 'I told you so!', but still give them relief Death.Speaking of the 'heroes', isn't it bizarre how the heroine's crippled brother Franklyn is treated like a nuisance by them? Even though we don't see it; it's obvious that they have frequently ridiculed him(His reaction in the abandoned house to their laughter best reveals this, as he can't stand to hear their mocking laughter even if it is not directed at him and he knows it). Yet, in contrast to the lead's treatment of the childish invalid Franklyn, the Sawyer family treats the two characters most similar to Franklyn(mentally and physically); Leatherface and Grandpa; as valued kinfolk, they are accommodated and appreciated in their family unit. Although the older brother heaps much verbal abuse on the Hitchhiker & Leatherface, it is no more than your usual stereotypically portrayed hick family on 'Hee-Haw'. They're close-knit, and as Franklyn says after the Hitchhiker slits himself and endures it 'Gotta admire that.Add to the fact that Franklyn is the the only character in the film to come close to communicating with, and in a sense, relating to, one of the Sawyers(Who starts up a genial, at first, conversation about knives and killing with the Hitchhiker); and it becomes more disturbing. Almost as if, under different circumstances, Franklyn would occupy the same position as Leatherface(If he could walk)or Grandpa if he were a member of the Sawyer clan, as if the hitchhiker recognizes this. It's also strange considering this take, that Franklyn is the last of the leads to die. I'm not saying Leatherface spared him for last out of mercy(He had just met Franklyn when he kills him), but because they are similar symbolically. Even Hooper has called Leatherface a 'big baby', and that seems to apply to Franklyn as well.Bizarre, the cannibals accept the handicapped(in their own way), and the 'heroes' see the handicapped as a burden, much like how former hippies who were drafted and returned maimed or crippled were rejected by their former friends for 'killin' babies' in 'Nam. Even more strange is that it's Franklyn who inadvertently causes their deaths when he gives them the faulty directions to the swimming hole, as if he's unknowingly getting his revenge.Obviously, I see the film as a social commentary. But I would not simply call it another entry in the cycle of other post '60's downbeat dramas, but a hybrid of that mentality with the 'Old Dark House' genre of years past. Compare the film with Whale's 1932 film of the same name; you'll see what I mean. Even that film's macabre humor and invalid patriarch character are referenced. TCM is an update on that genre with post '60's cynicism. As that stands, it may not be the first slasher film, as it's often called, but the last, and best 'Old Dark House with a homicidal but oddly funny family' type of film ever made.~ ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2009","score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" The Indie film community's head is so far up it's own ass with delusions of grandeur that they actually fail to see, at times, the area where their own films succeed.

Even Hooper has called Leatherface a 'big baby', and that seems to apply to Franklyn as well.Bizarre, the cannibals accept the handicapped(in their own way), and the 'heroes' see the handicapped as a burden, much like how former hippies who were drafted and returned maimed or crippled were rejected by their former friends for 'killin' babies' in 'Nam. Even more strange is that it's Franklyn who inadvertently causes their deaths when he gives them the faulty directions to the swimming hole, as if he's unknowingly getting his revenge.Obviously, I see the film as a social commentary. But I would not simply call it another entry in the cycle of other post '60's downbeat dramas, but a hybrid of that mentality with the 'Old Dark House' genre of years past. Compare the film with Whale's 1932 film of the same name; you'll see what I mean. Even that film's macabre humor and invalid patriarch character are referenced. TCM is an update on that genre with post '60's cynicism. As that stands, it may not be the first slasher film, as it's often called, but the last, and best 'Old Dark House with a homicidal but oddly funny family' type of film ever made.~ ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"23 June 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This expressionist early talkie, known mainly as a tale of degradation like Jannings' previous roles, is often hilariously funny. Jannings, one of the best actors of his day, is straight man here, and he's the funniest thing in the movie. This film is remembered mainly for Dietrich, because of Jannings' and Dietrich's subsequent political lives; it basically gave Dietrich the role she'd lost out to Louise Brooks in PANDORA'S BOX. At face value, though, the movie ought to be remembered mostly for Jannings. His hapless high-school teacher is brilliantly underplayed-- pathetic and hilarious in the same moments, even in the final scene. What's special about this movie is how Von Sternberg and Jannings keep the black comedy in the air all the way through, even in the scenes of tearjerking pathos.Most of the cast in the English version are obviously reading their lines phonetically. However, this version is not really so bad as is sometimes claimed. Dietrich and Jannings both spoke English well. The cast's Bad English actually adds to the comedy in some scenes. And Lola Lola is English, so the club would have picked up the slang from her.This Dietrich is somehow more appealing than the more stylized, streamlined one of her Hollywood films, where she got turned into another Exotic Foreigner-- a tramp version of Garbo. Here she's less serious and more fun. She can't sing, can't dance, and can barely even act (e.g., her reaction shots in the final fracas). Yet when she had a good role, like Frenchy in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN or this one, her nonchalant screen personality could make her more appealing than the usual glamour puss. How she became famous as a singer does remain a mystery. Maybe it's the unique poses-- the way she puts one ankle over one knee for Falling in Love Again. No one else would sing it quite that way-- not even a man.

It's up to seasoned detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and cocky newcomer David Mills (Brad Pitt) to track down the killer, who in the end, proves to be anything but ordinary and routine.Directed by David Fincher (Fight Club) and drawn from a script by Andrew Kevin Walker (8mm), Se7en is perhaps one of the most unsettling, most gruesome and most unforgettable thrillers to come from the 90's. Giving even The Silence of the Lambs a run for its money, Fincher's film is chock full of moody atmosphere and gloomy set-pieces. Rarely do the two detectives stumble into a brightly lit room, and the rain that plagues their non-descript, crime-filled city refuses to let up until the killer is revealed. Coming off of the troubled production that was Alien 3, Fincher was given a second shot, and with this film, defines a style all his own that had been plagiarized to death by the turn of the century. The cinematography and ambient direction are fresh for its time and hold up today &#x96; at fourteen years old, the film still looks stunning &#x96; and serves up a truly unique experience. The world created in this film may be too much to stomach for some, as it shows humanity at its worst with a serial killer who considers himself a hero, a savior even. Occasionally the film breaks for some slight situational humor that only serves to further humanize our two main leads, but for the most part, it's a wholly disturbing and gut-wrenching experience, right down to the final reveal of the killer and the inescapable ending.In a way, Se7en could be seen as the anti-Lethal Weapon -- A buddy-cop comedy without the comedy or the buddies. Instead, our well-worn pro, just six days from retirement, has been beaten down and drained by the world he lives in and is only leaving the job to salvage what humanity is left inside of himself. The arrogant new guy is fueled by past successes and a hunger for action that perhaps his older counterpart once had but tragically lost. The shocking ending only serves to juxtapose the two characters. Morgan Freeman is solid as always, while Brad Pitt overacts the part just a hair. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitt's wife sweet and as human as possible, while Kevin Spacey has a role in this film that can only be described as iconic. With a great cast under the brilliant direction of a budding, young and talented director, Se7en is as close to perfection as the horror\/thriller genre gets.
