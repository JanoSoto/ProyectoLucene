The Saga started smoothly, with Style, almost shining and vibrating with energy and...you get the idea.It has good action scenes(and helped with many special effects) it makes it interesting to watch over and over. Main Protagonist its Keanu Reeves(Neo), with the help of Laurence Fishbourne(Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss(Trinity) has to find the truth behind the Matrix he was living. Shocking truth.This world is something virtual!oh the humanity! We actually live on ships, on a Huge Sewer! Well...anyway, the movie has everything Weapons, Kung Fu, Bad Guys , a shocking story, a predictable love...simply complete. Too bad.Neo's The Chosen One Fate...would affect the quality of the next 2 movies. Still a piece of Art.Buy it. Best Part When you eat the cookie, you'll feel much better Secret Add 2 lbs. of special flour to your cooking =D ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Undoubtly, One of the Best movies of the 99's.
