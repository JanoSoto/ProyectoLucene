We see ourselves standing over the lives of four people who plan to finally achieve their dreams, for three of them it's money, for one it is to finally have the spot light reflecting off of her decaying skin as she gets a phone call stating that she is going to be on television. The movie is beautifully shot in a bizarre but unique manner. The characters are very human in their reactions and remain unpredictable and, in some cases, repulsive. I don't think the director could've done a better job shooting this. Bravo! First Pi and now this masterpiece. It's a shame nothing else has come from him yet.
