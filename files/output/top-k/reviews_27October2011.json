[{"date":"27 October 2011","score":"","review":" Joel Schumacher has quite the reputation of being a director that dumbs down films with melodrama or by stripping the script off any depth. '8MM' is quite an intense chilling thriller that does touch on some very disturbing themes. However, Schumacher doesn't delve into it enough. He's more focused on the mystery of the missing girl angle. This could have been a though provoking film but the director seems to be too concerned with the Hollywood aspect. The film does make brief suggestions about the power and influence pornography has on people but it doesn't explore the psyche that draws people towards it. That said, '8MM' is a decent thriller. It had me engaged from the very beginning. Moreover the solid execution, especially the camera-work, art direction and the haunting score create an intense atmosphere. For a Hollywood flick, '8MM' is quite graphic. Nicolas Cage is brilliant and so is Joaquin Phoenix. James Gandolfini is a scene stealer as the sleazy pornographer. Catherine Keener isn't given much to do other than playing the concerned wife. Overall, it's a decent flick which could have been more than that if it was in the hands of a more capable director.

And this is another one that has somehow remained on my To See list, although I'd be lying if I said that I could live without it. Still, it would be a shame to let precious hard disk space go to waste so I indulged myself with this glossy, too-clever-by-half thriller from one of Hollywood's great directors. And in spite of its lead actor tearing his way through the film like a whirling dervish, I still managed to enjoy it.On a dark and stormy night in Atlantic City, dirty cop Ricky Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is present at the last big fight being held at a casino before demolition. With his military friend Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise) by his side, Santoro is witness to the assassination of Defence Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and takes it upon himself to solve the case - seeing as the TV cameras are already there, there's surely opportunities to be made. But as he digs deeper, Santoro discovers a murky conspiracy seemingly involving everyone from the glamorous blonde sat next to him (Carla Gugino) to the boxer flat on his back in the ring (Stan Shaw)...There is plenty to enjoy in Snake Eyes, the first of which is the opening scene when the chaos begins to ensue. Being a long, single shot reminiscent of Hitchcock's Rope that has all the detail and clues you'll need to solve the case offers you a tantalising chance to figure out what's going on. Sadly, the case isn't that hard to crack because the principal baddie is quite easy to spot which does take the edge off somewhat. The direction and cinematography is quite brilliant - split screens and flashbacks gel perfectly well with each other as the story progresses but don't feel thrown in casually like they were in Duplicity. The story, despite the culprits being obvious, is a winner up to the very end which feels badly written in haste and somewhat at odds with the professionalism that went before it.The biggest problem, however, is Cage who acts like some random coke head has been let onto the set and told to go completely nuts. Santoro never feels much like a hero so at no point do you start to sympathise or root for him. Most protagonists in most movies do their deeds out of a sense of justice or kind-heartedness but with Santoro, you only ever feel like he's doing it for the money. But aside from a dodgy ending and a loose cannon for a lead, Snake Eyes remains a decent thriller that I'm glad I caught. I'm surprised that it has come in for harsher criticism - maybe De Palma's reputation precedes him and people were expecting another Scarface or Carlito's Way. Snake Eyes is no masterpiece but it certainly isn't as bad as some have said. It's a good movie but one that misses out on greatness.

In the 1930s, Europe, the U.S., and the rest of the world were in a horrible economic melt-down. The stage was set for a man like Hitler to use his charisma to take power by giving people - especially young people - an ideal to fight for.I think one of the most effective scenes in this superb, dark film is the way they do the song Tomorrow Belongs To Me. A great song, but to me the way it is done is very effective. It opens with a tight close-up of a young man who starts singing. All you can see is his face. He begins to sing and the camera slowly backs out to reveal that he is a Nazi. Very well done. The young people in the audience are shown in close-ups, rising and singing this song, but, like the lead vocalist, not joyously. To me, it was almost like they're programmed to rise and sign along with it. The faces are of hate and determination, not joy about a more beautiful tomorrow. It's as if the movie wants to show that they have been brainwashed. They are willing to fight and die if needed for their ideals and one is either for or against them.Also effective is the comment by Michael York at the end of the scene, where he asks Do you still think you can control them? and then, in a haunting way, we see Joel Gray as the M.C. in his pancake makeup with an eerie See, I told you so. There is much more to come smile. Powerful stuff. To me, that scene sums up the whole movie.A powerful, tour-De-force show for Liza Minelli and a fascinating commentary on the Germany of the Great Depression.

Like William, I was protected from the evils of rock and roll by strict parents, which had claimed my siblings during the late 60s. My brother and sisters are 11, 16 and 17 years older than I am, and I was 10 in 1974, the year in which Almost Famous takes place, so perhaps I'm more than a smidge partial to this movie, and the way I so strongly identified with it.The movie brought to mind the first time I listened to Queen's A Night At The Opera and Styx's The Grand Illusion - the first time I'd heard rock anywhere outside of my brother's closed bedroom door. It reminded me of the fascination I had with magazines like Tiger Beat, Creem, 16, Song Hits and the like during the mid-'70s and how I wanted to be a music journalist then, so I could meet the people who had entered my life and turned my world upside down. I would read about the stuff going on in New York City at CBGB and long to go, even to go to Long Island and hope for a glimpse of Billy Joel. (That was back when you could say Ramones, Billy Joel and Black Sabbath in the same conversation.) Because we lived so far from the venues where the larger acts played, I never got to see Queen or Styx growing up. It wasn't until I was 16 that I got to see my first rock concert, Cheap Trick in 1980. I still remember being absolutely enraptured with them all over again, even without Tom Petersson on bass. William Miller's rapture is my rapture, recreated. His dream was once my dream. Unlike me, William got to live it in his alter ego, Almost Famous writer\/director Cameron Crowe.This movie is the ultimate for me in vicarious living. About the closest I ever got to the rock and roll life that still burns within me is when I interviewed for a receptionist job at Bad Animals Studios, where Heart (including Mrs. Cameron Crowe) record in Seattle.It's a throwback to my life at that time, a fond collection of memories and the songs I would hear every day from the moment the floodgates opened that cold day in '74 at my best friend's house.The performances are honest, real and delivered with such credibility that you forget you're watching a movie, not a documentary, at times. Patrick Fugit as William definitely captures his initial innocence and later the frustration of finding out what his heroes are really like. Kate Hudson has that wide-eyed-but-in-on-the-joke look about her for much of the time, watching the young writer with amusement, but when she finds out her true value to the band, the illusion shatters and she becomes more real. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee's conflicted characters reflect the egos I often saw in my own brother and his best friends when they were struggling for their own brass rings.All in all, whenever I watch this movie, I again become the 14 year old I used to be, and remember dreams and that inevitable loss of innocence we all must go through on our journey into adulthood. But that doesn't come without a wakeup call, without a price - the price being that we are never quite the same again.
