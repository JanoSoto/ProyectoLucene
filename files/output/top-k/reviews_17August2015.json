After watching it just now, I am emotionally exhausted, and my mind is in overdrive analyzing every perfect piece of this well thought out puzzle, and reeling trying to process and deal with the raw sadness and electric, haunting nature of the mystery that encases the story like a chilling road map of the two main characters emotions. I am so affected by this one that I'm scared I'll screw this review up with my rambling adjectives and poetic mumbling that's become my trademark. There are a lot of films I like, some I love, but it takes a true gem to make it into my pantheon of all time favourites. This made it with one viewing. What can I say. Billy Crudup, who I've never been blown away by (although he's solid in Big Fish) gives an award worthy turn here as Fielding Pierce, an ambitious coast guard operative who climbs the ladder of politics and aspires to be a congressman. He is concise, democratic, and has a by the numbers view of the world. He meets Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), who couldn't be more different than him. She's an activist, focused on helping the world one rally, one church, one ounce of compassion at a time, as opposed to institution and organized parties. Despite these differences, they fall deeply, hopelessly, eternally in love. Connelly is a touching wonder as Sarah, expelling warmth and fiery concern with her performance. The two of them together make the most convincing on screen couple I've seen in a while, and I couldn't take my eyes off any scene with them. Now.. the film's opening scene is Fielding watching a news report of her death, a car bombing in Chile. It then time jumps between scenes of their budding relationship in the 70's, to Fielding in the early 80's, on a career upswing. Only problem, he suddenly begins to be haunted by waking visions of Sarah, her voice in his head, her figure in the streets calling to him, memories of her flooding his perception and causing him to see her everywhere. Is she still alive somewhere? Is he losing it? The film makes a very brave choice and decides never to give us one answer, even at the end. Crudup owns the part, especially in the scenes with Connolly, they are absolutely sensational together. The script goes from intriguing mystery to thoughtful treatise on how we may lose what we love and want, but that it may be in service of what we are meant for. Hard stuff for anyone with a heart to swallow, and indeed some scenes later had me just drowning in tears, but a theme that I can't say will leave my consciousness soon. Hal Holbrook is there as Pierce's mentor, Janet Mcteer as his no nonsense sister, Stanley Anderson is touching as his father, and Paul Hipp agonizing in one particular scene as his black sheep brother. The film entrances from beginning to end. The soundtrack is perfect, with contributions from Joni Mitchell and Peter Gabriel fitting the ethereal tone, and an incredulous original score. The atmosphere captures Fielding's confusion and heartbreak sensationally, and some camera work from expert cinematographer Tom Richmond provides some shots that look like they're out of a dream, specifically a scene in a subway tunnel where he sees her everywhere. The story flows perfectly with the beautiful music, aching romance and otherworldly mystery to weave a flowing tapestry of pure creation. I'm always amazed when all the elements of a piece flow harmoniously together. How this was not one one most talked about film of 2000 just kills me. I can't say how it will affect you, but it left me sitting on the couch in awe of what I had just seen, on the verge of breaking down, devastated by what Had just unfolded. Maybe you'll get that out of it too. Maybe not. Just don't come to me later and say you couldn't enjoy it as much as you wanted to because I hyped it up too much. I hate when people do that, and you know who you are. Nevertheless, this film.. Deep, ponderous, an old school tearjerker, without pandering melodrama, it gives a purpose to its two star crossed lovers, and the fact that they're so removed from one another in their respective lives and outlooks only adds to the captivating nature of their unbroken love. I'll stop gushing..for now.

Sadly the issues between father and son are not particularly well explored - except that Dad is racist and son isn't. Then unexpectedly Hank's son shoots himself. Following her husband's execution and in an unfortunate coincidence, Leticia (Halle Berry) also finds herself dealing with the loss of her child. United in their grief, Hank and Leticia start to fall for each other.Screenwriters Milo Addica and Will Rokos are clearly plucking for a heart-rending drama here, but sadly Hank and Leticia aren't really developed well enough to be able to become fully swept up in their grief. Berry's character is better developed as her failings are much more apparent (poor timekeeping, money problems, a short fuse etc). Although her character wasn't entirely likable, I always got the impression that she was fairly well-intentioned. Sadly, the writers do nothing with Billy Bob Thornton's character and offer very little insight about him as a person. I suppose the anger and resentment that Hank shows to his son is merely a projection of the relationship that exists with Hank and his father. If we keep the focus on characters then let's move on to Peter Boyle's role as Hank's father Buck; he plays a grumpy old man but not an endearing or funny grumpy old man like Walt Kowalski in Gran Torino or Victor Meldrew in One Foot In The Grave, but instead he's an irritating, humourless miserable old git. To saddle Boyle with a role such as this is a criminal waste of his talents.Once Hank and Leticia begin a relationship following the deaths of their children the film takes on a very sleepy and ponderous turn. The chemistry was poor between Hank and Leticia and given the fact that the deaths of their children is ultimately what brought them together it's actually surprising how little focus their deaths seem to have on the plot. There was one scene where Leticia is talking to Hank about her son and how he used to hide candy bars etc - this was quite an effective scene which was cheapened a bit by the two of them 'getting it on' immediately after this touching and emotive moment. Aside from one or two moments, I found myself really bored in the second half of the film and just found it to be a rather dull, ponderous, film with some sex thrown in now and again and found myself just praying for it to end. In addition to this the film occasionally threw in absurd and irrelevant plot points like Hank becoming a Gas Station owner then ignoring this aspect all together after it's been mentioned??? Finally we'll come to Halle Berry and whilst her performance was good here I'd hardly consider it Oscar Worthy. There is a sex scene about halfway through the film where we get to see what Halle's 'got' and I can't help but wonder that after seeing this scene that the critics were thinking with a very different part of their anatomy when they decided to award her with the Oscar.

I love Dan Aykroyd. He was and still is one of my top ten favorite talents to emerge from Saturday Night Live. However, as far as being able to write, produce, direct and star in a film, he might have bit off more than he could handle. I saw a portion of this movie for the first time around 1995; it was the scene where Chevy Chase is tried before the judge, found guilty on trumped-up charges and sent through the roller coaster from hell to his death. That was it for me. I never knew what happened next for several years. What happened before that? Where did it go from there? I had to know. Some years passed, and I found the movie at the local library. (Yes, libraries actually rent movies, and they do it for free.) It turns out what I missed was Chevy Chase as a successful stock broker meeting Demi Moore, a really hot lawyer, and that's basically where things spring board. It starts out dull and boring and leaves you waiting to get into the plot. Chevy wants to take Demi out for a long drive down the coast to be alone, but in walks the late Taylor Negron from Fast Times At Ridgemont High and his girlfriend to horn in on the trip and pretty much get on everyone's last nerve, including the audience. They don't even have a purpose in this movie and are quickly shuffled out twenty minutes later after serving their purpose. After pressuring Chevy to break the law and get them all arrested, they all get dragged up before Dan Aykroyd in very heavy (and I do mean VERY HEAVY) prosthetics in a courthouse in the middle of several acres of junkyard surrounded by a moat. While this fat-suit gimmick worked out great for Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor, Aykroyd uses it to become as gross, obnoxious and unappealing as possible. It's just not funny or really integral to the plot. The house and junkyard with its various Addams Family hidden room aspects are more intriguing, but we never see much of it. John Candy plays the judge's nephew, the only normal person in the judge's family, but Candy also gets stuck playing double-duty as his overweight and homely sister in a role that is both disturbing and uncomfortable for Candy. It's supposedly played for laughs, but it's not funny. The rest of the movie is pretty much about Chevy and Demi trying to escape with Chevy getting trapped into a marriage with the homely fat niece and sent through the aforementioned roller coaster to his death. Luckily, it conks out before truly chewing him up. Unfortunately, he's basically sleepwalking through the scenes and phoning in his dialogue without the energy or personality of Clark Griswold. Demi Moore tries playing her role straight, but it is not hard to see she's completely confused and dismayed by the script that isn't very funny and is actually frequently disturbing. It's basically Deliverance as a live-action horror cartoon, and it's not really helped by a disconnected musical interlude by a group I'm told calls itself Digital Underground. I'm never heard of them either, but they're the only good thing in this movie even if it gets disturbing to watch two young beautiful ladies rub up against Aykroyd in his fat latex old man costume. If this movie is what we can expect from the unbridled imagination that is Dan Aykroyd, all I can say is Thank-God for Harold Ramis for keeping him restrained enough to create Ghostbusters.

I was surprised how this film received mixed reviews when originally released, but I guess the contemporary audience was not ready for him just yet. This film fits the definition of a mystery, but it is much deeper than that. It's a love story, and a painful one to boot. The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses. Hitchcock's film is about a retired detective named Scottie who suffers from acrophobia, or the fear of heights. He is tasked by a former colleague to follow his wife, who has been acting strange lately. Scottie reluctantly agrees to take the case. Once he does, he realizes something strange is happening. Not only that, he begins to take a painful obsession over this girl, Madeleine. We get some fine, professional displays of acting here. James Stewart does a great job as Scottie. He, along with the new camera-work displayed by Hitchcock, really showed how paranoid he is with heights. And that really gave me the creeps just watching him be hesitant to even climb stairs. Kim Novak does a great job in two roles of hers, especially as Madeleine Elster. She brings a sensitivity to her character which I found to be reassuring when it comes to female characters during this era. Overall, Vertigo is a very suspenseful thriller that is often scary to watch. If you have seen this film and suffer from agoraphobia, perhaps this is the film to blame. But nonetheless, films like these is why Hitchcock have been called the master of suspense. Even conversations have an aura of what is going to happen next? The ending is unexpected and really good. If you like masterful suspense films, then Vertigo is the film for you.

The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses. Hitchcock's film is about a retired detective named Scottie who suffers from acrophobia, or the fear of heights. He is tasked by a former colleague to follow his wife, who has been acting strange lately. Scottie reluctantly agrees to take the case. Once he does, he realizes something strange is happening. Not only that, he begins to take a painful obsession over this girl, Madeleine. We get some fine, professional displays of acting here. James Stewart does a great job as Scottie. He, along with the new camera-work displayed by Hitchcock, really showed how paranoid he is with heights. And that really gave me the creeps just watching him be hesitant to even climb stairs. Kim Novak does a great job in two roles of hers, especially as Madeleine Elster. She brings a sensitivity to her character which I found to be reassuring when it comes to female characters during this era. Overall, Vertigo is a very suspenseful thriller that is often scary to watch. If you have seen this film and suffer from agoraphobia, perhaps this is the film to blame. But nonetheless, films like these is why Hitchcock have been called the master of suspense. Even conversations have an aura of what is going to happen next? The ending is unexpected and really good. If you like masterful suspense films, then Vertigo is the film for you.

My Grade A- ","genre":"Mystery, Romance, Thriller"},{"date":"17 August 2015","score":"","review":" To celebrate my 1,500th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films, starring my all-time favourite actress, although for reasons to follow I am unable to award it the perfect 10 it would otherwise have merited.Holly Golightly is a&#x85;, well, what exactly is she? A high-class call girl? No, in 1961 the Production Code was still in force so the film- makers could not afford to be so explicit. She is a mixture of good- time-girl, gold-digger and wannabe actress, and although it is never really explained how a poor girl from the backwoods of Texas can afford to live in style in a smart Manhattan apartment, prostitution is never mentioned.The film is a romantic comedy charting the romance between Holly and her neighbour Paul Varjak, a promising young writer. At least, he was once a promising young writer, but has not actually published anything for five years. He claims to be writing a novel, but the truth is that he has been side-tracked from his writing career by his affair with a wealthy married older woman, Mrs Failenson, nicknamed (from her initials) 2E. He certainly does not love her, and she does not love him enough to consider leaving her husband for him, but both are happy to go along with the arrangement, 2E because it brings her excitement and Paul because it enables him to live in comfort off 2E's money. Holly's own romantic life is even more tangled; in the course of the film she gets involved with a mobster, a crass and vulgar American millionaire bizarrely named Rusty Trawler, and a wealthy Brazilian.Truman Capote, author of the novella on which the film was based, famously objected to the casting of Audrey Hepburn as his heroine, complaining that she was not raunchy enough. (He would have preferred Marilyn Monroe, who apparently turned the role down on the grounds that playing a girl like Holly would be bad for her image). Now it is certainly true that Audrey was not raunchy, but then she didn't need to be. Raunchy is only another word for tries too hard, and Audrey didn't need to try hard. I'm not referring to her acting- she certainly worked hard at that- but rather to her inherent sexuality. In the fifties and sixties being the sexiest woman in the world was something that came to Audrey Hepburn as easily as breathing, without any apparent effort at all.As respects her age and her accent, Audrey was perhaps wrong for the role. It is clear from references in the script that Holly is, at most, 20; Audrey was 32. (Mind you, Marilyn was 35 at the time). As for her accent, I doubt if a working-class Texas girl could ever have sounded so British, even after elocution lessons from Martin Balsam. In every other respect, however, she is absolutely right. Holly is a flawed personality, but her flaws are essentially the result of her naivety, and it is important that she should remain sympathetic throughout, something which would have been wrecked by any attempt to play her in a raunchy manner. Even when Holly is behaving badly, Audrey is never anything other than captivating, and she can captivate with the tiniest of gestures- eating a pastry, raising her sunglasses, the way she holds her oversized cigarette holder.With one notorious exception, the supporting cast are all very good, including Balsam as Holly's agent, Buddy Ebsen as her former husband who is clearly still in love with her, Patricia Neal as 2E, and even Orangey as Holly's cat, unimaginatively simply known as Cat. (If there were an Oscar for Best Feline Actor he would have been a dead cert). George Peppard, long before he joined the A-Team, has come in for some criticism as Paul, but I actually found his performance quite touching. It doubtless came as a surprise for Audrey to have a leading man only a year older than herself, after years of being cast as the love-interest of men old enough to be her father (Bogart, Astaire, Fonda) or nearly so (Peck, Lancaster).Special mention must also go to Henry Mancini's fine musical score based around his wonderfully evocative theme song Moon River. Yes, I know that, taken literally, the lyrics don't very mean much, but symbolically they conjure up a whole world of yearning for new possibilities. The song also revealed, more than did her earlier musical Funny Face, just what a fine singing voice Audrey had; Mancini was to say that nobody had ever performed his song so well. The film's only two Academy Awards were won for Best Original Score and Best Original Song.Breakfast at Tiffany's is a film with a special meaning for me. The first time I saw it was when it was shown on television as a tribute to Audrey Hepburn, who had recently died and whom I had already come to love through other films such as Sabrina and My Fair Lady. That screening also came not long after I had witnessed someone very close to me trying to avoid the same trap which confronts Holly and Paul in the film. Both need to decide whether they will go for the easy option of basing their future on financial comfort and (in Holly's case) the respectability she will enjoy as Senhora José da Silva Pereira, or whether they will take the risk of basing their future on love. Anyone familiar with the conventions of romantic comedy (which, alas, are not always the conventions of real life) will know in advance what the answer will be, but that does not prevent the final scene in the rain, to the strains of Moon River, from being one of the most emotionally stirring in any film I know. 9\/10.

The film begins and ends in a typical south-mid-west Protestant church in America. Two characters who were killed at the beginning and appear again as the final two figures seen. If you haven't seen the film yet, you won't expect where they show up, and hopefully I won't be accused of offering a spoiler. Endless speculation and debate about their reappearance has been written about ad infinitum, even by reviewers during the time of the film's initial release in the mid-1980's.The first scene is a Protestant church in rural America where Rock of Ages (not the Def Leppard version) is a mainstay of the musical repertoire. Edna Spalding (Sally Field in an Academy-Award winning performance) is the wife and mother in a family of four in the rural south in Texas in the midst of the Depression. She is married to the unquestioned man-of-the-house, Royce Spalding, the sheriff of this small town. As the film progresses, we learn his role in the family was far more than simply the bread-winner. In addition to providing a good income, he took care of all bills, the finances, the mortgage on their house, even discipline.However, we don't learn about his role as head of the household by seeing him pay the mortgage and the bills, etc. At the very beginning of the story, Royce is killed at the hands of a young black man, Wylie, who was playing with a gun while drunk, a deadly combination. We get the sense Wylie had no intention of killing the white sheriff, but, as it was in those days, the accidental shooting signed the epitaph of Wylie as well. The two bodies are brought to their respective families and friends, with a brief appearance of the lynched Wylie being dragged behind a truck passed the house of the Spalding residence. This act will change the course of the Spalding family.After the social gathering mourning the deceased at the Spalding residence has ended, and the fried chicken and coffee cake have been consumed, Edna is dealt a curve ball care of the local bank via their powerless lackey, Mr. Denby (Lane Smith). After stating his willingness to help Edna in anyway, Mr. Denby tells her the bank would prefer if she sold their home and property in order to pay off the loan for the house. Inappropriately, he makes other suggestions about how to temporarily break up her family since they will be effectively homeless. (It is a snapshot into why life insurance became popular in the wake of the Depression.) She declines his suggestions and offers different ideas about how to create income for her family, but Denby rejects all of them, as if a woman was incapable of doing such things. His only concern is about the bank receiving its payment.However, Edna resolves to make a go of trying to create income for her family. She solicits the help of Moze (Danny Glover in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a middle-age black man who offered his help earlier in exchange for room and board. They decide to plant cotton in the nearly 40 acres of land owned by the Spaldings. Shortly thereafter, Mr Denby returns to the Spalding residence, and being the good Christian that he is, offers an arrangement which will make the bank happier about her keeping the property. He proposes to have his brother-in-law, Will (John Malkovich), a blind man injured in the Great War and currently unwanted by his family, to rent a room at the Spalding household as way to generate income. At first Edna declines the offer until she realizes she's not in a situation to refuse income, and so Will moves in, called Mr. Will by the kids and Moze.The five members, Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the children become a new family from the ashes of the old. During the story, Edna learns to do all the things her husband used to do, such as creating income and signing checks, even disciplining the children with corporal punishment. At first, Mr. Will despises his circumstances, but gradually comes to care for and even love the children and Edna and even Moze. When a tornado descends upon the town, the family becomes unified in a way they hadn't expected. And towards the end, Mr. Will defends Moze, and this rings of some of the themes present in To Kill a Mockingbird, both the book and film.There is one side story which distracts from the main storyline Wayne, the husband of Edna's sister Margaret is having an affair with the local schoolteacher, Viola. Several scenes involve these other four characters interacting with one another. Unfortunately, these scenes were not as interesting as Edna et al, and it diminishes their storyline which is really the main focus of the film. As much as I like the talent of Ed Harris, Lindsay Crouse, and Amy Madigan I would have preferred their sequences cut with more screen time offered for the developing relationships between Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the kids.Still, a fine film with incredible acting work. This may be the best acting of the three leads, plus honorable mention of the two young actors, Yankton Hatten and Gennie James as the kids Frank and Possum. Field certainly is as compelling as ever, but the other leads Glover and Malkovich not only keep up with her stride-for-stride, but make the story compelling from start to finish. And the two small roles of the sheriff and Wylie reappear at the very end, as if to remind us what led to the paths taken by the main characters.

In addition to providing a good income, he took care of all bills, the finances, the mortgage on their house, even discipline.However, we don't learn about his role as head of the household by seeing him pay the mortgage and the bills, etc. At the very beginning of the story, Royce is killed at the hands of a young black man, Wylie, who was playing with a gun while drunk, a deadly combination. We get the sense Wylie had no intention of killing the white sheriff, but, as it was in those days, the accidental shooting signed the epitaph of Wylie as well. The two bodies are brought to their respective families and friends, with a brief appearance of the lynched Wylie being dragged behind a truck passed the house of the Spalding residence. This act will change the course of the Spalding family.After the social gathering mourning the deceased at the Spalding residence has ended, and the fried chicken and coffee cake have been consumed, Edna is dealt a curve ball care of the local bank via their powerless lackey, Mr. Denby (Lane Smith). After stating his willingness to help Edna in anyway, Mr. Denby tells her the bank would prefer if she sold their home and property in order to pay off the loan for the house. Inappropriately, he makes other suggestions about how to temporarily break up her family since they will be effectively homeless. (It is a snapshot into why life insurance became popular in the wake of the Depression.) She declines his suggestions and offers different ideas about how to create income for her family, but Denby rejects all of them, as if a woman was incapable of doing such things. His only concern is about the bank receiving its payment.However, Edna resolves to make a go of trying to create income for her family. She solicits the help of Moze (Danny Glover in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a middle-age black man who offered his help earlier in exchange for room and board. They decide to plant cotton in the nearly 40 acres of land owned by the Spaldings. Shortly thereafter, Mr Denby returns to the Spalding residence, and being the good Christian that he is, offers an arrangement which will make the bank happier about her keeping the property. He proposes to have his brother-in-law, Will (John Malkovich), a blind man injured in the Great War and currently unwanted by his family, to rent a room at the Spalding household as way to generate income. At first Edna declines the offer until she realizes she's not in a situation to refuse income, and so Will moves in, called Mr. Will by the kids and Moze.The five members, Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the children become a new family from the ashes of the old. During the story, Edna learns to do all the things her husband used to do, such as creating income and signing checks, even disciplining the children with corporal punishment. At first, Mr. Will despises his circumstances, but gradually comes to care for and even love the children and Edna and even Moze. When a tornado descends upon the town, the family becomes unified in a way they hadn't expected. And towards the end, Mr. Will defends Moze, and this rings of some of the themes present in To Kill a Mockingbird, both the book and film.There is one side story which distracts from the main storyline Wayne, the husband of Edna's sister Margaret is having an affair with the local schoolteacher, Viola. Several scenes involve these other four characters interacting with one another. Unfortunately, these scenes were not as interesting as Edna et al, and it diminishes their storyline which is really the main focus of the film. As much as I like the talent of Ed Harris, Lindsay Crouse, and Amy Madigan I would have preferred their sequences cut with more screen time offered for the developing relationships between Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the kids.Still, a fine film with incredible acting work. This may be the best acting of the three leads, plus honorable mention of the two young actors, Yankton Hatten and Gennie James as the kids Frank and Possum. Field certainly is as compelling as ever, but the other leads Glover and Malkovich not only keep up with her stride-for-stride, but make the story compelling from start to finish. And the two small roles of the sheriff and Wylie reappear at the very end, as if to remind us what led to the paths taken by the main characters.

The film begins and ends in a typical south-mid-west Protestant church in America. Two characters who were killed at the beginning and appear again as the final two figures seen. If you haven't seen the film yet, you won't expect where they show up, and hopefully I won't be accused of offering a spoiler. Endless speculation and debate about their reappearance has been written about ad infinitum, even by reviewers during the time of the film's initial release in the mid-1980's.The first scene is a Protestant church in rural America where Rock of Ages (not the Def Leppard version) is a mainstay of the musical repertoire.

Or some funny, but still reverential films like Kill The Umpire or It Happens Every Spring. None of these films will ever have a character like Susan Sarandon, a well known baseball Annie which is what the players have dubbed their groupies. You could never have a character like her with the infamous Code in place. Sarandon is frank, she loves sex, she loves baseball and she sees herself doing her bit for the national past time. Her concentration this year is on Tim Robins who is a promising Sandy Koufax like pitcher before Sandy got control of his pitching and gave us five of the best seasons ever seen before announcing his premature retirement.Also giving Robins his concentration is veteran catcher Kevin Costner hired specifically for that purpose by the Raleigh-Durham Bulls. Between Sarandon and Costner they turn Robins into someone fulfilling his promise. But baseball is a most unsentimental game as Costner knows and Sarandon's avocation is also one with some heartbreak.Best scene in the film is Costner describing what it's like in the Major Leagues, 'the big show'. As he says the 20 best days in my life. Like actors, athletes on team sports want to play in whatever major leagues there are.

One reason being I don't like westerns in general - just find them formulaic and violent for the sake of violence (although I'm a great fan of the Godfather franchise, so maybe it's not the violence that turns me off in westerns). The other reason being that while John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns dominate our TV screens, westerns featuring Alan Ladd (including Shane) are shown with the frequency of Halley's Comet. I finally saw Shane on Netflix two months ago (only after reading glowing praises of the film from Woody Allen, because, frankly, Shane's poster is a huge turn-off) and I've been watching and re-watching it ever since!!! I even bought a DVD of this film to join the only seven other movies I watch whenever possible (yes Godfather I is among them). Shane is filled with great performances from the slinking dogs, to the title role of Shane - and everyone in between. I cannot imagine other actors playing these roles, just like I cannot imagine a different director, different cinematography and different musical score. It's like reading a Great American Novel but in pictures. It's timeless. And this is largely due to the excellent editing and George Stevens - Alan Ladd pairing (unhappily never repeated). Alan Ladd is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors (since Shane I looked up some of his other movies - his noirs are excellent). Despite great talent, most directors (and certainly the studio executives) didn't know how to use him at all. Not so with George Stevens he knew he got the right stuff here (the fact that he wanted to work again with Ladd on Giant shows how much he appreciated Ladd's talents). Stevens worked him hard but he got what he wanted in spades. The intensity Alan Ladd portrays on screen is electrifying. Even when he is off center in the shot, the eye travels to him. His body language is subdued but his eyes are especially expressive. While Brando needed cotton balls to produce the truly memorable performance, Ladd just has to shift the light in his eyes to make the chills run down one's spine. Actors don't operate in vacuum and excellent cast helps make Ladd's appeal even greater. On a flip side, however, other players are shown against Ladd's persona as if he was the canvas that makes their colors stand out. In short it's a symbiotic relationship. A lot has been written about the fact that the only people on the set shorter than Ladd (other than the kids) were Jean Arthur and Elisha Cook Jr. So what? He was larger than life - especially as Shane - and that's what the movies are about - the illusion. There are also some criticisms about his buckskin outfit and long golden locks. If you think they are too effeminate for a gun slinger, just watch the scene where Shane shows off his shooting to Joey. I sure as heck wouldn't want to be at the business end of his gun. And again the face Shane shows for a split second when he fires the gun - you know this guy can kill (and most likely has killed) a man. If you want action like Die Hard 8 or Mission Impossible 7 - don't bother to watch this movie. If you are looking for western of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly ilk (or any Wayne vehicle) - don't bother with Shane either. But if you like to watch Kurosawa, Jean-Pierre Melville or Coppola (especially The Conversation) - give it a shot. You might really enjoy it. Then again, you might have to watch it a couple of times to really get into it. I'm not sorry I did.

A big city cop (Elias Koteas) catches wind of the otherworldy plot and pursues. He's led to a backwater New Mexico town that Gabriel has turned his attention too. It's a muddy, convoluted yarn, but don't get me wrong, I freakin love it. Walken seems to Emory the weirdness and wild, 'scream at the stars' anger of the jaded cherub perfectly, giving him a heart of evil obsidian glass and a mind to carry out his plan no matter how many races he has to decimate to do so. Virginia Madsen fills the female lead nicely, and there's supporting work from Amanda Plummer, Glenn Danzyg, Eric Stoltz, and a brief but wickedly memorable turn from Viggo Mortensen, playing Lucifer.

Almost everything was done right with this comic adaptation.The movie generates a sense of reality the whole way, and this is one of the best things a superhero movie can deliver in my honest opinion. Sure, some elements here and there like vampires going to ashes remind you that this is a fantasy, but the story itself remains real most of the time except at the climax which evolves into surreal. Filming was also very well done, avoiding flashy colours, accentuating the feeling of seriousness and reality throughout the city scenes.Fight choreographies were perfect, delivered fantastically by Snipes. Speed was fast enough to show that unnatural characters are at work here, but still slow and natural enough for our human eye to know what's going on. Wesley Snipes also did not just get fighting right, he also got acting right, delivering a nicely balanced performance. Managed to show that Blade is a tormented guy without going overboard and keeping the movie's focus elsewhere, where we want it to be. And Stephen Dorff did even better with a timeless performance in the role of Deacon Frost­. His character instills fear and doubt in every scene where he shows up despite his smaller stature and business clothing. It all fit together perfectly. Finally, one also needs to mention the successfully designed settings in many scenes, from the Temple of Eternal Light to the skyscraper rooftops to the vampire archives, it's all eye-popping and does not get old even today.Now, to what was not done right. First, some special effects. The blood ones, especially by the end where Blade explodes a few vampires with blood boiling, look absolutely horrible. The ashes from vampire dying by silver didn't work with me either, although they were not as bad as the blood effects. I also thought N'Bushe Wright wasn't a great cast for Karen, although maybe the role itself wasn't the best part of the movie. All in all, very minor sins compared to the whole achievement.Before closing, let it be said that Blade showcases some unrestrained violence but where there is no violence or danger, superheroes aren't needed much. This movie understood that most hero stories must be set against a credible evil in order to work, and Blade was a movie made for a mature audience rather than for kids.

Claire starts hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. Claire thinks the phenomena may have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist, and she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice........... try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody, and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth..........So this film was made because Zemeckis had nothing to do while Tom Hanks lost weight for Castaway. If this really is the case, I wish Hanks does more of these roles, because the result is a solid 'Old-Fashioned' horror movie, with the ubiquitous Zemeckis sheen.The concept and story of the film isn't the most original thing in the history of cinema, but the unique selling point of this film is the twist. It's not as in your face as The Sixth Sense of Se7en, but to have Harrison Ford, the all American hero, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, the President for crying out loud, is a wonderful inclusion to what otherwise is a stereotypical ghost story.Zemeckis has obviously done his research on Hitchcock for his filming styles, and the references are a subtle as a sledgehammer. It's not a bad thing though, but sometimes they do cause you to roll your eyes a little. The first two acts are quite unsettling and and have a very strange feel to them. Zemeckis throws us a red herring, leading the audience to believe that Claire is being haunted by the girl next door. While it's a neat concept, it's dealt with too quickly and we are left with Claire doing a lot of detective work and basically letting the audience in on who the ghost is.But then the final third is with us, and it goes absolutely bonkers for the last twenty minutes. There is little dialogue shared between the two leads in this final part, but Zemeckis let's body language, camera angles and mise en scene take the forefront.Pfeiffer and Ford are both brilliant in their roles, so good, they actually make the rest of the cast seem a little cookie cutter in what they are doing.All in all, it's nothing more than a b-movie ghost story, glossed over with brilliant performances, and wonderful direction.And for once, the blatant use of digital effects only add to the charm of the movie.

Whether he proved his point or not is open to interpretation, although the fact that Starman was essentially his last big budget movie during the 80's and the director eventually kept spiraling farther away from the mainstream is probably evidence that this film didn't go as planned either. What Carpenter did accomplish though in the process, is craft the best serious take on an encounter with an alien civilization, at least until Contact came along.Compared to any other of Carpenter's films, Starman is perhaps the most singular and also the most genre-bending of any of his projects. You might have thought he pushed the envelope with Big Trouble in Little China, but Starman goes even further. The story is part alien encounter, part road movie, part romance and manages to mix its elements competently and switch gears expertly, propelled by two great performance by a young Jeff Bridges (this was his first Oscar nomination) and Karen Allen. Production values are also very high. Special effects, although not ubiquitous, are very imaginative and brilliantly executed whenever they occur. There are several shots in this one that have become iconic, such as the Starman transformation sequence early in the film, accomplished through a rare collaboration of two effects masters of the period, Stan Winston and Rick Baker. The movie is also graced with a spectacular score by Jack Nitzsche, elevating scenes like the finale into levels of otherworldly beauty.When it comes to Carpenter films, I consider this to be his finest, even compared to such gems as The Thing and Halloween. The fact that this isn't even remotely a horror film, so far from the director's comfort zone, makes it all the more remarkable.

The story is part alien encounter, part road movie, part romance and manages to mix its elements competently and switch gears expertly, propelled by two great performance by a young Jeff Bridges (this was his first Oscar nomination) and Karen Allen. Production values are also very high. Special effects, although not ubiquitous, are very imaginative and brilliantly executed whenever they occur. There are several shots in this one that have become iconic, such as the Starman transformation sequence early in the film, accomplished through a rare collaboration of two effects masters of the period, Stan Winston and Rick Baker. The movie is also graced with a spectacular score by Jack Nitzsche, elevating scenes like the finale into levels of otherworldly beauty.When it comes to Carpenter films, I consider this to be his finest, even compared to such gems as The Thing and Halloween. The fact that this isn't even remotely a horror film, so far from the director's comfort zone, makes it all the more remarkable. A classic and some of the most intelligent sci-fi you are ever going to find.

Here's why.Look, I know good, award-worthy movies and I can see why this one doesn't belong in that category. The acting is not very convincing, the story has huge holes in it and the characters aren't exactly deep. But there's just something incredibly charming about this film.The three main characters are beautiful to look at and though their acting isn't great, this kind of works for them because their exaggeration also makes them very likable.The film has a good atmosphere, with its typical British elements, its music, that's simple and plain but works, and its own pleasant style, which I find hard to define.And I really like the plot. I won't spoil anything - I'll just say it gives you a really interesting perspective on some things. It may not be a very deep perspective, or even a realistic one, but it is one I liked nonetheless.The movie is lighthearted and kind of depressing and sad at the same time. Which is a strange combination, but it works. It's also kind of ridiculous, a quality I can really appreciate in a film.

It has events. It has characters. It has music. But what is the point? Oftentimes it seems there isn't one and it takes a long time for something meaty to arrive. And even the movie's ending is not a full stop.The film consists of a series of events in the life of a cab driver. Unfortunately, a lot of them are not interesting, even though on paper they should be. Scenes with little content last a good long while and then end in some awkward situation because the main character is mentally and socially unstable. Those scenes are reminiscent of movies like the Midnight Cowboy, an Oscar-awarded movie I would rather go to a dentist than watch.The film shows the various dirt you see in a city at night, but you can probably see it better yourself if you hang around the streets or watch a documentary. There are a few situations that are interesting, but every time they are followed up by a long nothing. If the long pauses are meant to create tension or accentuate the descent into madness, they fail, creating awkwardness instead. It would appear that the director asks the viewer to do the work and fill in a lot of the blanks instead of doing the effort himself and putting in the sufficient energy.As Taxi Driver enters its 2nd half, the cerebral content and the tension start seeping in and it gets more and more interesting, but you have to wait almost an hour to arrive at this point. It takes TWO THIRDS of the movie before Jodie Foster's character shows up. The pay-off in the 2nd half of the film feels worth it and the movie makes sense in the end, but it requires a ton of patience from the viewer. It is like a good joke that takes an hour to get to the punch line.The acting is good as you would expect from Robbert De Niro, but it is also appropriate for the role, which means it is subdued and realistic to the point of boredom. Again, as with the story, there are good moments, most of them in the second half. The camera-work is simple but also brilliant in its simplicity. When the camera movies, there is a real sense of purpose and weight.The ending is an interesting choice. Without spoiling too much, the problem is that mental sickness doesn't just end with a happy ending, so it is strange to see a rather positive open ending.Bottom line, this is not a movie for me, but the quality is there if you have the patience.
