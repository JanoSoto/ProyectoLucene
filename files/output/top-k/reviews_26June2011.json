This film would chronicle Batman as he fights crime in Gotham as an emerging villain does his best to throw it into chaos. It is not really an origin story as you will not be seeing Batman training or designing his costume. At the start of the film he is Batman and there is already word of him on the street. You will see Joker being created in a manner of speaking in this one, but not like would be typical in future comic book films. This film features Michael Keaton as Batman\/Bruce Wayne and as playing the characters I say he is second best to Christian Bale. However, no one so far has played a really good Batman\/Bruce Wayne yet in any of the films so far in my opinion. So far the best version I have seen comes from the animated series, just hard for a real person to be both characters. Michael Keaton is actually rather good as Batman at times, but sometimes it just seems he is kind of off when delivering a line as the caped crusader and one thinks of Beatlejuice or Mr. Mom, and one should be thinking of neither while watching Batman. As Bruce Wayne he is okay acting the part, but he absolutely does not look the part. Still, after him Val Kilmer and George Clooney would make anyone pine for Keaton to return for the sequels. Jack Nicholson plays the Joker and he does a rather good and insane job often carrying the film. There are not all that many scenes of Batman in this film, however, this limited use of the caped crusader would only make his limited appearances more special, the highlight for me when he and Joker meet in the museum\/restaurant that ends with a great chase with the first incarnation of the Batmobile in a serious movie and the best of the original three. It even rivals the one used in the last two films of Christopher Nolan. The film is not perfect, however, as the Joker in the comics is an anarchist and here it seems to often that he is under control and has a plan. From what I understand there are parts cut out that would have helped define him as more the anarchist type. The Batsuit looks way to constricting in this movie and will in the remaining four of this series and you can see that the fighting is very limited here, with Batman exhibiting limited movement and the less said about the use of Prince on the soundtrack the better. Still, the musical score that starts with the opening credits is very good and for the most part so is this Batman, certainly the best of the original four which are supposed to be interconnected, but nearly every one of them has a different tone as we go from this one which is dark to the second which is dark and Gothic with odd bits of humor, to forever which is a bit lighter and more colorful to the fourth one where they get back to almost 60's television style with stars dying to be in the films as it appears they were not trying to make a good film, but rather it was just a party or something. Started good and I think it could have been a pretty good set of films had Burton and Keaton stayed on board, granted I was not the biggest fan of returns, Burton most certainly never would have made anything close to resembling four.

At first you really don't know what to make and think about this movie, since absolutely nothing is happening in it. But yet it keeps on intriguing, through its special way of film-making and storytelling.Really the great thing about this movie is that it doesn't let the story tell its story but it instead leaves things up mostly to the viewers mind. It's your own interpretation of things and your imagination that make this movie a mysterious and tense one. The movie is filled with lots of irrelevant moments, characters that don't do- or add anything and a very slow progress, but yet the movie never bores or becomes an ineffective one because the movie constantly provokes you with its surroundings and events. You're constantly paying attention, searching for perhaps a deeper meaning behind a certain event or character and the movie keeps you constantly expecting something to develop into something big or important. So you really don't want to miss a second of it! A real unique but also quite daring approach for a movie to take and I absolutely applaud it for that, especially when you see how it all works out.I perhaps make it sound like this is a very difficult and artsy movie to watch but this really isn't the case though. Everybody should be capable off experiencing this movie just as good and effectively as anybody else and you shouldn't worry about this movie perhaps being too hard to get through.The whole build up and approach of this movie reminds me most of an Italian giallo movie, if I have to compare it to anything else. No big surprise, since as it turned out the director of this movie was an Italian himself. This is one of the rare movies director Michelangelo Antonioni did entirely outside of his native Italy and it definitely got me interested in checking out his other work as well. Hopefully it's just as provoking and unique to watch as this movie was.Another great and unique thing about this movie is that it isn't even featuring a really likable main character. David Hemmings plays a real arrogant and selfish young successful photographer. It doesn't make his story less interesting to follow though, which is also perhaps thanks to the realistic approach of the character and acting performance by David Hemmings. He was still a quite young actor at the time but he still manages to carry the entire movie almost entirely on his own.

A dark story, brilliantly acted, shown in all its brutality and vulgarity. A film that speaks to everyone hate is baggage, and change is possible. And AHX has a great story to express that message with. It is truly a modern classic.The most in-your-face part of American History is Derek, played by Edward Norton. Like De Niro in Taxi Driver, he is iconic, or will be in the future. Norton performs incredibly, showing the cruelty and violence of a Neo Nazi, as well as the hurt and sincerity of a changed man. How he didn't win the Oscar with that shaved head and tattoo is beyond me. It's worth seeing the film for him alone...But almost all the other actors are as great, but don't have the part of Derek Vinyard. Furlong, as Danny, is great as the young, developing Derek, who smokes, writes papers on Mein Kampf, but still sticks up for the white kid who gets beat up and has time to give his sister 'airplane rides'. The rest of the family is well played, you can relate to them, and you can feel for them.Only Seth and Derek's girlfriend are hard to watch. Seth is intentional though he's an urban redneck, blind in his faith. The girlfriend is out of place. How a one-dimensional, trashy girl like that could end up with the ruthless (yet importantly smart) Derek is a little far fetched.The music is quiet, yet important. It has a very American feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place in Saving Private Ryan. During the opening credits, it gives the viewer a feel for what's to come an emotionally charged film set in their backyard.And it is emotional. The use of black and white in flashbacks is perfect, and slow-mo in important scenes really adds to their emotional punch.

Even the injuries which really occurred as the actors were thrown around the set, were included in this film. Das Boot is emotional, gripping, well written, and wonderfully directed, what else can I say. Das boot is considered to be one of the best films ever made and I would concur with that notion. This film should have broad appeal ranging from women to men, and every cross section within the primary sexes. It is German, with subtitles, but like many movies is dubbed, though I have never liked a dubbed version of anything I have ever seen outside of cartoons.

Even the injuries which really occurred as the actors were thrown around the set, were included in this film. Das Boot is emotional, gripping, well written, and wonderfully directed, what else can I say. Das boot is considered to be one of the best films ever made and I would concur with that notion. This film should have broad appeal ranging from women to men, and every cross section within the primary sexes. It is German, with subtitles, but like many movies is dubbed, though I have never liked a dubbed version of anything I have ever seen outside of cartoons. To discuss the plot like many films I review, is to do this film an injustice, the audience is always better off when a good story isn't spelled out for them before they see it. So just watch it sometime you should dig it, and maybe you to will find yourself rooting for the bad guys. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http\/\/raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"26 June 2011","score":"7 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" Pink Floyd as a band has withstood the test of time.30 years after The Wall, it's still a large influence on music in general, and a land mark out there.A concept album is like a book.

Lovecraft adaptation from director Stuart Gordon and producer Brian Yuzna.Synopsis Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs) is an obsessed medical researcher who enrolls in Miskatonic University to continue his research into bringing the dead back to life. He blackmails his room-mate Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) into assisting him in his research by threatening to reveal Dan's relations with Megan Halsey (Barbara Crampton), daughter of the university's Dean. When Dan naïvely tells Dean Halsey Robert Sampson) about their research he threatens to expel them. West is determined to keep going so they sneak into the hospital morgue to continue their research but are disturbed by the Dean who is killed by an out of control reanimated corpse. To cover up his death West reanimates the Dean. The Dean's condition as violent mindless zombie raises the suspicions of Megan and university professor Dr Hill (David Gale). Hill tries to force West to turn over his research to him but instead West cuts off his head. West then reanimates Hill's head and body but Hill is far from helpless and he escapes to plan his revenge.There is so much about this film that I love. Combs is just marvellous as Herbert West, playing him as an amoral monster.Most of the humour in the film comes from the vicious contempt West shows to everyone else, especially towards Megan and Dr Hill. David Gale gives great performance as Hill, a man desperate to stay top dog. Bruce Abbott is very pleasant to look at and I'm sure others will say the same about Barbara CramptonThe effects are probably a little dated but I don't think that detracts from this film at all. Modern CGI effects rarely disgust me like these older effects still manage to. I think fluids like pus and vomit gore are still better as real fake fluids than any CGI equivalent I have seen to date especially when they are dripping from an actor.Another thing I like is the wonderful score by Richard Band, a theme that builds in tension then decays into madness perfectly matching this filmI read the original Lovecraft story Herbert West - Re-Animator after watching this film and I was surprised to find that the film was toned down quite a lot from the book.

Like the prisoners we are made to do work against our will, we are made to live around certain people, and submit to unyielding authority. If there is a God, like the guards, he can only be distant, judgmental, and utterly unwilling to listen to us. Like the boss with the reflective sunglasses, we can only see ourselves and our inability to please God when we approach Him, while He always hits the mark perfectly in his own holy righteousness.Into this prison, into this all too familiar world, comes Luke, a man who's only crime is that he has never really been given a decent chance in life, a decent 'hand.' It is clear from the beginning that Luke is really innocent, essentially a good man who was never put in a position to succeed at life or find his purpose in life. This is proved by the fact that he won medals serving his country at war, but is never given credit for that service. It is striking that he explains that the chains of prison aren't medals but represent bad mistakes after his nephew asks why he isn't wearing chains. This innocence and respect for morality sets him apart from the other inmates from the start.There are several other strange and almost startling things about Luke. For one, though he knows what terrible hands he's been dealt, he fully uses that nothing hand, making it a 'cool' hand and smiling as if in spite of his own fate. And the truly miraculous result of this is that it works. Using nothing beside a courageous unwillingness to give in and a joy unspeakable Luke beats Dragline in a fistfight, wins a poker game, eats fifty eggs, and escapes prison three times. Through all this Luke teaches the others (and us) about real freedom, real hope, and real courage. Freedom that comes like a breathe of fresh air when you are least free, hope like a fiery lighthouse when things are most hopeless, and courage like a rock no matter how bad the odds. And how does he do this? Though the movie doesn't admit it, its obvious that the real key is humility, or as Luke puts it 'nothing.' Luke takes himself lightly and that is the secret to his success midst suffering. Life will always give us nothing, but humility will give us the power to both recognize and use that nothing to its full potential.It is clear that the presence of Luke both physically and in spirit (the magazine) is an enormous comfort and inspiration to the prisoners. But they take this for granted and bask in Luke's glory while continuing to let him suffer at the hands of the bosses. I may be misinterpreting Luke's character, but I think there is a real compassion in Luke for the inmates that transcends mere camaraderie, he is angry at them for 'feeding off him' because he sees them simply using his sense of freedom, hope, and courage instead developing their own, and not living out the sheer independence that he embodies and suffers for.But besides the story between Luke and the other inmates, there exists the story - or more accurately the battle - between Luke and the bosses. It is a battle that he fights on his own and that he freely admits that he lost. The bosses did break him as he fell into the grave he had dug himself, moaning his apology and declaring allegiance to the bosses and the God which he had once mocked. But that is not the end, if it were than we would be back where we started. In a prison with no respite from the powerful justice of authority. Luke rises again, he escapes, a final triumphant miracle.But Luke knows that life outside is little different from that within the prison, that no matter where he is he will be dealt his hand of nothing. He brings his conflict to the God the bosses finally forced him to believe in - he prays, asking in extreme humility what the purpose and meaning of his life is. The lack of response prompts Luke to reinforce what he'd always found true - 'he'd have to find his own way.' Or in other words, he'd have to be his own God. But God does answer. Dragline enters with the bosses right behind him. And that's when Luke realizes the purpose of his life, what he was meant for, and what he was meant to do. As a fellow prisoner he could never really help the others, but as a martyred hero he could inspire them to find their own hope, freedom, and courage through humility. And even more than that, work out a communication with the bosses that is no longer a failure,that there can be peace between inmates and the Captain, between us and God.This may be a bit of a stretch, but I think Dragline is the first to latch on to the lasting significance of what Luke did. It is Luke which gave him the opportunity to shatter the guard's mirror glasses so that he would no longer see himself in those judgmental lenses, but the eyes of the judge; and though it is physically impossible, I sincerely believe those eyes were actually the eyes of Luke, looking in defiant grace and mercy at Dragline. That is when he realized just how much Luke was indeed a world shaker - that he shook even the guards to the point of acceptance. That God at heart has the independent spirit of Luke. Or maybe that Luke was right when he called on God to find he was talking to himself. That may come as a shock, but no more shocking than a 2000-year-old carpenter who also shook the world.

It's pretty much comprised of scenes of soldiers ducking in the grass, quivering, throwing a grenade, getting picked off, yada yada yada. In the end, I don't find it especially profound, as gripping as it no doubt is at times (almost the entire first hour of the film depicts the taking of one hill, and it's every bit as nerve-wracking as the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan). Acting honors belong to Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson and Sean Penn. Acting dishonors belong solely to Jim Caviezel, whom I still hate. What a damn bore that guy is, and his subsequent role as Jesus makes several of his scenes unintentionally humorous. The appearances of John Cusack, John Travolta and George Clooney are distracting, even if none of them are particularly bad in their roles. So, the big question SPR or TRL? I'd actually go with SPR. Sure, the bookend sequences are absolutely awful and insulting, but Spielberg does construct a handful of sequences which are the very definition of taut, gripping cinema (obviously the D-Day sequence, but also the sniper sequence where Vin Diesel bites it and Jeremy Davies' big sequence at the end, among a few others). As for the Academy Awards, I think, despite the fact that they were bought off, Shakespeare in Love deserved the big award. Although, who knows, perhaps that would suck on re-watch (haven't seen it for over a decade, either, though I've seen it at least once since I saw it in the theater). Perhaps I should give it another go.

I didn't think much of it, but I liked it enough to check out his other two films, and liked them both a lot. And his subsequent two films have been fantastic. So I assumed I was probably wrong about this one. Well, I did like it more the second time around. Unfortunately, I still don't think it's a great film, and I probably agree with my assessment that this is his least good work. It is a very beautiful film, but, really, what exactly is it saying that is that much different from what any other WWII movie was saying, including its chief rival, Saving Private Ryan (which I also reassessed as a little better than I had originally thought about seven or eight months ago)? It's pretty much comprised of scenes of soldiers ducking in the grass, quivering, throwing a grenade, getting picked off, yada yada yada. In the end, I don't find it especially profound, as gripping as it no doubt is at times (almost the entire first hour of the film depicts the taking of one hill, and it's every bit as nerve-wracking as the D-Day sequence of Saving Private Ryan). Acting honors belong to Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, Woody Harrelson and Sean Penn. Acting dishonors belong solely to Jim Caviezel, whom I still hate.

I THINK that I must have heard about this film before, but, honestly, I'm just not sure! If I had heard the name before, I probably thought it was the typical 80s teen comedy cheesy sex romp that came out in droves in that decade.On the surface, the movie reminds one of Friday the 13th simply due to the camp, summertime setting, but after I saw it recently the film Psycho came immediately into my mind! This movie isn't the standard slasher-vengeance flick like most slasher movies of the 80s (and now!). It has strong psychological underpinnings. There are some genuinely disturbing scenes in this movie!The central character is Angela (played impressively by a then 13-year old Felissa Rose), an extremely shy and lonely teen who goes off to camp with her cousin Ricky (played with a lot of spunk by then teen Jonathan Tiersten). Angela was raised by her aunt, Ricky's mom, after Angela's father and brother were killed 8 years earlier in a tragic boat accident (a rather disturbing scene shown at the film's start), which has obviously traumatized Angela all these years.At camp, Angela gets bullied by several kids, especially the girls, including one of the camp counselors Meg (played with confident malice by Katharine Kahmi) and fellow camper Judy (an over-the-top, yet funny Karen Fields). Other than her protective cousin Ricky, the only bright spot for Angela is when she meets and connects with the boy camper Paul (played with stalwart appeal by 80s teen star Christopher Collett). Angela actually opens up to Paul amidst all the bullying and loneliness.Of course, the overt plot of the flick is that several killings occur. Early on, they just seem like freak accidents to the camp director Mel (veteran actor Mike Kellin in a rather thankless role). It's a bit of a stretch to believe that after a couple of kids dying, they would actually let camp continue! But, they actually do seem like accidents. Then the movie moves into full blown slasher territory in the last half hour with several of the main characters getting killed off one by one in very creative ways. I actually found the killings and maimings in this movie to be kind of disturbing simply because they weren't the typical stuff you see in the Jason\/Freddie\/Mike Myers oeuvre where theirs a bunch of slashing with sharp objects. Also, the killings aren't done to elicit cheap laughs or puns at all, as you typically get in many cheesy slasher films. They are MEANT to be disturbing! The ending is the big shocker and explains this film's lasting popularity.It's kind of obvious that the movie was made on the cheap, but at the same time, it's not the most amateurish looking low budget film I've ever seen. It actually attempts genuine character interaction. Some of the dialogue is actually pretty funny and comes naturally. Plus, there are some sly moments that hint at the themes of the film. And the main young actors playing Angela, Ricky, Meg, Judy, and Paul really do a good job given what they have to work with. Ironically, the only adult actor to leave an impression is Desiree Gould, who plays Ricky's mom and Angela's aunt; this character is EXTREMELY odd; she bookends the movie and the ending explains in part her behavior.Although there are obvious elements of several other famous horror movies at play here (Carrie, Psycho, Friday the 13th), the movie definitely has it's own identity that doesn't make it some cheap knockoff. I'm not usually big on criticizing datedness, but the movie is so 70s-looking that it does kind of detract from it, and the script is fairly standard fare, not to mention a few too many cliché characters; I found those jerkish male bullies to be kind of useless to the plot, in particular.

The film centers around 13-year-old Dani (Reese Witherspoon) who falls in love with her 17-year-old neighbor Court (Jason London) but soon he finds himself falling for Dani's older sister (Emily Warfield). While this isn't the first coming-of-age film to deal with some sort of love triangle, I do feel it's one of the best due in large part to a very tender story and the masterful direction by Mulligan. The screenplay certainly isn't 100% original and there were so many moments where the film could have fallen flat on its face but Mulligan's direction handles everything so perfectly that you can feel and believe everything you're seeing. I won't give away the ending but so many movies would have tried the same thing and I'd say that the over whelming majority of them would have failed. You could say it would be a miracle to make the ending work but the miracle is this movie and it pulls it off in such a loving way that you can't help but sit through the end credits and really soak in everything you've seen. The screenplay does a terrific job at showing love through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl who feels she's just starting to get life and yet she doesn't realize all the mean tricks it can throw at you. The movie does a marvelous job at getting the setting just right and an even better job because the thing plays out like a poem that doesn't hit a wrong note. Another factor that really brings the story to life are the wonderful performances, which are some of the best you're going to see. Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are perfect as the parents who find themselves dealing with their girls growing up.

Warfield is so soft in the picture that you really can't help but fall in love with her. As terrific as everyone is there's no question that the movie belongs to Witherspoon in the film that would really launch her and separate her from so many of the young actresses at the time. Witherspoon really owns this character and makes her one of the most memorable young female roles in recent memory. There's no doubt that once you see this film you're not going to forget this character and the young actress has to go through a lot of emotions and various ranges and yet she pulls all of them off perfectly. The chemistry between her and London is so great that you have no problem feeling and understanding what they're going through.

In short, the screenplay effectively anticipates many later themes of that popular sci-fi decade. Consider Putnam's (Carlson) paranoia when nobody believes what he knows to be true, much like Miles' (McCarthy) difficulties in Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956); or, the hideous alien monster like so many Z-grade specials of that drive-in decade; or the remote desert setting also like so many of these specials, especially director Arnold's. In fact, the more I think about it, the parallels with Body Snatchers are striking, including Ellen's (Becky's too) sudden transformation captured in jarring close-up.However, here, it's really humans who are dangerous&#x97;the aliens simply want to repair their ship and leave, but are canny enough to know how humans typically react to the ugly and unfamiliar. It's an unusually thoughtful plot twist. On the other hand, the effect of those subjective shots through the alien's bleary eye is probably lost without the 3-D depth. Now it just seems cheesy in an otherwise superior film.

Also, I like the astute staging (e.g. Frank and George in sinister shadow), even though Arnold has to work with a rather obvious exterior set for the desert encounters. Then too, the cast is excellent. Carlson is outstanding as the embattled astronomer, while the lovely Rush is actually menacing in those skyline close-ups.I don't know if this early 50's entry manages to make the front rank of period sci-fi, but all in all, it's darn close.

The first thing they steal is the supreme beings map of time portals allowing them to time travel and well become time bandits. From there the movie is a mythical adventure partly based on historical figures and partly based on fairy tales.

Was it to get industry respect? I didn't think so. Was it for financial reasons? Who knows. Or was it just to see if he could pull it off? Whatever the reason and apart from my own bewilderment I was entertained by 'Wolf'. It is a good example of what an established director with access to big stars and studio money can do with a genre that is more used to one time directors, young and enthusiastic but amateur crews, and casts that, well, maybe nobody has ever heard of before. I think the film's success owes itself to an excellent script by Wesley Strick and James Harrison, firmly rooted in a specific time and place, that is present day New York City. The supernatural, when it occurs, is therefore not difficult for the audience to believe, as if the characters may be wishing for it in order to have some respite from their painful and monotonous lives in the everyday world. Jack Nicholson plays Will Randall, a publishing executive reaching middle age. Due to a company takeover, he is coming to accept the fact that his services may no longer be required by his new boss, a millionaire media mogul (played by Christopher Plummer). On a lonely stretch of road at night, with his car broken down Will is attacked by a wolf and bitten. This is the opening scene of the film and on the cinema screen it looks spectacular. The night photography is beautiful and the actual attack made me literally jump out of my seat. Will gains a new lease of life; he feels physically and mentally stronger; his hearing and sight become acute. He no longer accepts being thrown onto the scrap heap by his new boss and decides, after a fashion, to fight back. Romance comes his way in the form of Plummer's daughter Laura, (Michelle Pfeiffer) a sad, rich and attractive girl who finds it in her heart to nurse him as he turns into something that is no longer human. Will's plight is not that he will lose his humanity, but that he will regain his primeval need for survival in the corporate world of American business. This is not that he should survive the concrete jungle but that he save his own soul and reach a better understanding of God and the qualities that make him a unique human being. The work by Italian cinematographer Vittorio Storraro, and a distinctive soundtrack by Ennio Morricone both make their presence felt as background to the chemistry between Nicholson and Pfeiffer. Their respective emotional dilemmas as individuals are contrasted with the dreary presence of Plummer, one of those people with a great amount of savvy in business but a character who represents our collectively repressed imaginations. He is stiff, unyielding and unable to show any love for his daughter A pivotal scene where Will scares a horse with a cigar which Plummer has offered him and which he smokes, shows Plummer to be in possession of his faculties but sadly ignorant of the natural world around him. To say any more would be to give the plot away. I found 'Wolf' to be a strangely poetic experience. It's not horror of the in-your-face variety. I would call it 'intellectual' horror as I suspect it was made for the chattering classes rather than the gorehounds in an attempt to make the genre more respectable. Nevertheless it's a good film and will appeal to those who love horror movies as well as those who like to think their tastes are more discriminating.

Never had a movie plunged me in such a unique atmosphere, and never will another film do. I respectfully salute one of the greatest cinematic creations, and I use the word 'creation' as this is one of a fistful of films that cannot be categorized. And this is the true cinematic accomplishment of Fargo, while many acclaimed films relied on homage to other classics, the Coen brothers made a masterpiece out of nowhere, out of the middle of nowhere, only drawn from their memories, a vast territory unfairly snubbed by cinema, somewhere in Minesotta.We're not in New York City, in Los Angeles, in the Death Valley, this is Paul Bunyan's territory, a flat region with a Siberian kind of winter that paints the landscape in such a blinding whiteness you can hardly see when the land stops and where the sky begins. It's a place that is unfamiliar, almost exotic to us, efficiently providing a memorable cinematic escapism. But the setting is not Fargo's only signature, the greatest strength of the masterpiece relies on the characterization, which comes part from the script, and part from the acting. In fact, when you keep the cinematography in mind, you realize that Fargo is one of these jewels where everything immediately penetrates your memories. That's why Fargo was rightfully regarded as a classic almost as soon as it was released.The characterization is what gives Fargo its color, its touch of authenticity. It's a movie dedicated to the spine of America, lost between two coasts. The film made me wonder why this particular place has rarely been used in films and I guess part of the answer comes from the film itself. These are towns where politeness and simplicity are significant aspects of the culture, Minnesota Nice as they say. In the film, even the smallest characters welcome you with a shining smile compensating the sunless sky. They all are polite and hardly let a F' word slip from their tongue, even hostility is hidden behind politeness. This is the austere, simple but respectable culture of the habitants, mostly descendants from Scandinavian emigrants as it's implied by the consonance of their names, Lundergaard, Gustafson, Gunderson, Grimsrud, and that heavy accent, these Yeah that sound like Yah. The accents are the music that accompanies the rhythm of the film in an odd but so appealing way. The limit between authenticity and caricature is very thin, but it works because the laughs are never aimed at people, but at the situations they're going through.And speaking of situations, the setting is quite ironic as if it's specifically in these areas where violence is repressed, that it has to explode in the most vicious way. The movie is supposed to be based on a true story, but we all know it's more a kaleidoscope of the craziest and most memorable situations that impacted the Coen brothers, the debate is pointless anyway because the movie still invites us to contemplate one of the most pointless and tragic criminal affairs, initiated by Jerry Lundergaard, the Executives Sales Manager of a car company. William H. Macy portrays with perfection one of the biggest cinematic schmucks ever, a man so in need of money, he'll elaborate an incredibly stupid scheme by asking two criminals to kidnap his own wife, so he can get the money from his ruthless father-in-law. The two men are Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, their relationship is driven by the talkative and stoic-guy-who- hardly-speaks classic but efficient dynamic. How these guys could work together is mystery, but they must have their reasons. Anyway, from the first minutes of the film, the mission is marked by the sign of incompetence. Whatever Lundergaard tries, he fails miserably, whatever he touches is doomed, yet he never gives up. The movie disturbingly oscillates between laughs and shocks, but both are used spontaneously it never feels forced, and helps to assimilate the absurdity of what is happening.But the movie could have never been praised with such enthusiasm had it focused the story on Lundergaard, Showalter or Stomare. The genius of the Coen brothers is the creation of Marge Gunderson, one of these impacting and memorable characters like only Cinema can provide. Her seven-month pregnancy gives a nice touch as it helps to root for a woman carrying life while investigating a horrific case of brutal murder, and makes so authentic and touching the famous moment where she feels nauseous, while watching corpses &#x85; just because of morning sickness. But she's not only a good and sweet woman, she's also very competent. She's the heart of the film, and her investigation is the Shakespearian journey into the world of simple people in their everyday lives with their flaws, their secrets, their kindness and sometimes their lies. Marge's sweetness probably relies on the perfect solidity of her marriage. She and her loving husband, Norm, exudes love and harmony that compensate the overall cynical tone of the film, a way of showing that these simple people, overly smiling, are authentic and admirable in their simplicity, and at least, they're happy the way they are. This austere simplicity is beautifully conveyed by the nostalgic and emotional score of the film that I immediately associate with this world of simple people, profoundly attached to their roots, and who have in their hearts the warmth lacking outside.Fargo is an original, inventive, beautifully written, film inhabited by a poetry that leaves you stunned at the end. And I'd like to thank Roger Ebert, as the one, who convinced me, from his ecstatic review to give the movie a second chance. I'm afraid to admit, that I didn't like Fargo in the beginning, but it takes one second viewing to get the genius of the film. You betcha!

The limit between authenticity and caricature is very thin, but it works because the laughs are never aimed at people, but at the situations they're going through.And speaking of situations, the setting is quite ironic as if it's specifically in these areas where violence is repressed, that it has to explode in the most vicious way. The movie is supposed to be based on a true story, but we all know it's more a kaleidoscope of the craziest and most memorable situations that impacted the Coen brothers, the debate is pointless anyway because the movie still invites us to contemplate one of the most pointless and tragic criminal affairs, initiated by Jerry Lundergaard, the Executives Sales Manager of a car company. William H. Macy portrays with perfection one of the biggest cinematic schmucks ever, a man so in need of money, he'll elaborate an incredibly stupid scheme by asking two criminals to kidnap his own wife, so he can get the money from his ruthless father-in-law. The two men are Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, their relationship is driven by the talkative and stoic-guy-who- hardly-speaks classic but efficient dynamic. How these guys could work together is mystery, but they must have their reasons. Anyway, from the first minutes of the film, the mission is marked by the sign of incompetence. Whatever Lundergaard tries, he fails miserably, whatever he touches is doomed, yet he never gives up. The movie disturbingly oscillates between laughs and shocks, but both are used spontaneously it never feels forced, and helps to assimilate the absurdity of what is happening.But the movie could have never been praised with such enthusiasm had it focused the story on Lundergaard, Showalter or Stomare. The genius of the Coen brothers is the creation of Marge Gunderson, one of these impacting and memorable characters like only Cinema can provide. Her seven-month pregnancy gives a nice touch as it helps to root for a woman carrying life while investigating a horrific case of brutal murder, and makes so authentic and touching the famous moment where she feels nauseous, while watching corpses &#x85; just because of morning sickness. But she's not only a good and sweet woman, she's also very competent. She's the heart of the film, and her investigation is the Shakespearian journey into the world of simple people in their everyday lives with their flaws, their secrets, their kindness and sometimes their lies. Marge's sweetness probably relies on the perfect solidity of her marriage. She and her loving husband, Norm, exudes love and harmony that compensate the overall cynical tone of the film, a way of showing that these simple people, overly smiling, are authentic and admirable in their simplicity, and at least, they're happy the way they are. This austere simplicity is beautifully conveyed by the nostalgic and emotional score of the film that I immediately associate with this world of simple people, profoundly attached to their roots, and who have in their hearts the warmth lacking outside.Fargo is an original, inventive, beautifully written, film inhabited by a poetry that leaves you stunned at the end. And I'd like to thank Roger Ebert, as the one, who convinced me, from his ecstatic review to give the movie a second chance. I'm afraid to admit, that I didn't like Fargo in the beginning, but it takes one second viewing to get the genius of the film. You betcha!

Never had a movie plunged me in such a unique atmosphere, and never will another film do. I respectfully salute one of the greatest cinematic creations, and I use the word 'creation' as this is one of a fistful of films that cannot be categorized. And this is the true cinematic accomplishment of Fargo, while many acclaimed films relied on homage to other classics, the Coen brothers made a masterpiece out of nowhere, out of the middle of nowhere, only drawn from their memories, a vast territory unfairly snubbed by cinema, somewhere in Minesotta.We're not in New York City, in Los Angeles, in the Death Valley, this is Paul Bunyan's territory, a flat region with a Siberian kind of winter that paints the landscape in such a blinding whiteness you can hardly see when the land stops and where the sky begins. It's a place that is unfamiliar, almost exotic to us, efficiently providing a memorable cinematic escapism. But the setting is not Fargo's only signature, the greatest strength of the masterpiece relies on the characterization, which comes part from the script, and part from the acting. In fact, when you keep the cinematography in mind, you realize that Fargo is one of these jewels where everything immediately penetrates your memories. That's why Fargo was rightfully regarded as a classic almost as soon as it was released.The characterization is what gives Fargo its color, its touch of authenticity. It's a movie dedicated to the spine of America, lost between two coasts. The film made me wonder why this particular place has rarely been used in films and I guess part of the answer comes from the film itself. These are towns where politeness and simplicity are significant aspects of the culture, Minnesota Nice as they say. In the film, even the smallest characters welcome you with a shining smile compensating the sunless sky. They all are polite and hardly let a F' word slip from their tongue, even hostility is hidden behind politeness. This is the austere, simple but respectable culture of the habitants, mostly descendants from Scandinavian emigrants as it's implied by the consonance of their names, Lundergaard, Gustafson, Gunderson, Grimsrud, and that heavy accent, these Yeah that sound like Yah.
