But the material given to the masses is just plain poor.Four days from now my nation, the United States of America, will once again ponder briefly that December 7th some sixty-years ago, when my parents and their parents were witness to the times that shook this nation to its very foundation, and was met with the traditional strategy of war conceived and execute by Imperial Japan's military elite.Why some of the big names in film reviews have given this film a pass is beyond me. It truly is. Those people, Americans even, seem to miss the point; the event portrayed in this film IS the drama that takes place. So what exactly happened? Let's start with the historical material.Japan's expansionism to create is Economic Prosperity Sphere by trying to thrust its jingoism on East Asia as a whole, has brought the eyes of the world upon it. It's military adventures into Korea and China have seen some of the most horrid atrocities perpetrated by soldiers on common citizens since Ghengis Kahn. I remember hearing an interview with a former Japanese soldier who was in China during Japan's occupation of the coast. He tells of how he and his comrades bayoneted a screaming baby, and tossed it on a fire and laughed. It made me sick. The sexual enslavement of Korean women, the wanton brutalization of a people by a foreign power has nary been equaled since the age of the Roman Empire.But, for all this, the United States did not go to war with Japan. Nations go to war only when their interests are threatened. So it was that Japan saw US sanctions (largely an oil embargo against Japan) as retribution for their actions in China, which is exactly what that sanction was all about. The solution, seek out a new source of oil in the South East Pacific.Ah, but the American fleet is stationed at Hawaii, and can deploy to the Philippines at a moment's notice. In fact, said fleet is seen as a dagger (or samurai sword) pointed straight at Japan. Solution; execute what the Pentagon would call in Cold War parlance as the pre- emptive-first-strike-initiative; i.e. attack the forces at Hawaii, specifically take out the carriers to deny naval aviation assets, then seize the oil in the south east pacific, and fortify so that when the American's rebuild their carrier forces you'll be ready for them.This plan, of course, hinges all upon sinking (or putting out of commission) the US Navy carrier task forces. It was not to be, and the Japanese lost by winning the first battle of Pacific Theatre. Or rather, not wining it as they had hoped and needed to win.The drama we see unfold in the film is the drama of international relations. It's the story of how tiny cogs in a giant clockwork are relevant on all levels. One could call the exposition in this film The Application of the 'Butterfly Effect' in the Second World War, for we see how small seemingly insignificant actions taken and not taken by various actors resound throughout the film, and tally to the ultimate and final climax.Cinematically this film is outstanding. Not a singly shot is wasted. Some of the SFX may look a little poor here and there, but beyond some minor split screen work and a few models for the Japanese Navy, everything else IS REAL. The stunt work in this film is insane. It is outrageously stunning to see stunt men get close to pyrotechnics the way these guys did. Or to see stunt pilot fly a few feet off the ground as they strafe some target.I missed the film in the theatre, but saw it every time it hit the airwaves; specifically on December 7th, usually on KTVU Channel 2 in the San Francisco Bay Area.The acting is outstanding. Not overstated, but dramatic where needed. The actors hit their marks superbly. I think Jason Robarts flubs a line with the STIVIL population instead of the civil population, but you hardly notice it. In fact, maybe he meant to say that... sort of him channeling a real human speech flaw from the former Army chief at Hawaii. There are many a familiar face in this drama, and some not so familiar, but who would become well known.This is not a guy film. I mean, it is, but only in the sense that it's men who are leading and taking part in the action. This is a time of men, and how their decisions and actions will effect the world for the next one-hundred years (possibly longer). Even so, I would be hard pressed to find a single woman, make that fully mature (emotionally, physically, psychologically) woman who doesn't find this film fascinating on all levels.Through all the destruction and diplomatic intercourse, you have to ask yourself, were you General George Marshal or Chief of the Army Tojo, would you have done any different in their shoes? If you were Admiral Yamamoto, would you have defied Tojo, appealed to the Emporer, or done your duty? How important is it to you that your people survive and\/or win out over another people? Because that's what this film ultimately asks the audience.Is war worth it?That's something only you can answer for yourself.Tora Tora Tora makes no pretense about answering such a weighty question, but shows the short comings and long term effects of decisions that makes a certain day forever live in infamy.

The year is 2017, thirty years in the future when the film was made in 1987. Following some unspecified apocalypse America is divided into at least two parts. In the big cities civilisation goes on much as before. The deserts of the American West, however, have become a lawless wilderness, dominated by violent gangs, similar to those in the Mad Max films, who roam the desert in cars or on motorbikes.The film does not dwell much on futuristic technology, with one exception. The central premise of the film is that, before the apocalypse, science managed to perfect humanoid robots. The main character is a young man named Sam Treadwell who owns a Stepford Wives type female robot who acts as his housekeeper and sexual partner. As these robots are programmed to have warm and affectionate personalities and never have a headache at bedtime Sam is very happy with this arrangement, until his beloved short circuits during a love-making session on his kitchen floor. This presents Sam with a problem. His lady-friend was an obsolete model, the Cherry 2000, no longer being manufactured, but he knows he will not be happy with a more modern replacement. (If the number 2000 was supposed to indicate the year in which Cherry was first manufactured, this is yet another in the long list of sci-fi predictions which have proved sadly premature- human colonies on Mars by 1987, and all that sort of thing).Sam discovers that there is a supply of Cherry 2000s in an abandoned warehouse, and decides to recover one and install the previous model's memory chip. There is, however, one further problem to be overcome. The warehouse is situated in the now lawless desert, beyond the pale of civilisation. He therefore enlists the help if Edith E Johnson, a tracker who makes a living through guiding people through the wasteland, but in order to reach the warehouse they have to avoid the attentions of Lester, the leaders of the gangsters who now control the desert. Sam also runs into his former girlfriend Elaine, now Lester's mistress, and the sort of neurotic, foul-tempered woman who could drive any man into the arms of a robotic substitute.The film is intended to be an action-adventure story, but it suffers from one fatal weakness; it stars Melanie Griffith. By playing a tough, sassy character Melanie was obviously hoping to get away from her bimbo image, but the inconvenient truth is that most of her best performances have come in films where she either plays a straightforward bimbo (as in The Bonfire of the Vanities) or a bimbo with hidden depths (as in Working Girl or Born Yesterday). Here as Edith she seems hopelessly miscast. Her normal blonde locks are hidden beneath a lurid red wig, making her look like the second cousin to a Belisha beacon, but she makes no attempt to disguise her high pitched, breathy, little-girl voice, hilariously inappropriate on the lips of a tough action heroine. She would probably have been better playing the robot Cherry, the girl with the artificial, carefully manufactured bimbo personality.There is occasionally some sharp dialogue; I liked, for example, the exchange when Elaine, told by Sam that her new boyfriend Lester is a psychopathic killer, snaps back Don't impose your values on me, Sam. (This does not, however, imply that Elaine is deeply in love with Lester; her only reaction to his death is Well, no sandwiches for him). The action sequences are not badly done, but as I pointed out when reviewing the original Mad Max there should be more to a film than the quality of its car crashes. None of the actors make much impression, other than Griffith who makes an impression for all the wrong reasons. Overall, Cherry 2000 is a rather dull bit of eighties sci-fi marred by miscasting. It is sometimes described as a cult film, but cults, whether cinematic or religious, are often mystifying to those who are not already True Believers. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"4 December 2009","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Cherry 2000 is a sort of post-apocalyptic science fiction Western, a cross between Mad Max and The Stepford Wives.

The main character is a young man named Sam Treadwell who owns a Stepford Wives type female robot who acts as his housekeeper and sexual partner. As these robots are programmed to have warm and affectionate personalities and never have a headache at bedtime Sam is very happy with this arrangement, until his beloved short circuits during a love-making session on his kitchen floor. This presents Sam with a problem. His lady-friend was an obsolete model, the Cherry 2000, no longer being manufactured, but he knows he will not be happy with a more modern replacement. (If the number 2000 was supposed to indicate the year in which Cherry was first manufactured, this is yet another in the long list of sci-fi predictions which have proved sadly premature- human colonies on Mars by 1987, and all that sort of thing).Sam discovers that there is a supply of Cherry 2000s in an abandoned warehouse, and decides to recover one and install the previous model's memory chip. There is, however, one further problem to be overcome. The warehouse is situated in the now lawless desert, beyond the pale of civilisation. He therefore enlists the help if Edith E Johnson, a tracker who makes a living through guiding people through the wasteland, but in order to reach the warehouse they have to avoid the attentions of Lester, the leaders of the gangsters who now control the desert. Sam also runs into his former girlfriend Elaine, now Lester's mistress, and the sort of neurotic, foul-tempered woman who could drive any man into the arms of a robotic substitute.The film is intended to be an action-adventure story, but it suffers from one fatal weakness; it stars Melanie Griffith. By playing a tough, sassy character Melanie was obviously hoping to get away from her bimbo image, but the inconvenient truth is that most of her best performances have come in films where she either plays a straightforward bimbo (as in The Bonfire of the Vanities) or a bimbo with hidden depths (as in Working Girl or Born Yesterday). Here as Edith she seems hopelessly miscast. Her normal blonde locks are hidden beneath a lurid red wig, making her look like the second cousin to a Belisha beacon, but she makes no attempt to disguise her high pitched, breathy, little-girl voice, hilariously inappropriate on the lips of a tough action heroine. She would probably have been better playing the robot Cherry, the girl with the artificial, carefully manufactured bimbo personality.There is occasionally some sharp dialogue; I liked, for example, the exchange when Elaine, told by Sam that her new boyfriend Lester is a psychopathic killer, snaps back Don't impose your values on me, Sam. (This does not, however, imply that Elaine is deeply in love with Lester; her only reaction to his death is Well, no sandwiches for him). The action sequences are not badly done, but as I pointed out when reviewing the original Mad Max there should be more to a film than the quality of its car crashes. None of the actors make much impression, other than Griffith who makes an impression for all the wrong reasons. Overall, Cherry 2000 is a rather dull bit of eighties sci-fi marred by miscasting. It is sometimes described as a cult film, but cults, whether cinematic or religious, are often mystifying to those who are not already True Believers. 4\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"4 December 2009","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In times of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union have competed against each other in getting their first spaceships into space,building nuclear weapons that could destroy all human kind in one day, and the battle between communism and the free enterprise system.

The various shooting angles on the US Air Force planes flying towards Russia in close up views was good. The use of dramatic lighting shined on the generals, ambassadors, and the president was clear in focus, well lit on their faces, and very dramatic sense of light that establishes the characters as important, privileged leaders that are willing to fight and prevent the war against Russia. The lighting on the pilots and the soldiers fighting outside a building were dull in their mid-tone gray contrast emphasizing the gloomy mood and their need to be the people that'll be disposed in the fight against Russia, as a result of their deadly weapons. The use of back light on the general sitting in a chair was really nice. The special effects that were used for a full-view airplane flying towards Russia made the plane feel like it was flying in the older Superman series style. The duration of the plot throughout the film dragged causing the overall mise-en-scene of the film to drag and cause the viewer to lose interest in the film.Although the screenplay dragged the plot and storyline throughout the film, the overall message was strong and to the point.
