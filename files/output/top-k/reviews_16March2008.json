The French film version with Alain Delon (Au plein soleil) was slow-moving, largely uninteresting and looked more like an over-long Roald Dahl Tale of the Unexpected, but Minghella has chosen to explain Tom Ripley and create much more sympathy for him than Highsmith could muster. And he has done so thoroughly by boosting the homosexual love angle that is more subdued in the novel and next to non-existing in the French film. By making it clear from the outset that Ripley falls in love with Dickie Greenleaf, a love that is unrequited but still partly encouraged by Dickie, everything falls into place up to the first murder, and the subsequent killings are acts of desperate self-preservation.But even more interesting is it that if we peruse the list of 20 characteristics of a psychotic compiled by Robert Hare, the leading expert on psychotic behavior, we may be surprised to find that the psycho in Minghella's film is not Tom Ripley at all, but Dickie Greenleaf.Dickie possesses superficial charm, he is self-centered to a fault, has an excessive need for stimulation and is prone to boredom, he is manipulative (when he makes love to Marge on the boat in order to avoid a row), and shows little remorse, even when Silvana, his Italian fling, commits suicide.

After viewing, I must agree with both points. Hannibal Lecter, in 'Hannibal', shows a whole new spectrum of characteristics, humor, violence, erotic desire, craving for attention, snob, some of which came forward in SOTL already but surely not all of them, at least not to a great extent. Harris was obliged to round his villain, in both Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs Lecter isn't the central character, merely a tool handled to catch another creep. This formula worked better, the few scenes where Lecter is shown are very effective truly scary and disturbing. By giving the cannibal a wealth of screen time and portraying him calmly making dinner or lazily strolling around an art gallery, the intrigue is gone and that perhaps is Harris' biggest mistake when writing the sequel under the pressure of the raving success of it's two predecessors. The almost perfect novel and film SOTL was a finished story. Sure, there were some story lines left open for intrigue reasons but there was little left to tell about Clarice Starling, who was the main character not Hannibal or Buffalo Bill, and Harris just wrote the sequel because everyone insisted (I'm sure his publisher one of them, but also the public in general). This for me, is a sufficient explanation of why the story is very different from that in the first one. 'Hannibal' is a film built around, well, Hannibal Lecter himself as the title clearly indicates. The script was left in the more than competent hands of director Ridley Scott, creator of brilliant pictures like Gladiator and Blade Runner. The script stays very true to the source material, the order of some scenes is rearranged but the gross of them is present in the novel. I was especially pleased with Mason Verger, Oldman delivers a great performance even if he is nothing more than a voice almost the entire runtime. His delivery is the perfect amount of tongue-in-cheek, the black humor and suffering also mixed in. His face wasn't as disgusting as I'd pictured it in the novel, believe it or not, but no make-up artist in the world can match the depths of one's imagination. I feel they could have done more with the exquisite locations in Florence, I wasn't very impressed with the way they chose them. The city is, as most Italian cities I've frequented, perfect for filming locations, beautiful spots all around. Instead, they chose to approach the story more soberly, letting it be a pure horror\/thriller and not something that rises above that artistically. The excess of one dimensional secondary characters is remarkable and strange, the Italian inspector, Mason Verger, Verger's physician were all very much cardboard characters, the story would've worked much better if they'd just scratched the Italian storyline out, at least make it shorter and focus more on Verger's relationship with Lecter. This, for me, would've made it much better. They set up Verger as a very intriguing character, a crippled, disturbed but incredibly wealthy man. A smörgåsbord of opportunities there, opportunities left unexplored unfortunately. The film would've also benefited from less graphic gore and more tension instead. Hannibal felt too much like a horror movie, extraordinary horror mind you, but just horror with gratuitous violence and a lot of slashing. This, to disguise, that the story isn't very thrilling or clever, at least not compared to it's prequel. Scott's 'Hannibal' also does a few things right of course, Moore is a different Clarice but she's surprisingly convincing, the bizarre relationship between Starling and Lecter is further explored which is interesting, and the production values are great as can be required of Scott.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 March 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Without meaning to sound crass, Sex and Lucia (2001) is essentially a film, both literally and figuratively, about holes. We can look at and interpret these various holes in number different ways, be it in the more obvious creation of the cavernous dents that litter the film's expressionistic landscape, or instead, as metaphorical places for the characters to hide. On top of this we also have the holes as a sexual metaphor; with the sub-textual references to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the various thematic ideologies that such a notion presents, with the central character falling into a hole and being re-born into her own story; while later in the film, the male protagonist disappears into a hole and never returns. We also have the more erotic notion of the hole, as illustrated by the holes on the beach surround the obvious, phallic-like light-house.Here however, director Julio Medem is more concerned with how these holes in both the design of the film and its structure can be used as a means of navigating the audience through his various interweaving strands of character, narrative and the potential for multiple thematic outcomes. With this in mind, Sex and Lucia becomes less of a film in the conventional sense and more of a detective story for the audience to follow; existing in the same self-reflexive, psychological realm as Medem's other great features, such as Vacas (1991), The Red Squirrel (1993) and The Lovers of the Arctic Circle (1998), which each present similar ideas pertaining to the creation of a particular character and the world in which they inhabit. With Sex and Lucia however, we have alongside this titular character a handful of secondary characters that drift in and out of the film to supply clues before disappearing without a trace. To add further elements of confusion, paradox and open-ended interpretation, Medem skilfully juggles these characters between each varying strand, culminating in several possible stories each being woven simultaneously, but all leading back to the idea of the writer and the story that he (or she) is creating.It isn't as confusing as the interpretation would suggest, with the film rewarding patient and imaginative viewers with something that could be described as anything from a grand mystery, a cinematic enigma or a multi-layered riddle, wherein the stories are given the room to weave in and out of one another, creating windows that lead into dreams and everything is in some way connected. For anyone familiar with Medem's previous work it is clear that some elements of the plot are supposed to remain indecipherable. The director wants us to go back and re-experience the film like we would a novel; each time picking up subtle nuggets of information we may have missed the first time around. It is important to remember when watching Sex and Lucia that we are dealing - as stated above - not with a single story, but with several or more stories each being spun concurrently. When we begin to look at the internal logic of the story we see the fracturing of two separate elements. To better understand the film we must look at the plot, not from the point of view of Lucia, but from the perspective of the writer, noting how each of his sub-plots come to reflect the main elements of the story.So, we have a writer submitting a book about a couple's sensual holiday and eventual one-night stand. We then have the characters from that book losing touch, getting on with their lives, discovering the existence of a baby and eventually trying to track-each other down. Then we have the writer trying to write a novel about the new woman in his life. This book has none of the tragedy of the former, instead dwelling on love and sexual elation. Unsatisfied with this, the writer then begins to draw parallels with this story and the previous one, by re-introducing characters and adding a subplot of infidelity; all of which will climax on the island where the original story began. So there we have three novels within the film each being read, written or re-interpreted and each of them coming to reflect an element of Medem's film. Throughout the film the writer relates his story to various people; at one point even explicitly mentioning the hole in the middle that leads back into the story and the central idea behind the film. It is at this point that Medem begins incorporating narrative elements from the couple's gossipy conversation on the bench, the child's bedtime story, the internet relationship, the suicide note and finally, a central character's coma-induced fantasies. There are also some wonderful examples of character doubling, coupling and mirroring between the leads, which recalls the similarly complex experiments of Jacques Rivette's Celine & Julie Go Boating (1972) and is also Buñuelian almost in its execution.Medem's stylistic touches make the film all the more deceptive; creating a wonderful, alien landscape for his characters to interact with. As well as this, we also have an exceptional use of cinematography, where the camera is always mobile circling, tracking, blocking, revealing; really becoming one with the characters and bringing us into both the fun and frivolity as well as the mystery. The editing works in as similar fashion, with Medem keeping the structure tight and rhythmic as he merrily jump cuts from one thing to the next, but always keeping the separate elements connected.

We can look at and interpret these various holes in number different ways, be it in the more obvious creation of the cavernous dents that litter the film's expressionistic landscape, or instead, as metaphorical places for the characters to hide. On top of this we also have the holes as a sexual metaphor; with the sub-textual references to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the various thematic ideologies that such a notion presents, with the central character falling into a hole and being re-born into her own story; while later in the film, the male protagonist disappears into a hole and never returns. We also have the more erotic notion of the hole, as illustrated by the holes on the beach surround the obvious, phallic-like light-house.Here however, director Julio Medem is more concerned with how these holes in both the design of the film and its structure can be used as a means of navigating the audience through his various interweaving strands of character, narrative and the potential for multiple thematic outcomes. With this in mind, Sex and Lucia becomes less of a film in the conventional sense and more of a detective story for the audience to follow; existing in the same self-reflexive, psychological realm as Medem's other great features, such as Vacas (1991), The Red Squirrel (1993) and The Lovers of the Arctic Circle (1998), which each present similar ideas pertaining to the creation of a particular character and the world in which they inhabit. With Sex and Lucia however, we have alongside this titular character a handful of secondary characters that drift in and out of the film to supply clues before disappearing without a trace. To add further elements of confusion, paradox and open-ended interpretation, Medem skilfully juggles these characters between each varying strand, culminating in several possible stories each being woven simultaneously, but all leading back to the idea of the writer and the story that he (or she) is creating.It isn't as confusing as the interpretation would suggest, with the film rewarding patient and imaginative viewers with something that could be described as anything from a grand mystery, a cinematic enigma or a multi-layered riddle, wherein the stories are given the room to weave in and out of one another, creating windows that lead into dreams and everything is in some way connected. For anyone familiar with Medem's previous work it is clear that some elements of the plot are supposed to remain indecipherable. The director wants us to go back and re-experience the film like we would a novel; each time picking up subtle nuggets of information we may have missed the first time around. It is important to remember when watching Sex and Lucia that we are dealing - as stated above - not with a single story, but with several or more stories each being spun concurrently. When we begin to look at the internal logic of the story we see the fracturing of two separate elements. To better understand the film we must look at the plot, not from the point of view of Lucia, but from the perspective of the writer, noting how each of his sub-plots come to reflect the main elements of the story.So, we have a writer submitting a book about a couple's sensual holiday and eventual one-night stand.

This splendid idea consists in doing a good deed for three people, who must (each one) in return do good deeds for three other people - in a try to make a better world. Ahhh, isn't that sweet?But this is also a very realistic movie that deals with serious and heavy subjects, such as the world, alcoholism, drugs, social studies, school, bullies, violence, people's lives, family relationships, the society and others. All of this without forgetting that the movie is a take on a cruel and selfish world.Trevor McKinney is a great little hero. He is one of the bravest and nicest kids ever put on the screen. Although only 11-12 years old, he has the maturity of an adult. He's a kid with a heart of gold. Brilliant performance by Haley Joel Osment. Even his facial expressions are brilliant, as well as the way he changes his emotions all over the movie frustrated, angry, furious, desperate, pessimist, happy, funny and in tears. Amazing! Kevin Spacey is great as the teacher Eugene Simonet. He is the one who gives the class project in social studies, which aim is to «Think of an idea to change our world and put it into action!». Spacey is so much better in a serious role like this than in most other roles he plays.Helen Hunt, while not as good as Haley and Kevin, has nevertheless a good acting as Trevor's mother.

A beautiful homage in memory of Trevor at the end. As for Thomas Newman's musics, they're so calm, relaxing and peaceful to hear. Truly a delight for the soul.The ending is very sad and shocking.

But as much as I could talk all day about how these two geniuses revolutionised cinema the main concentration of this review will be based on the 1980 movie raging bull.

It is more than just another rocky movie, it's not about a brain dead boxer who tries hard and wins it has much more deaph than that. The movie tells the story of an emotionally self destructive boxers rise (ish) And fall.

He said to me, I want you to watch this film. It's one of the greatest movies ever made. So, I did. I watched the film with my father, and I was in tears by the end -- genuine, sobbing tears. This was usually an indication, at that age, that I had liked a movie. But my father asked me anyway if I liked it. I was only able to nod my head yes. He asked me why, and my response was, I don't know. It was just so sad. How can a 12 year old express the great depth of the message and themes of a film like Citizen Kane? Especially when that greatest message of the film is so simple and universal.From the time this film was first released, it has been immortalized by the critics and panned by the people. It did not do well at the box office overall, despite the erudite, ground-breaking praise heaped upon it, and the praise overall has been about the film-making itself - the cinematography, the lighting, the performances, the unique narrative structure. As a professor of film, I teach it in all my classes. There is no way around it. As an example of film-making technique, there are few films that can compare to it on every level, but this has been talked into the ground.Film theorists, historians and movie buffs from all generations have turned Citizen Kane into the holy grail of film-making. By analyzing the complexities of the film, I believe the most simple and most powerful aspect of this film is often overshadowed, as it is very symbolically within the film &#150; the quest for true love. Not that love is ever simple. This is a film about a man who almost knew love but had it taken away from him before he could really hold on to it, and the rest of his life is spent trying to get it back. It is a tragic story of love lost (and truth be told, the greatest films are almost always about love lost or found). That has always been it's true strength to me.If you go into this film with the expectation of the greatest film ever made, then you need to understand the context of that comment. It's not just about story but about the techniques of storytelling and film-making. It means that you will be watching it, for the most part, from a distance. You will be watching it for Toland's cinematography, or Mankiewicz and Welles's parallel narrative structure, or Welles's performance par excellence. And as long as you are watching it from this perspective, you may never be able to connect to the humanity of the film. And that's okay.Or you can watch it through the eyes of a 12 year old in 1981&#133;before MTV and the internet. Simply allow all the separate techniques of film-making to come together as one, and just watch the movie. Let go of expectations...I have loved this film since I was 12 and unable to articulate why I loved it. I loved this film before I cared about cinematography and lighting, art direction and editing. I loved this film because the story of a man searching for love spoke to me, even at 12.God, I love this film!

He said to me, I want you to watch this film. It's one of the greatest movies ever made. So, I did. I watched the film with my father, and I was in tears by the end -- genuine, sobbing tears. This was usually an indication, at that age, that I had liked a movie. But my father asked me anyway if I liked it. I was only able to nod my head yes. He asked me why, and my response was, I don't know. It was just so sad. How can a 12 year old express the great depth of the message and themes of a film like Citizen Kane? Especially when that greatest message of the film is so simple and universal.From the time this film was first released, it has been immortalized by the critics and panned by the people. It did not do well at the box office overall, despite the erudite, ground-breaking praise heaped upon it, and the praise overall has been about the film-making itself - the cinematography, the lighting, the performances, the unique narrative structure. As a professor of film, I teach it in all my classes. There is no way around it. As an example of film-making technique, there are few films that can compare to it on every level, but this has been talked into the ground.Film theorists, historians and movie buffs from all generations have turned Citizen Kane into the holy grail of film-making. By analyzing the complexities of the film, I believe the most simple and most powerful aspect of this film is often overshadowed, as it is very symbolically within the film &#150; the quest for true love. Not that love is ever simple. This is a film about a man who almost knew love but had it taken away from him before he could really hold on to it, and the rest of his life is spent trying to get it back. It is a tragic story of love lost (and truth be told, the greatest films are almost always about love lost or found). That has always been it's true strength to me.If you go into this film with the expectation of the greatest film ever made, then you need to understand the context of that comment. It's not just about story but about the techniques of storytelling and film-making. It means that you will be watching it, for the most part, from a distance.

Decades later, the film still feels fresh, has lost none of its charm and is a pleasure to watch.After the opening credits (accompanied by some appealing theme music), we are introduced to Claudette Colbert's character of Ellie Andrews. She has locked herself in her room on a boat which belongs to her over-bearing father. He is threatening to annul her very recent marriage to 'King' Westley because he disapproves of him. After an argument develops, she jumps ship and swims for the shore, with the intent of going straight to New York to meet up with her new husband. While taking a bus trip to reach her destination, she encounters Peter Warne (played by Clark Gable), a newspaper reporter who eventually recognises her after seeing a front page story of her as a runaway. After he threatens to turn her in unless she stays with him in order to give him headline news, she reluctantly makes the cross country trip with him. Things don't always go to plan, which allow some humorous scenes, and there is an attraction that develops between the two. The question then, is who will she end up with by the time the film ends?This is a film which deserves its status. Not only is it a wonderful, feel-good movie, it is great in all aspects of cinema, and has hardly dated a bit. The films energy and performances from all the cast keep the film from feeling stale, even after more than 70 years. The script is cleverly written with some truly laugh-out-loud moments. What makes this film even more remarkable, is the fact that few people involved in it, with the exception of Frank Capra, had much faith in it. Even the stars of the film, particularly Claudette Colbert, were unenthusiastic to say the least. Thankfully though, the film turned out incredibly well.'It Happened One Night' also has a place in cinematic history for being the first film to win all 5 Oscars in the main categories, an achievement that was not equalled until 1975's 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest'. Some viewers today remark at how unlikely it would be for a romantic comedy these days to receive such an honour. That being said, it's not a film that is going to be forgotten any time soon, and it certainly should be seen.

At 109 minutes, that's well over half-way. Certainly the point was to pop our main character, Rollie Tyler (reprised by Bryan Brown from the first movie), into a life and death situation beyond his comprehension, and not until several clues are followed revealed that he (and we) find out what these circumstances are.Briefly, Rollie, the Australian special effects wizard, is hired again by the FBI to aid in cornering a serial killer. However, the plan goes awry when the FBI man who was supposed to stop the suspect in his tracks is killed by another unknown killer. Rollie finds himself also caught in a web of intrigue. And of course, when he is on the verge of getting snuffed out, Dennehy as Leo McCarthy pops in to save his ass. Not a bad opening, all things considered.Finally, Leo uncovers the back story, which I won't reveal, lest I be accused of giving it away as they say. However, the back story is described almost offhandedly, without even a flashback. Unfortunately, the downside is that, with very little screen time left, neither the history of what's behind the bad guys' motivations nor the bad guys themselves are ever fully developed. I found myself wanting to know more about the circumstances surrounding this back story, the what and the why. Of course, with these kinds of movies, a lot of screen time must be devoted to the baddies chasing the innocent by-standers in shopping malls or in car chases. I guess it's a Hollywood law that American filmmakers must devote a specified minimum amount of time to choreographed running around and shooting so they can legitimately call their project an action movie.Still the film has its entertainment value. There is a strange chemistry that exists between Brian Dennehy (reprising his role has Leo McCarthy) and Bryan Brown, and again I wish that had been milked for all its worth. Of course, the most entertaining sequence, like the first installment, is the use of movie effects to thwart the bad guys, which works very well. Maybe I appreciated it as a breath of fresh air from the typical cat and mouse chase with automatic weapons that typically climaxes most of these kinds of films.Still very much in the style of a 1980's action movie, although this was 1991, with the typical rock songs spliced in for good measure. With the exception of the use of the special effects against the baddies at the finale, story-wise it is really the equivalent of a two-part episode of Simon and Simon with a larger budget.

Still, it is a terrific movie. Shirley Valentine is a beautiful, witty, and aging woman who starts to wear from her tiresome and dull life in Manchester, England. However, she doesn't brow beat or turn herself into an us against the world person like most Hollywood actors and actresses do in their characters. Shirley Valentine has flaws and she can poke fun of others in a funny, sensitive way. She loves her husband, but he has become a terrible bore. Her daughter is spoiled. Her neighbor is too prying. Her son is a dreamer.There are flashbacks throughout her life that are hysterical. She remembers in school that she hated this one prissy girl. She hates the class prejudice at the school that condemns her as a dimwit and troublemaker, when she knows that she is better than that. She finally runs into the prissy girl, whom she was so jealous of, and is surprised that she has become a high-class call girl, and secretly admired her for being a person who didn't just take things as they were.She has a feminist friend who invites her along to Greece on holiday, only to prove that she is a fickle ist.

Brazil is nothing like the country and part of the reason it is named thus is because of the desirable nature of many who want to go the South American nation. Gilliam is intelligent in giving Brazil a dark claustrophobic look as this is not a light story, but one filled with conflicts that Lowry must overcome in order to find his dream girl and leave his paperwork-obsessed world forever. More obvious is the use of the famous Ary Barroso song used in the film's soundtrack. Considered an un-official national anthem of the country, the jumpy tune is the lightest aspect of Brazil, which works in contrast to the so-called utopia society. Thus, the audience plays into Gilliam's hand of wanting Lowry to escape. He intelligently withholds, but unlike Universal's ill-tempered boss, we're smart enough to realise just how necessary this is. Brazil's inability to go to the Bright Side of Life is part of why it is such a marvelous piece of work.The chaos in Brazil begins when the ultimate attempt at perfection leads to a little typo. This tiny mistake leads to an innocent father getting arrested, a neighbour trying to get him out of the government's hold and a lowly government worker chasing after her. Terry Gilliam, an American who spent years in Great Britain with the Monty Python comedy troupe, uses his use of images and subtle nods to poke fun at the bureaucrats who rely on paperwork to try to keep everything ship-shape. There is also a sense of secrecy in the proceedings, particularly in Michael Palin's character, Jack. Throughout the film, we share Lowry's perspective that Jack is a good man, yet once his true job description is revealed, the audience is just as surprised as Lowry is. Part of this is not only through Palin's double-edged performance, but Jonathan Pryce's work as well. Pryce takes on the role of Lowry almost similar to how the most famous American everyman would have. From his stammering dialogue to the wardrobe, there's a hint of James Stewart coming from his performance. There's an honest appearance to him that sets him apart from the dark world around him as well as the humour around him. When he was with Monty Python, Gilliam's comedy writing was mostly used for his animated shorts, but with Brazil, he became in command with most of the screenplay, creating a very humorous world. This makes the commentary on the dystopia of Brazil have a rather fun angle to it as well. The pains of ordering a simple stake, the quest for the perfect face and the government's obsession with paper-work are taken on through not only serious prodding, but humorous pokes as well.Terry Gilliam, like Tim Burton, has always a director with visual flair. Even when his films are less than average, his visual prowess allows them to be slightly more enjoyable. It is not surprising that his best film would feature some of his most accomplished visual look to date. From the look of the high-rises to the coldness of the government buildings to the duct-filled apartments, Brazil features some of the most stunning art direction seen in any film. Brazil was largely inspired by George Orwell's 1984, yet Gilliam creates a world that the author probably never imagined. The sets in the film were probably even more influenced by the work of Georges Méliès than the writings of Orwell. Gilliam's animation style may be considered third-rate, but his visual effects are anything but. They are so well done that it is hard to figure out whether they were done on computers, stop-motion or puppetry. In fact, the realism of the special effects allows the viewer to be whisked easier into Lowry's dreams.Along with Pryce and Palin, the rest of the cast succeeds in domineering their characters very well and understand that's Lowry's story. This class of highly accomplished actors know not to go over-board and bring the right level of humour and terror to their roles. Robert De Niro has a small, but important role that further alters Lowry's quest. Along with Lowry, he's the hero of the story and the calmness of De Niro combines well with the quick-witted work ethics of the character. Bob Hoskins takes on a more menacing role than he is known for, yet his sinister and almost scary tone creates Lowry's most memorable obstacle. And then there's Kim Greist, the main object of desire. What could have been a stereotypical female lead, Greist turns into a three-dimensional character that is the most cunning of the whole film. In fact, one wonders just how much she matches Lowry's dream girl. While, in that film, he does to save her and she cannot seem to get out of a situation, the real Jill is actually able to fend for herself in the tough world outside and is a more brave personality than Lowry. In the dreaded Love Conquers All version of Brazil, Lowry has a happy ending with Jill. Yet, it is a more open ending than the Director's Cut, because their relationship could turn tired as Lowry might realise that she is not how he pictured her. It brings to mind whether humming to Brazil is more satisfying, which makes Sid Sheinberg's mind seem even more warped.In the end, Terry Gilliam's preferred vision to the best edition of Brazil and it certainly is a marvelous adventure. The humour and the social commentary, mixed with one of the most electrifying casts seen in a science-fiction comedy to date. Visually impressed and featured one of the greatest songs ever produced, Brazil is an entertaining fantasy that tells as much about modern society as it was in 1985.

La pianiste is a depressing and slow movie which is focusing on the incredibly played main actor Isabelle Huppert in the role of a piano teacher Erika. From the beginning you know something is not quite right with this woman that still lives with her mother (and even sleeps in the same room to fall asleep with her bragging) and goes out on nighly journeys that are quite the opposite to her daily routine life teaching piano and being obsessed with Schubert.We soon learn that she harbors a lot of frustration that is released on her students who not just once leave the lesson crying and sexual tension that she releases on her nighly journeys. But as if her visits in porn cabins sniffing used tissues or watching couples in car cinemas isn't enough soon a young man steps into her otherwise empty life who admires her playing and reveals her disturbing secrets even more.Like many aspects of the movie its uncertain if he really falls in love with her, just admires her talent or seeks to add an older woman to his experience. For my taste he gets too involved for the latter two since the piano teacher reveals a rather odd sexual preference which is hard to watch and even harder to deal with for Walter who gets deeper into her thoughts.Its hard to feel sympathy with Isabelle Hupperts Character Erika at first since she is absolutely cold and in her dealing with Walter annoying. But her dominant\/subordinate games like the obscure toilet scene soon show she is a woman who lost her self and tries filling the gap with something she isn't sure of. Ultimately she wants to be loved but is stuck in a sadomasochistic roleplay that leads to terrible consequences when she realizes that its not what she hoped and longed for.Its in these moments when finally her coldness begins to explain and the confused psychology becomes clearer, but never clear. Haneke leaves so much open to the viewer. For example, does she just hurt a female student with shards of glass hidden in her pocket just to eliminate a contester for Walter who showed interest in the girl (her running on he toiled and peeing immediately after points to that since it indicated sexual arousal in another odd scene)... or does she recognize herself in the girl who is driven to become a perfect pianist by her obsessive mother and lose touch with real life and love like her? Is Walter a bad person (many scenes indicate the opposite) and just takes revenge for being played with or does he really try to give in to Erikas kinky wishes as a sign of love? Its hard to say... Erikas uncertain often childlike, then dominant and cold behavior makes Walters actions explainable. How would you react if someone you fell in love with demands what is quite the opposite of love for you. Its heartbreaking seeing Erikas face when Walter reads her letter and starts feeling disgust for her although it is the greatest sign of love and openness Erika could ever give and as the finale indicates will ever give.Maybe Haneke plays his well known game in showing how confused and wrecking human relations can become but takes it to a higher level. In the end both characters have to deal with hard situations and Erika gets broken... or does she break herself? In the end all characters seem both unsympathetic and pitiful.The movie got me but not for the supposedly shocking scenes... by far more gripping is the emotional vacuum and hopelessness that is created by Erikas actions... her final look into the camera with a hint of tears on her cold emotionless face and a disgusted act of self mutilation are shattering. Is she disgusted by herself, by Walter, by her mother and the whole world or by her actions that led to the girl not being able to play the concert.... we don't know and Haneke leaves that door so wide open that many will be angry at the extremely open end. To me these uncertainties were what filled Erika with humanity since they made me as a viewer get thinking and trying to explain. Life is hard and being different, for whatever reasons that led to Erikas sexually and emotionally repressed state, makes it ultimately harder.So don't expect this to be a pure shock-fest... its more than that but like other Haneke Movies its way too stretched and slow.

Life is hard and being different, for whatever reasons that led to Erikas sexually and emotionally repressed state, makes it ultimately harder.So don't expect this to be a pure shock-fest... its more than that but like other Haneke Movies its way too stretched and slow.

Every moment he is off screen (which is most of the movie) is either a bore or a puzzlement. Kipling's dialog works just fine on the page, but on screen there is no feel whatsoever that real people would talk in such a manner. What flows on the page is stilted when forced into the mouths of actual people. Dean Stockwell does as well as one can imagine with the title role, but everything he says sounds as written as the Declaration of Independence, not the spontaneous remarks of a boy. (The same applies to every character, actually.) The direction is flat and incredibly unimaginative for a major studio release. Scenes which could have had real dynamism are played in flat tableau. Sequences of physical action are staged as badly as a high-school play. (Was there no experienced stunt coordinator available?) Beautiful footage of India is interspersed through more prevalent scenes of largely cheap-looking soundstage sets. (A walk through an Indian train station shows not one speck of dirt or debris or trash on the floor, no sign of dust or even worn paint!) The rear-projection shots of principles on soundstages in front of Indian scenery are worse than the cheapest serials of the time. And nothing substantial happens! The spy games being played consist mainly of doing things through complicated means that could have been much more effectively done straightforwardly. The dramatic action of this film could have been condensed into a twenty-minute short, and the 113-minute running time of the feature would not have felt like 1,113 minutes. The only saving grace is the splendid work of Errol Flynn, who almost manages the impossible task of making Mahbub Ali a real and realistic person instead of a spout for the pouring out of novelistic and archaic dialog. Flynn seems to me to be at the height of his powers here, if slightly (and only slightly) past the height of his beauty. I rejoiced every time he (far too rarely) returned to the story. The rest of the time, I watched the screen with one eye and the clock with the other.

The tactics used by the perpetrators included hangings, burning barns, churches, livestock, and homes. The locals intimidated the blacks who they believed were cooperating with the FBI, instilling scare tactics to terrify them into avoiding the agents. The more the FBI tried to gain information, the more the violence escalated. The sheriff's office was involved in the terror and used it to maintain their power. They were bullies, believing their behavior was justified. They wouldn't tolerate opposition. Everyone involved was responsible, even the mayor, who one agent pointed out wasn't in on it yet Agent Ward reciprocated by saying his knowledge of the incident was enough to involve him. Agent Ward was baffled at the behavior of the locals, being a naïve, straight-arrow D.C. agent while Agent Anderson was realistically unsurprised, having been raised in northern Mississippi.The mutation of the FBI tactics in the investigation was the most thought provoking part of the movie. Agents Ward and Anderson were on completely opposite ends of the spectrum. Ward was trying to be polite and accomplish goals by the book while Anderson was a street-smart, unorthodox, fearless, and empathetic agent. At first, they sought and expected cooperation from the sheriff; that never happened. Their questioning of the black community was met with resistance. Agent Anderson established a rapport with Deputy Pell's wife. He sensed her overwhelming desire to break away, yet she was at first reluctant to help, being a dutiful wife and southern woman, but eventually became an informant. Anderson had no qualms assaulting one of the members at their social club, letting them know early on that he didn't take kindly to threats.There were two very pivotal points in the movie that made the FBI change its tactics, even to the point of Agent Ward growing a backbone and adopting some of Anderson's philosophies. First was organizing a secret meeting of the key members in a church. When they realized it was a set up and bailed, Lester ignorantly spilled and the FBI quickly took advantage of his vulnerability. As Agent Anderson put it, the rattlesnakes were beginning to commit suicide. The story took a very dramatic turn when Deputy Pell's wife finally broke down and identified the location of the bodies. After the discovery and processing, the sheriff insisted Pell settle the problem at home, even sending 3 fellow members to watch over Pell violently assault his wife for her betrayal. They had finally struck a vital nerve with the FBI and Anderson was finished relying on Ward's protocol. Ward's pressed-suit, pen-and-paper, rookie agents were out and Anderson's seasoned, no-nonsense fixer agents were in. I found an interesting correlation in the FBI measures to the perpetrator's. They spared no expense for a desired outcome, to include a rouse hanging of Lester, an extremely coercive interrogation of the mayor in a desolate shack, and, my favorite scene of the entire movie, Agent Anderson's retaliation against Deputy Pell at a barber shop, asking Pell if he struck a blow for the white man the night he killed the civil rights workers as well as the night he remorselessly beat his wife.I believe the FBIs tactics, although unorthodox, were justified. They tried to play it by the book and it didn't work. Perhaps they pushed the envelope to gain results but justice prevailed. Agents Ward and Anderson learned a thing or two about each other and the ethics of bureau procedure.

Winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay, To Kill a Mockingbird, based on the novel of the same title, is one of a handful of Hollywood gems that not only unabashedly adheres to the parent story but captures its atmosphere. The cast seems to have stepped right out of Harper Lee's prose and onto the screen being exactly how you would expect them. Gregory Peck (in an Academy Award-winning performance) appears to have been born to play Atticus Finch although the production of such a film would have been unimaginable when Peck came into the world in 1916. Brock Peters as Tom Robinson is equally as fine a choice, and honorable mention should go to James Anderson as the morally corrupt and spiritually void Bob Ewell. The children are equally superb, particularly Mary Badham in an academy-nominated performance as Scout and Philip Alford as Jem. Instead of watching a movie, you feel like you've moved into this town.The magic of both the book and the movie is that it is not just a story about prejudicial and racist attitudes in the South, although these ideas are certainly at its heart. It is these attitudes and behaviors as seen from a child's perspective. Jem, Scout and their summer-friend Dill Harris (John Megna) see the clashes and the controversies of the adults and do not quite know what to make of them. They are old enough to understand what is going on but still too young to understand why a black man would be wrongfully accused of raping a white girl, Mayella Ewell (convincingly portrayed by Collin Wilcox). Or why some of the townsfolk frown on Atticus for defending an innocent man who happens to be black. Their friend Dill also has some tall tales of his own, bragging that his father is a railroad magnate. The other storyline involves a kind of secret admirer of the children that has been giving gifts to Jem in a knot-hole of a tree a few blocks from the Finch's, near the home of the Radleys. The Radleys are a reclusive family and the subject of many tall tales grown and fertilized by the townspeople, particularly Boo Radley who is characterized like a small-town devil through rumor. The Radleys are the target of community scorn, although not with as blunt an instrument as against African-Americans. We get the picture that this story is about untruths, from little innocent fibs like Dill's to the fabrication of the circumstances surrounding the trial.In one brilliant scene, a lynch-mob gathers to take Tom Robinson from his cell. The mob seems compelled by some traditional sense of duty rather than flaming passion as the Ewells are not well-loved in the community. Atticus, forewarned of the plans, sits outside the front of the jail house as Robinson's only defense. Before there is an escalation of violence, little Scout Finch arrives on the scene. She notices the people in the mob are acquaintances and she begins having polite conversation with them as if they were at a social function. Her presence and friendliness deflates the resolve of the mob, almost as if they have been found out, not by the police, but by a child. How could they possibly explain to her what they are doing? A large part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson defended by Atticus Finch in a courtroom drama that is unlike most other Hollywood courtroom dramas. Here, the defending attorney Finch is fighting a losing battle where facts cannot penetrate deep-seeded hate and prejudice. Although the jury members dislike the Ewells, keeping the African-American community in their place takes a higher precedent. The climax involves how the outcome of the trial collides with the mysterious children's admirer. Notice the names Finch and Robin-son, both birds, like mockingbirds.This is a masterpiece of film-making that defies most Hollywood conventions. Both the book and the film continue to appear on Best of lists, and deservedly so. There are few pieces of literature that have helped foster social change, not through a step-by-step objective plan, but simply through the innocent eyes of children witnessing and trying to make sense of injustice and prejudice. For some reason human beings tend to engage in hate more than love. But maybe when the child within us sees the pain and sorrow of unjustified prejudice, that's when we will change our attitudes.

Both the book and the film continue to appear on Best of lists, and deservedly so. There are few pieces of literature that have helped foster social change, not through a step-by-step objective plan, but simply through the innocent eyes of children witnessing and trying to make sense of injustice and prejudice. For some reason human beings tend to engage in hate more than love. But maybe when the child within us sees the pain and sorrow of unjustified prejudice, that's when we will change our attitudes. A tissue box and a loved one are also highly recommended when viewing.

I still can't believe this movie won Best Picture even over a movie like Saving Private Ryan! I thought the movie was boring and cheesy! The love story between Will and Viola was just as cheesy as a little girl's movie! Another thing I didn't like about it was that they barely showed the true love between Will and Viola The only thing they really did was have sex a million times! There's no true love in sex! There really were only a few scenes that truly showed the love between them! Other than that, the acting was really good! Gwyneth Paltrow deserved her Academy Award and so did Judi Dench. I thought Geoffrey Rush did a pretty good job too. After seeing this movie, I really have lost my respect for William Shakespeare. He was really only a lover who was lead by his emotions to fall in love with Viola. He even had a wife before Viola! Who knows, he could've been just as in love with her. You can't help who you fall in love with. And if the scene with him and that other writer is true, the cornerstone of Romeo and Juliet was hardly his idea! I thought this movie was all acting and nothing great. Just another movie to watch only when you're extremely bored.

Basically tennis champ Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train travelling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno suggests swapping murders. Guy obviously didn't take him seriously, until of course when Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) is found murdered in an amusement park. Guy of course is the chief suspect, and Bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan, and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead. This murder enquiry and Bruno's stalking are threatening his tennis career, and his relationship with the daughter of Sen. Morton (North by Northwest's Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realises that Guy won't do his murder, so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park. After his tennis game, Guy and Anne (who obviously found out the murder plan) race to the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they have a fight on the speeding out-of-control carousel. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the director's daughter) as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony, Howard St. John as Police Capt. Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins, and Hitchcock's cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions, some good suspense moments, and of course the unforgettable carousel finale, a good classic film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 32 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!
