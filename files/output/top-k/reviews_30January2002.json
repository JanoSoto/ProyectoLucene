Playing on every child's fear, not only are the monsters employed to frighten children  - collecting screams as an energy source for their home of Monstropolis - but they are actually scared of kids and once a child escapes into their world the chaos begins!As with the Toy Story movies at the core of this film is a great double act, here between co-workers Sulley (John Goodman) & Mike (Billy Crystal). Other great actors bring their vocal talents to the supporting cast such as Steve Buscemi & James Coburn although this film is more a two man show than previous Pixar releases. Goodman & Crystal make great leads, Goodman the more laid back thoughtful beast with Crystal his hyperactive, excitable sidekick, a perfect marriage between actor and character. It goes without saying that the world of Monsters Inc looks breathtaking, a fully believable world with monsters of all shapes & sizes everywhere, indeed like all of Pixars movies repeated viewing is a must so rich in background detail is the film.Unlike the failure that was Final Fantasy this film not only delivers the goods visually but also story wise.

This is no more apparent than in Monsters Inc, which despite not being quite as laugh out loud funny as the Toy Story films has an unparalleled richness of character & plot. There are too many highlights, the Child Detection Agency, the cameo appearance of the Yeti - voiced by the excellent Pixar regular John Ratzenberg.

He is by far my favourite slasher serial killer due to the fact that he is the most vulnerable.  He can be hurt and possibly even killed.  When hurt bad enough he goes into a coma so his body can heal itself.  While he does possess super human qualities the viewer gets the impression that he can be killed.  Sadly Halloween 6 The Curse of Michael Myers (H6) takes the story of Michael Myers, that was developing nicely through parts 2,4 & 5 and tries to do too much with it.  The revelation of the Man in Black is disappointing and the movie tends to ask more questions then it answers.  This entry tries to put to bed some of the story lines started in parts 4 and 5 but in doing so the conclusions it gives cause even more questions to be asked.  This is due in part to the conclusions not being very clearly presented. Overall the movie is okay.  The director keeps Michaels presence felt by having Michael continuously shown to be present in many scenes by appearing for a moment in the background.  It's nice touches like that that make the movie more interesting to watch. Story wise the movie seems rushed.  The director and writer capture a bit of the magic that made the original Halloween so much fun to watch but the story is far too convoluted to make much sense.  Overall I give Halloween 6 a 5 out of 10.  Halloween H20 is much better and makes for a nicely trilogy with parts 1 & 2.  Apparently Halloween The Homecoming is due for release this year (2002) and follows H20.  Why can't they just leave well enough alone?  H20 ended the story very nicely.

The plot was so thin I thought I was watching a bunch of Anorexic(SP?) teen movie stars trying to make themselves look like actors.The only other decent actor I could find in the movie was Rick Yune, whose part was not nearly emphasized enough... poor Rick.

What seemingly starts off to be a science fiction story about a robot, given human characteristics, turns into a Pinocchio-like fairy tale.  I know many critics have blamed this film for doing exactly that  switching gears, as it were, mid-stream.  However, I didn't see it that way at all.  Knowing beforehand that this was going to be a fairy tale from the beginning made the picture all the more poignant and telling.The filming is superb.  The film, I mean the actual visuals, has texture, feeling to it!  Each section of the film has a different feel to it, making it interesting.  From the opening almost Rembrandt-like sepia-toned Operating Room in which a specimen is being examined to the expansive aquamarine, underwater Coney Island scene, this film is incredible visually.  The return to the intimate living pod at the end of the film is also breath-taking with its narrator, soothingly wrapping up the story in a happily-ever-after setting is haunting.  The set for the living quarters, by the way, is reminiscent of the house in A Clockwork Orange.  So much of this film is suggestive of other Spielberg\/Kubrick films.  Oh yes, and of course there's that ending, the beings from another planet, Time Beings, whatever!  But if you look at it from the fairy tale point of view, every fairy tale has a deus ex machina in it.  David thinks it's The Blue Fairy, and in one sense it is, but then because The Blue Fairy is really only a statue, the true saviors arrive and he can live happily ever after.  All of the acting in this film is top notch.  Haley Joel Osment is truly remarkable.  In the beginning of the film, he captures what being a boy-like robot must be.  He has just enough of the robotic character and the right mix of boy-like characteristics to be truly convincing in this role.  Jude Law is amazing in the role of Gigolo Joe.  He has a robotic amorality to him with a touch of Gene Kelly (did the programmers of Gigolo Joe do that intentionally?) that make him interesting and remarkable.This is truly one of the great movies of all time, and it is, indeed, a fine tribute to an incredibly gifted film maker by yet another.

It's sufficient to say that Cruise's character David is disfigured in a car accident somehow and has been arrested for murder. The details prior to his arrest are revealed in that, somewhat tired old narrative tool of flash-back. What makes the film more interesting is that it switches between a couple of time-lines and the time-lines themselves can shift in keeping with David's memory of events. However in the final third of the movie the plot takes a gigantic shift and asks the viewer to swallow some rather large doses of disbelief. The final ending whiffed a bit too much of AI for me in terms of tone and sentiment and was somewhat unsatisfactory. The plot may shift a bit but, despite what other reviewers would have you believe, isn't all that complicated. Certainly at the end it's hammered home as to what happened to David that only an idiot *could* be confused... and it also speaks too much of a big reset button. You'll know what I mean once you've seen it all.Cruise is good in this. Generally I'm indifferent to his acting, feeling he gets by on his pretty-boy looks but he finds justification for himself playing the tortured soul here. Penelope Cruz is adequate although doesn't exhibit a whole load of emotional range (presumably stymied by not acting in her native tongue) and Diaz has a tendence to put in a somewhat hammy-psycho-girl performance which I can not always take seriously. David's mate, played by Jason Lee, and David's lawyer, played by Kurt Russell, are both perfectly passable without being scene-stealing or giving the Academy anything to notice.As to Crowe's adaptation of the original movie, I found it for the most part well enough done. Firstly I enjoyed the sound-track, partially because it featured about 5 of my favourite bands but also because the musically was generally particularly well chosen (as someone pointed out the REM track Sweetness Follows is excellently placed). The cuts between scenes are generally well handled without being confusing or unnecessary and the production values, in the character's houses, reflect the personas well. Crowe can be a bit heavy-handed at times and this is of particular note in his overly-long explanation of what happened at the end of the movie. Perhaps this is for the benefit of the slower audience members but it made the ending drag out too much (again like AI) - certainly I knew there would be a surprise ending and correctly guessed the main device that would be used (since Crowe made it quite obvious earlier on in the movie that it would be used - again too heavy). It's well done and capable - scenes like the much-touted Times Square are nice and add to the movie but it's nothing comparable to the sharper touches of David Fincher's Fight Club to which the movie has (somewhat erroneously) been compared.I'd recommend you see Vanilla Sky to form your own opinion. It's a breath of fresh air at least and is that bit different from your average formulaic 5 act movie. Whether you'll come across feeling somewhat mutely disappointed, as I did, is hard to tell. In the end I'll give it a 7\/10 and look with interest to see if Crowe can do better next time seeing as how I enjoyed his last piece Almost Famous that bit more than this.

Fortunately, Orange County is not another teen comedy. This is not American Pie 3. It's well-written, tender and, for a change, flat-out funny. It also introduces movie audiences to the second generation of the Hanks family, as in Colin Hanks, son of Tom.When children of famous actors become actors themselves, it's tempting to make comparisons. In the case of Colin Hanks, it's damn near impossible not to notice the similarities. His mannerisms and speaking patterns are almost identical, not to mention the physical resemblance. But any doubt of Hanks' lineage is completely erased every time his character grows exasperated with the incompetence of those around him. Like his father did so many times, in early films like The Money Pit, Hanks plays a normal guy who's frequently pushed over-the-edge by a farcical calamity. When Shaun explodes into a comedic I-can't-believe-everyone-around-me-is-so-stupid rage, it's not only funny, it feels very familiar. The movie's director also knows what it feels like to follow in his father's footsteps. Jake Kasdan is the son of Lawrence Kasdan, who directed The Big Chill and co-wrote an obscure little sequel called The Empire Strikes Back (which, if you're scoring at home, qualifies him for god status). The younger Kasdan, who's just 26, is already an old pro at the family business.He assembles a talented cast of great comedy actors. Jack Black, plays Shaun's stoned-out embarrassment of a brother. Black has become the go-to guy when casting directors are looking for a wacky supporting player and he comes through again here. (If he keeps it up, Black will assume the Belushi mantle of portly sidekicks, a mantle last carried by the late, great Chris Farley.) John Lithgow and Catherine O'Hara get laughs with a nimble ease as Shaun's divorced parents. There are also a host of celebrity cameos which I won't spoil. Kasdan additionally gives us a nice Beach Boys-styled soundtrack to compliment the California surfing motif.Orange County is a sweet coming of age movie that evokes memories of film's like The Graduate.

In the case of Colin Hanks, it's damn near impossible not to notice the similarities. His mannerisms and speaking patterns are almost identical, not to mention the physical resemblance. But any doubt of Hanks' lineage is completely erased every time his character grows exasperated with the incompetence of those around him. Like his father did so many times, in early films like The Money Pit, Hanks plays a normal guy who's frequently pushed over-the-edge by a farcical calamity. When Shaun explodes into a comedic I-can't-believe-everyone-around-me-is-so-stupid rage, it's not only funny, it feels very familiar. The movie's director also knows what it feels like to follow in his father's footsteps.

After seeing `Town and Country,' one begins to understand why.In this film, former box office headliners Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn and Charlton Heston are stranded in an embarrassing pseudo-French farce co-written by the famed Buck Henry (he wrote `The Graduate') and Michael Laughlin and directed by Peter Chelsom.  Rounding out the cast are Andie MacDowell, Garry Shandling, Jenna Elfman, Nastassja Kinski and Josh Hartnett - scarcely a cadre of second-rate talents and no-name unknowns.  Yet what these filmmakers have done to these fine people seems all but criminal.  The plot is devised along the lines of one of those Feydeau sexual roundelays, wherein the characters end up in an assortment of compromising situations and have to do a lot of quick explaining to their assorted spouses and loved ones to try to extricate themselves from them. The problem is that the adultery theme around which the comedy swirls is often more painful than funny in its nature.  Moreover, neither the lines nor the situations are ever particularly humorous and, in fact, they more often than not give off an air of desperation, as when the writers throw the characters into funny costumes for no discernible purpose or when all the women involved in Beatty's adulterous affairs somehow find themselves occupying the same ladies room without there being displayed any of the finely worked out narrative logic needed to get them there (which any truly successful madcap farce would absolutely rely on).  The characters are not even consistent with their own personalities.  The prime example is the Garry Shandling character whom we are told early on is a closeted homosexual, yet spends the entire movie picking up on and commenting on women - even after he has declared he will be true to his real nature.Of all the performances, Heston's portrayal of MacDowell's nutcase father is both the creepiest and the most daring.  The filmmakers even poke a little good-natured fun at Heston's NRA President image, having him storming into a New York City social gathering brandishing his prized hunting rifle. Yet, like so much of what happens in this film, this scene seems strangely tacked on and pointless.  Indeed, the plot is so unfocused that one often gets the impression that the filmmakers just thought it up as they were going along. devising storylines as the spirit (and the desire to shoot in an exotic location) moved them.  How else to explain the fact that the plot careens over to Sun Valley for no logical reason other than that Beatty and Shandling probably wanted to get a little skiing in during production time? And how does MacDowell's character - whom Beatty met earlier on an airplane going from New York to the Deep South - suddenly show up on a ski lift in Utah?  In short, this is one hell of a clunky, messy film.One can only hope that, in the twilight of their careers, these once major stars will still be able to find some material that will afford them the respect and dignity they deserve.  In the meantime, the politest thing we can do is look the other way and forget all about `Town and Country.'

I despised the novel, but the movie was great! Following is my reviewMuch can be said about a film that exceeds the novel it is based upon. Especially when the novel is a classic and integral part of American literature. Such is the case of Gary Sinise's film rendition of John Steinbeck's timeless story Of Mice And Men. From the talented acting to the beautiful imagery kept from the novel, this motion picture should be treated with a deep respect. Not only has the director kept the endearing straightforwardness of the original, he has grown and stretched the characters without detracting from them, a difficult feat by any standards. Unlike the book, the film becomes alive, drawing you deeper and deeper into the dramatic web of Lennie and George, two traveling farm workers trying to make a living during the Great Depression and earn a little on the side to buy their own place. Just a little place, with rabbits and chickens, a place to call their own. Unlike many people today, it's what they really wanted, not a big thing. A place where they could go and hang their hats. The two find a job bucking barley, but trouble just won't let them be. The boss's son has a problem with Lennie, a childlike giant of a man that doesn't understand why the man is trying to fight him. George is driven to protect his simpleminded friend to the end, something he does.The level of acting has not been seen in Hollywood since the days of Audrey Hepbourne and James Stewart. John Malkovich is brilliant as the lovable Lennie, perfectly capturing his true innocence. `George, tell me about them rabbits,' he joyfully exclaims, unaware how odd he seems to an outsider. Who can ever feel anything but passion for a man whose life centers on being able to care for the rabbits? George is also radiantly portrayed by Gary Sinise, keeping the character's gruff manner without making him seem unaffectionate in the least. The supporting cast is also wonderfully depicted, a rarity in today's world. Ray Waltson(Candy), Casey Siemaszko (Curley), Sherilyn Fenn (Curley's wife) and the others make the viewing experience much more pleasurable, bringing depth to the characters, something that was sadly lacking in the novel. The cinematography is beautiful, a stark contrast to the shocking events that occur. The golden light feeling is soothing, adding a jolt when violence rears its ugly head. Beautiful scenery and magnificent directing weaves symbolisms into the story, earning this movie the right to be labeled a film. Truly portraying the real grit of the story, something that the author was incapable of, this version of Of Mice And Men is Oscar worthy, a true gem of a film. When the audience is finished, they have a sense of completion. Loyalty, friendship and the American dream can be understood with simple clarity, and celebrated.

For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read The Lord of the Rings in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with The Hobbit and The Silmarillion as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in The Hobbit book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ranger. Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.
