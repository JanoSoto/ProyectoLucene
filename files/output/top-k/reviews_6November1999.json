He has to break the news to his wife (Diane Venora, who I believe should go on to be one of the best actresses of all time) that their beautiful home, swank cars and health care plan (their oldest daughter is athsmatic) are about to go down the tubes. He's been given a severance package but that's about to fall apart as well.Enter Lowell Bergman (Pacino), producer for CBS Television News' bastion of journalistic integrity, 60 Minutes. Bergman's doing a report on fires that were started by careless smokers and has been given a report so huge and full of technical jargon he can't make heads or tales of it.

Well, its all over the papers these days about how the tobacco industry lied about manipulating the leaves to make them more habit forming. We have Wigand to thank for that.

And so, she does something about it!Director Shekhar Kapur's film focuses on one of history's most important leaders.  Queen Elizabeth made her mark for several reasons, not the least of which was for firmly establishing the Church of England.  In this film, Elizabeth is portrayed as a complicated woman, bitter, passionate, and politically charged.The story unfolds with Queen Mary Tudor on the throne.  She thinks she is pregnant, yet in fact she is dying (she has a tumor in her stomach).  She despises her half sister, Elizabeth, and as Queen, Mary has restored the Catholic church in England.  Upon her death, Elizabeth is charged with taking on the throne.  She is the natural successor, but still a controversial choice, in light of the fact that she, herself has converted to the protestant religion.  Elizabeth's new empire is crawling with bishops and priests, lords and dukes, all desperate to keep their power, which is tied firmly to the Catholic faith. Cate Blanchett is fabulous as Elizabeth I.  The character is portrayed in a passionate light.  Blanchett is a natural beauty, with strong looks that compliment this bold character.  Through Blanchett we are allowed to see a vulnerable side to this remarkable woman, without feeling that she is also weak.  I am not an expert on this subject, however I wonder if this film did take some liberties with the character.  Throughout the film she seems to be the only proponent of peace.  When her court urges her to bear arms against Mary of Guise, Elizabeth would prefer to talk it out.  Elizabeth is sympathetic to the little people, even to those who may have betrayed her.  She is passionate and playful with the man she loves, Robert Dudley, played by Joseph Fiennes.  We are used to seeing a stoic, iron-clad monarch in film portrayals of this character.  This new, 90's kind of gal, is at times a bit hard to believe, if not merely unique(?).Geoffrey Rush offers a standout performance playing Sir Francis Walsingham.  He was nominated in 1998 for Shakespeare in Love, a film which he was also great in, however I do think that this was a better role.  Walsingham is the cool, calculating right hand man to Elizabeth.  He takes on the nasty deeds that her character dare not even think.  In his opening scene he chastises a young man who attempts to slash his throat.  When the man finally sees reason, Walsingham calmly turns the razor on the young man.Elizabeth is a beautiful film to watch.  The sets are magnificent.  Castles, battlegrounds and thrones all come to life.  The costumes are also great.  There are scenes where Elizabeth is being dressed by her ladies-in-waiting and I, for one, could not wait to see what they were going to outfit her with next.  Hands down! this was defineatly the best film of 1998.  I found the storyline to be mesmerizing.  Well drawn out characters, proper pacing and enchanting scenery, made this a film that I could not take my eyes off of. Kapur's film captures well, an interesting time in history, and brings to new life, one of history's favorite Queens.  I recommend this as a companion piece to A Man for All Seasons.  Watch that film to fully understand why Elizabeth's reign began in such turmoil.

Of course, that episode didn't have the stylish directing talents of Michael Mann, a suave Al Pacino strolling on a dimly lit beach screaching I fought for you and I STILL fight for you..., and other tantalizing little moments which Mann attempts to inject at every twist and turn in order to keep things moving.  Indeed, Mann is a director who knows how to stretch a film out for 2+ hours and not make the viewer look at his watch.I guess I could have just done with less cloak and dagger stuff and more documentary style details, like one might find on a PBS Frontline episode.  As a matter of fact, that's precisely where Lowell Bergman ended up after leaving CBS over this fiasco.For all Mann's stylish directing talents (who doesn't like those city skyline shots that Mann seems to use so much) and Pacino's shouting and posturing, this film just ends up being an slickly produced, over dramatized hollywood version of events that by now are well known to most.

I saw this movie when I borrowed it from my grandmother.  My sister and I both sat down to watch it and just laughed ourselves silly.  I thought that the mother of Liz (the woman who Matthau falls in love with in the movie) was funny.  One thing that I wonder, however, is why a young woman like Liz would ever fall in love with an old man like Charlie (Matthau).  Another interesting character was the cruise director, Gil Godwin (played by Brent Spiner).  He was one of those proper types of people.  He and Charlie did not get along at all, with Charlie always stalling himself when it came time to dance.  This movie is sure to delight people for generations to come.

I think his remake of the 'Thing' was far superior to the original.  The story, acting and special effects made it a better movie.  I think it was the other way around with his attempt to remake Village.  In the original, the truely terrifying element was children that appeared to be normal children, but weren't.  Had the director worked with better child actors, he could have frozen your blood with a stare instead of relying on the goofy special effects for the eyes.  A pretty good movie, but only by virtue of the great original story.
