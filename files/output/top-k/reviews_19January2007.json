They have that rare talent among American filmmakers where their movies speak in a singular voice, something that makes their work fresh and original, even when they utilise familiar plot lines. And in the case of Fargo, they take the standard story of a kidnapping plot, inhabit it with some extraordinarily memorable characters, and direct it to such an engaging degree it becomes a modern classic.I didn't always like Fargo. The unique and offbeat style of the Coens doesn't always lend itself easily to a storytelling narrative. And on my first viewing of Fargo, I was left very puzzled by the film. I couldn't quite grasp it, because of the way it contrasts light humour with some very black overtones. I found it to be a very overrated film.But there was something about Fargo that remained ticking in the back of my mind. And I decided to give it another whirl one night. And a funny thing happened. I really started getting into it. I found myself cracking up at the strangest things. The way it was directed impressed me, and by the end, I'd fallen in love with the film.Fargo makes use of a staple of film-making that has cropped up over the last 50 years. The kidnapping plot. But this being a Coen brothers film, you know beforehand things won't unfold in the traditional scheme of things. Kidnapping plots seldom turn out the way they're supposed to on film. Otherwise there would be no interest. But in the hands of the Coens, Fargo proceeds at such a bizarre pace, this plot goes horribly wrong in the most spectacular way imaginable. And then some.Jerry Lundegaard (a suitably loserish William H Macy) walks into a bar an hour late to meet with two lowlifes, Carl and Gaear, to discuss a proposition. He needs his wife kidnapped, who is the daughter of Jerry's boss Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell). Jerry is on the verge of bankruptcy after an insurance swindle went bad, so he figures another swindle will get him out of this jam. Jerry will claim Carl & Gaear demanded $80,000 in ransom, and when Wade pays up, Jerry takes the amount he needs to pay off his debts.But Jerry is not the sharpest pencil in the box. Since he's not a particularly good salesman, it means he's not a particularly good judge of character. Otherwise his instincts would have told him that Carl & Gaear are not expert kidnappers. And when they end up killing a state trooper and two innocent passersby, its just the beginning of an escalating body count and a fiasco of monumental proportions.The first half hour carefully sets up the events. The plot. The kidnapping. The accidental murders. All set against the frigid backdrop of Fargo. Its at this point it introduces the film's best character, Marge Gunderson (a wonderful performance by Frances McDormand), the local police chief. A 7 months pregnant waddling ball of cheery chirpiness, its up to her to unravel the mystery and close the book on it.McDormand captures the attention from the second she arrives. You couldn't imagine the film without her, which is why the first 30 minutes seem like they're just waiting for her to turn up, and when she does, all of the plot strands seen beforehand finally click into place.McDormand plays Marge very deceptively. At first glance, she appears as a smalltown hick, forced to move up into the big leagues when these triple murders come her way. She gives the impression that with her Midwestern drawl she's a little slow on the uptake. And because her acting is so good, I actually bought into that. But she gradually reveals to us that her mind is as sharp as a tack. She correctly intuits the chain of events that eventually lead her back to Jerry.I love the scenes when she questions Jerry. Watch the way she fixes him with her penetrating stare, a big smile on her face that betrays none of her true emotions. Her deceptively pleasant demeanour wears down Jerry's resolve, until he's practically ready to confess everything. Sort of like Columbo. Only of the pregnant variety. Marge should get her own TV show.All of the cast give excellent performances. In a part Macy was born to play, he gives an impeccably controlled response to what is (in his mind) the perfect plan gradually unravelling around him. And Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are superb as the chalk and cheese scumbags who make a complete hash of the plan. The Coen's typical black comic approach is prevalent in their scenes. You won't forget the wood chipper scene in a hurry.The ending is a surprisingly moving one. Not to mention philosophical. And its McDormand's character who provides that emotional key at the end. She sums up the entirety of the plot in just a few sentences, that really left me breathless. Fargo is by far the Coen brothers most intelligent and well rounded work. Its not often that you can call a film that clocks in at 90 minutes a modern classic. Fargo is such a film.

This length was actually a necessary evil, however, as a lot went on during the course of the film and it's multiple reversals as well as requiring the time to not only introduce a myriad of characters, but fill them out to be real people.It took about 45 minutes for this film to pick up some steam and start going due to getting everyone introduced, but being a drama based on a book, the direction changed a few times during the course of the film. This slow start is at once alleviated on a second viewing, however, since knowing the characters the second time around, you get everything a lot more clearly and the momentum is obvious from the get-go.Vito Corleone is the Godfather, not only of the Corleone clan, but of many of the people he has come into contact with over the years, particularly in the Italian community. He creates many give and take relationship with a lot of people, and follows through on them. The first part of the film focuses on Vito and his reign as Don, then the focus shifts to between his sons, Michael and Sonny when the Don runs into a bit of trouble. Once Michael is placed center stage as the main character, and even on a first viewing, this was the point where the film really got into its groove and took off.It got a little slow while Michael ran off to Sicily, and that all seemed like a big side story we could deal without, but it allowed Sonny's reign to come and go, which was not necessarily a pleasant thing.The characters, as I said, were numerous and well-rounded, and it's just astounding how well they were drawn throughout the film.

I had actually forgotten I'd seen it before, but as the movie progressed, I began recognizing certain scenes, while a lot of the rest seemed completely unfamiliar.This is I think typical of this movie, and a lot of De Palma's films -- there will be long sequences with dull dialogue where you wonder why they weren't edited down, and some dubious acting and bizarre plot twists, and then suddenly there will be a sequence of 5 or 10 minutes that is just dazzling. De Palma here had a finalized story-line to work with (from a novel), and didn't script himself, which is good news for those familiar with some of his auteur derailments.At the same time, the script of The Fury shows some of the director's typical weaknesses (lack of logic, inconsistent characters, etc), and it's too bad that a third party wasn't brought in to tighten up the narrative flow, strengthen the logic, and remove weak dialogue. So, ultimately, it looks very much like a typical De Palma work, a B-movie with some dazzling cinematography and a few quite powerful scenes.*** some spoilers from here on *** The good news is that the basic premise of the story is pretty interesting and at least to me in 2007, one of the assets of the movie. The notion of the two young psychics, both victims rather than masters of their powers, is an arresting idea, and while the terrorist angle is unnecessary, I could imagine someone turning The Fury into a pretty good movie today.The second asset is, to my mild surprise, Amy Irving, who delivers a terrific performance, and actually seems a little too good for this occasionally hokey movie. She's believable, convincing, and often moving. I read some snide comment about her over-preparing for B-movies, but for The Fury at least, I am grateful for this commitment. Her shock at her own uncontrollable powers is brilliantly performed, and makes for those sudden jumps in your attention, when the movie has dragged on for too long. Very nice work.The other actors seem to work on routine; Kirk Douglas acts as if he's in a B-movie about spies, and has some bad dialogue to deal with. Andrew Stevens looks right for the part, and while not a convincing actor, his creepy hunk presence seems appropriate, especially towards the end of the movie. Cassavetes is OK, but not more, and looks somewhat uncomfortable with his black suit and busted-up arm.Some of the camera-work is excellent, and as always with De Palma, there are a few show-off pieces where he goes into long complex montages that aren't really motivated by the context or narrative development, but are nevertheless exciting too watch. The feeling is, as often, that a lot of the other stuff in the movie he doesn't really care for, as long as he can deliver these 5-minute masterpieces of cinema craft here and there.Ultimately, thanks to the arresting basic premise, the occasionally masterful direction, and the performance of Amy Irving, I enjoyed The Fury a little more than I expected to. I can see how it may appear ludicrous or bizarre to others, but that wide range of responses is what you get most of the time when the director is Mr De Palma.

Her shock at her own uncontrollable powers is brilliantly performed, and makes for those sudden jumps in your attention, when the movie has dragged on for too long. Very nice work.The other actors seem to work on routine; Kirk Douglas acts as if he's in a B-movie about spies, and has some bad dialogue to deal with. Andrew Stevens looks right for the part, and while not a convincing actor, his creepy hunk presence seems appropriate, especially towards the end of the movie. Cassavetes is OK, but not more, and looks somewhat uncomfortable with his black suit and busted-up arm.Some of the camera-work is excellent, and as always with De Palma, there are a few show-off pieces where he goes into long complex montages that aren't really motivated by the context or narrative development, but are nevertheless exciting too watch. The feeling is, as often, that a lot of the other stuff in the movie he doesn't really care for, as long as he can deliver these 5-minute masterpieces of cinema craft here and there.Ultimately, thanks to the arresting basic premise, the occasionally masterful direction, and the performance of Amy Irving, I enjoyed The Fury a little more than I expected to.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"19 January 2007","score":"","review":" One of Brian De Palma's lesser known works, at least around where I live, I recently watched The Fury for the first time in 25 years. I had actually forgotten I'd seen it before, but as the movie progressed, I began recognizing certain scenes, while a lot of the rest seemed completely unfamiliar.This is I think typical of this movie, and a lot of De Palma's films -- there will be long sequences with dull dialogue where you wonder why they weren't edited down, and some dubious acting and bizarre plot twists, and then suddenly there will be a sequence of 5 or 10 minutes that is just dazzling. De Palma here had a finalized story-line to work with (from a novel), and didn't script himself, which is good news for those familiar with some of his auteur derailments.At the same time, the script of The Fury shows some of the director's typical weaknesses (lack of logic, inconsistent characters, etc), and it's too bad that a third party wasn't brought in to tighten up the narrative flow, strengthen the logic, and remove weak dialogue. So, ultimately, it looks very much like a typical De Palma work, a B-movie with some dazzling cinematography and a few quite powerful scenes.*** some spoilers from here on *** The good news is that the basic premise of the story is pretty interesting and at least to me in 2007, one of the assets of the movie.

(As an aside, I found out that Arthur Miller wrote the screenplay while in Reno waiting for his divorce to be finalized; significantly, the film opens with the character of Roslyn getting her divorce from an abusive husband).There's the delightful Marilyn Monroe (as Roslyn Taber) in her next to last movie, trying to find a man worthy enough to believe in; Clark Gable in his last movie (as Gay Langland) the restless, older cowboy &#150; resourceful, independent, strong, but with a touch of cynicism &#150; who's attracted to Roslyn despite himself; the always vulnerable Montgomery Clift (as Perce Howland), who drifts from rodeo to rodeo, trying to forget his past; and then there's the ever-present Eli Wallach &#150; one of Hollywood's greatest &#150; playing the widower (Guido) who can't forget his past, but for all the wrong reasons.All three men are, of course, attracted to Roslyn, and all the while Thelma Ritter (as Isabelle Stears, and an older friend of Roslyn's) tries to help her sort out what she should do.Together the group stay for a while at Guido's unfinished house, out near the Nevada desert, and it is there that Roslyn decides she will try to live with Gay for a while, to see if things work out for them both. But, it is only when she accompanies all three men on a camping foray into the desert, to round up some mustangs, that Roslyn finds out what all three men truly believe in. When she does find out, she's no happy camper (no pun intended), that's for sure &#150; except in the case of Perce.The stark black and white camera work, especially in the desert night, is hauntingly beautiful, reminding me very much of the photography in Pursued (1947), perhaps still the finest example of Western night filming. The action during the hunt for the mustangs is intense, grueling and exhausting. So much so, that the viewer can almost feel it. And the editing is just excellent as the cowboys bring down each horse, one by one, leaving the stallion to last, in a final great tussle (in a Clark Gable biographical documentary I saw, I found out that he did much of the heavy work in those scenes; no mean feat for an aging star in his sixtieth year. Sadly, of course, Gable did have a heart attack two days after filming ended and died nine days later).If you haven't seen this classic film, I think you should.

This performance ranks right up there with Tinkerbelle as Julia's worst performance ever.John Malkovich was solid as Dr. Jekyll \/ Mr. Hyde.

It comes from a different point of view from the Robert Louis Stevenson novella. It tells the story of a woman who finds herself trying to choose between failing for the noble Dr. Jekyll or the infamous Mr. Hyde. It draws into a different side of human nature because a lot of women tend to be drawn to the dangerous type. Unfortunately, this movie called for a strong actress to play Mary Reilly and they were stuck with Julia Roberts.One other issue that some might have with this film is you really must see a traditional version of Jekyll and Hyde first. The movie would probably be fairly hard to follow if you didn't because the movie assumes that you know the Jekyll and Hyde background.Finally, I will leave on a positive note.

A few months ago, I watched my beloved horror classic on channel 9, and low and behold, right after it was The Rage Carrie 2. I had been warned about this movie. My brother saw it in theaters when I was seven, and told my mother it was terrible. When I fell in love with Carrie, I told my friend I wondered how the sequel was. She had also seen it and said it was terrible.They were right.Carrie 2 had potential. The character of Emily Bergl's Rachel Lang is a very intriguing idea, as she is a bit of a punk rocker, in contrast to Carrie's shy demeanor, but her personality is underdeveloped, squashed underneath the all too many attempts to maintain the point THIS IS THE NEW CARRIE, SHE CAN MOVE THINGS WITH HER MIND! Watch her break this snow-globe, close this locker, break this window, JUST WITH HER MIND!!!! Amy Irving returns as Susan Snell, but pay CLOSE attention, or you won't be able to know that, as she's only mentioned by name perhaps two times. She attempts to help Rachel in a horrible remake of the Carrie-Ms. Collins relationship, and even goes so far as to visit Rachel's mother in Arkham Asylum (stolen from Batman) and find out she's Carrie's half sister but Rachel won't take it and ends up killing her with a fire poker. I feel sorry for Sue. Why would you live twenty-three years after the plight of Carrie only to get killed by her not as interesting, horrible protagonist younger sister? But the one thing I will give this film is a kudos to its love story, even though IT has its flaws. Rachel's boyfriend, Jesse Ryan, is a jock who rejects his former friends for Rachel's sake, but isn't smart enough to realize after one of them invites him to take Rachel to his summer house that something is suspicious. The jocks turn out to be planning Rachel's humiliation, because she wants to give the police evidence they caused her friend's death. Rachel says she does not believe in love, but after two dates, sleeps with Jesse and later tells him she loves him as a house burns around them? Okay, whatever.In the inevitable destructive ending, Rachel's tattoo extends around her flesh... which is a great special effect, but how does it pertain to the story? She has telekinesis, not magic powers. Even her death is questionable, a piece of roof falls on her and crushes her? Why would a telekinetic person die from something falling on top of them? MOVE IT!!!! When sequels do not star the original character, they have to be REALLY GOOD to make it. The Rage Carrie 2 does not do this. It is a half-baked remake for the nineties, and if I want a half-baked remake, I will WATCH the remake from 2002. The one star given is for the flashbacks of Carrie, and I am proud to say it. This film does not do Carrie justice. It was originally called Carrie 2 Say You're Sorry, WHOEVER WROTE THIS NEEDS TO SAY THEY'RE SORRY!!! But if they made a Carrie 3, I WOULD see it...just to see if they did it right this time around.-Paris N.

A few months ago, I watched my beloved horror classic on channel 9, and low and behold, right after it was The Rage Carrie 2. I had been warned about this movie. My brother saw it in theaters when I was seven, and told my mother it was terrible. When I fell in love with Carrie, I told my friend I wondered how the sequel was. She had also seen it and said it was terrible.They were right.Carrie 2 had potential. The character of Emily Bergl's Rachel Lang is a very intriguing idea, as she is a bit of a punk rocker, in contrast to Carrie's shy demeanor, but her personality is underdeveloped, squashed underneath the all too many attempts to maintain the point THIS IS THE NEW CARRIE, SHE CAN MOVE THINGS WITH HER MIND! Watch her break this snow-globe, close this locker, break this window, JUST WITH HER MIND!!!! Amy Irving returns as Susan Snell, but pay CLOSE attention, or you won't be able to know that, as she's only mentioned by name perhaps two times. She attempts to help Rachel in a horrible remake of the Carrie-Ms. Collins relationship, and even goes so far as to visit Rachel's mother in Arkham Asylum (stolen from Batman) and find out she's Carrie's half sister but Rachel won't take it and ends up killing her with a fire poker. I feel sorry for Sue. Why would you live twenty-three years after the plight of Carrie only to get killed by her not as interesting, horrible protagonist younger sister? But the one thing I will give this film is a kudos to its love story, even though IT has its flaws. Rachel's boyfriend, Jesse Ryan, is a jock who rejects his former friends for Rachel's sake, but isn't smart enough to realize after one of them invites him to take Rachel to his summer house that something is suspicious. The jocks turn out to be planning Rachel's humiliation, because she wants to give the police evidence they caused her friend's death. Rachel says she does not believe in love, but after two dates, sleeps with Jesse and later tells him she loves him as a house burns around them?

It's hard to imagine how this film could be improved upon. It's both gripping AND original. Each image on the screen is indelible. I'll give one example. Joseph Cotton waiting for Orson Welles at the gigantic ferris wheel, his coat flapping in the wintry breeze. The scene that follows references all the themes we have been introduced to previously -- crime, friendship, love, betrayal -- and it's very funny too. I mean, five hundred years of democracy and peace producing nothing more than the cuckoo clock. That scene could be played again and again without extinguishing the viewer's interest in it.Not that the movie depends entirely on set pieces. The continuity is provided not just by Holly Martins' (Joseph Cotton) investigative perambulations but by incidents that link with one another or that restate the themes. By restating the theme, I'm referring to things that reveal Holly's failed attempts to replace Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in Anna's (Valli) life. Holly tries, for instance, to feed her some lines she has to learn for a play. Harry used to do that. The lines are in German and Holly flubs it until she gives up. And Anna's cat. Holly tries to play with it but it blows him off. He only liked Harry. The cat next appears in the street below, playing with the shoelaces of Harry, who is hiding in a dark doorway. Such is her love that she treats as flesh the stuff of shadows, to rip off Dante baldly and badly.By incidents that link with one another, I mean pieces of dialog or action that reflect one another and add to the sense of cohesion. Example When Anna finds out that Holly is a police informant, she scolds him and says sarcastically, Holly -- what a silly name! After the climactic chase, much later, Holly asks Calloway (Trevor Howard) to leave him at the gate so he can talk to Anna. Calloway tells him, Be sensible, Martins. And the reply is Haven't got a sensible name. The lines resonate. Another example twice Calloway and Martins drive past Anna while she is walking down the same road, leaving Harry's funeral -- one at the beginning and again at the very end. It's an adult movie with wit and elisions that are aimed at people who are not seeking black and white cartoon characters. It even manages to make us feel some sympathy for the villainous Harry when he's chased through the sewers, the cloaca maxima of post-war Vienna. The story has to do with three people a British officer who will not change his mind about a criminal, a friend of the criminal who does change his mind, and the criminal's lover who does not. Expect an up-beat ending? Watch Valli walk past Holly Martins on her way out of the cemetery while the leaves fall. In all the films I've seen there are few more moving scenes, and its completely wordless.Everything seems to fit together here -- the direction, the performances, the score, the photography, and the writing. It's nearly a Gesamtkunstwerk and could have been shot in Wagner's Bayreuth instead of Vienna. Anton Karas's musical instrument wasn't chosen at random. It a traditional instrument in Austria and Germany. The word zither, by the way, is from an old Indo-European root that also gave us sitar and guitar. No need to go on about its virtues.

A lot of comments for this film has suggested its similarity and superiority to Rain Man, this is not so in my eyes, this is a watered down sub-standard effort with none of Rain Man's humour or warmth.

Stuck in his daily routine, estranged from his wife and failing to be a father to his children. This, cut-and-paste character then meets Georges, a guy with Down's Syndrome who proceeds as we all know by now to help him turn his life around and get back to being a father to his kids.The problem is that we are given no insight as to why Harry puts up with Georges after the initial meeting. Harry's life is in a bad enough state as it is, it's completely implausible that he'd risk losing his job by taking time off to try and get Georges to his mother's house. The humour completely misses the mark, instead of showing us why Harry is putting up with this guy, we are treated to a series of irritating, unfunny skits in which Harry bears the brunt of Georges mishaps.The film reaches its peak when Georges remembers it's Harry's daughters birthday and along with other people from his home steal a bus, take Harry out of a conference, set off some fireworks, et viola! Harry is a good father again and now he can see the kids.

Fireworks of 1997 is a sad, funny, violent, melancholic, brilliant film, an absolute masterpiece which is, in my opinion, one of the best movies of the 90s. Hardly ever have I seen a movie which is this memorable and unique in both its tragic and its funny moments, as it is the case with this ingenious work of art.I am a big fan of director Takeshi Kitano, who also stars in the leading part (as 'Beat' Takeshi) in this, and Hana-bi is my personal favorite of his movies.Yoshitaka Nishi (Kitano) is a mostly calm, but occasionally irascible and ultra-violent cop, whose wife Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto) is terminally ill of leukemia. After his partner Horibe (Ren Osugi) is wounded, and another police officer is killed, Nishi decides to quit his job at the police and spend more time with his dying wife. In order to help Horibe, who is now in a wheelchair, and the dead police officer's widow, and in order to make the remaining time as comfortable as possible for his wife, Nishi, who also owes money to the Yakuza, needs money and he is determined to acquire it.There is no doubt in my mind that Takeshi Kitano is an absolute genius, which he has proved by writing and directing this masterpiece. But not only is Kitano a genius as a writer and director, his acting performance in Hana-Bi is also uniquely superb and one of a kind. Nobody else could have played the role of Nishi with such brilliance as 'Bito' Takeshi Kitano, who rarely says a word in the first half of the film and is (nevertheless or therefore) absolutely impressive in his role of the cop with the constant poker face, which typical for Kitano. By the way, the impressionist and very original pictures which are shown occasionally throughout the movie were also painted by Kitano himself.The rest of the acting is also great, Ren Osugi delivers a particularly memorable performance as Horibe, Nishi's partner who is struck by fate and has to live in a wheel chair, and Kayoko Kishimoto is great in the lovable role of Nishi's dying wife.An absolute genius as a writer, director and actor, Takeshi Kitano is without doubt one of the greatest cinematic multi-talents alive, as far as I am concerned he is one of the greatest cinematic multi-talents who have ever lived. Hana-bi is arguably his greatest film. ","genre":null},{"date":"19 January 2007","score":"19 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" Takeshi Kitano's Hana-bi aka.

As a film alone, it is passable. But as an adaptation of truly attention-getting material, it is a sorry failure. Based on the true-life of George Jung who created an empire in the United States by dealing cocaine, the film starts off on the wrong footing and continues to descend into a white-wash of the events of George Jung's life.Director Ted Demme takes Jung's life and creates artificial sympathy for the character making the film a tragedy of circumstance rather than of choice. However, George Jung himself admitted that the only reason he chose to be a cocaine dealer was that times were slow and he needed the money. Demme also turns Jung's mother into an uncaring villain who turns her son into the cops and taunts him as he is led away, when in reality Jung really doesn't know who turned him in. The film also looks over the fact that George had a well-paying job when he decided to enter the world of drug trafficking. It is of no surprise that director Ted Demme sympathized with Jung considering Demme's own cocaine related death less than a year later.What was advertised and initially appeared to be a truly engaging exploration of the world of cocaine dealing turned out to be a very typical Hollywood film about drug dealing. With music video cinematography and underwhelming performances by Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and most of the remaining cast, Blow doesn't come close to expanding or improving upon countless other films exploring the same topic. It falls quickly into the Hollywood glamor trap and never ascends to anything more than typical.

If you are bitten, then you become one in a short time. I know that seems like standard fare, but the weird part is what happens while you are a zombie. Pieces of you might randomly fall off. You can still talk, but you prefer to kill in the most hideous ways, like punching through the back of one person's head, with your hand coming through the mouth to grab another person, or by pulling the skin completely off a person's entire head. It's nearly impossible to kill them also, except by completely destroying them. Several scenes involve on zombie's intestines wrapping people up like tentacles. The movie has some of the most terrible acting, writing, dialog, and overall directing I've seen this last year, but the creative gore and zombies more than make up for it.The story follows the character Lionel who lives in New Zealand in the 1950's. He goes off with a girl to the zoo, while his horrible, wretched mother follows. She is spying on her son and his new love interest (Paquita), obviously disapproving, and she gets too close to the cage with the cursed Samutran Rat Monkey, who proceeds to bite her. Her son takes care of her for the next few days, trying to prevent his new girlfriend from finding out about his now deceased and reanimated mother, who starts to attack house guests, including Paquita's dog. Eventually, his uncle who claims to have been left Lionel's house, throws a party, unknowing about the zombie chained up in the basement, and all hell breaks loose. The movie has the BEST ACTION SCENE EVER, in which a priest goes kung-fu on some zombies in a graveyard, saying the memorable line I kick ass for the Lord. Another great scene, which is the scene that gives the movie it's world record holding position, is where Lionel gets a lawnmower, starts it up, and.... You fill in the rest. The scene has fake blood being pumped at five gallons per second, running for about 4-6 minutes total. A few interesting notes -The opening scene in which an explorer carries the Rat Monkey is the same place where Peter Jackson shot the scene in The Lord of the Rins Return of the King when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolos travel to The Paths of the Dead. -The movie also has had more people report THROWING UP while watching the movie than any other film in history. Even I got a bit nauseated. -There is not one moment of action or dialog cut from Peter Jackson's original screenplay. -In some cinemas, tickets for the movie included paper bags for vomiting. -Some dude's dad's grave was partially in the frame for about 5 seconds in the graveyard scene, so he filed a lawsuit. As only three letters were visible (BRA), he lost the case. -Many families, after seeing The Lord of the Rings, picked up this movie to see what else Jackson had done. Those who stood through the horrible acting and dialog were definitely surprised when they got to the zombie sex scene, the lawnmower scene, and the Mother on the Roof scene. Indeed they were.Anyway, I recommend this movie, but you HAVE to stick with it. The first half of the movie sucks.
