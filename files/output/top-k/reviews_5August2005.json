Even though I did not understand some of the underlying sophisticated meanings behind the film, I still was blown away by the groundbreaking visuals and action. Now, having seen it recently again, I can honestly say that this film is probably the best film ever made. Not only does it have amazing battle scenes, but it is more about the story of men that will give everything for nothing in return. There are some very touching scenes between the brave Samurai and the poor villagers. The Samurai represent everything that is good in man and I believe, are the models for humanity.If you are a Kurosawa fan or not, this is a movie that you have to see because it is absolutely incredible.

One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; Psycho being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, Oh, that is such a classic. And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit 24 Hour Psycho, wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that Psycho changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that Psycho doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released?

That's why I've already seen several of his movies and that's also the reason why I gave this movie a try. I'm normally not too much a fan of action movies, but with him in one of the leading roles, you can always expect something more and better than some simple spectacle.Clear and Present Danger is a movie based on a Tom Clancy novel that tells the story of Doctor Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst who finds himself in the middle of a power struggle within the Colombian drug cartel as well as some dirty political games in the highest ranks of the American political establishment. It all starts with the murder of a close friend and his family of the American president aboard their yacht in the Caribbean, apparently in retaliation for stealing money as part of a money laundering scheme for the cartel. When some of the president's men convince the president to conduct covert actions against the cartel, without telling the Congress of course, and the security chief of one of the cartel bosses tries to play both sides by informing his boss, but trying to organize a coup against the cartel leadership with the help of the CIA at the same time, Ryan soon gets in a very difficult position. When he finds out the entire truth, he sets himself the almost impossible task to save the men that were left behind in the jungle, while trying to save his own reputation and life...Whether everything shown in this movie is possible or not, I can not really say. But one thing is for sure and that is that we certainly will not know everything the president of the USA is involved in or has knowledge of. I'm convinced that everywhere in the world, the CIA does play some dirty tricks so now and then, as long as it is beneficial for them and \/ or the country. So in that perspective I must say that this entire movie feels quite believable. And even though this isn't the best movie I've ever seen Harrison Ford play in, I must say that he did a nice job in this movie. His character is still believable, because he never seems to use any weapons and certainly isn't some kind of superman who can escape from entire armies without getting a scratch (although it sometimes started to look like it). I don't think the average CIA office worker is used to carry a lot of guns, machine guns, hand grenades, bazooka's or I don't know what other weaponry you sometimes see them use in all those cheap action flicks, so it's a good thing that they didn't have Jack Ryan carry them either. But there is one thing I don't really believe I don't think that the CIA would ever send such a high ranking employee in the field. Nevertheless, Harrison Ford did a nice job with his role and the same can be said about Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer,... But in the end this is a bit too much an action movie to my taste, even though the action shots are certainly nice to watch. The story and the acting are OK and make that this movie is a lot better than the average action flick. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5\/10 and 7\/10.

When some of the president's men convince the president to conduct covert actions against the cartel, without telling the Congress of course, and the security chief of one of the cartel bosses tries to play both sides by informing his boss, but trying to organize a coup against the cartel leadership with the help of the CIA at the same time, Ryan soon gets in a very difficult position. When he finds out the entire truth, he sets himself the almost impossible task to save the men that were left behind in the jungle, while trying to save his own reputation and life...Whether everything shown in this movie is possible or not, I can not really say. But one thing is for sure and that is that we certainly will not know everything the president of the USA is involved in or has knowledge of. I'm convinced that everywhere in the world, the CIA does play some dirty tricks so now and then, as long as it is beneficial for them and \/ or the country. So in that perspective I must say that this entire movie feels quite believable. And even though this isn't the best movie I've ever seen Harrison Ford play in, I must say that he did a nice job in this movie. His character is still believable, because he never seems to use any weapons and certainly isn't some kind of superman who can escape from entire armies without getting a scratch (although it sometimes started to look like it). I don't think the average CIA office worker is used to carry a lot of guns, machine guns, hand grenades, bazooka's or I don't know what other weaponry you sometimes see them use in all those cheap action flicks, so it's a good thing that they didn't have Jack Ryan carry them either. But there is one thing I don't really believe I don't think that the CIA would ever send such a high ranking employee in the field. Nevertheless, Harrison Ford did a nice job with his role and the same can be said about Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer,... But in the end this is a bit too much an action movie to my taste, even though the action shots are certainly nice to watch. The story and the acting are OK and make that this movie is a lot better than the average action flick. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5\/10 and 7\/10.

With the TV series Lock Stock and ... and movies like Snatch, and this Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, he has done some excellent work.While four friends find themselves in deep trouble after a crooked card game (if they don't want to lose some of their fingers, they have an enormous debt to pay in a week time to the local gang-land boss and porn king Harry 'The Hatchet' Lonsdale), they overhear their neighbors in the next flat plotting to hold up a group of pot growers. They decide that they will steal the money from their neighbors after the hold-up. In the meantime the same Harry Lonsdale has found a pair of antique shotguns that he would like to own, but for which he doesn't want to pay of course. He has it arranged that they are stolen from the retired owner, but the two not exactly brilliant thieves make a mess of the job and sell the guns to Nic the Greek, a small-time hustler. Because our four friends will need some weapons, they ask Nic the Greek to sell them something. All he can give them are two old shotguns...Even though most of the actors aren't exactly very well known, they all did a wonderful job together.

Unlike most action movies, Mamet's stories are almost entirely about strategy. That might make it sound like rather less than it is. Mamet seems to love puzzles -- and puzzles within puzzles -- and the lengths people will go to manipulate one another and, man, is this a prize-winning example of his obsession. As in House of Game we have a big con that goes a little astray and winds up not only with the theft of a priceless invention but murder as well.I realize Glengarry Glenross is probably Mamet's most highly esteemed work but I think House of Games and The Spanish Prisoner are more engrossing because more things HAPPEN. Mamet's dialog always involves a lot of byplay, repetition, non sequiturs, and general ellipsis, but the elegant stylization isn't worth much if it doesn't go anywhere. Here the plot moves from the Caribbean to New York to Boston and with each step the conundrum becomes more difficult to figure out.Of course the plot is an implausible one because it depends on the heavies being able to predict precisely the moves of the mark, down to small basically unforeseeable details, such as his snooping in a secretary's desk and stealing a souvenir FBI card out of her scrapbook. But it hardly matters because we're swept along so fluidly in the mystery that we don't really question these events. The viewer, by the way, is kept as much in the dark as Scott Campbell, the protagonist.The performances are all quite apt. Scott Campbell might be a terrific inventor but he's kind of a dim bulb in other respects. He's the kind of highly conventional Schlub that wouldn't DREAM that anyone, let alone an entire organization, would lie with comfort and such powerful effect. You have to wonder what his voting record looks like.Rebecca Pigeon is, I think, an actress who never got the kind of attention she deserves. She's beautiful in an unconventional, petite, brachycephalic, angular way and her locutions and expressions always seem to suggest she may know more about what's going on inside your head than you do yourself. She delivers Mamet's stylized speeches efficiently but in other films has demonstrated considerable range. You never know who a person really is, she says. Something else. She may be treacherous, and he may be wary of an office romance, but they seem genuinely attracted to one another. Near the end, when Scott finally kisses her, she draws back and says, Crikees!, as if amazed and tickled. This is a set up for a final scene when she is hustled into the police van. She's supposed to break away from the cops holding her, run to Scott, throw her arms around him, kiss him fiercely, and confess that her feelings had changed to true love. But no! Thank heaven she has no remorse at all and leaves him with a wisecrack and a sardonic smile. Mamet is nobody's fool.I ought to mention the score. It's mysterious and melancholic. The main theme is built around a handful of descending notes and the orchestration is simple but a little odd -- bass, piano, quiet woodwinds, and chimes.

Mary didn't have to be multi-dimension, but Hillgoss' performance makes her so. She is cold, alone, and isolated from the world. She has no friends, and doesn't feel the need for any. Despite the coldness of her character, you feel sympathetic for her and even begin to hope she gets out okay. Due to her lack of companionship, she eventually turns to the chauvinistic man who lives across from her. This is another interesting character, one who obviously lusts for Mary but doesn't know how to express his feelings, and it seems if it wasn't for the censorship at the time, he could've become more fleshed out. As another reviewer noted, he is obviously on the verge of rape and is emotionally abusive.The story is simple, yet it grabs you by the throat and refuses to give up until the film is over. A woman bizarrely comes out of water three hours after an accident occurred. How did this happen? As she tries to get away as far as possible from the incident, strange events continuously occur and she finds herself drawn mysteriously to an abandoned carnival. Also, a strange specter appears constantly. Is this a human stalking Mary? Or is it something supernatural or of the psyche? No one else can see him. Things continue to get worse and worse, and many times Mary is unable to communicate or hear the people around her, yet strangely it goes back to normal within moments. The film's ending is slightly predictable, but suiting. Something more flashy would've destroyed the feel.As many have noted, this isn't a technically flawless film. But you get so sucked in by the film it isn't until the ending that you realize some of the flaws. For one the editing isn't the greatest, but you must remember that the crew had an obscenely low budget to work with. It wasn't for lack of talent, it was for lack of resources. Also some of the supporting actors aren't very good, but again the film is so low-budget that it would've been impossible to pay better performers. Did you really expect to see Oscar winners in a b-film anyways? There are several aspects that easily trump the mild flaws. For one, the camera work is incredible, on par with many Hollywood films. The angles of the organ were particularly affecting, and the upward shots of the ghouls gave you the feeling of helplessness that Mary feels. Also, Hillgoss' performance is, as I stated above, very good. She manages to make a cold and isolated character human and sympathetic instead of the cardboard stereotype that haunts most films of the nature. The actor who plays the neighbor isn't the best, but his character is certainly interesting, a perverted peeping tom that if the film had been made ten years later would've surely been more developed. Also, the crudeness of the acting adds to the feel. Due in fact that Hillgoss provides the only good acting in the film, you get the feeling that something isn't right. The lack of development for almost every other character adds to the dreamlike quality. When was the last time you had a nightmare in which the other people involved where fleshed out.The most impressive aspect is Harvey's direction. He knew how to make something out of absolutely nothing, and it certainly shows. The angles and pacing are some of the film's benefactors. And the dream sequences and sped-up carnival footage are nothing short of breathtaking, showing his masterful Harvey was. It's a shame he never made another film, but than again if you make only one film, why not have it be a masterpiece? Carnival of Souls transcends its limitations. It contains no special effects for the most part, and very minimalist makeup. It shows that imagination is what makes a film work, not flashy dynamics and special effects. Due to this, many fans of newer horror films will not appreciate its genius. For fans of cult films and surrealist films will be impressed. The latter camp will be amazed how the film is very avant-garde despite no budget to work with. The film is one of the ultimate cult films. Ignored when it came out, only decades later was it appreciated on its rerelase in 1989. The same thing happened with Reefer Madness, Glen or Glenda, and Spider Baby. That is, in my opinion, is one of the factors that makes a film a cult film, definitely more so than if the film is just a sleeper hit. Even if it didn't have the cult following, this is still a film that must be seen. It never outright scares you, but it gets under your skin. It leaves a lasting impression, and I guarantee you'll not forget it for the rest of your life.

The devil is a concept that has scared even the most brave people for decades. Well, okay, that's all fine and dandy but how about we put the terrible power, and pure evil of the devil into a small and seemingly harmless child.

Unbelievable, and the acting is superb.Even though this movie isn't exactly scary (keep in mind that this is coming from a girl who has seen tons of horror flicks and hasn't been scared by a single one) it is most certainly my favorite movie of all time. I recommend this for any horror flick fan who likes to watch well thought out horror flicks instead of the plot less, pointless ones. However if you like the plot less, pointless gory movies you may like this but I highly doubt it.So rent (or better yet buy) this movie, pop it into your DVD player, dim the lights, and let the horror begin!

The novel may have, but the film sadly has very little to say about resisting fascism, as the reason why the protagonist in the film chooses not to grow up is only a distaste for adult sexuality. The bulk of what makes this a fascinating watch is the open-ended premise. What would it be like to never physically age? This keeps the material interesting for an amount of time, but ultimately on such related ideas alone, the film cannot take the stretch to over two hours in length.

I knew that there was also a kind of historical context for the times, of how it was in New York City as well as in others during the 70's (though especially in the 70's)- I remembered my mother telling me about how the atmosphere of 'Death Wish' with its thieves and rapists and abusers was for real, that they were around every corner, and that crime was indeed at an all-time high then. So watching the film with this in mind, it brings a little extra drama to the story of Paul Kersey (Bronson). There is the style, and underlying humor, that appeals for the genre fans (and there is a minor bit of exploitation in making Kersey a 'bleeding heart liberal' with skill behind a gun). But there is also a sense of overall tragedy to it all.The tragedy comes out of a truly disturbing scene- Kersey's wife and daughter go home from the market, unaware that a trio of hoodlums (one of them a fresh-faced Jeff Goldblum no less) follow them, bust in, and beat and rape them. This is indeed so terrifying and real it tops a scene like the one in Clockwork Orange with the assault on the writer; it's somehow even more shocking when its in an apartment in the now, with hoodlums as random and sadistic as the ones here. Kersey mourns the loss of his wife and daughter (the latter to dementia) briefly, but it sticks with him through the whole film, in one way or another. The first signs of him knowing what's around him on the streets at night (and one of the funnier bits of the film's bleakness) is when he takes a sock full of quarters to use on the hoodlums. This is short-lived after a visit to the south-west, where he gets slipped a gun in his suitcase. The rest of the film unfolds as it would, at least under the circumstances of the genre.Yet within the grip of Death Wish being a genre picture (and this is something that the sequels and other lessor B films have forgotten) is that there has to be a sense of reality, and real dangers, to the film, not to mention the sort of evolution of Kersey into how he becomes- a killer, a vigilante of the scum who try to rob and threaten to kill. Although the police procedural that parallels his story isn't as strong as his, it works fine within the scope of the story that has to turn out in a certain way. But there are other factors to go with it besides a strong story (based on an even stronger book Brian Garfield). Bronson is, indeed, great at being, well, Bronson. If the violence in the film doesn't pull any punches for its time period, Bronson doesn't skip being good at showing Kersey's inner strength of defense as well as his weaker side. It's not a very complex performance aside from the conflicts midway through the film with Kersey, but it's in a way truer than the film could deserve. Michael Winner, the director, is also an asset with this, in giving to the film its gritty tone. And, as an added bonus, there's the sweet musical score from Herbie Hancock.Death Wish is a film of its time, but one that still has significance, and entertainment value for today. People my age (i.e. college kids) will be attracted to it for its 'retro' style, and, as it is in the vein of a film like Taxi Driver (though less visceral), as a stylistic action film. And for the older folks, the drama of the film, and the solid storytelling, will keep it interesting. In short, it's the proverbial good vigilante film of its time, giving Bronson one of his most memorable turns.

His good looks definitely helps and I have never seen such suavely dressed men of action before. No wonder that both the films, A Better Tomorrow and The Killer were made into Hindi\/Indian films but couldn't hold a candle to the originals.I loved the sharp editing and crisp story telling of the film while the cinematography added to the fast pace of the film. I am squeamish about action scenes and generally try to fast forward the action scenes but in this film, I found myself replaying the action sequences over and over. The action choreography was sheer poetry.....synchronised to perfection, even if, over the top in magnitude.I was quite astounded to find similar ethos and strains in the story telling of Hong Kong movies and Hindi films....love, betrayal, friendship, bonding, righteousness and a larger than life hero.Someday I wish to see CYF in a Hindi film! I have just one grudge, he dies at the end, in all the good movies. Doesn't he deserve a happily ever after? I think he does....and he rocks! His Hollywood movies don't do him enough justice, except may be Anna and the King.
