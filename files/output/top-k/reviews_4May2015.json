Did the succeed? The answer is almost. This movie,in many ways seems to be similar to On Her Majesty's Secret Service-a movie where Bond marries. they both feature skii chase sequence,TWINE opens in swiss bankar's office and there is a similar scene in OHMSS as well. This movies also gets its title from OHMSS-Bond family motto The World is Not Enough was first mentioned in that movie. But most of all they feature a relationship that is more genuine than usual. the are many similarities between Tracy and Elektra-both are excellent on skiis and seem to be strong women while deep down they are vulnerable and insecure. Of course-we think that of Elektra before we find out she is in fact a villain. It's a great twist-heck,a brilliant one. Elektra for my money is an absolute best character that ever graced the series. At first we see her as a strong young woman who has the opinion that there is no point in living if you can't feel alive. But when she gets traped she goes through a panic attack. Bond starts to sense she is a remarkable person but a badly damaged one. The story hints thay her and Bond are attracted because they are both wounded. Bond hids it under his boyish charms. We actually see more dimensions of Bond in this one. At its best moments movie shows Bond caught up between his duty to protect the heiress and his own growing attraction. The love scene is for my money the best one there ever was. The screen just cracks with energy every time Sophie and Brosnan are together. Apted commented on the love sceneThere are no light quips and puns. This is the real deal. Bond seems to be quite tender with Elektra. At one point I got the impression he wants to cuddle. He genuely wants to know how Elektra survived the kidnapping. He seems to be affected by the story. When she asks him what does he do to survive he answersI take pleasure-in great beauty this was first and foremost a compliment for Elektra at that point but Bond takes great pleasure from beauty of life- luxury. He escapes the sense of danger that way. It's a wonderful line spoken during a wonderful scene. Aside that we have a great pre-title sequence and opening in swiss bankar's office. Bond is cool,highly skilled professional with sophistication and charisma that just needs to be admired. Brosnan is brilliant. So the first hour is fantastic. but then the problem comes. Denise Richards as nuclear scientist. Named Christmas simply so they could make a pun at the end. A huge huge mistake. Even though Bond is supposed to be hurt deeply by the revelation that Elektra is more than she seems the ending simply undercuts any truly emotional and complexed feeling. I beg Apted to explain himself. It's like he wanted to do something different but he wasn't smart enough to make the ending right- Bond actually being affected by it all. Just like her name implies Elektra's death should in one hand be a tragedy. Her behaviour was a product of things she went through. It seems if she received proper help and care she wouldn't got the point she came. Even M seems to acknowledge that much when Renard says how Elektra is worth fifty of him. Elektra is an incredible character-truly unique and truly fascinating. She is so sure Bond wouldn't kill her because he would miss her. But Bond does kill her-in cold blood commentingI never miss it's a stunning scene and the moment after that is like that as well. Bond comes closer and touches her face like her mourns over her. M vitneses it and Judi Dench is incredible. But Christmas Jones and the ending undercut any sense that Bond truly cared or was affected by her even though earlier in the film and in the last moment between Bond and Elektra it seems that way. The ending is in Roger Moore style- Bond being caught with a girl and doing a pun.Michael Apted needs to explain this tonal mismatch. A shame because for my money this could have been THE VERY BEST Bond movie ever. That's right. For performances-Brosnan IS Bond,Sophie is incredible and Judi Dench is great- as always.Denise on the other hand is awful. There is absolutely no other room for any other Bond girl aside Elektra in this movie and the presence of a supposedly brilliant nuclear scientist who wanders around in hot pants showing her tattoos is one fatal mistake-it could only be described like that. and the torture scene was brilliant. You should have killed me when you had the chance-but you couldn't not me not the woman you loved. But the movie provides a secondary designated Bond girl...Apted...I am waiting for an explanation.

Still, The Blues Brothers wasn't the perfect movie to be made. It was a nightmare for Universal Pictures, to complete. It was wildly off schedule, had an ever-changing script, drug-fuel stars and was way over budget. Yet, the movie made, nearly triple of its money back, when it was released. The reasons why it work, was because the movie was action packed, kinda funny, and had great musical numbers. Still, most of its success, came from its two top drawings stars, Dan Akroyd and John Belushi. This sequel, didn't have any of those achievements. It's felt like a desperate retread between writer\/actor Dan Akyroyd and writer\/director John Landis to relive the glory days. The sequel fails to live up to the original, big time. The reasons why, are very clear. First off, the movie plot is paper thin. The movie tells the story of Elwood Blue (Dan Aykroyd) trying to reunited the old band to fight in a battle of the band contest in Louisiana. In my opinion, this plot is very weak, compare to the Mission from God, from the first movie. The movie never establish, why Elwood need the band, in the first place, or why the other band members would come to his rescue, when they, themselves are living, pretty well-off. Second off, the movie kinda ruins the first film, by stating out that the orphanage that the brothers were trying to save, ended up, closing. It kinda a bummer opening to a film. The Studio didn't like this, and force John Landis to make the rest of the film, more light-hearted. It gets worst, as the film turns PG to capitalize on a wider audience. It really limits the amount of violent and language, that they can show. This makes for a very underwhelming film. It was really boring for the most part. The jokes are very childish and cartoony. I really couldn't get into the whole, over the top supernatural sequence, this movie, brings. It felt like a 10 year old, wrote this film. I really didn't like the fact, that Elwood was being team up with a kid named Buster (J. Evan Bonifant). Not once, in the film does Elwood seem like he has any father-like connection with the kid. The movie acts as if the kid wasn't there, for the most part. It was very pointless. Even new members, like Mack (John Goodman) were underwhelming. The movie never does a good job, in making it seem, like Elwood and Mack have somewhat a connection. The chemistry, between them isn't there. It's sad, because I love John Goodman as an actor. John Landis and Dan Aykroyd were reportedly very unhappy with the changes the studio forced onto the film, even coming close to quitting the project. Third off, I can't believe, they made a sequel, 18 years after the 1980's hit, Blues Brothers. John Landis really waited too long to get this sequel, off the ground. Nobody really wanted to see this film, in the late 1990s. Why is this movie, even made!? It's not like, the fan-base were asking for a Blues Brothers sequel. If, they were; clearly the producers should had quickly capitalize on it, in the early 1980s. Maybe, they did, wanted to make a film sequel as quick as possible, but production of the film was halted, due to main actor, John Belushi's odd drug behavior. Maybe, they were waiting for Belushi to go into rehab. Well, that day never came, as John Belushi died in 1982. Since Belushi couldn't reprise his role, I don't understand, why this movie wasn't shelf. Clearly, they can't use a double for Jake. Nobody can double Belushi. The death was actually worked into the film's plot; it didn't really help, but it was at least respectful to John Belushi. The film was originally intended to include Brother Zee Blues (Jim Belushi, brother of John Belushi). But due to an already existing television deal, Jim Belushi was unable to appear and the script was altered to include Cab Blues (Joe Morton). This was a huge mistake as Joe Morton, really didn't give us, much in humor. He's a good actor, but he's no comedian. The movie has a lot of cameos by celebs. Aretha Franklin, B.B King, James Brown, Frank Oz and few others return from the first movie, for a small paycheck and reprise some of their classic hits. One person from the first movie that didn't return was Cab Calloway & John Candy, who died four years prior to the film's release. Still, the movie does give them, some homage. I like that new musicians at the time, like Blues Travelers & Erykah Badu, gives the movie, so needed new flair. It made the film, somewhat entertaining. The music is pretty damn good for the most part, but the movie doesn't mixed, the musical sequences so well, with the rest of the film. Overall This movie is one of most pointless, underwhelming, and just downright bizarre sequels in comedy history. It wasn't good, man. I don't recommended.

Overall This movie is one of most pointless, underwhelming, and just downright bizarre sequels in comedy history. It wasn't good, man. I don't recommended.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"4 May 2015","score":"","review":" Legend is not a film you'd expect from director Ridley Scott, more known for historic and scifi films, yet when you look closer, you start to see the resemblance to his other films. The definite epic scope, the endless struggle between fluttering good and overpowering, almost invincible evil, the use of heavy shadows and colours, the amazing production values.Legend is an important film for the fantasy film genre because of how it looks. It was one of the first films of its genre where real money was spent on set designs and special effects. And it shows. It's a gorgeous film with a unique look that has influenced most films that succeeded it. Even if that unique look means making the whole world glitter worse than all of the Twilight films combined.The costumes are also some of the best we had seen until then and they hold up pretty well even today. Tim Curry's devil costume is especially impressive on all levels. It's iconic, scary, yet expressive design that's sure to leave a lasting impression.Unfortunately, it's not a perfect film. The story itself is not bad, but I get the sense that Scott bit off more than he could chew or simply couldn't properly transfer his idea on to the silver screen.

All of those look extremely realistic and they add to the super creepy atmosphere this film has. The voice they gave the possessed Reagan is perfect. If I had to choose a voice for the devil, it would have been that one. It really gets to you and makes every scene that has it way more frightening. The movie does have issues though. In the very beginning, they have this backstory about this little sculpture of the devil being found and I found it to be both unnecessary and kind of confusing. It isn't really clear if the devil got released because of that statue or what. I couldn't find a correlation between that statue and Regan either. Only other problem I have is the devil being very picky about how he uses his power. I don't understand why he just didn't break the straps and leave. I know they tried to explain it, but it doesn't really make any sense. Damien Karrass asked him that and he responded with that would be a display of too much power or something like that. He says that, yet he'll throw stuff all over the place and throw up on people, and even kill people. How is breaking some straps too much power? I call bs on that explanation.

Not trusting humans with this knowledge in light of the pending world wars, members of an advanced alien race arrive to collect the stones and hide them away for safe keeping. Fast forward three hundred years when an evil presence traveling towards Earth threatens life as we know it and the only hope is to assemble the five elements before a dark planet enters our atmosphere. A down-on-his-luck cabbie, Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis), collides with the perfect woman while she is running from the police. Leeloo (Milla Jovovich), seeks the elemental stones in her quest to save Earth. In the meantime, Zorg, a wealthy arms manufacturer played by Gary Oldman, agrees to steal the sacred stones before Leeloo can use them. With the help of a scatterbrained priest, a young postulate, and a popular DJ, Dallas must find the stones, show Leeloo that there is more to humanity than destruction, and help her save the planet from annihilation.As Leeloo learns about the Earth's history of the previous three hundred years, she discovers many wars, riots, and disasters have occurred. She sees how humans build and create, but always end up destroying through violence, hate, and intolerance. At the crucial moment when it's time to save the world, a broken and beaten Leeloo has lost all hope and faith in what she was designed to protect humanity. Dallas struggles to convince her that there is good in the world and that some things are still worth saving. Dallas finally admits his love for Leeloo and her will to save life is renewed. This action packed, funny, futuristic adventure somehow still finds a way to show the age old story of good triumphing over evil and proves that despite the horrible things that humans do to themselves and the planet, we still deserve to exist. Similar threads of the same theme were present in I, Robot as the artificially intelligent computer VIKI decided that humans must be protected from themselves and the destruction that they create and therefore controlled or destroyed. In both movies people fight for their right to exist and must defend the good, bad, and ugly of the human race.Another message of the film is that even 300 years into the future people probably will still not have learned to care for the Earth. The piles of refuse at the airport are confirmation that we create more trash than we know what to do with and the film implies that we ship it to other planets when it becomes too much for Earth to store. Also, the entire population of Hawaii appears to have relocated to Fhloston Paradise, begging the question of what happened to those Pacific islands. Were they destroyed by volcanoes or did they become uninhabitable due to pollution? Notes on Cinematography and Design There are a lot of close, in-your-face camera angles that make the viewer feel like he's right in the middle of the action. While watching, you will find yourself getting personal with Leeloo while she discovers a whole new world of flying vehicles and rude human interaction, the zany DJ Ruby Rhod and the flight attendants he is sexing up, and Zorg and his minions. The good versus evil and light versus dark theme is conveyed throughout the film through use of color. Leeloo's clothing from the very start is white, light, and bright. The energy she projects in the final battle to defeat the big bad is pure white as well. As usual, the forces of evil prefer dark colors that don't show stains.There are not a lot of surprises in the movie for those looking for mystery and heavy-handed plot twists. However there is an impressive vocal performance by the Diva Plava Laguna, who has developed a cult following above and beyond the film. You could almost believe she alone could take on the forces of evil and win.

There is no other way to explain this than to describe the ending, so again , , , SPOILERS BELOW!The ENTIRE movie centers around the effort to find a new body for the consciousness of Joe Pendleton (played by Warren Beatty), a QB for the LA Rams whose consciousness was mistakenly removed from his body many years too soon by a rookie angel who wrongfully assumed that he was about to be killed in an accident. The head angel, played by the great James Mason, takes over and finds the body of a freshly murdered millionaire to host Joe's consciousness temporarily, until a permanent replacement body is found. Eventually, the millionaire is murdered again, and Joe's consciousness is once again left without a home. However, Joe's backup QB for the Rams, Tom, conveniently dies during the Super Bowl, and head angel invites Joe's consciousness to inhabit Tom's body before anyone realizes that Tom is dead. Joe's consciousness inside Tom's body leads the Rams to a comeback victory, and is the Super Bowl hero.So far, so good.Then, the viewer gets a giant punch to the gut. The head angel informs Joe that he must return to his duties, and that after he leaves, Joe will have no memories of his life as Joe, or of his time in the body of the millionaire that he temporarily inhabited. He will just become Tom. The End.Huh?!?!? We just spent almost two hours watching a journey to find a permanent home for Joe's consciousness. And at the end . . . Joe's consciousness is totally obliterated for no good reason that is explained to anyone! Heck, if Joe had just died in the accident at the start at least his consciousness would now be in heaven. But after two hours of this movie, it is as if Joe never existed. And if the Tom, the backup QB, really dies and his consciousness is in heaven, then how can Tom's consciousness also still be alive in Tom's body, since the consciousness in Tom's body is now just Tom, with no more traces of Joe remaining. What was the point of everything that happened in the movie?Answer Zero. Which, if you are smart, is how much time you will waste watching this abomination.

Eventually, the millionaire is murdered again, and Joe's consciousness is once again left without a home. However, Joe's backup QB for the Rams, Tom, conveniently dies during the Super Bowl, and head angel invites Joe's consciousness to inhabit Tom's body before anyone realizes that Tom is dead. Joe's consciousness inside Tom's body leads the Rams to a comeback victory, and is the Super Bowl hero.So far, so good.Then, the viewer gets a giant punch to the gut. The head angel informs Joe that he must return to his duties, and that after he leaves, Joe will have no memories of his life as Joe, or of his time in the body of the millionaire that he temporarily inhabited. He will just become Tom. The End.Huh?!?!? We just spent almost two hours watching a journey to find a permanent home for Joe's consciousness. And at the end . . . Joe's consciousness is totally obliterated for no good reason that is explained to anyone! Heck, if Joe had just died in the accident at the start at least his consciousness would now be in heaven. But after two hours of this movie, it is as if Joe never existed. And if the Tom, the backup QB, really dies and his consciousness is in heaven, then how can Tom's consciousness also still be alive in Tom's body, since the consciousness in Tom's body is now just Tom, with no more traces of Joe remaining. What was the point of everything that happened in the movie?Answer Zero. Which, if you are smart, is how much time you will waste watching this abomination.

Production began in September 1999 in Toronto, Canado and ended in March 2000.The film was released on July 14, 2000 to positive reviews and critical success and spawned a reemergence of superhero films and it would prove to movie studios that superhero films could succeed.The film introduces us to Wolverine and Rogue into the conflict between Professor Xavier's X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto. Magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a United Nations summit with a machine he has built, to bring about acceptance of mutant kind, but Xavoer realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deaths.Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice of Wolverine and this film would lead him into being in the sequels and two spin-offs and other movies including Van Helsing and Prisoners.

As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, increased strength, speed and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing.After his beloved Uncle Ben is murdered, a murder Peter could have easily prevented, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City and he becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn, subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes the freakish Green Goblin, who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must do battle with the Goblin, all while trying to express his true feelings for Mary Jane.The feel of the comic book look and the film should be praised. Director Sam Raimi and his team really did a great job of bringing the Spider-Man character to life on the big screen was really amazing, and with today's CGI effects, they were about to make him jump and climb up walls.From the skyscrapers of New York to the warehouses to the film's web slinging sequences to the action sequences, this movie makes you feel like you wish you had the same powers as Spider-Man and the film has a great cast, who bring true performances to the characters they are playing.Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man and who does an amazing job in the part and his performance won me over in this film and he would play the part for the next two films. When he is Peter Parker, he takes a serious approach, but once he is Spider-Man, man, he is super cool. The way that had his costume in this film was just wonderful, but the one thing that was missing was his web-shooters, but that was in the reboot.Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn and Green Goblin and he gives us a menacing, hilarious and serious villain who loves being evil and I will say, the costume is a bit stupid, but I like it though. It's not horrible, but it could have been worse, worse than George Clooney's Batman suit in Batman and Robin and that is for sure!The rest of the cast is just amazing.

The music by Danny Elfman is just amazing and fantastic. The theme is really amazing as hell and it is fantastic and so amazing.

It was a really good musical score and I love his BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS musical scores and that was really fantastic.The visuals are amazing and the action sequences that I like the most are the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin and the fight choreography in those scenes were really well done and the dialogue in this movie is really wonderful and this script was written by David Koepp and he wrote a good script and this film is really amazing.Overall, SPIDER-MAN is a really amazing film and it is really fantastic and an amazing, spectacular, incredible, stunning and well done superhero film that does not get enough credit and it really gets a lot of things right and this was really fantastic and it is really amazing to see Spider-Man on the big screen.I could go for hours talking about how much I like this and talk about the action sequences, the dialogue, the effects, music, editing and the acting from the actors, but I know that IMDb has a word limit and I've got to keep this review short.Spider-Man is a really good and amazing comic book film and this will remain as one of my best superhero films of all time and one of my best superhero films on IMDb and it will not change. I'm giving this film a rating of an 8 out of 10.

M. Night Shyamalan and his crew created a world and characters that were easy to believe in as well as engage in. There may have been one or two scenes that were necessary, but the movie never felt like it was dragging on. It also doesn't rely on just scaring the viewer, but draws out all sorts of emotions.The biggest thing about this film is its cleverness. Everyone mentions the twist at the end, but I argue that this film was good without it. The film is complex enough to keep interest. Yes, the twist is what this movie if really known for, but I think that it sometimes over-shadows the story of a young boy who sees dead people. All of the parts of the film work really well together and I never felt there was something that was out of place.The cinematography is not ground breaking, but it creates lots of contrast that definitely adds to the story. I thought the music was a great fit as it was not too overpowering at emotional moments, but was able to create suspense when needed. Haley Joel Osment's acting is fantastic. He looked as professional as the great adult actors. Although Bruce Willis acts this part very well, I may have gone with a different actor because of his reputation as hard edged characters. As I said before, it is as rewarding if not more rewarding to watch it more than once. It has many little ins and outs that make this film more complex than most. Overall, this film is very entertaining to watch and I think has more to say than what is on the surface.

You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made &#x96; something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.'

But calling it my least favourite is like saying this pizza with 19 slices of pepperoni is it not as good as this pizza with 20 slices of pepperoni. It's appropriate that the second part of three act story is the dark entry, so the more light hearted third act can act as a release from the darkness and despair. Imagine if Star Wars went in the direction of The Planet of the Apes franchise? It's a miracle the studio had no input into the film, creating the movie sequel all movie sequels aspire to be. What if it was a rushed out sequel titled Star Wars II? If Jaws started the trend of blockbusters and Star Wars cemented it, then The Empire Strikes Back was the final step in the birth of the blockbusters, by cementing the rules behind the art of the movie sequel.

Yoda really is a perfect creation, like Obiwan, you do wonder if everything he says is full of crap when you break it down, but it doesn't matter. It's just a shame the perception of the character has become bastardized because of the prequels. Plus what is it about stop motion that is just endlessly appealing to look at? The way that is doesn't have the full fluid motion of live action movement but not to the point that is looks choppy.Although the darkest, The Empire Strikes Back is the funniest of the series. C-3PO constantly telling people about the improbability of escaping the situation they're getting themselves into never fails to get a laugh. Plus the movie keeps teasing you that you're going to get to see that iconic jump to light speed shot from the first film, making it all the satisfying when you finally do get to see it.
