When you think that Buddy Holly was five years older than Valens at the time of their deaths, it is intriguing to think what Valens might have accomplished given a similar amount of time - just as it is to think what Holly could have accomplished had he lived. But the fact is that Holly was much more the established star in 1959, and because of that he is the more remembered.The same is true of La Bamba as is true of Valens - the film is not as well remembered as The Buddy Holly Story, which is a shame because it is almost as good. Some of the performances are truly excellent, and, more importantly, the spirit of the music is captured perfectly.The film deals predominantly with Valens' family relationships - he was close to his mother as he was at odds with his brother Bob - and his sharp rise to fame. There are a few flaws Lou Diamond Phillips, in the lead role, looks almost nothing like the real Valens although his performance is suitably intense and lively; and much of Valens' early attempts at performing are ignored (he was turned down by several record companies who felt the 16-year-old Valens looked too old for the teenage market). But the balance the film finds between each sub-plot (his family, Bob's relationship with Valens's sweetheart Rosie, his difficulties with girlfriend Donna's family etc.) is a real winning formula, and the music tops things off well.The music is pretty much spot-on throughout the whole film. Supplied by Los Lobos (whose front man does an excellent Valens impersonation), it shows what can be achieved if the lip-syncing rock biopic is done properly. Similar attempts have failed (notably in 'Great Balls of Fire', the Jerry Lee Lewis biopic), whereas the ground-breaking live performances in The Buddy Holly Story set a new standard for music in this type of film. Also, some of the incidental acts are truly superb - Eddie Cochran, Jackie Wilson and a sensational Marshall Crenshaw as Buddy Holly are real winners and help the film no end.The fact that we still care so much about a 17-year-old Mexican pop act fifty years on is a real indicator of the immense talent Valens had and just what a defining event the plane crash itself was. Two of the most talented musicians ever in any genre (Holly was compared to the great composers more than once) were taken at a young age, and it is hard to imagine a similar event happening today that would have such a far-reaching impact.It is important that films on the two are made as well as this as we need to remember the men for what they were, because unlike rock biopics, no more of them will be made.

Marvel has planned four more movies leading to The Avengers, Spider-Man 4 has been announced and a new Daredevil movie is rumored to be in the works. Christopher Nolan rocked the summer with The Dark Knight. All of these movies are possible because of the legitimacy X-Men brought to the genre.Patrick Stewart's opening statement explains that new mutations are causing the evolutionary process to take a giant leap. Members of the new species, derisively called mutants, possess supernatural powers that cause some regular humans to hate them. Congress, led by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is considering a law that would require every mutant to register with the government as do sex offenders.A mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellen) survived Hitler's holocaust and worries that the Mutant Registration Act will begin a new one. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believes in taking every step needed to avoid violent conflict. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who is also a physician, stand with Xavier. Magneto's followers are Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); who seems to hate Wolverine; Mystique (the lovely Rebecca Romijn) and Toad (Ray Park, who also played Darth Maul). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and runaway teenager Rogue (Anna Paquin) are the newcomers to Xavier's School for the Gifted.Whereas movies such as Spider-Man and Daredevil contain two or fewer characters with supernatural powers, it can be easy for a script to grow excessive with the legion of characters in the X-Men universe. Writer David Hayter, best known as the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video games, demonstrates good self-discipline. He and director Brian Singer limit the mutant count to ten. Although each possesses a unique look, X-Men does not differentiate the characters on that trait alone. Only two wield similar powers, and the script includes a conversation distinguishing the two. The introduction of these powers provides much of the entertainment early. I watched the television show as a child yet was not familiar with some characters' capabilities.Some of the personalities are poorly realized, but Hayter and Singer compensate with small details such as Toad's quirky attitude and Mystique's sultry body language. Some have complained that Cyclops is boring. Judging by what I hear from the comic book enthusiasts, Marsden's character is translated on target. Cyclops' Mr. Morality personality is much like Superman's. Unlike in the two sequels which totally cheated him, Cyclops plays a pivotal role in the story. Magneto is the most effectively developed character. His horrific childhood motivates him. He does not desire power or wish to exterminate all of humanity. He takes drastic action only when he cannot see better options.With the future of comic book movies in serious trouble after Batman and Robin, 20th Century Fox allotted the production team only 75 million dollars. Some of the visual effects look shoddy and occasionally the timing is wrong such as during the incident where Wolverine is hurled backwards. That said, the fights utilize the mutants' abilities inventively and the choreography is above average. The only problem is the use of the hang-time error. The hang-time error occurs when a character flies threw the air, but does not fall closer to the ground. Thankfully, it appears only twice. The two outstanding scenes are Magneto's answer to a police siege and the Wolverine fights during the climax. The X-Men display good teamwork in their missions, especially at the end. Sadly, neither of the sequels comes close to matching it.Acting-wise, Halle Barry drew disapproval from the X-Men nation. She is not great, but not bad either. Apparently I am not familiar enough with the drawn character to know what causes the uproar. McKellen, Stewart, Jackman and Paquin perform the best. Paquin has the most demanding role. Most people seemingly do not realize how tough it is to show the depth of emotion she does in the climax without being corny. Wolverine is an angry and independent person. At times it looks like Jackman is readying himself to bite somebody. Stewart inhabits Professor X as well as he does Captain Picard and no other actor has the combination of appearance and acting specialty to better Ian McKellen's Magneto.Movies based on comic books had a bad name when X-Men was released in 2000. Batman and Superman were the two franchises to come before it. Both eventually jumped the shark and into unfunny wackiness. X-Men had to convince the public that comic book inspired films can still take their subject matter seriously. It did, and I assign the most credit to David Hayter.

They come closer together and help each other out because they only have each other. The main point the director was trying to drive was, the father didn't want the son to turn to a life of crime like his father. By the end of film we learn that the son does not follow his fathers foot steps. The acting was fantastic, Tom Hanks playing the lead role of a gangster seems like it wouldn't be all that great, but when you add in the element of a father son relationship, it works out perfect. This is an old picture setting it was set in the early 1930's. The mood of the film felt dark and foggy most of the time. A unique gangster flick that had action, drama, and family. The film had great cinematography, acting and direction. This film will appeal to all audiences.

We find one of them simply feeding pigeons at his office window. These men squabble at a professional level, but at least to all appearances they are on the same side. Later we find them both walking in what looks like Green Park, comparing the menus at their respective clubs. For them, Britain seems changeless.Seargent Palmer is a devious near-criminal with a healthy contempt for authority. Cool, laconic and irreverently working-class, our quietly- spoken, bespectacled anti-hero is a new kind of spy who mixes action with brains in an understated way. But Palmer is vanguard to the social changes that are coming. His speech is eloquent and he's picked-up on good food and music, fresh grinding his own coffee for breakfast. He wasn't taut these things as a kid.Something's going wrong with British scientists, and the department to which Palmer is seconded must find out what's happening. There's a great deal more than at first meets the eye. Nobody is quite what they seem. You can't trust anyone completely.With very little warning, Palmer finds himself captured by 'the enemy' and in danger of being brainwashed like some of the scientists.As I say; there are wonderful little comic touches throughout the movie. At a branch fronting as a bespoke staffing agency, we see a disaffected job-applicant leaving in a huff 'I might as well have gone to the labour exchange'. On another occasion, Palmer and one of his superiors engage in an disagreement at a small supermarket. Their exchanges are emphasised by a trolley-ramming contest. There is yet more humour in the petty inter-departmental office-politics.By the same token, drama is equally slick. Death is sudden and unexpected. During an exchange, Palmer machine-guns an American Agent to death. Slyly we see proceedings in miniature through the dead agent's discarded spectacles. It's original (for its time) wicked and fun. In response, Palmer's colleague - played by the likable Gordon Jackson - is shot through the head, whilst waiting at traffic-lights in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity. Here's some dialogue; 'The Americans have put a tail on Palmer.' 'Really? How tiresome'. Perfect.The 'spectacle trick' is one of many similar plays on indirect observation. We study characters through car windows, telephone boxes, we peer over the tops of their desks as if from a crouched position. A dead suspect is barely glimpsed between the grating of his cell-door. We look down on another dead agent from the unlikely perspective of the room's light shade. It's as if the viewer has also been seconded into the spying game. There are lots of other novel tricks too. A conversation between two is portrayed by focusing from one to the other instead of changing the camera angle or working a second close-up. It's as much fun to watch what the director and cameraman are doing as the play between the actors themselves. How much more engaging modern movies could be if makers would only take the time to study older classics instead of resorting to foul language, cheap special effects or pyrotechnics. Almost none of which appear in this work.Throughout the movie, incidental music pops-up in various tempos as laconic as the man himself, to emphasise suspense, tedium, or just the melancholy passage of time. Lead is usually played by base guitar, it's a well-tried 1960's style; the spartan cords work well in both a macho, and suspenseful presentation. But there's another instrument too with which I'm unfamiliar.Even the last lines contain an element of dry wit Palmer; 'I could have been killed, or driven mad, or anything.' Reply; 'Well, it's what you're paid for.'This is the movie that propelled Micheal Caine to overnight stardom. And it was well-earned. But the supporting cast also deserve full credit for the Sterling efforts they make. Lighting is excellent, frequently slipping into a noirish style. Editing is also unexpected and keeps you guessing as it lingers upon some seeming trivia, drawing out the moment, then at other times cutting with shock suddenness. It's an inventive, droll, and suspenseful classic from a time when British cinema could still hold its own.

","genre":"Thriller"},{"date":"3 December 2008","score":"","review":" A Damsel in Distress is definitely not one of Fred Astaire's better musicals. But even Astaire's bad films always had some good moments.In Damsel, Astaire is Jerry Halliday, an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour. He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), a beautiful English heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. He tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry. Keggs (Reginald Gardiner) the conniving butler, and Albert (Harry Watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.This musical has numerous problems. First, there is the plot, based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). The story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. When Fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.The butler and the house boy are especially irritating. They are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, Ginger Rogers. Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. She has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride, as Jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and Gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done. At times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in London, not Hollywood. (They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) On the plus side, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. And of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to Astaire and his choreographer, Hermes Pan.But the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. At times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (At one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) The numbers include  I'm Dancing and I Can't Be Bothered Now -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled London street. He does some great cane-twirling with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (In the Broadway musical, Crazy For You, Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.) Put Me To The Test -- Fred, George, and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage. George and Gracie match Fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason. Stiff Upper Lip (The Fun House Number) -- At an amusement park fun house, Fred, George, and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. It's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times. Things Are Looking Up -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. Fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer. A Foggy Day in London Town -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London. At times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself. Nice Work If You Can Get It -- A great song that is misused in the movie. During a social event at the manor house, Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. Each time Fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (Again, Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in Crazy For You.)  Drum Dance Number -- As Fred and Joan are eloping, Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. As usual, it's a great dance number. But there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. As he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote.

Fred (or rather, a stuntman in Fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote. The >>FF button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.

There are too many instances where events could play out really cool, yet they invariably fizzle. Given that this is the third installment of Sinbad by the same creative team, I expected more. The plot seems to wear out halfway through the movie, and important scenes are poorly executed. But can any movie featuring Ray Harryhausen's creatures and sexy Jane Seymour ever be truly bad? Of course not! I'm just frustrated that this movie missed being great, because it easily could have been. The storyline of the movie is acceptable, and some of it is directly lifted from an 1001 Nights story, which is a plus. A prince is cursed into baboon shape by a witch so a challenger for the throne (the witch's son) can take over the kingdom. The shapeshift will become permanent after a while. The sister of the prince hires Sinbad to sail to a foreign land to find a wizard to break the curse. The witch and her son pursue Sinbad to prevent the reversal of the shapeshift. At the end of the movie, the competitors end up at the north pole in the temple of a lost civilization, the last hope to cure the prince.Much of the plot follows standard elements found in the three Harryhausen Sinbad movies such as a race to a lost land and a shapeshifted\/disfigured royal person. But that is okay. What does not work is that there are too many characters just tagging along with little to do. Sinbad is one of the characters left hanging, which is not a good sign for a movie with Sinbad in the title. Once Sinbad states (early in the film) that he cannot remove the curse but he knows someone who can, Sinbad exits center stage and the wizard becomes the driver of the plot. Jane Seymore visually dominates any scene she is in with her sexy princess outfit, but does little else. The witch's son and the wizards daughter must have some dramatic story potential, I'll figure out what it is some day, maybe.Basically, the heart and soul of the movie comes down to a duel between the wizard and the witch, as both ships race for the north pole. The witch (Margaret Whiting) is outrageous and bizarre, and has plenty of stop-motion creature sorcery at her disposal. The wizard (Patrick Troughton) has obscure knowledge and is wonderfully nutty. But this duel is hardly a battle of wits. Their antics actually make the movie kind of funny, not necessarily on purpose, but since they are the main focus for drama the whole tone of movie feels uncertain. The writers do not seem to grasp the central importance of these two characters, and the plot devolves into random encounters and padded scenes. It would have been great to have an ongoing duel of sorcery (and dynamation creatures) throughout the race to the pole, but this opportunity was missed. As always, the dynamation monsters are entertaining, but perhaps not as effectively presented in the dramatic parts of the story as they could have been. The minotaur is totally cool, but almost pointless; the walrus is totally pointless; the skeletons are okay but without any sense of why the witch could summon them (and then only once); the troglodyte looks great but is almost pointless; and the saber-toothed tiger and troglodyte fight (two dynamation creatures fighting at the climax is another staple feature in these Sinbad movies) is an awkward disappointment. The baboon is by far the best creature in the film. Harryhausen always manages to evoke personality from his creations, and the baboon-prince is one of his very best in terms of expression, emotion and presence. However, too much screen time is spent with this creature and the baboon ultimately adds drag to the film.In spite of my frustrations with the film, I've watched it several times and will undoubtedly watch it several more. There is something charming about a Ray Harryhausen movie, even one that misses the mark.

Really though a comedy was the right place to take the never dying Chucky because the situation was all ready pretty comical to begin with. Child's Play could be considered one of the blackest comedies ever made. The humor there was dry and mixed with horror. Bride of Chucky knows what it is and is willing to indulge into self-parody and for that I most give it tremendous credit.Brad Dourif reprises his role as Chucky who is stitched up and brought back to life by his sadomasochist trailer trash love Tiffany. Tiffany wants a traditional marriage and think Chucky is the one for her despite his maniacal tendencies. We are led to think that her attraction to Chucky is largely based on sex and sex alone. The night Charles Lee Ray was gunned down he left a ring on the mantle. Tiffany finds it and thinks it is a proposal of marriage and spends the next ten years searching for the remains of the Good Guy. Chucky tells her the truth that she was ****ing nuts Heartbroken Tiffany traps Chucky in a playpen and plans a grand revenge scheme for him by ridiculing him for being a doll. She gives him a present a bride his own size but Chucky is one step ahead of her and turns her into his bride I don't think anyone genuinely likes Chucky as a character but we love the scenario of a doll being possessed by vulgar sociopath. I was hard on Seed of Chucky because the humor didn't work but I like Bride of Chucky for the Tiffany character. She is a lot of fun and it makes Chucky all the more palatable. Child's Play was a film that worked because it created fear and because Chucky wasn't the central character of the story. Child's Play 2 and 3 were terrible movies because Chucky got the most screen time. Bride of Chucky realizes the scenario all though interesting is ridiculous and because it realizes this it is able to take more risk. Really though maybe Chucky needed a bride to vent all that homicidal rage. The interaction between the two playmates is the highlight of the film because their views of the world and marriage are so deranged and twisted that it makes for fine dark humor. Tiffany walks in with a plate of cookies that you all most think it is a 50's show where the loyal wife is at the husband's needs after a hard day's work. The highlight of the film is when Chucky and Tiffany are making love in doll form, I don't care what you think that scene was risky and hilarious.Don Mancini is not a comedian and he doesn't know what the movie going public will find funny. There are a few moments in Bride of Chucky were you look at the screen and wonder to yourself whether or not a joke was just told. I am forgiving to this however because Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly breath so much energy into their performances.The film is less interesting when our teens take center stage. With the iconic characters we don't care who they terrorize we just care that they get out and cause chaos. Mancini took the Drive-In book of horror clichés to create these side characters which includes an offensive homosexual stereotype written by an openly gay man.Bride of Chucky isn't a good film in the traditional meaning of the world but it is a hell of a good time for the horror fan who wants a good laugh. The little guy should have hung up his knife after this outing but his prophetic declaration applies to all horror villains.Go ahead I'll be back, I all ways come back... but dying is such a B***h!

The Arabian Nights setting is dialed in, Sinbad and his crew look like they actually belong on a shady adventure ship, the ship looks accurate for the period, the evil sorcerer and his powers of darkness are perfectly and sensibly integrated into the movie, the little bits of humor work, and Caroline Monroe is out of control sexy. Oh and the stop motion monsters are in top form, not only do they look good, but they fit in perfectly with the story.The actors are all believable and interesting. Sinbad, played by John Phillip Law is the best Sinbad of the three movies. He plays an active, smart Sinbad who handles danger and moral situations in true heroic fashion. The other characters support the story and add to the depth of the movie.I think the most important element in a Sinbad movie is a credible supernatural threat. This movie features one of the best evil wizards in all of fantasy. Tom Baker plays Koura the magician, and he gives an impressive performance. But sorcery in this picture is not just for show, there is an underlying structure to it that makes sense. Koura pays a price for aid from the powers of darkness - every time he uses sorcery, he ages. This is a brilliant way to show Koura slowly slipping into the clutches of dark powers. The monsters he summons or commands come alive with the magic of Dynamation and every monster makes sense for the setting and story and has a dramatic impact on the story. And the wicked little pet homunculus - I want one! The story moves along briskly. Sinbad and the Sultan race Koura across the seas to a lost island where they hope to solve the riddle of the 3 golden pieces and thereby restore the kingdom. Compare this ship race with Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger - the Golden Voyage has so much more tension, it moves much quicker, the stakes seem higher. The scenes on the lost island are varied and interesting. There is lots for everyone to do, and all if it is important. The final battle between creatures representing good and evil is really cool. The mystical powers of the Fountain of Destiny make sense and provide a fitting and dramatic end to the movie.This is one of my all-time favorite fantasy films.

The stay in the camp is not lengthy and before long all of the prisoners find themselves in the hands of the Germans. They are to be shipped to a German Prisoner of War camp, by train, giving the allied soldiers a chance to overpower the guards and commandeer the train. Once they are free, Col. Ryan planned to take them all to the safety of the Swiss border. However, the Germans sent their own train to over take them and bring them back. Were it not for the use of air power, the prisoners would be long gone. However, there are several major obstacles to overcome, including enough rail tracks to get them there. From start to finish, this is a dramatic story which is enhanced by the stars in the film, including Trevor Howard, who is superb as Major Eric Fincham, Brad Dexter as Sergeant Bostick, Sergio Fantoni as Captain Oriani, Edward Mulhare as Captain Costanzo and Vito Scotti as the Italian Train Engineer. Wolfgang Preiss plays Major Von Klemment.

In David Fincher's mind, that was all he was trying to accomplish. Did he do it? Well . . . I'm not sure I have a definitive opinion either way.On a technical level, The Game certainly succeeds. David Fincher knows how to use a camera, and I'm not sure anyone, including the most negative reviews of this film, could say otherwise. The Game creates a flawlessly dark atmosphere&#151;literally, but not so much figuratively. Instead of jumping on the wagon and trashing the viewer over the head with horror clichés as similar movies do, The Game slowly builds up to its over-the-top moments in an attempt to immense the viewer in reality before going into the unbelievable. If this movie were in the hands of any other director but Fincher, it would have been the single biggest cliché-fest in cinematic history because it wouldn't practice any subtly whatsoever. For example, the clown in the opening of the movie was fully grounded in The Game, but in any other movie would have just looked like a cliché prop. This is a credit I do have to give Fincher . . .But it's also a credit I have to take back by the end of the movie. Simply put, I've seen a lot of unbelievable movies, and I usually vouch for them. Unbelievable movies are rarely as unbelievable as real life, is something you'll always hear me say. Not so with The Game. At all. By the midway point, the level of ridicules things happening brought to me to the point of laughing. Though other reviews have taken the time to carefully label and point out every plot hole, there is one big one that few people are seeing. The people behind the game could not know every single move the main character would make to such a precise degree. Period. When you finally figure this out by the middle of the movie, the entire plot become worthless and very formulated.The other major problem I had with The Game is it's absolutely nothing new or original in the least. Thriller writers have used this exact plot so many times it's second nature to the hardcore thriller fan, such as myself.And when I say rehash I mean it in every way I can. The Game is so slow-paced and tedious, not to mention repetitious, I could honestly see people shouting We get it, come on! at the screen. Oh the irony what is the point of a thriller if it isn't thrilling? Entertainment value&#151;alongside originality&#151;is almost a dead concept among modern directors, isn't it? They're so fixed on making sure their movies have some sort of cliché, pretentious social commentary they forget that watching a movie was once, dare I say it, a fun thing to do.Don't get me wrong. When I say movies lack entertainment value, that doesn't mean I'm not all for movies that scar the viewer and show them something meaningful, but The Game isn't that either. The big moral point at the end is just another cliché in the pit of clichés The Game already was. We got it back with A Christmas Carrol and It's a Wonderful Life&#151;why did we sit through this tedious movie just to hear old news? Excuse the overused pun, but in every aspect The Game loses. It leaves the viewer feeling like they were just cheated in the same way the main character was, but not in the meaningful way. More in a I could have done the laundry in the time it took to watch that pointless movie! kind of way.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 December 2008","score":"9 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" The Game doesn't try to be anything except a standard, well-done thriller with an intelligent moral.
